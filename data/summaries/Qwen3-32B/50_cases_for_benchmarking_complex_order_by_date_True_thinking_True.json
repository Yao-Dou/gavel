    "46567": "On May 5, 2025, G.M.G., a Venezuelan national detained at Rhode Island’s Wyatt Detention Facility, filed a habeas petition and complaint challenging his potential removal under President Donald Trump’s March 14, 2025 Proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). The Proclamation targets noncitizens over 14 alleged to be members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a criminal gang, authorizing summary removal to El Salvador without judicial review. G.M.G., who has pending asylum and withholding claims and was denied bond in immigration court, argues the Proclamation is unlawful for three reasons: (1) TdA is not a “foreign nation or government” or engaged in an “invasion” as required by the AEA; (2) it bypasses procedural safeguards in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Convention Against Torture (CAT); and (3) it denies due process by providing insufficient notice and opportunity to contest designation as an “alien enemy.”  \n\nThe petition highlights prior court actions nationwide, including a temporary restraining order (TRO) issued in *J.G.G. v. Trump* (D.D.C. Mar. 24, 2025) and invalidated by the Supreme Court (Apr. 7, 2025), which emphasized the need for due process. The government’s 12-hour notice policy for removals, revealed in sealed declarations, was criticized as inadequate by multiple judges, including in *J.A.V. v. Trump* (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2025) and *D.B.U. v. Trump* (D. Colo. Apr. 22, 2025). G.M.G. seeks injunctive relief to block his removal and transfer out of Rhode Island, citing risks of torture in El Salvador and persecution in Venezuela if wrongly designated.  \n\nOn May 5, Judge Melissa R. DuBose issued an order requiring 48 hours’ advance notice before moving G.M.G. out of the district. After a hearing on May 7, the court amended this to 72 hours, excluding weekends and holidays. The case remains pending, with the petitioner alleging violations of the AEA’s statutory criteria, the INA’s exclusive removal procedures, and Fifth Amendment due process rights. Related cases, including *G.F.F. v. Trump* (S.D.N.Y. May Apr. 9, 2025) and *D.B.U. v. Trump*, have similarly challenged the Proclamation’s legality. Counsel for G.M.G. include the ACLU and Rhode Island ACLU Foundation, with pro hac vice attorneys from New York and California.",
    "46582": "On April 30, 2025, Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian woman detained at the Prairieland Detention Facility in Texas, filed a habeas corpus petition and complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Kordia, who entered the U.S. legally in 2016 on a tourist visa and later pursued educational and immigration pathways, alleges her detention by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) violates the First and Fifth Amendments and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). She participated in pro-Palestinian protests, including a 2024 demonstration near Columbia University where she was briefly arrested (charges later dismissed), and sent a $1,000 family support payment to Palestine in 2022.  \n\nThe Trump administration, following executive orders targeting “antisemitism” and “hateful ideologies,” initiated immigration enforcement against Kordia and other noncitizens involved in Palestinian advocacy. DHS investigators surveilled her, including reviewing her WhatsApp account and interrogating family members, but found no evidence of criminal activity or terrorism ties. Despite an immigration judge granting her $20,000 bond on April 3, 2025, DHS appealed using an automatic stay, keeping her detained over 1,500 miles from her New Jersey home.  \n\nKordia’s complaint highlights deplorable detention conditions: overcrowding, inadequate medical care, and systemic failures to accommodate her Muslim faith, including no halal meals and lack of prayer mats or appropriate clothing. She alleges these conditions force her to choose between religious observance and survival, causing severe weight loss and health deterioration.  \n\nThe case is connected to similar lawsuits involving Mahmoud Khalil (a lawful permanent resident arrested for advocating Palestinian rights), Ranjani Srinivasan (a student whose visa was revoked after a protest), and others, all challenging the administration’s enforcement policies as viewpoint-discriminatory. Magistrate Judge Rebecca Rutherford recommended Kordia’s immediate release, finding her detention unconstitutional, but the district court recommitted the matter after new objections were filed. A preliminary injunction hearing on June 5, 2025, allowed Kordia to attend remotely; the court also lifted sealing restrictions on filings.  \n\nKordia seeks release from custody, declaratory relief, and injunctive orders to prevent future religious discrimination. The case remains pending, with the government contesting her claims.  \n\n**Legal Foundation:**  \n- **Cause of Action:** 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas corpus), RFRA (42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1).  \n- **Constitutional Basis:** First Amendment (free speech/association), Fifth Amendment (procedural and substantive due process).  \n- **Remedy Sought:** Immediate release, declaratory judgment, and injunctions.  \n\n**Judge Information:**  \n- **Judge:** Magistrate Judge Rebecca Rutherford (Northern District of Texas).  \n\n**Related Cases:**  \n- Consolidated with lawsuits involving Mahmoud Khalil, Ranjani Srinivasan, Dr. Badar Khan Suri, Momodou Taal, and Rümeysa Öztürk, all challenging similar enforcement actions.  \n\n**Proceedings:**  \n- **Important Filings:** Motion for preliminary injunction (May 5, 2025), motions to intervene (May 30, 2025), and motions to modify briefing schedules (August 2025).  \n- **Court Rulings:** Granted remote access for the June 5 injunction hearing, allowed public access to sealed documents, and recommitted the case after new objections.  \n- **Magistrate’s Recommendation:** Advised granting the preliminary injunction and ordering Kordia’s release (June 27, 2025).  \n\n**Context:**  \n- **Factual Basis:** Kordia’s lawful U.S. presence, peaceful protest participation, and family support payment are central to her claims. The government’s policy of targeting Palestinian advocacy, as outlined in executive orders and implemented by ICE, forms the backdrop of her detention.",
    "46496": "On April 24, 2025, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, Southern Border Communities Coalition, and Urban Justice Center filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Secretary Kristi Noem. The plaintiffs allege that DHS unlawfully shut down three oversight offices in March 2025—the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman Office (CIS Ombudsman), and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO)—violating statutes, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the constitutional separation of powers. These offices, established by Congress, were tasked with investigating civil rights abuses, overseeing immigration detention conditions, and resolving immigration-related disputes, among other functions.  \n\nThe plaintiffs, nonprofit organizations advocating for immigrants’ rights, claim the closures prevent them from filing complaints, seeking redress for abuses, and influencing policy. For example, CRCL had investigated allegations of sexual abuse and medical neglect in detention facilities, while OIDO conducted unannounced inspections of detention centers. The complaint asserts that DHS’s actions exceed its statutory authority, are arbitrary and capricious under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and (C), and usurp Congress’s legislative role by unilaterally eliminating offices created by statute.  \n\nOn May 8, 2025, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to halt the shutdown, which was denied in a TRO on May 23. However, the court scheduled an evidentiary hearing and directed DHS to provide updates on staffing. Subsequent status reports revealed tensions: DHS stated it was creating new positions for the offices, but plaintiffs challenged the adequacy of these efforts, noting that only a handful of staff had been reinstated and that the FY2026 budget sought to eliminate OIDO entirely. On July 11, 2025, the court denied the preliminary injunction and set a schedule for summary judgment motions, with discovery deadlines through late 2025.  \n\nJudge Ana C. Reyes presided over the case, emphasizing concerns about DHS’s conflicting public statements and internal plans. The plaintiffs seek a declaration that the closures are unlawful, an order to reinstate the offices, and injunctive relief to preserve their statutory functions. The case remains pending, with cross-motions for summary judgment due by November 2025.",
    "46432": "On April 18, 2025, petitioner Mohammed H., a 20-year-old Bangladeshi national lawfully studying in Minnesota on an F-1 visa, filed a habeas corpus petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, challenging his immigration detention. He alleged that federal officials, including the President and Homeland Security Secretary, targeted him for arrest and detention in retaliation for his protected speech on Palestinian human rights, violating the First Amendment, and that his continued custody lacked due process under the Fifth Amendment. He also claimed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unlawfully terminated his SEVIS student status in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  \n\nThe court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 22, 2025, preventing his transfer out of the district to preserve jurisdiction. After expedited proceedings, the court ordered his release on bail pending adjudication on May 5, 2025, citing serious constitutional concerns. The TRO was extended three times, until June 17, 2025, to ensure ongoing review. On June 17, the court ruled in favor of the petitioner, finding his detention violated the First Amendment (retaliatory enforcement), the Fifth Amendment (arbitrary use of automatic stay without individualized justification), and the APA (unlawful SEVIS termination). The court mandated his release under a $7,500 bond previously set by an immigration judge, which had been overridden by DHS’s automatic stay.  \n\nThe government appealed the decision to the Eighth Circuit on July 29, 2025 (Case No. 25-2516). The case centered on whether immigration enforcement could be used to suppress speech, with the court emphasizing that constitutional safeguards apply even to noncitizens. The petitioner’s arrest followed public pro-Palestinian posts and occurred after DHS initiated a visa revocation and SEVIS termination without adequate procedural justification, shifting legal bases for removal over time. The court concluded the government failed to establish a lawful basis for detention and that the enforcement actions were pretextual and retaliatory.",
    "46477": "On April 14, 2025, ten international students (F-1 and M-1 visa holders) from universities in Michigan and other states filed a lawsuit against U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials, including Secretary Kristi Noem, alleging that unilateral termination of their SEVIS records violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Plaintiffs claimed the terminations were arbitrary, lacked statutory or regulatory basis, and disrupted their academic and employment opportunities without proper notice or justification. By May 2025, the case expanded to 31 plaintiffs after a first amended complaint and joinder.  \n\nOn April 23, 2025, Judge Jane M. Beckering granted a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), requiring DHS to restore the plaintiffs’ SEVIS records retroactively, prohibit future terminations absent valid grounds, and halt deportation proceedings tied to the contested terminations. The court found the plaintiffs had a strong likelihood of success under the APA, as DHS failed to demonstrate compliance with regulations governing F-1/M-1 status termination. Irreparable harm was established due to immediate loss of work authorization, academic disruption, and deportation risks.  \n\nFollowing a May 6, 2025 evidentiary hearing, the court issued a preliminary injunction on May 7, 2025, maintaining the TRO’s terms and rejecting DHS’s argument that voluntary compliance mooted the case. The court emphasized that DHS’s new policy permitting SEVIS terminations for “failure to comply with nonimmigrant status” was ad hoc and reversible, leaving plaintiffs vulnerable to recurrence. Defendants were ordered to confirm retroactive notations on SEVIS records and ensure visibility to university officials.  \n\nPlaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought injunctive and declaratory relief, while defendants (represented by government attorneys) appealed the preliminary injunction on July 7, 2025. As of August 2025, the appeal transcript was pending, and the case remains active with motions to dismiss the amended complaint yet to be resolved. The factual basis centered on plaintiffs’ minor criminal encounters (e.g., dismissed charges, traffic violations) that did not trigger SEVIS termination under applicable regulations.",
    "46239": "On March 17, 2025, Erie County, New York, filed a lawsuit against the Corporation for National and Community Service (AmeriCorps) and its interim director, Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the U.S. Constitution’s Spending Clause. Erie County had applied for a three-year RSVP grant (totaling $250,000) to support senior volunteer programs, including Meals on Wheels, and was approved in January 2024. The grant required compliance with AmeriCorps regulations, including establishing a diverse advisory council reflecting the service area’s demographics (45 C.F.R. § 2553.24(a)(5)).  \n\nIn January 2025, President Trump signed Executive Orders 14151 and 14173, which directed federal agencies to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and condition grants on anti-DEI certifications. AmeriCorps then demanded that Erie County certify its grant did not promote DEI activities, creating a conflict: Erie County could not truthfully comply without violating its own grant terms. The county sought injunctive relief, arguing the executive orders’ implementation was arbitrary and capricious under the APA and imposed vague, unconstitutional conditions on federal funding.  \n\nAmeriCorps opposed the injunction, asserting the court lacked jurisdiction over grant decisions (due to sovereign immunity and ripeness concerns) and that the county had alternatives, such as amending its grant. On April 14, 2025, Erie County voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice after AmeriCorps revised its certification requirements. The case was assigned to Judge James E. Boasberg and involved related litigation in the District of Maryland, where a preliminary injunction against the executive orders was later stayed by the Fourth Circuit.  \n\nThe lawsuit highlighted tensions between federal grant regulations and executive actions targeting DEI, though it concluded before the court could rule on the merits.",
    "46230": "On March 14, 2025, twelve nonpartisan career civil servants (Jane Doe 1-6 and John Doe 7-12) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Douglas A. Collins, Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs challenged the termination of their employment and the closure of the VA’s Office of Equity Assurance (OEA), which they alleged violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the First and Fifth Amendments. The OEA, established in 2023, aimed to address disparities in veterans’ access to benefits, including for rural Veterans and those in geographically disadvantaged areas.  \n\nFollowing President Trump’s January 20, 2025, Executive Order 14151 targeting DEI initiatives, the VA placed OEA employees on administrative leave on January 22, 2025, and later terminated them via a contested reduction-in-force (RIF) process. The plaintiffs argued the VA’s actions were arbitrary, lacked due process, and stigmatized them as “DEIA employees,” violating their rights to free speech, association, and equal protection. They sought injunctive relief to block their termination and public recantation of the DEIA designation.  \n\nOn April 18, 2025, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, with Judge Rudolph Contreras ruling after a May 2, 2025, hearing. The court found the plaintiffs’ claims not immediately actionable and deferred to administrative processes. The case was later voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on July 17, 2025. The plaintiffs did not pursue further relief, and no court-enforced settlement or monitoring was ordered. The case remains notable for its challenge to the legality of broad executive actions targeting DEIA programs in federal agencies.",
    "46242": "On March 5, 2025, BlueRibbon Coalition, Inc., Sage Riders Motorcycle Club, and Paul Wells filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, challenging the BLM’s December 31, 2024, San Rafael Swell Travel Management Plan (TMP) and its associated Environmental Assessment (EA). The plaintiffs allege the TMP unlawfully closes 665 miles of motorized routes in the San Rafael Swell, a 1.3-million-acre area in Emery County, Utah, violating the Dingell Act’s prohibition on buffer zones around wilderness areas, the APA’s requirements for reasoned decision-making, and NEPA’s mandate for thorough environmental analysis. They argue the BLM failed to address public comments, relied on invalid Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations, and arbitrarily expanded wilderness protections beyond Congressionally designated boundaries.  \n\nThe BLM defended the TMP as balancing recreation and resource protection, citing concerns about user conflicts and environmental harm. On March 6, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to halt implementation, claiming irreparable harm if routes are obliterated. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA), a conservation group, intervened as a defendant on April 21, 2025, asserting its interest in preserving the area’s ecological and cultural resources. The court granted SUWA’s intervention, recognizing its protectable environmental interests and potential divergence from the government’s position.  \n\nThe case remains in the administrative appeal phase, with the parties following a court-ordered schedule for briefing. Judge David Nuffer presides. If the plaintiffs succeed, the court may vacate the TMP, requiring BLM to revise its plan. The dispute centers on federal land management authority, the scope of wilderness protections, and compliance with environmental laws.",
    "46039": "On February 4, 2025, the Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association (FBIAA) and individual FBI personnel (the “Doe Plaintiffs”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice and the United States. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants’ post-January 6, 2021, actions—including compiling lists of FBI employees involved in related investigations and prosecutions, and threatening disclosures of their identities—constitute unlawful retaliation and violate the Privacy Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the First and Fifth Amendments. The plaintiffs, comprising current FBI agents and support staff, seek injunctive relief to block further collection or dissemination of their personal information, mandamus to compel compliance with legal duties, and declaratory judgment.  \n\nThe case arises from FBI investigations into the January 6 Capitol attack, which resulted in over 1,500 prosecutions. Following his 2025 inauguration, President Trump issued pardons and commutations for individuals convicted in these cases, while his administration initiated a review of FBI personnel involved. The Department of Justice directed the FBI to compile lists of employees tied to January 6 investigations and other matters, prompting fears of public disclosure, termination, and retaliation. Plaintiffs cite threats by pardoned individuals, such as Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who vowed vengeance against FBI agents, and allege that the defendants’ actions jeopardize their safety, reputations, and employment.  \n\nThe defendants countered that the information sharing complies with the Privacy Act’s intra-agency disclosure provisions and that the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge speculative harms. On February 7, 2025, the court consolidated this case with a related lawsuit (25cv325) and issued a temporary administrative stay, prohibiting the government from disclosing the compiled lists publicly until a preliminary injunction hearing scheduled for March 27, 2025. The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed some named parties (John Doe 4) on February 23, 2025. The case remains pending, with the plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions due by February 24, 2025.  \n\nThe lead judge is Judge Jia M. Cobb. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel, including Mark S. Zaid and Norman L. Eisen, while the government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeremy S. Simon and Dimitar Georgiev-Remmel. The court’s February 7 order emphasizes that the stay preserves the status quo pending full review, with no final ruling yet on the merits.",
    "46681": "On February 3, 2025, Gary L. Barnes, a pro se plaintiff from Wisconsin, filed a complaint in the U.S. Court of International Trade challenging President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. Barnes alleged that the President exceeded his constitutional authority by unilaterally imposing tariffs, which the Constitution reserves exclusively to Congress under Article I, Sections 7 and 8. He sought declaratory and injunctive relief to invalidate the tariffs, block their collection, and compel the President to uphold his constitutional duties.  \n\nThe defendant, the United States, moved to dismiss the case on March 21, 2025, arguing Barnes lacked Article III standing. The government contended that Barnes, as a private consumer, had not alleged a particularized or concrete injury traceable to the tariffs. Barnes replied on April 22, asserting that his injury stemmed from the President’s “breach of the Constitutional Contract” and his right to hold representatives accountable. The court granted the motion to dismiss on May 23, ruling Barnes failed to demonstrate a sufficient injury-in-fact, traceability, or redressability. The dismissal was without prejudice, allowing Barnes to amend his complaint.  \n\nOn June 19, Barnes filed an amended complaint, and the government renewed its motion to dismiss on July 21. As of August 11, Barnes had responded, but the court had not yet ruled on the renewed motion. The case is connected to subsequent lawsuits by importers challenging the same executive actions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Barnes’ claims hinge on the argument that Congress improperly delegated tariff authority to the President through statutes like the Tariff Act of 1930, violating the separation of powers. The court emphasized that generalized grievances about constitutional violations do not satisfy standing requirements, a position reinforced by Supreme Court precedent.  \n\nThe factual basis includes Trump’s February 2025 executive orders imposing 10–25% tariffs, justified as addressing drug trafficking and border security under IEEPA. Barnes, a retiree, alleged the tariffs would raise consumer prices, harming his household income and undermining constitutional governance. The government countered that importers, not individual consumers, have standing to challenge tariffs, as they are directly burdened by the duties.  \n\nNo settlements, decrees, or court-appointed monitors were part of the case as of the latest filings. The procedural timeline reflects ongoing litigation over the scope of executive power to impose tariffs, with Barnes’ pro se status noted in court proceedings.",
    "46758": "In June 2025, plaintiffs—including U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and immigrant advocacy organizations—filed a habeas corpus petition and class action in the Central District of California, alleging that federal immigration officials violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments through suspicionless detentions and denial of counsel during “Operation At Large” in Los Angeles. The operation involved “contact teams” detaining individuals in public spaces and businesses like carwashes, often without warrants or reasonable suspicion based on race, ethnicity, language, location, or occupation.  \n\nOn July 11, 2025, the district court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO), enjoining defendants from conducting detentions without reasonable suspicion and prohibiting reliance solely on factors like race or location. The court found plaintiffs likely to succeed on their claim that the detentions were unconstitutional. Defendants appealed and sought a stay, which the Ninth Circuit denied on July 16, 2025, for procedural non-compliance.  \n\nOn July 30, 2025, the district court ordered the release of petitioner Carlos Osorto on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, citing his serious health issues and inconsistent agency conduct. The Ninth Circuit later issued an August 1, 2025, order denying the stay of the TRO except for the vague “except as permitted by law” clause.  \n\nThe case remains pending, with a preliminary injunction hearing scheduled for September 2025. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin policies enabling unconstitutional detentions, while defendants argue the TRO improperly restricts immigration enforcement discretion. The court emphasized that the TRO’s geographic scope was necessary to prevent harm to plaintiffs and others in the district.",
    "46378": "On April 10, 2025, four international students—Chinmay Deore (India), Yogesh Joshi (Nepal), Xiangyun Bu (China), and Qiuyi Yang (China)—filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleging that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) violated their Fifth Amendment due process rights and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by unilaterally terminating their F-1 student status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The plaintiffs, enrolled at the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, claimed they were law-abiding students with no criminal convictions (beyond minor traffic violations) and no prior notice of the April 2025 terminations, which were communicated to them by their schools. The termination reason cited in SEVIS was “otherwise failing to maintain status—individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked,” though the government later clarified that only two plaintiffs had their visas prudentially revoked by the State Department.  \n\nDHS defended the terminations, asserting they were based on criminal record matches or visa revocations and that SEVIS record termination does not automatically equate to loss of F-1 status. The agency argued the plaintiffs’ requested injunction was premature, as their nonimmigrant status had not been conclusively revoked and removal proceedings had not been initiated. On April 17, 2025, Judge Stephen J. Murphy III denied the temporary restraining order, finding insufficient evidence that the SEVIS terminations constituted final agency action or that the plaintiffs faced irreparable harm. The court noted ambiguities about whether SEVIS termination independently affects immigration status and deferred further analysis to a preliminary injunction hearing scheduled for May 19, 2025.  \n\nThe case is connected to similar lawsuits nationwide, including *Liu v. Noem* (D.N.H. 2025), where a court granted a TRO under similar theories. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to restore their SEVIS records, block arrests or deportations, and halt the alleged unlawful policy of mass terminations. Defendants emphasized compliance with statutory authority and the availability of administrative remedies, such as reinstatement applications. The court’s order highlighted unresolved legal questions about the relationship between SEVIS records and immigration status, as well as the adequacy of procedural protections under the APA and Constitution.  \n\nCounsel for plaintiffs included the ACLU of Michigan and cooperating private attorneys, while the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan represented the defendants. The docket reflects expedited proceedings, including a motion for discovery and a stipulated dismissal filed on May 29, 2025, though the dismissal’s terms are not detailed in the provided documents. The case centers on whether DHS’s actions violated due process or the APA, with the court requiring further factual and legal development before ruling on preliminary injunctive relief.",
    "46385": "On April 9, 2025, Sheila Bedi and Lynn Cohn, clinical law professors at Northwestern University’s Pritzker School of Law, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Judge Elaine E. Bucklo) against the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce, its Chair Tim Walberg, Subcommittee Chair Burgess Owens, and Northwestern University officials. The professors, representing clients and teaching in clinics focused on civil rights, criminal justice reform, and mediation, alleged that the Committee’s demands for sensitive documents—such as clinic policies, budgets, donor lists, and Bedi’s personnel records—violated their First Amendment rights to free speech, association, and academic freedom, as well as Fifth Amendment due process and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel. They argued the demands were pretextual, motivated by retaliation against their “left-wing” advocacy rather than a legitimate investigation into antisemitism, and warned of irreparable harm to their professional reputations, donor relationships, and ability to represent clients.  \n\nThe Committee had sent a March 27, 2025, letter accusing Northwestern of supporting “left-wing political activism” and linking Bedi’s clinic to a pro-Palestinian protest lawsuit. This followed prior investigations and executive orders by the Trump administration targeting universities and law firms (e.g., Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block) for similar “ideological” reasons. Plaintiffs sought an emergency temporary restraining order (TRO) to block compliance with the Committee’s April 10 deadline, but the motion was denied as moot after the deadline passed without compliance. On June 24, 2025, the court granted a joint motion to stay proceedings until September 2025.  \n\nThe case is part of a broader pattern of government actions, including frozen federal funds and executive orders, aimed at punishing institutions and individuals for disfavored political views. Plaintiffs’ counsel included multiple firms and the Center for Constitutional Rights, while defendants were represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and private attorneys. No trial or appeals have occurred, and the case remains stayed.",
    "46353": "On April 7, 2025, John Doe, an international student in lawful F-1 status with post-graduate STEM Optional Practical Training (OPT) authorization, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Donald J. Trump, Secretary Kristi Noem, and other officials in their official capacities. Represented by private counsel Van Der Hout LLP, Doe alleged that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated his SEVIS record on March 28, 2025, citing failure to maintain status under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i), despite his compliance with F-1 requirements. The termination followed a criminal records check that noted a minor misdemeanor conviction (not a crime of violence) already disclosed to DHS, which had previously approved Doe’s immigration benefits. Doe claimed the action violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being arbitrary and capricious and infringed on his Fifth Amendment procedural due process rights by denying notice and a chance to respond.  \n\nDoe sought declaratory and injunctive relief to block enforcement actions (arrest, detention, deportation) tied to the SEVIS termination and to reinstate his status. On April 16, he filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which Judge Jeffrey S. White granted on April 17, enjoining defendants from arresting or transferring him pending litigation. The TRO was extended through May 15, 2025, after hearings revealed DHS had begun temporarily reactivating SEVIS records for some plaintiffs but lacked a formal policy.  \n\nThe case was consolidated with five others (e.g., S.Y. v. Trump, Zhuoer Chen v. Noem) involving similar SEVIS terminations, many targeting students from Muslim-majority countries. Defendants argued SEVIS termination was a “flag” for further administrative review and not a final agency action, while plaintiffs countered that it had immediate legal consequences, including loss of employment authorization and risk of removal. On May 22, 2025, Judge White issued a preliminary injunction, maintaining the TRO’s terms and requiring DHS to keep SEVIS records active until a new policy was implemented.  \n\nOn July 21, 2025, defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and filed a motion to stay the injunction pending appeal. The motion was partially granted on August 22, 2025, but the injunction remains in effect while the appeal proceeds. The case highlights tensions over DHS’s authority to terminate SEVIS records, the distinction between visa revocation and status termination, and claims of discriminatory enforcement against students based on race and religion.",
    "46337": "On April 3, 2025, multiple states (California, Nevada, Massachusetts, and 17 others) filed a lawsuit challenging Executive Order No. 14248, issued by President Donald J. Trump on March 25, 2025. The Order mandated the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and the Secretary of Defense to require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship for federal voter registration forms, including the Federal Post Card Application for military and overseas voters. It also directed the Attorney General to enforce a strict Election Day ballot receipt deadline, prohibiting states from counting mail-in ballots received after that date. The states argued these provisions violated the Constitution’s Elections Clause (Article I, Section 4) and Electors Clause (Article II, Section 1), usurping state and congressional authority over election administration and circumventing statutory processes under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), and Help America Vote Act (HAVA). They sought a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the Order’s contested sections and a declaration that they were unconstitutional.  \n\nOn June 13, 2025, Judge Denise J. Casper of the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts granted the preliminary injunction. The court found the states likely to succeed on the merits, ruling that the President lacked authority to unilaterally amend federal voter registration forms or dictate ballot deadlines, which must be governed by state law unless preempted by Congress. The injunction barred the EAC and Secretary of Defense from implementing the citizenship documentation requirements and prohibited the Attorney General from enforcing civil or criminal penalties against 13 states permitting post-Election Day ballot receipt or cure procedures. It also invalidated the EAC’s funding conditions tied to these rules. The Order was consolidated with cases in the D.C. District Court (25-cv-0946-CKK), where private plaintiffs had earlier sought similar relief.  \n\nOn July 18, 2025, the court modified the injunction to clarify its scope but maintained the core restrictions. Defendants appealed the ruling to the First Circuit on July 31, 2025 (Case No. 25-1726). The states emphasized that the Order’s mandates would impose costly administrative burdens, disenfranchise voters lacking citizenship documents, and undermine state sovereignty. The court concluded that the Order’s requirements conflicted with Congress’s express delegation of authority to the EAC and state legislatures, violating separation of powers principles.",
    "46238": "On March 17, 2025, Master Sergeant Logan Ireland and Staff Sergeant Nicholas Bear Bade, both transgender men in the U.S. Air Force, filed a lawsuit in the District of New Jersey challenging Executive Orders 14183 and 14168 issued by President Trump. These orders reversed the 2016 policy permitting transgender individuals to serve openly and instead banned transgender service members, requiring them to adhere to regulations based on their birth sex. The plaintiffs argued the policy violated the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause by discriminating on the basis of transgender status and sex. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent their involuntary separation and enforce their right to serve as their affirmed gender.  \n\nDefendants included the Secretary of Defense Peter B. Hegseth, Acting Secretary of the Air Force Gary Ashworth, the U.S. Department of the Air Force, and the United States. The case was assigned to Judge Christine P. O’Hearn. On March 18, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to halt administrative separation proceedings, citing imminent threats to their careers and reputations. The court issued an Order to Show Cause, requiring defendants to respond by March 20. Defendants opposed the TRO, asserting the policy was based on military readiness and medical standards, not animus, and survived rational basis review. On March 24, the court granted the TRO, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits and face irreparable harm if separated. The TRO remained in effect for 14 days.  \n\nDefendants later sought a stay of the TRO to coordinate with parallel litigation (Talbott v. Trump, D.D.C.), but the court denied the request on March 26. The case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on May 15, 2025. The plaintiffs’ claims centered on the abrupt reversal of longstanding policy, the lack of evidence supporting the new restrictions, and the harm of requiring transgender service members to suppress their identity. The defendants emphasized military judgment and deference to executive authority in crafting the policy. No settlement or decree was issued.",
    "46234": "On March 15, 2025, Momodou Taal (a dual U.S. lawful student visa holder from the U.S. the U.K. and Gambia), his professor Mũkoma Wa Ngũgĩ (a U.S. citizen), and fellow Cornell student Sriram Parasurama (a U.S. citizen) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel including the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and Project TAHA, challenged Executive Order 14161 (“Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists”) and Executive Order 14188 (“Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism”), alleging violations of the First and Fifth Amendments. They argued the orders unconstitutionally chilled protected speech by linking criticism of U.S. foreign policy, American “culture,” or Israeli actions to terrorism or antisemitism, with threats of deportation for non-citizens and criminal prosecution for citizens.  \n\nThe complaint detailed Taal’s academic career at Cornell, his advocacy for Palestinian rights, and prior disciplinary actions unrelated to immigration law. It cited public statements by President Trump and Department of Justice officials, including a pledge to deport students participating in pro-Palestinian protests and a DOJ task force’s assertion that pro-Hamas demonstrators would face prosecution. On March 9, 2025, DHS arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student, as an enforcement example. Taal’s visa was revoked on March 14, 2025, leading to ICE’s attempt to detain him, which the plaintiffs sought to block via a temporary restraining order (TRO).  \n\nOn March 27, 2025, the court denied the TRO, ruling plaintiffs failed to establish jurisdiction or irreparable harm. The court emphasized that challenges to Taal’s removal must proceed through immigration courts under 8 U.S.C. § 1252, and plaintiffs did not demonstrate standing for claims tied to First Amendment rights to “listen” or “associate” as the visa revocation was already underway. After the denial, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and petition for a writ of habeas corpus but voluntarily dismissed the case on April 1, 2025, without prejudice.  \n\nThe case centered on whether the executive orders’ broad speech restrictions violated constitutional protections and whether the government’s enforcement actions against Taal were retaliatory. The court’s decision highlighted jurisdictional limitations in immigration cases and the plaintiffs’ failure to meet the high threshold for injunctive relief. Related case *Chung v. Trump* (Case No. 1:25-cv-02412) was referenced as another instance of enforcement under the challenged policies.",
    "46216": "On March 12, 2025, Gordon Schiff, M.D., and Celeste Royce, M.D., both Harvard Medical School professors and practicing physicians, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The plaintiffs challenged the removal of their peer-reviewed articles from AHRQ’s Patient Safety Network (PSNet), a government-run forum for medical professionals to share patient safety insights. The removal followed Executive Order 14168, issued by President Trump on January 20, 2025, which mandated federal agencies to eliminate content promoting “gender ideology,” defined as views that gender identity diverges from biological sex.  \n\nOPM’s implementing guidance required agencies to remove “outward facing media” containing terms like “LGBTQ” or “transgender” by January 31, 2025. AHRQ removed two articles: Dr. Schiff’s commentary on suicide risk assessment, which listed LGBTQ individuals as a high-risk group, and Dr. Royce’s analysis of endometriosis, noting the condition can affect transgender and non-gender-conforming people. AHRQ offered to restore the articles only if plaintiffs censored those terms, which they refused, arguing the revisions would mislead about patient safety risks.  \n\nThe plaintiffs claimed the removal violated the First Amendment by imposing viewpoint-based restrictions on private speech in a limited public forum and was arbitrary under the APA. On April 1, 2025, they moved for a preliminary injunction. After a hearing and full briefing, Judge Leo T. Sorokin ruled on May 23, 2025, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their First Amendment claim, as the removal constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. The court ordered the defendants to restore the censored articles and all other private content removed under the same policy.  \n\nOn June 16, 2025, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the case was moot due to PSNet’s inactivity after March 24, 2025, when its technical support contract expired. The court denied this motion, and the injunction remains in effect pending further proceedings. The case centers on balancing government speech policies against the free expression rights of private researchers in agency-maintained forums.  \n\n**Legal Counsel:** Represented by the ACLU Foundation of Massachusetts, the ACLU, and the Media Freedom & Information Access Clinic at Yale Law School.  \n**Related Case:** *Doctors for America v.

    "46207": "On March 7, 2025, Alishea Kingdom, Solo Nichols, and Jas Kapule, three transgender individuals incarcerated in the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), filed a class action complaint challenging Executive Order 14168 issued by President Donald Trump on January 20, 2025. The order banned federal funding for medical procedures or treatments “for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex” and required BOP to revise policies accordingly. BOP implemented the order via two memoranda, discontinuing hormone therapy and accommodations like gender-affirming clothing for plaintiffs and others with gender dysphoria. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual punishment), the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the APA.  \n\nThe plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to halt enforcement of the order and memoranda, restore medical care, and provisional class certification for approximately 1,028 BOP inmates with gender dysphoria. On March 17, 2025, they filed motions for a preliminary injunction and class certification. The defendants, including BOP officials and the President, opposed these motions but later agreed to temporarily restore hormone therapy while litigation proceeded.  \n\nIn a June 3, 2025 memorandum opinion (2025 WL 4501000), Judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled that the plaintiffs’ claims were not moot, denied the defendants’ argument for administrative exhaustion, and held that BOP’s actions were arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The court granted the preliminary injunction and certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2), ordering BOP to reinstate hormone therapy and social accommodations for class members. A renewed injunction motion in August 2025 extended this relief until November 30, 2025. The case remains active, with plaintiffs represented by the ACLU, Transgender Law Center, and private counsel.  \n\nThe court rejected the defendants’ claim that the policy was based on legitimate medical or administrative considerations, emphasizing the lack of reasoned justification for the abrupt reversal of BOP’s prior practice. The order also noted that the plaintiffs’ access to care had been inconsistently restored, with BOP personnel tying resumption of treatment to ongoing litigation. The case is consolidated with *Doe v. McHenry* (25-cv-286) and faces potential challenges from amicus briefs by states supporting the defendants’ policy.",
    "46104": "In February 2025, American Oversight, a nonpartisan nonprofit transparency organization, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), U.S. DOGE Service (USDS), U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization (USDSTO), U.S. Digital Service (renamed USDS), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The case arises under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to compel expedited processing of eight FOIA requests. These requests target communications involving Elon Musk and his staff related to the removal of inspectors general from 17 agencies in January 2025, as well as DOGE’s directives to federal agencies like USAID, Treasury, NIH, and USDA. The plaintiff alleges that DOGE wields independent authority beyond advising the president, including freezing agency funds, accessing sensitive systems, and issuing personnel orders, making it subject to FOIA.  \n\nDOGE was established by President Trump’s January 20, 2025 executive order, which renamed the U.S. Digital Service as USDS and created a temporary organization within it. Trump’s subsequent executive orders mandated agency heads to form DOGE Teams to implement efficiency initiatives. American Oversight claims DOGE staff, including Musk, used non-governmental platforms like Signal and Slack for official communications, raising concerns about record preservation. The plaintiff submitted FOIA requests in January and February 2025 but received no substantive responses, leading to claims of administrative exhaustion and a request for judicial intervention.  \n\nThe court issued a preservation order on April 2, 2025, requiring defendants to preserve records responsive to the FOIA requests. On May 23, 2025, it ordered limited discovery to resolve whether DOGE qualifies as an “agency” under FOIA, given conflicting public statements about Musk’s leadership and DOGE’s operational independence. Discovery motions filed in June 2025 sought to clarify DOGE’s structure, authority, and staffing practices.  \n\nThis case is connected to *Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. U.S. DOGE Service* (2025 WL 752367), where a district court found DOGE likely subject to FOIA. It also references *AFL-CIO v. Department of Labor* (2025 WL 542825), in which Judge Bates criticized DOGE’s inconsistent legal arguments. The court here, led by Judge Beryl A. Howell, has emphasized factual inquiry into DOGE’s agency status, rejecting the defendants’ assertion that the issue is purely legal.  \n\nThe plaintiff seeks a determination that DOGE must comply with FOIA, an order to conduct adequate searches for responsive records, and production of non-exempt documents within 20 days of a court ruling. The case remains active, with discovery proceedings ongoing to address jurisdictional and procedural disputes.",
    "46602": "On May 15, 2025, the Oregon Council for the Humanities (doing business as Oregon Humanities) and the Federation of State Humanities Councils filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, alleging that the Trump administration’s United States DOGE Service and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and constitutional separation of powers by abruptly terminating NEH grants to state humanities councils. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel from Tonkon Torp LLP, sought injunctive and declaratory relief to restore funding and halt the terminations.  \n\nCongress established the NEH in 1965 to fund humanities programs nationwide, including mandatory grants to state councils under 20 U.S.C. § 956(f). By statute, NEH must distribute funds to these councils using specific formulas, and terminations require findings of noncompliance, notice, and opportunity for a hearing. In March–April 2025, after DOGE’s creation via Executive Order 14158, NEH terminated nearly all grants to state councils, including general operating support and special initiatives, without individualized review or adherence to procedural requirements. The terminations were communicated via mass emails sent from a non-governmental account, using boilerplate justifications tied to Executive Orders.  \n\nThe plaintiffs amended their complaint on June 11, 2025, to address NEH’s partial rescission of some terminations but continued to challenge the blanket reduction in funding. On August 6, 2025, Judge Michael H. Simon issued a preliminary injunction and stay under the APA, finding that the mass terminations were arbitrary and capricious, violated statutory procedures (e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7)), and contravened Congress’s appropriation mandates. The court emphasized that the NEH’s actions exceeded its discretion, ignored reliance interests, and failed to follow the Impoundment Control Act’s requirements. The ruling preserved funding for state councils under the 2024 and 2025 appropriations and compelled NEH to comply with statutory grant termination processes.  \n\nThe case centers on the plaintiffs’ claims that the executive branch unlawfully usurped congressional authority by dismantling the NEH’s Federal/State Partnership, causing irreparable harm to humanities programs in rural and underserved communities. The court’s opinion underscores the constitutional principle that the executive cannot unilaterally refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress without following prescribed legal procedures.",
    "46478": "In *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* (Case No. 1:25-cv-01248-RC), plaintiffs Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc.—family-owned U.S. companies that import educational products from China and other countries—sued President Donald J. Trump and federal officials, challenging tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The plaintiffs alleged the tariffs exceed executive authority, violate the Constitution’s allocation of tariff power to Congress under Article I, and cause irreparable harm to their businesses.  \n\nThe case arose from a series of executive orders beginning in February 2025, which imposed escalating tariffs on Chinese goods (from 10% to 145%) and a universal 10% tariff on imports from most countries. Plaintiffs argued IEEPA does not authorize the President to levy tariffs, as the statute lacks explicit tariff language and its emergency powers are limited to non-tariff measures like sanctions. They also contended the tariffs were not “unusual and extraordinary” emergencies as required by IEEPA, but rather longstanding trade deficits and economic policy goals.  \n\nDefendants moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), asserting exclusive jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i). However, District Judge Rudolph Contreras denied the transfer, concluding IEEPA does not “provide for” tariffs, as it never mentions duties or taxes and historically served for sanctions, not revenue-raising measures. The court granted a preliminary injunction on May 29, 2025, halting enforcement of the tariffs against the plaintiffs, finding they were likely to succeed on the merits and would suffer severe financial harm without relief.  \n\nThe government immediately appealed the injunction and sought a stay. On June 3, 2025, the court granted a stay pending appeal, aligning with the CIT’s own stay of a related case. The core dispute centers on whether the President’s emergency tariff authority under IEEPA conflicts with Congress’s exclusive power to regulate tariffs, with the district court’s ruling emphasizing textual and jurisdictional limits on executive action. The case remains pending further appellate review.",
    "46390": "In April 2025, two Venezuelan nationals detained in Colorado filed a class action petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against President Donald J. Trump and federal officials. They challenged the government’s use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to summarily remove noncitizens accused of affiliation with Tren de Aragua (TdA), a Venezuelan criminal gang, without due process. The petitioners argued that the AEA’s invocation was unlawful because TdA is not a “foreign nation or government” as required by the statute and that the gang’s activities do not constitute an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” under the Act. They also contended that the government’s procedures denied individuals notice, an opportunity to contest their designation as alien enemies, and protections under immigration laws like asylum and the Convention Against Torture.  \n\nThe U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado granted an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 22, 2025, barring the government from transferring the named petitioners or the provisionally certified class of detained Venezuelans in Colorado out of the district pending litigation. The court ordered 21 days’ notice before removal under the AEA, with information provided in a language the individual understands and the right to consult an attorney. On May 6, 2025, the court further issued a preliminary injunction, finding the petitioners likely to succeed on the merits. The government had previously removed over 130 individuals to El Salvador under the AEA, where they faced indefinite detention and potential torture.  \n\nThe case was consolidated with similar challenges in the Southern District of New York and Texas. The Supreme Court had earlier ruled in *J.G.G. v. Trump* that AEA removals must comply with due process, including meaningful notice. The government appealed the TRO, but the Tenth Circuit denied a stay on April 29, 2025, citing insufficient likelihood of success on jurisdictional or legal arguments. The district court certified the class of noncitizens in Colorado custody subject to the AEA Proclamation, emphasizing common issues of statutory and constitutional compliance. The government argued it had broad authority under the AEA and expedited removal procedures, but the court rejected these claims, noting the Act’s wartime purpose and the lack of evidence supporting its current invocation.  \n\nThe case remains pending, with the government appealing the preliminary injunction to the Tenth Circuit. The petitioners seek to invalidate the AEA’s use against TdA members and ensure compliance with due process before removal.",
    "46499": "In April 2025, four Chinese international students (Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment by unilaterally terminating their SEVIS records and F-1 student status. The plaintiffs claimed the terminations occurred without notice, individualized review, or legal justification, despite their compliance with visa regulations and lack of criminal convictions. Many had arrests or minor incidents that were dismissed, expunged, or unrelated to criminal activity.  \n\nThe court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) ex parte on April 18, 2025, preserving the plaintiffs’ status pending a hearing. After consolidating related cases and considering declarations from over 30 affected students nationwide, Judge Jeffrey S. White issued a preliminary injunction on May 22, 2025, blocking DHS and ICE from arresting, transferring, or imposing legal penalties on the plaintiffs and “similarly situated individuals nationwide.” The injunction also prohibited further SEVIS terminations absent adherence to statutory and procedural requirements. The court found the mass terminations arbitrary, inconsistent with agency regulations, and a violation of due process and equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment.  \n\nOn July 29, 2025, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, as a defendant, challenging visa revocations under 8 U.S.C. § 1201(i). The amended complaint argued that the State Department’s revocations were unlawful and beyond statutory authority, as they targeted students already present in the U.S. and relied on NCIC database hits without individualized assessments.  \n\nDefendants appealed the preliminary injunction and filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in August 2025, arguing the injunction improperly issued universal relief and overstepped judicial authority under *Trump v. CASA* (2025). The motion highlighted that ICE had already reinstated SEVIS records and that the nationwide scope of the injunction burdened law enforcement and public safety. The court’s May 22 order remains in effect as the appeal proceeds.  \n\nThe case centers on whether DHS and ICE can terminate SEVIS records en masse based on non-convictions or law enforcement database hits, absent individualized process. The plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction, restoration of their legal status, and systemic reforms to prevent future arbitrary actions.",
    "46319": "On March 31, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) filed a lawsuit challenging Executive Order 14,251, issued by President Donald J. Trump on March 27, 2025. The Order excluded 12 federal agencies and subdivisions—represented by NTEU—from the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), which governs collective bargaining for federal employees. NTEU alleged violations of 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) and the First Amendment, arguing the Order exceeded the President’s statutory authority and was motivated by retaliation for NTEU’s legal challenges to the administration. The Union sought injunctive relief and a declaration that the Order was unlawful.  \n\nOn April 25, 2025, U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman granted NTEU’s motion for a preliminary injunction. The court held that the Order’s broad exclusions conflicted with Congress’s intent to broadly protect federal workers’ collective bargaining rights and found “clear evidence” the President’s rationale was pretextual. The White House Fact Sheet and OPM guidance accompanying the Order emphasized removing “procedural impediments” to firing employees and countering “hostile unions,” which the court deemed inconsistent with the statute’s purpose. The government appealed the injunction, and the D.C. Circuit granted a stay on May 16, 2025, pending appeal, finding the Union had not shown irreparable harm.  \n\nThe case proceeded to cross-motions for summary judgment. NTEU contended the Order was ultra vires, citing the President’s overbroad interpretation of “national security work” and his admitted retaliatory motives. The government argued the exclusions were lawful, asserting the agencies’ roles in national security and the President’s discretion under the statute. The D.C. Circuit’s stay remains in effect, and the district court has yet to rule on the merits. Related litigation includes a consolidated appeal in *American Foreign Service Association v. Trump*, No. 25-5157.  \n\nThe court’s opinion (2025 WL 1218044) emphasized that the FSLMRS’s exclusions must align with Congress’s narrow statutory criteria, not serve unrelated policy goals. The government’s motion to stay pending appeal highlighted the need to defer to the President’s national security authority, while NTEU’s reply argued the Order’s implementation would irreparably harm its bargaining power and revenue. The case remains pending on the district court’s docket, with the preliminary injunction stayed and the parties awaiting appellate review.",
    "46285": "On March 24, 2025, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), UndocuBlack Network, and CASA, Inc. filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Case No. 1:25-cv-00872) against U.S. government officials, including Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump, in their official capacities. The plaintiffs, nonprofit organizations representing members lawfully paroled into the U.S. through humanitarian programs (e.g., for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, and Ukrainians), alleged that the administration’s policies expanded expedited removal to strip parolees of due process protections. They sought a declaration that applying expedited removal to parolees was unlawful, an injunction blocking such actions, and vacatur of the policies.  \n\nThe case arose from the Trump administration’s January–March 2025 directives, including the termination of parole programs for CHNV nationals and the use of expedited removal for parolees. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on May 30, 2025, arguing jurisdictional and procedural bars under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 11, 2025, adding claims under the Accardi Doctrine and challenging the APA compliance of the policies.  \n\nOn August 1, 2025, Judge Jia M. Cobb ruled that the plaintiffs were substantially likely to succeed on the merits. The court held that the challenged policies exceeded the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) statutory authority under the INA, as parolees inspected and released at ports of entry were no longer “arriving aliens” eligible for expedited removal. The policies were also deemed arbitrary and capricious due to inconsistent legal justifications and insufficient analysis of humanitarian impacts. The court granted a stay, halting enforcement of the policies against all noncitizens paroled at ports of entry pending litigation.  \n\nThe factual basis highlighted members facing sudden detention and deportation after participating in government-established parole programs, including those with pending asylum claims or family ties. The court emphasized that the plaintiffs’ members had relied on lawful processes and that the policies created irreparable harm through abrupt family separations and limited access to legal remedies. Related cases included *Make the Road New York v. Huffman* (D.D.C. 2025) and *Svitlana Doe v. Trump* (D. Mass. 2025), which addressed similar issues. The stay remains in effect as of the ruling date, with no specified expiration.",
    "46179": "In February 2025, Travis LeBlanc and Edward Felten, Senate-confirmed members of the PCLOB, filed a lawsuit challenging their removal by President Donald Trump on January 27, 2025, without stated cause. The PCLOB, an independent agency established under 42 U.S.C. § 2000ee, was created to ensure privacy and civil liberties are balanced with counterterrorism efforts. Plaintiffs argued that the 2007 amendments to the PCLOB’s organic statute (Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act) barred removal without cause, citing mandatory language for six-year terms, bipartisan selection requirements, and the Board’s quasi-legislative oversight role. Defendants countered that the statute lacked explicit removal restrictions and that the President’s authority to remove principal officers is presumptively at will.  \n\nAfter cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court (Judge Reggie B. Walton) ruled on May 21, 2025, that the removals violated the PCLOB’s statutory structure and function, which Congress designed to insulate the Board from presidential control. The court declared the terminations null and void, enjoining defendants from interfering with the plaintiffs’ duties and ordering reinstatement. The court emphasized the PCLOB’s role as a nonpartisan, expert-driven body akin to the Federal Trade Commission in *Humphrey’s Executor v. United States* (1935), where removal protections were upheld for agencies performing legislative or judicial oversight.  \n\nOn appeal, the D.C. Circuit granted a stay on July 1, 2025, pending resolution of whether the PCLOB’s structure constitutionally restricts the President’s removal power. The Circuit held that the PCLOB’s statute does not explicitly limit removal and that its advisory role to the President and Congress does not qualify for the narrow Humphrey’s Executor exception reserved for adjudicatory bodies requiring independence from executive control. The case remains pending further appellate review.",
    "46106": "On February 11, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the Association of Administrative Law Judges (AALJ), and three individual plaintiffs, including current and former federal employees, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. They alleged that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), along with its leadership including Elon Musk, unlawfully disclosed their sensitive personal information—such as Social Security numbers, health records, and employment histories—to DOGE agents without proper vetting or legal justification. The plaintiffs, represented by private law firms and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt further disclosures and ensure compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706).  \n\nOn February 14, plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which the court converted to a preliminary injunction request. Defendants, represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, argued in a March 14 motion to dismiss that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that the Privacy Act did not provide a remedy for the alleged harms. The court denied the motion to dismiss in part on April 3, finding the plaintiffs plausibly alleged violations of the Privacy Act and APA. On June 9, 2025, the court granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that OPM’s granting of administrative access to DOGE agents without sufficient safeguards or legal basis posed an imminent risk of harm. The injunction barred OPM from disclosing records to DOGE agents, required OPM to submit a report on its compliance measures, and mandated the impoundment and destruction of any improperly obtained data. The decision emphasized that the plaintiffs’ injuries were concrete and analogous to the common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion, rejecting defendants’ claims of adequate alternative remedies.  \n\nThe case was consolidated with related litigation in Maryland (Am. Fed’n of Teachers v. Bessent) and referenced proceedings in Virginia and the District of Columbia. Judge Denise L. Cote presided, and the plaintiffs posted a $1,000 bond on July 8, 2025, to enforce the injunction. The court’s order highlighted the plaintiffs’ concerns about cybersecurity risks, given OPM’s 2015 data breach affecting 22 million people, and the lack of proper security training or background checks for many DOGE agents. The injunction remains in effect pending further proceedings.",
    "46095": "In February 2025, the Association of American Universities (AAU), American Council on Education (ACE), Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU), and multiple universities filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and their acting leadership, challenging a new NIH Guidance capping indirect costs at 15% for all existing and future grants. The plaintiffs argued the policy violated federal statutes, including the Appropriations Clause, and regulations governing grant funding, particularly the 2024 Appropriations Rider (Section 224) prohibiting NIH from altering indirect cost reimbursement policies. The Guidance, issued abruptly on February 7, 2025, bypassed required regulatory procedures and threatened to disrupt research infrastructure, leading to potential layoffs, facility closures, and halts to critical medical studies.  \n\nThe plaintiffs, represented by private law firms, sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to block implementation of the cap. The court granted the TRO on February 10, 2025, and later issued a 76-page preliminary injunction on March 5, 2025, finding the Guidance likely unlawful under the APA for being arbitrary, capricious, and procedurally flawed. The court emphasized the NIH’s failure to follow notice-and-comment rulemaking and disregard of institutional reliance interests in negotiated cost rates. On April 4, 2025, the court converted the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction, concluding the Guidance violated 45 C.F.R. § 75.414, the Appropriations Rider, and APA requirements.  \n\nThe case was consolidated with two related lawsuits (Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. NIH and AAMC v. NIH), which similarly challenged the Guidance’s retroactive application and financial impact. Defendants appealed the final judgment to the First Circuit on April 8, 2025. The plaintiffs, including leading research institutions like Brown University, MIT, and the University of Chicago, alleged the 15% cap would cause irreparable harm by destabilizing budgets and undermining U.S. scientific leadership. The court’s orders prohibited NIH from enforcing the cap pending resolution of the appeal.",
    "46023": "On February 3, 2025, the Alliance for Retired Americans, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Scott Bessent (as Treasury Secretary), the Department of the Treasury, and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). The plaintiffs, three membership organizations representing millions of retirees, federal employees, and healthcare workers, alleged that Defendants unlawfully granted access to sensitive personal and financial data in BFS systems to members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), including Elon Musk, violating the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the disclosure of records and to require retrieval of already shared information.  \n\nOn February 5, Plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which the court deferred to a preliminary injunction (PI) motion after a February 5 hearing. The parties reached a consent order on February 6 limiting BFS access to specific DOGE members (Tom Krause and Marko Elez) with “read-only” permissions. After a February 24 hearing, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly denied the PI on March 7, 2025, ruling Plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm under D.C. Circuit standards. The court, however, ordered Defendants to submit an administrative record by March 10.  \n\nPlaintiffs challenged the adequacy of the administrative record, prompting the court to permit limited expedited discovery on March 20. Related cases in the Southern District of New York and Eastern District of Virginia, which addressed similar DOGE access disputes, were cited as context. The New York case resulted in a preliminary injunction barring DOGE access to federal payment systems.  \n\nOn April 1, a protective order governed the handling of confidential discovery materials. Defendants moved to dismiss on April 11, arguing Plaintiffs lack standing and that the APA does not authorize injunctive relief for Privacy Act or IRC violations. Plaintiffs cross-moved for summary judgment on April 25, asserting Defendants’ actions were contrary to law and arbitrary. The case remains pending, with motions for summary judgment fully briefed and awaiting judicial resolution.  \n\nThe court’s March 7 opinion emphasized that while Plaintiffs’ associational standing was plausible, their requested PI failed due to insufficient evidence of irreparable harm. The April 11 docket entry confirms the parties are now focused on summary judgment, with Defendants contending the challenged actions are not final agency decisions and Plaintiffs arguing for compliance with privacy statutes. Key legal issues include whether DOGE’s access constitutes a final agency action under the APA and whether the Privacy Act and IRC preclude injunctive relief. Related cases underscore the novelty of the claims and the court’s reliance on the administrative record for review.",
    "46563": "On May 2, 2025, multiple Washington and California counties and cities (Plaintiffs) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against federal officials and agencies, including HUD Secretary Scott Turner, DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). The Plaintiffs challenged new conditions imposed on federal grants by the Trump administration, which required recipients to oppose Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, verify immigration status, and prohibit funding for or promotion of elective abortions. These conditions were added to Continuum of Care (CoC) grants for homelessness services and Department of Transportation (DOT) grants for transit, highways, and airports. The Plaintiffs alleged violations of the Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering principle, the Fifth Amendment’s void-for-vagueness doctrine, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing the conditions exceeded statutory authority and usurped congressional power.  \n\nOn May 5, the Plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to block enforcement of the conditions, which the court granted on May 7, 2025. The order found jurisdiction under the APA and Constitution, rejecting Defendants’ Tucker Act argument, and concluded the conditions were likely unlawful. A second TRO motion and preliminary injunction followed on May 21, 2025, after the Trump administration expanded the conditions to additional DOT programs. The court granted the preliminary injunction on June 3, 2025, extending the TRO and enjoining HUD and DOT from imposing or enforcing the disputed conditions. The order emphasized that the conditions were not statutorily authorized, were unconstitutionally vague, and violated separation of powers by allowing the Executive to rewrite federal law through grant agreements.  \n\nThe case involved 29 Plaintiffs, including King County, New York City, Denver, and others, representing over $4 billion in at-risk federal funding. Defendants argued the Tucker Act required claims to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims, but the court held that the APA and constitutional challenges fell outside that jurisdiction. Key rulings included that the conditions were “in excess of statutory jurisdiction” and “contrary to constitutional rights” under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). No settlements or monitoring mechanisms were mentioned in the documents. The litigation remains ongoing, with the preliminary injunction in effect pending further proceedings.  \n\n**Cited Opinions:**  \n- *Order Granting TRO* (2025 WL 1186310, N.D. Cal.

    "46484": "On April 23, 2025, the American Bar Association (ABA) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in their official capacities. The ABA, through its Commission on Domestic and Sexual Violence (CDSV), sought injunctive relief to prevent the DOJ from enforcing the termination of five active grants totaling $3.2 million under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). These grants funded programs providing training and technical assistance to legal professionals working with domestic violence and sexual assault survivors.  \n\nThe ABA alleged that the DOJ terminated the grants in retaliation for its protected First Amendment activities, including public criticism of the Trump Administration’s actions against the judiciary and joining a lawsuit challenging an international development grant freeze. On April 9, 2025, Deputy Attorney General Blanche issued a memorandum barring DOJ employees from participating in ABA events or using government resources to engage with the ABA while it litigated against the federal government. The next day, the DOJ canceled the grants, citing a shift in “agency priorities” without specifying further reasons. The ABA emphasized it had never violated grant terms and that no other grantees faced similar action.  \n\nOn April 24, 2025, the ABA moved for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the terminations. The court scheduled a hearing for May 12, 2025, and granted the preliminary injunction on May 14, 2025, finding the ABA likely to succeed on its First Amendment retaliation claim. The court rejected the DOJ’s jurisdictional argument that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, noting the claim arose from constitutional protections, not contract disputes. The injunction preserved the grants’ funding pending resolution of the merits.  \n\nThe ABA’s complaint included six claims: First Amendment retaliation and viewpoint discrimination, unconstitutional conditions on grants, Fifth Amendment Equal Protection and Due Process violations, and Administrative Procedure Act (APA) breaches. The DOJ moved to dismiss the case, but the court reserved judgment on claims beyond the First Amendment retaliation issue. The case remains active under Judge Christopher R. Cooper, who ruled that the ABA demonstrated irreparable harm and that the public interest favored the injunction.  \n\nThe DOJ’s termination letter referenced 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4), allowing terminations when grants no longer align with agency priorities. The ABA highlighted its long-standing collaborative relationship with the DOJ and the abrupt, unexplained nature of the terminations as evidence of retaliation. The court’s opinion noted the lack of performance issues cited by the DOJ and the absence of similar actions against other grantees.  \n\nThis case involves private counsel for the ABA and touches on constitutional free speech principles in the context of federal grant funding. The preliminary injunction remains in effect as of the last documented court entry.",
    "46279": "On March 23, 2025, noncitizens D.V.D., M.M., E.F.D., and O.C.G. filed a class action in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, alleging the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its officials violated their legal rights by deporting individuals with final removal orders to third countries—countries not designated in their immigration proceedings—without providing notice or an opportunity to contest removal on grounds of persecution, torture, or death. The plaintiffs, represented by private attorneys and the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, argued that this policy breached the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act (FARRA), the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, and U.S. treaty obligations under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). The proposed class included all noncitizens with final removal orders whom DHS had or would deport to third countries after February 18, 2025, under a controversial internal directive.  \n\nThe district court, presided over by Judge Brian E. Murphy, granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on March 28, 2025, and later certified the class on April 18, 2025. The court issued a preliminary injunction requiring DHS to provide written notice of third-country removal in a language the individual understands, along with a meaningful opportunity to seek CAT protection. The injunction also mandated a 15-day window for motions to reopen immigration proceedings if a fear claim was denied.  \n\nDefendants appealed, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) and (b)(9) and that their procedures satisfied due process. The First Circuit denied a stay on May 16, 2025, and the Supreme Court granted a stay on June 23, 2025, pending resolution of the appeal. Despite this, the district court continued proceedings, including expedited discovery on whether O.C.G. received notice before his deportation to Mexico in February 2025. O.C.G., a Guatemalan man granted withholding of removal to Guatemala, was secretly deported to Mexico without warning, where he faced forced detention and potential return to Guatemala. The court found this violated the preliminary injunction and ordered DHS to facilitate his return, though this was later stayed by the Supreme Court.  \n\nPlaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment in July 2025, asserting DHS’s policy is unlawful. Defendants sought to stay the district court proceedings pending appeal, but the court denied the motion, emphasizing the need to address jurisdictional and procedural issues. As of August 1, 2025, the case remains pending, with the Supreme Court’s stay in effect. The plaintiffs continue to challenge the constitutionality of third-country removals, while defendants argue for deference to executive authority and compliance with existing administrative processes.",
    "46186": "In February 2025, plaintiffs—including Ukrainian, Nicaraguan, Afghan, and other nationals paroled into the U.S. under humanitarian programs, U.S. citizen sponsors, and the Haitian Bridge Alliance—filed a class action in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts. They alleged that the Trump administration unlawfully terminated categorical parole programs and suspended immigration benefit adjudications for parolees, violating the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs argued that parole under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5) allows temporary entry for “urgent humanitarian reasons” or “significant public benefit,” which had been historically applied on a programmatic basis by administrations of both parties.  \n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump signed executive orders directing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to terminate categorical parole programs and review parole policies. That day, Acting Secretary Benjamine Huffman issued a memorandum claiming such programs were “blatantly inconsistent with the statute.” In March 2025, DHS published a Federal Register Notice terminating the CHNV programs, which allowed parole for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, and rescinding parole grants issued under these programs by April 24, 2025, without case-by-case review. USCIS also paused adjudicating immigration benefits (e.g., asylum, TPS) for parolees, citing incomplete vetting.  \n\nPlaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to block these actions, arguing irreparable harm from losing legal status and work authorization. The district court granted partial relief, staying the mass termination of CHNV parole and certifying a class of affected parolees and sponsors. On May 30, 2025, the Supreme Court granted a stay of the district court’s order pending appeal, allowing DHS to proceed with terminations. The case remains ongoing, with plaintiffs challenging the legality of the policies as arbitrary and capricious and inconsistent with the INA’s text and historical interpretation.  \n\nThe suit highlights plaintiffs’ reliance on parole programs to avoid dangerous border crossings, reunite families, and seek protection from persecution. Defendants countered that parole terminations were discretionary and lawful under the statute, with the district court’s jurisdiction barred by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B). The conflict underscores tensions between executive authority to manage immigration and judicial oversight of agency actions.",
    "46180": "On February 25, 2025, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), American Sociological Association (ASA), AFT-Maryland, and later Eugene School District 4J (District 4J) filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), Secretary Linda McMahon, and Acting Assistant Secretary Craig Trainor. The plaintiffs alleged that a February 14, 2025, DOE Dear Colleague Letter (the Letter) and a subsequent certification requirement (the Certification) violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), First Amendment (free speech and association), and Fifth Amendment (vagueness).  \n\nThe Letter purported to clarify Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Supreme Court’s 2023 Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) decision, banning practices it deemed \"race-based discrimination.\" It criticized teaching about systemic racism, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, and student groups tied to race or ethnicity, asserting such activities created hostile environments. The plaintiffs argued the Letter reinterpreted Title VI to prohibit lawful educational practices, such as culturally responsive teaching, history curricula addressing racial discrimination, and student affinity groups, while failing to define key terms like \"DEI\" or \"racially hostile environment.\" The Certification, sent to states and school districts on April 3, 2025, required affirmation of compliance with the Letter’s standards as a condition for federal funding.  \n\nOn April 24, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction against the Letter, finding it likely violated the APA by being a final agency rule issued without required notice-and-comment procedures and chilled protected speech. The Certification was not enjoined initially because the Amended Complaint lacked specific claims against it. After the plaintiffs added new counts in their Second Amended Complaint, the court ruled on August 14, 2025, vacating both the Letter and Certification. The court held the Letter and Certification were final legislative rules requiring APA compliance, issued without proper process and in conflict with existing law. The Certification also violated the Paperwork Reduction Act and imposed arbitrary, vague obligations. The ruling concluded that the documents unlawfully restricted curriculum and speech, forcing schools to self-censor or risk losing funding, investigations, or False Claims Act liability.  \n\nThe case ended with a judgment vacating the Letter and Certification, enjoining their enforcement, and rejecting the government’s argument that the actions merely restated existing law. The court emphasized that agencies must follow procedural requirements and not overstep statutory authority, even when implementing policy shifts aligned with a new administration’s priorities.",
    "46119": "In *J. Doe 1-26 v. Elon Musk*, plaintiffs (current and former USAID employees and contractors) filed a complaint on February 13, 2025, alleging that Elon Musk, in his official capacity as a de facto leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), violated the U.S. Constitution’s Appointments Clause and separation of powers. Plaintiffs claimed Musk, who was not Senate-confirmed, exercised authority over USAID by directing the removal of senior staff, granting DOGE personnel unrestricted access to USAID systems (including sensitive personnel files), and implementing mass contract terminations and office closures. The complaint alleged that these actions disrupted humanitarian programs, jeopardized employee livelihoods, and breached privacy laws.  \n\nOn March 18, 2025, Judge Theodore D. Chuang granted a preliminary injunction, enjoining Musk and DOGE from accessing plaintiffs’ sensitive data, terminating employees or contracts, and dismantling USAID without authorization. The injunction also required reinstatement of system access and submission of a plan to restore USAID’s headquarters. Defendants appealed, arguing that Musk was a non-officer with no formal authority, and that USAID’s actions were taken by duly appointed officials. On March 28, the Fourth Circuit stayed the injunction pending appeal, finding plaintiffs had not named the actual decision-makers (e.g., USAID leadership) and that the district court’s order risked enjoining lawful executive functions.  \n\nPlaintiffs amended their complaint on May 30, 2025, adding USAID and other officials as defendants and seeking class certification for all USAID employees and contractors affected during January 20–February 3, 2025. Defendants moved to dismiss on May 1, 2025, asserting jurisdictional bars under the Civil Service Reform Act and Contract Disputes Act, and that plaintiffs lacked standing. The district court had not yet ruled on the motion at the time of the appeal.  \n\nThe case centers on whether Musk’s role in DOGE constitutes an unconstitutional circumvention of the Appointments Clause and whether the executive branch exceeded its authority by dismantling USAID, an agency established by Congress. The Fourth Circuit’s stay remains in effect, preserving the status quo pending resolution of the appeal and district court proceedings.",
    "46099": "On February 10, 2025, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) and Journalism Development Network (JDN), non-profit organizations providing global health and journalism services, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of State, USAID, OMB, and President Donald Trump. They challenged Executive Order 14169, issued by President Trump on January 20, 2025, which mandated a 90-day pause on foreign development assistance to review program efficiency and alignment with U.S. foreign policy. The order was implemented via directives from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, freezing funding for AVAC’s HIV prevention research and JDN’s anti-corruption journalism projects under existing grants and cooperative agreements.  \n\nThe plaintiffs alleged the freeze violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, and the Impoundment Control Act, arguing Congress had appropriated funds without authorizing such a suspension. On February 13, the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the defendants from enforcing the freeze for existing contracts and grants, but permitted individualized terminations based on contract terms. Despite this, plaintiffs later moved to enforce the TRO, asserting continued non-compliance, including delayed payments and blanket terminations. The court ordered defendants to unfreeze funds for work completed before the TRO by February 26, 2025.  \n\nDefendants appealed, seeking a stay, but the D.C. Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction over the TRO. The Supreme Court also denied a stay, directing the district court to clarify compliance timelines. On March 10, the district court issued a preliminary injunction, finding the freeze likely arbitrary and capricious under the APA and violating separation of powers. It required defendants to make all appropriated foreign aid funds available for obligation. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaints, arguing plaintiffs lacked standing and the APA did not authorize judicial review of impoundment claims.  \n\nOn August 13, 2025, the D.C. Circuit upheld the dismissal of plaintiffs’ constitutional and APA claims, ruling they lacked a cause of action to challenge executive impoundment of funds. The court emphasized that the Comptroller General, not private parties, holds authority under the Impoundment Control Act to enforce statutory obligations. The preliminary injunction was vacated, leaving defendants unencumbered to proceed with their restructuring of foreign aid programs.  \n\nThe case centered on the balance of congressional appropriations authority and executive discretion in foreign policy, with plaintiffs seeking to restore funding for humanitarian and democratic initiatives, and defendants asserting their statutory and constitutional authority to realign aid priorities.",
    "46093": "In February 2025, plaintiffs—including individual refugees and nonprofit resettlement agencies—filed a class action lawsuit challenging Executive Order 14163, signed by President Trump on January 20, 2025. The order indefinitely suspended refugee admissions and processing under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) and halted funding to resettlement partners. Plaintiffs argued this violated the Refugee Act of 1980 (8 U.S.C. § 1157 et seq.), the Administrative Procedure Act, and constitutional due process rights, particularly affecting follow-to-join (FTJ) petitioners and newly arrived refugees.  \n\nOn February 25, 2025, Judge Jamal N. Whitehead granted a preliminary injunction, blocking implementation of the order. The court found the suspension of refugee processing and funding was ultra vires, exceeding presidential authority under the INA, and arbitrary under the APA. The Ninth Circuit later partially stayed the injunction on March 25, 2025, excluding refugees conditionally approved before January 20, 2025, but clarified in April 2025 that the stay applied narrowly to cases with “strong reliance interests” comparable to lead plaintiff Pacito, whose family had sold possessions and lost housing after last-minute travel cancellations.  \n\nDefendants moved to dismiss, arguing the APA did not apply to contract-based claims and that § 1182(f) of the INA granted the President unreviewable authority. The court rejected these arguments, emphasizing the statutory mandates for refugee resettlement and the Ninth Circuit’s requirement for case-by-case reliance assessments. In July 2025, the court established a compliance framework, appointing Magistrate Judge Michelle L. Peterson to oversee individualized determinations for refugees with confirmable travel plans canceled pre-EO.  \n\nThe case remains pending, with the preliminary injunction in effect for qualifying refugees. Related proceedings include consolidated cases (e.g., *Doe v. Trump*, 288 F. Supp. 3d 1045 (W.D. Wash. 2017)) and appeals to the Ninth Circuit (No. 25-1313).

    "46065": "On February 7, 2025, the states of Washington, Minnesota, Oregon, and later Colorado, along with three physician plaintiffs, filed a lawsuit challenging Executive Orders 14,168 and 14,187 issued by President Donald J. Trump. The Medical Services EO (14,187) defined certain gender-affirming treatments for minors under 19 as “chemical and surgical mutilation” and directed federal agencies to immediately defund institutions providing such care. The Gender Ideology EO (14,168) mandated that federal grants not fund programs recognizing gender identities inconsistent with biological sex.  \n\nPlaintiffs argued the EOs violated the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, usurped Congressional spending authority under separation of powers principles, and infringed on states’ rights to regulate medicine under the Tenth Amendment. They sought injunctive relief to block enforcement, citing imminent harm to patients and institutions reliant on federal funding. Defendants countered that the EOs were within the President’s authority to direct agencies and that plaintiffs lacked standing due to unripe claims and no final agency action.  \n\nOn February 14, 2025, Judge Lauren King granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining enforcement of the Medical Services EO’s defunding provision. After a February 28 hearing, the court extended the injunction to the Gender Ideology EO’s funding restrictions but denied relief for the criminal enforcement provision (Section 8(a)). Defendants appealed and secured a stay of the preliminary injunction on April 23, 2025, pending resolution in the Ninth Circuit.  \n\nThe case centers on whether the EOs unconstitutionally discriminate against transgender youth, infringe on federalism principles, and overstep executive authority. Plaintiffs highlighted life-saving medical consensus and institutional reliance on federal grants, while defendants emphasized policy discretion and statutory compliance. Key related litigation includes a nationwide TRO issued in a parallel Maryland case. Discovery proceeded on claims of contempt after NIH terminated a grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital, though the court denied plaintiffs’ motion to hold defendants in contempt.

    "46028": "In *PFLAG, Inc. et al. v. Trump et al.* (Case No. 8:25-cv-00337-BAH), plaintiffs including PFLAG, GLMA, and transgender minors and adults, along with their parents, sued the Trump administration over two Executive Orders: EO 14,168 (Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth) and EO 14,187 (Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation). Filed on February 4, 2025, the complaint alleged the Orders violated the Constitution’s separation of powers by unilaterally conditioning federal funding on ending gender-affirming care for individuals under 19, and infringed on rights under the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and statutory anti-discrimination provisions (e.g., ACA Section 1557 and PHSA Section 1908).  \n\nOn February 13, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining federal agencies from implementing the Orders’ funding restrictions. The TRO was extended to March 5, 2025, after the court found irreparable harm to plaintiffs from disrupted medical care, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy. On March 4, 2025, the court issued a preliminary injunction nationwide, barring agencies from conditioning, withholding, or terminating funding based on the provision of gender-affirming care to minors. The injunction was based on the court’s determination that the Orders exceeded presidential authority under Article II and conflicted with congressional statutes.  \n\nDefendants appealed the injunction, and on April 9, 2025, the court granted a limited partial stay of deadlines pending the appeal. Plaintiffs sought to enforce the injunction after agencies issued new notices in March 2025, which they argued renewed threats to federal funding for gender-affirming care. The court denied the enforcement motion, stating it would not expand the injunction’s scope without further proceedings.  \n\nThe case centers on whether the Executive Branch can override congressional appropriations and statutory non-discrimination mandates to restrict gender-affirming care. Plaintiffs’ claims rely on equitable relief and constitutional challenges, while defendants argued the Orders were lawful directives consistent with their statutory authority. The matter remains pending on appeal.  \n\n**Key Elements from Checklist:**  \n- **Filing Date:** February 4, 2025.  \n- **Parties:** PFLAG (national LGBTQ+ advocacy org), GLMA (health professionals org), transgender minors/adults, parents; defendants include Trump, HHS, HRSA, NIH, and their officials.  \n- **Type of Counsel:** ACLU, Lambda Legal.  \n- **Cause of Action:** Facial challenge to EOs for violating separation of powers, the Fifth Amendment, and anti-discrimination statutes.  \n- **Statutory/Constitutional Basis:** Article I (Congress’s spending power), Fifth Amendment Equal Protection, ACA §1557, PHSA §1908.  \n- **Remedy Sought:** Temporary and preliminary injunctions blocking enforcement of the EOs.  \n- **Judge:** Brendan A.

    "46306": "In March 2025, a group of legal service organizations (e.g., Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), its Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), and the Department of the Interior (DOI) violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by abruptly terminating funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings. The plaintiffs, represented by Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, and Justice Action Center, argued that the termination conflicted with the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA) and ORR’s 2024 Foundational Rule, which mandate that HHS ensure legal counsel for such children “to the greatest extent practicable.”  \n\nOn March 21, 2025, DOI issued a “Cancellation Order” halting payments to Acacia Center for Justice, the prime contractor for legal services, and directing subcontractors like the plaintiffs to cease funded work immediately. The plaintiffs claimed this left thousands of unaccompanied children—many infants or toddlers—without legal guidance for asylum, trafficking protections, or other relief. The district court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 1, 2025, enjoining the government from cutting off funding, and extended it to April 30 after a motion for recusal was denied. A preliminary injunction (PI) was issued on April 29, 2025, maintaining the TRO’s terms.  \n\nThe government appealed the PI to the Ninth Circuit, arguing the district court lacked jurisdiction under the APA and that the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. § 1491) required claims for monetary relief to be heard in the Court of Federal Claims. The Ninth Circuit initially dismissed the appeal as non-appealable but later allowed a petition for rehearing en banc. The panel denied the stay pending appeal, affirming the district court’s jurisdiction and the plaintiffs’ likelihood of success in showing the cancellation order was arbitrary and capricious. The government’s motion to recuse the district judge (Araceli Martinez-Olguin) for prior ties to a plaintiff and potential bias was denied.  \n\nThe case highlights a conflict over statutory interpretation: the plaintiffs assert the government is legally obligated to use available congressional appropriations (up to $5 billion through 2027) to fund legal services, while the government claims discretion to allocate resources and terminate contracts under its authority. The district court’s nationwide injunction preserves funding for legal representation, but the government seeks to vacate it, citing separation of powers concerns and the risk of irrecoverable taxpayer expenditures. The litigation remains ongoing, with the Ninth Circuit’s en banc decision pending.",

The states alleged that the Department arbitrarily terminated all previously awarded grants under the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) and Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) programs in February 2025, violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). These programs, established under the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. §§ 1022 et seq.) and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (20 U.S.C. § 6672), aimed to address national teacher shortages by funding training, placements, and professional development in underserved areas and subjects like special education and math.  \n\nThe states argued the termination letters sent by the Department lacked individualized reasoning, failed to comply with statutory requirements, and disregarded reliance interests of grantees and students. On March 10, 2025, Judge Myong J. Joun granted a TRO reinstating the grants and blocking further terminations. The Department appealed, claiming the TRO improperly interfered with its discretion to manage federal funds and that the case should be heard in the Court of Federal Claims. On April 4, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay pending appeal, citing jurisdictional concerns under the APA and Tucker Act.  \n\nThe states later withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. The core dispute centers on whether the Department’s grant cancellations, based on policy objections to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, violated the APA’s requirement for reasoned decision-making and adherence to statutory authorization. The case remains unresolved, with the Supreme Court’s stay in effect as of April 2025.",

United States* (Case No. 2:25-cv-241-BHS), transgender service members and the Gender Justice League sued the U.S. government to challenge Executive Order 14183 (the “2025 Military Ban”), which prohibits individuals who are transgender or exhibit symptoms of gender dysphoria from serving in the military. Plaintiffs, represented by Perkins Coie LLP, Lambda Legal, and the Human Rights Campaign, alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses and the First Amendment’s Free Speech protections. They sought a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the policy, arguing it lacks rational or compelling justification and violates their rights by discharging qualified service members based solely on transgender status.  \n\nThe case was filed on February 6, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, where Judge Benjamin H. Settle presided. Plaintiffs included seven active-duty transgender service members (e.g., Commander Emily Shilling, with over 19 years of Navy service and 60 combat missions) and one aspiring enlistee, Matthew Medina. Defendants included the U.S. government, the Department of Defense, and senior military officials in their official capacities. The court granted the preliminary injunction on March 27, 2025, finding plaintiffs likely to succeed on their claims and concluding the policy failed intermediate scrutiny. The injunction barred implementation of the ban nationwide, preserving the prior Biden-era policy allowing transgender service under specific medical criteria.  \n\nDefendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit, seeking to stay the injunction, and later filed an emergency application for a stay with the Supreme Court. The Ninth Circuit denied the stay on March 31, 2025, and the Supreme Court’s docket reflects ongoing review. The case is linked to parallel lawsuits, including *Talbott v. United States* (D.D.C.) and *Ireland v. Hegseth* (D.N.J.), both addressing similar challenges to the 2025 Military Ban. The government argued the policy is a legitimate exercise of military judgment to ensure readiness, cohesion, and cost efficiency, citing medical literature and prior policies. Plaintiffs countered that the ban is driven by animus and contradicts decades of military data showing no adverse impact from transgender service under the 2016 Carter Policy and 2021 Austin Policy.  \n\nThe district court’s March 27 order emphasized the absence of evidence supporting the ban’s asserted justifications, noting no complaints about unit cohesion or readiness under the previous policies. Defendants’ motion to stay pending appeal highlighted the military’s need to enforce its policy to maintain operational effectiveness, while plaintiffs warned that the ban would irreparably harm service members and undermine diversity in the armed forces. The case remains pending, with the Supreme Court considering whether to grant a stay of the injunction.",
    "45984": "On January 28, 2025, a group of transgender service members and prospective enlistees filed a lawsuit challenging Executive Order 14183, issued by President Donald J. Trump, which barred transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. military. The plaintiffs, including active-duty personnel with decades of combined service and multiple commendations, alleged the order violated the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause by discriminating based on transgender status. The order reversed prior policies under President Biden that allowed transgender individuals to serve openly if they met medical and administrative standards, including stability in their gender identity for 18 months.  \n\nThe district court, presided over by Judge Ana C. Reyes, granted a preliminary injunction on March 18, 2025, blocking implementation of the order. The court found the policy likely unconstitutional, rejecting the government’s claim of military readiness concerns and emphasizing that transgender service members had served without adverse impact. The injunction was stayed until March 21, 2025, to allow the government to seek emergency relief. On March 26, 2025, the court denied the government’s motion to dissolve the injunction, reiterating its likelihood of success on the merits.  \n\nThe government appealed, arguing the policy addressed legitimate medical and operational concerns, including unit cohesion and costs of gender-affirming care. On March 27, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted an administrative stay pending appeal, halting the injunction’s enforcement. The case remains pending, with the core issue being whether the military’s exclusion of transgender individuals based on gender dysphoria constitutes impermissible discrimination under heightened constitutional scrutiny.  \n\n**Related Cases:** The litigation builds on prior challenges to similar policies, including *Doe 1 v. Trump* (2017) and *Doe 2 v. Shanahan* (2019), which were resolved in favor of transgender service members.  \n\n**Legal Context:** The plaintiffs’ counsel included private attorneys and pro hac vice attorneys from organizations like the ACLU. The government’s defense relied on military deference principles, citing cases such as *Rostker v. Goldberg* (1981) and *Goldman v. Weinberger* (1986), but the district court found the policy lacked sufficient justification and was motivated by animus.",
    "45964": "In January 2025, the states of Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon, along with individual plaintiffs Cherly Norales Castillo and Alicia Chavarria Lopez, filed a lawsuit challenging Executive Order No. 14,160 issued by President Donald Trump. The Order sought to deny U.S. citizenship to children born in the United States to parents who were unlawfully present or temporarily present (e.g., on student or tourist visas), unless the child had at least one parent who was a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. The plaintiffs argued the Order violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause, which guarantees citizenship to “all persons born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction,” and Section 1401(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which mirrors this standard.  \n\nThe states claimed immediate harm from the Order, including loss of federal funding for programs like Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and Title IV-E foster care, as well as administrative burdens to modify systems for verifying citizenship. Individual plaintiffs, noncitizens expecting children after the Order’s February 19, 2025 implementation date, alleged the Order would strip their children of citizenship, exposing them to deportation and denying them rights like voting and working. The district court granted a temporary restraining order and later a preliminary injunction, blocking the Order’s enforcement nationwide. It ruled the states had standing based on their sovereign and proprietary interests in federal funding and concluded the Order likely conflicted with the Constitution and INA.  \n\nDefendants appealed, arguing the injunction improperly extended to nonparties and that states lacked standing to assert individual rights. The Ninth Circuit initially denied a stay, but the Supreme Court later held in *Trump v. CASA, Inc.* (June 2025) that universal injunctions exceeding the scope of the plaintiffs’ injuries were impermissible. However, the Court left open whether such injunctions could apply to states’ own injuries. On remand, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction against the Order, holding the states’ financial and administrative harms were concrete and directly traceable to the Order. The court rejected arguments that the harms were speculative or self-inflicted, emphasizing the states’ reliance on federal reimbursement for programs.  \n\nThe case proceeded as a class action for the individual plaintiffs, though their claims were dismissed due to overlap with a certified class in another district. The states’ challenge to the Order’s legality remained active, with the court upholding the injunction as necessary to prevent harm to their programs. The defendants did not dispute the constitutional guarantee of citizenship for the individual plaintiffs but maintained the Order was lawful under the President’s authority to define jurisdictional limits. The Ninth Circuit’s final opinion (July 2025) concluded the Order contradicted the plain text of the Fourteenth Amendment and INA, affirming the injunction’s validity for the states’ claims.",
    "45965": "On January 21, 2025, CASA, Inc., Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, and five pregnant women with non-citizen immigration statuses filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland challenging Executive Order 14,160, issued by President Donald J. Trump. The order sought to deny birthright citizenship to children born in the U.S. to mothers who were either unlawfully present or lawfully present on temporary visas, and whose fathers were not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Plaintiffs argued the order violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause and 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a), which guarantee citizenship to all children born in the U.S. and subject to its jurisdiction.  \n\nThe district court, presided over by Judge Deborah L. Boardman, granted a nationwide preliminary injunction on February 5, 2025, blocking enforcement of the order. The court found the plaintiffs had a strong likelihood of success on the merits, citing the Supreme Court’s 1898 decision in *Wong Kim Ark*, which affirmed birthright citizenship regardless of parents’ immigration status (except for narrow exceptions like children of diplomats or enemy combatants). The court also emphasized the irreparable harm of denying citizenship to newborns, including statelessness and family separation.  \n\nThe government appealed to the Fourth Circuit and sought a partial stay of the injunction, arguing it improperly extended to nonparties. The Fourth Circuit denied the stay, but the Supreme Court granted partial stays on June 27, 2025, limiting injunctions to plaintiffs and prohibiting courts from enjoining the Executive Branch’s internal implementation efforts. The Court held universal injunctions lacked historical basis in equity and exceeded judicial authority.  \n\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s directive, the district court certified a nationwide class on August 7, 2025, representing children born or expected to be born in the U.S. after February 19, 2025, whose parents’ immigration statuses fall under the executive order’s scope. Class representatives included CASA and ASAP members with pending asylum claims, temporary visas, or undocumented status. The court found Rule 23(b)(2) applicable, as the injunction sought to prevent the government from enforcing an allegedly unlawful policy affecting the entire class.  \n\nThe case remains pending on the merits, with the Supreme Court’s partial stays allowing the district court to refine the injunction’s scope to comply with Rule 23. The plaintiffs’ motion for a classwide preliminary injunction was granted, maintaining the status quo until the class certification is fully addressed. The government has not contested the constitutional and statutory claims on their merits, focusing instead on procedural limits of injunctive relief.  \n\nConsolidated cases include *Washington v. Trump* (W.D. Wash.) and *New Jersey v. Trump* (D. Mass.), both granting nationwide injunctions. The Supreme Court’s decision emphasized that while universal injunctions are invalid, class actions under Rule 23 provide a lawful avenue for broad relief. The certified class here seeks to preserve birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children, ensuring access to citizenship benefits and preventing family disruption under the long-standing *Wong Kim Ark* precedent.",
    "VR-LA-0120": "In *Clark v. Edwards* (Case No. 3:20-cv-00308-SDD-RLB) and consolidated *Power Coalition for Equity & Justice v. Edwards* (Case No. 3:20-cv-00283-SDD-RLB), plaintiffs—including individuals with health risks from COVID-19 and two organizations—sued Louisiana state officials, alleging that the state’s absentee voting laws violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments and the Voting Rights Act. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to remove three restrictions: (1) the “Excuse Requirement” mandating specific reasons to vote by mail, (2) the “Witness Requirement” requiring a third party to sign absentee ballot envelopes, and (3) the “Cure Prohibition” denying voters notice and an opportunity to correct ballot defects.  \n\nPlaintiffs argued that these provisions forced high-risk voters (e.g., elderly individuals, those with preexisting conditions) to choose between their health and voting, disproportionately impacting Black Louisianans due to systemic health and socioeconomic disparities. They cited epidemiological evidence of pandemic risks and compared Louisiana’s rules to more flexible systems in other states. The state defendants, including Governor Edwards, Secretary of State Ardoin, and Attorney General Landry, moved to dismiss, claiming plaintiffs lacked standing because the pandemic (not state action) caused the alleged harm and asserting that judicial intervention near elections would create chaos under the *Purcell doctrine*.  \n\nThe court dismissed the claims with prejudice. It held that plaintiffs failed to establish standing, as their injuries were not traceable to the defendants’ actions but rather to the virus itself. Additionally, the court found the cases moot for the July and August elections, which had adopted an “Emergency Election Plan” expanding absentee voting for some categories, and ruled that plaintiffs could not prove an unconstitutional condition for the November and December elections. The judgment closed the case, and plaintiffs’ motion to amend the dismissal was denied.  \n\nThe consolidated cases highlight tensions between public health concerns and election administration, with the court deferring to state authority and procedural timelines over plaintiffs’ constitutional arguments.",
    "VR-SC-0078": "In *Thomas v. Andino* (Case No. 3:20-cv-01552-JMC), plaintiffs—including Mary Thomas, Nea Richard, Jeremy Rutledge, Trena Walker, Dr. Brenda Williams, and the nonpartisan organization The Family Unit, Inc.—filed a lawsuit in April 2020 challenging South Carolina’s absentee voting requirements amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs argued that two state laws unduly burdened their fundamental right to vote in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Voting Rights Act (VRA). First, the “Excuse Requirement” (S.C. Code § 7-15-320) limited absentee voting to specific categories of voters, such as those over 65 or with disabilities, excluding others who wished to avoid in-person voting due to pandemic risks. Second, the “Witness Requirement” (S.C. Code §§ 7-15-220, 380) mandated a third-party witness sign absentee ballot envelopes, which plaintiffs claimed was impossible for those living alone, particularly elderly and disabled voters.  \n\nThe case arose as South Carolina faced a surge in pandemic-related health risks, with plaintiffs emphasizing that the challenged laws disproportionately affected African-American voters, who comprised a majority of virus-related deaths in the state. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to suspend these requirements for the June 2020 primaries and November general election, asserting irreparable harm from disenfranchisement or exposure to the virus. On May 25, 2020, the court granted a preliminary injunction against the Witness Requirement for the June primaries, ordering defendants to inform voters of the change. However, the state legislature later enacted a temporary law (S.C. Act 133) allowing all voters to request absentee ballots for the June primaries, which expired on July 1, 2020.  \n\nIn August 2020, defendants (state election officials) and intervenors (South Carolina Republican Party, Governor McMaster) filed motions for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that the Excuse and Witness Requirements were constitutional and lawful under state and federal law. The plaintiffs countered that the requirements violated Section 201 of the VRA as “tests or devices” and the ADA by discriminating against disabled voters. The court partially granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on the Excuse Requirement, finding plaintiffs had not demonstrated a severe burden under the Anderson-Burdick framework. On the Witness Requirement, the court deferred to state legislative authority, citing the state’s interest in election integrity.  \n\nOn September 18, 2020, the court issued a stay of proceedings, citing a related case (*Middleton v. Andino*, 3:20-cv-01730-JMC), where a preliminary injunction had already suspended the Witness Requirement for the November election. The stay was later extended, effectively halting further litigation until after the 2020 elections. By September 2020, most plaintiffs had been terminated from the case (e.g., Rutledge, Walker), and Governor McMaster was removed as a defendant. The court’s final rulings upheld the state’s election laws as constitutional, emphasizing the legislature’s role in regulating voting procedures and the lack of evidence showing the challenged requirements caused significant harm. The case underscores tensions between pandemic safety concerns and election administration, with the court ultimately deferring to state legislative decisions.",
    "JC-MD-0017": "In April 2020, a group of pretrial detainees and a post-conviction prisoner at the Prince George’s County Jail (PGCDOC) filed a class action complaint and habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 against Mary Lou McDonough, the Director of the Department of Corrections, in her official capacity. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments due to the jail’s failure to implement CDC-recommended measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and its inadequate medical care for symptomatic inmates. They sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to enforce hygiene protocols, social distancing, and timely medical screening, as well as release for medically vulnerable detainees.  \n\nThe complaint detailed uncontrolled outbreaks, lack of free hygiene supplies, insufficient medical attention, and unsanitary isolation conditions. Plaintiffs highlighted systemic issues, including limited soap access, failure to isolate symptomatic individuals, and delayed testing. The court granted a TRO on May 21, 2020, requiring the jail to submit a plan for identifying, monitoring, and treating high-risk detainees. The TRO expired on June 22, 2020, after the court found no further emergency relief necessary.  \n\nDefendant McDonough moved to dismiss the amended complaint, arguing that plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies and that the TRO was moot. The court denied the motion to stay the TRO pending appeal, finding no evidence of exhaustion or likelihood of success on the merits. The case proceeded with discovery, and in August 2020, the court denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss, upholding the plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief and class certification.  \n\nA court-appointed inspector, Dr. Carlos Franco-Paredes, reviewed the facility and confirmed significant undertesting and challenges in maintaining social distancing. His report, however, noted the jail’s compliance with CDC guidelines in some respects, such as sanitation and quarantine measures. The plaintiffs’ claims centered on the jail’s deliberate indifference to the pandemic, while the defendant emphasized adherence to evolving CDC protocols and the necessity of lockdowns to curb transmission.  \n\nThe case remains active, with the court maintaining jurisdiction to address ongoing compliance with public health standards and constitutional rights in the detention facility.",
    "IM-FL-0029": "In April 2020, 34 detained immigrants (later expanded to 58 plaintiffs) filed a class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, alleging violations of their Fifth Amendment due process rights. The plaintiffs, housed at three Florida detention centers (Krome, Glades, and BTC), claimed that ICE’s failure to implement Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic exposed them to unconstitutional health risks. They argued that overcrowded conditions, cohort quarantines, and lack of hygiene supplies made social distancing impossible, violating ICE’s own detention standards and CDC recommendations for managing infectious diseases in correctional facilities.  \n\nThe court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 30, 2020, requiring ICE to reduce detention populations to 75% capacity, provide masks and hygiene supplies, and evaluate detainees for release. After a May 2020 hearing, the TRO was extended and clarified to permit transfers only after individualized assessments of release eligibility. In June 2020, the court issued a preliminary injunction, mandating further compliance with CDC protocols, including separating confirmed and unconfirmed COVID-19 cases, ensuring unrestricted access to cleaning materials, and educating detainees about the virus. A special master was appointed to monitor compliance and found ICE had partially adhered to the orders but continued to cohort detainees and conduct unsafe transfers.  \n\nIn July 2020, the court denied class certification for the habeas corpus release claim but certified a class for conditions-of-confinement claims. Petitioners later filed a settlement agreement in June 2021, which required ICE to follow CDC and ICE pandemic response guidelines, implement vaccination protocols, maintain population density below 75% capacity, and provide educational materials about health measures. The settlement also allowed for continued individual habeas petitions. ICE contested the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment in January 2021, but the court found ongoing violations of detention standards. The case concluded with a settlement that remains court-enforced, emphasizing ICE’s obligation to prioritize detainee health during the pandemic."
