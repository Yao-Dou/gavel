    "46290": "In March 2025, the Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council (QEC), a student organization, filed a lawsuit against the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents and university officials, challenging a February 2025 ban on drag shows. The QEC sought to hold its annual Draggieland drag performance at the Rudder Theatre on March 27, 2025, but the Board ordered its cancellation, citing opposition to “gender ideology” and claims that drag shows “demean women” and violate an executive order. The QEC alleged violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, arguing the ban constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination and a prior restraint on speech.  \n\nThe court granted a preliminary injunction on March 24, 2025, blocking enforcement of the drag ban and permitting Draggieland to proceed as scheduled. Senior Judge Lee H. Rosenthal ruled that drag performances are protected expressive conduct under the First Amendment, and the Rudder Theatre functions as a designated public forum. The Board’s resolution was deemed viewpoint-discriminatory because it targeted speech based on its perceived ideological message. The court also found the ban unconstitutionally vague and not narrowly tailored to serve any compelling state interest, such as preventing a hostile environment under Title IX.  \n\nThe defendants appealed the injunction on March 28, 2025, and later moved to stay the ruling pending appeal. The case remains active, with the injunction in effect until further court order. The QEC, represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), sought injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, and attorney’s fees. The Board, represented by private counsel, defended the ban as compliant with federal funding rules and campus values.  \n\nThe factual record showed Draggieland’s history as a student-funded, non-nude event promoting LGBTQ+ culture, with no prior complaints of misconduct. The court highlighted that the Board’s abrupt cancellation caused irreparable harm to the QEC’s ability to express its message and fundraise, while the university’s justification relied on subjective, underinclusive criteria. The case underscores the tension between institutional policies and First Amendment protections in public university forums.",
    "46324": "Inclusiv, Inc., a nonprofit promoting financial security through credit unions, filed a lawsuit on March 31, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), its Administrator Lee Zeldin, Acting Deputy Administrator W.C. McIntosh, and Citibank. Inclusiv alleges that the EPA unlawfully froze and attempted to terminate its $1.87 billion grant under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), a program established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The EPA, represented by Zeldin and McIntosh, issued termination letters on March 11, 2025, citing unspecified “program integrity” and “misalignment with agency priorities,” but provided no evidence of fraud, waste, or legal violations by Inclusiv. Citibank, acting as a financial agent for GGRF funds, refused to disburse the money, despite contractual obligations to follow Inclusiv’s instructions.  \n\nInclusiv claims the EPA’s actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, the Anti-Deficiency Act, and constitutional separation-of-powers principles, including the Legislative Vesting Clause, Spending Clause, and Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to block the EPA from terminating the grant and to compel Citibank to release the funds. On April 1, 2025, Inclusiv moved for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order after discovering its grant funds had been moved to a money market fund, though it later withdrew the TRO request following assurances from Citibank.  \n\nOn April 15, 2025, the court consolidated this case with *Climate United v. EPA* (25-cv-698), which involves similar claims by other GGRF recipients. The court denied Inclusiv’s preliminary injunction motion as moot on April 16, 2025, following the consolidation. The case remains pending, with Inclusiv alleging that the EPA’s termination of the grant is arbitrary, exceeds statutory authority, and breaches contractual obligations with Citibank.  \n\nThe lawsuit is represented by private counsel from Venable LLP. Judge Tanya S. Chutkan presides over the consolidated cases.",
    "46391": "On April 11, 2025, five pseudonymous F-1 visa holders (S.Y., Z.D., Y.W., H.G., W.X.) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials and President Donald J. Trump. The plaintiffs, current or former international students and workers, alleged that their SEVIS records were abruptly terminated between April 4–8, 2025, without legal justification. The terminations cited vague grounds like “Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status” linked to criminal records checks or visa revocations, but the plaintiffs had minor or no criminal histories that would render them deportable. They argued that SEVIS termination is a final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), claiming it was arbitrary, capricious, and violated the APA’s requirement for lawful procedure. They also asserted Fifth Amendment procedural due process violations, asserting a protected property interest in their SEVIS status necessary for maintaining F-1 status and employment.  \n\nThe court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 17, 2025, enjoining defendants from arresting, detaining, or transferring the plaintiffs for 14 days and halting legal consequences of the SEVIS terminations. After a hearing on April 25, the TRO was extended, and a preliminary injunction was issued on May 22, 2025, maintaining these restrictions pending litigation. The court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on their claims, noting that ICE lacked statutory authority to terminate SEVIS records under the circumstances and that termination caused irreparable harm, including threats to education, employment, and freedom from deportation.  \n\nThe case was consolidated with similar lawsuits (e.g., Doe v. Trump) and re-assigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White. Defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025, and sought a stay pending appeal. The plaintiffs’ core诉求 remained vacatur of the SEVIS terminations, reinstatement of their status, and injunctions against enforcement actions. The dispute unfolded amid broader federal efforts targeting international students, with plaintiffs highlighting ICE’s policy of using SEVIS terminations and visa revocations to intimidate noncitizens into leaving the U.S. without due process.  \n\nThe case proceeded with extended deadlines for defendants’ responses to the complaint, reflecting ongoing litigation delays. No settlement was reached, and the court’s orders emphasized compliance with statutory and constitutional requirements for administrative actions affecting immigration status.",
    "46509": "On April 29, 2025, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), its Board of Directors, and three board members (Laura Ross, Thomas Rothman, and Diane Kaplan) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, the White House Presidential Personnel Office, and the Office of Management and Budget. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that an April 28, 2025, email from Deputy Director Trent Morse purporting to terminate the three board members was legally invalid, along with an injunction to block further interference with CPB’s governance.  \n\nCPB, established in 1967 as a private nonprofit under 47 U.S.C. § 396, argued that its structure insulates it from executive control. The statute explicitly states CPB is not a federal agency, its board members are not federal officers, and no federal entity may direct or control its operations. The plaintiffs contended that the termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), separation of powers, and the Constitution’s Presentment and Appropriations Clauses. They cited prior court rulings affirming CPB’s independence and highlighted a similar 2025 case involving the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP), where the administration faced claims of unlawful board terminations and property invasion.  \n\nDefendants argued that under D.C. nonprofit corporation law (D.C. Code § 29-406.08(e)), the President, as the appointing authority, had the power to remove board members unless the CPB’s bylaws explicitly restricted such removal. The CPB later amended its bylaws to require a two-thirds board vote for removals, but this change occurred after the challenged terminations.  \n\nOn June 8, 2025, Judge Randolph D. Moss denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court concluded that plaintiffs failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits, as the statutory and D.C. corporate law frameworks did not clearly conflict. The judge also found no irreparable harm, noting that CPB’s bylaws and D.C. law allowed the board to function even with reduced membership via a “designated body” of former directors. The court left open the possibility of renewed motions if defendants took further steps to interfere with CPB.  \n\nBy July 25 and August 1, 2025, two plaintiffs (Ross and Rothman) voluntarily dismissed their claims. The case continues with CPB, the Board, and Kaplan pursuing summary judgment on the merits.",
    "46590": "On April 7, 2025, coal miner Harry Wiley filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., alleging violations of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 (30 U.S.C. § 843) and the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause. Wiley, representing himself and similarly situated miners, claimed that HHS unlawfully terminated staff overseeing the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) and Part 90 job transfer protections, which allow miners with pneumoconiosis (“black lung”) to work in low-dust environments. The programs were paused in April 2025 amid a reduction-in-force (RIF) ordered under Executive Order 14210, leaving miners like Wiley unable to access free medical screenings, transfer rights, or B-Reader certification for diagnosing occupational lung disease.  \n\nWiley’s amended complaint, filed April 21, 2025, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that HHS’s actions were arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of its statutory duties. On May 7, 2025, the court held a hearing on Wiley’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Testimony revealed that CWHSP’s closure disrupted critical services, including mobile health screenings and epidemiological research, and that no plan existed to transition these responsibilities to other HHS divisions. The court, in a May 13, 2025, memorandum opinion and order (2025 WL 3549018), granted the preliminary injunction, finding that HHS’s RIFs rendered it unable to fulfill its obligations under the Mine Act and that Wiley faced imminent harm from continued dust exposure. The injunction required HHS to rescind the RIFs, restore the Respiratory Health Division, and ensure uninterrupted Part 90 protections.  \n\nThe case proceeded with discovery and scheduling orders issued in June 2025, and a second amended complaint was later filed and granted. The court emphasized that the closure of CWHSP and Part 90 violated the APA, the Mine Act’s anti-backsliding provisions, and due process rights, as miners had no alternative means to access legally mandated health safeguards. The defendants, represented by private counsel, contested standing and argued sovereign immunity, but the court rejected these claims, noting the public interest in preserving Congressionally mandated miner health protections. No settlements or monitoring mechanisms were documented. The case remains pending, with a trial scheduled for May 2026.",
    "46605": "On May 17, 2025, Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan, a Venezuelan citizen detained at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, filed a habeas corpus petition and class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Represented by private counsel, Arevalo alleged that Proclamation No. 10903—issued by President Trump under the AEA—unlawfully authorized the immediate removal of Venezuelan nationals, including himself, without adequate notice or process. The case named multiple government officials and agencies, including the President, Department of Homeland Security, and ICE, as respondents.  \n\nThe court initially granted a temporary restraining order (May 19, 2025) and certified a class of noncitizens in the Central District of California subject to the Proclamation. This was converted to a preliminary injunction on June 2, 2025, enjoining the government from removing or transferring class members under the AEA or Proclamation pending resolution of the case. The court found Arevalo likely to succeed on his due process claims, as the government failed to specify sufficient notice periods for removals. However, the court ruled that challenges to the Proclamation’s legal basis under the AEA were largely unreviewable due to the president’s discretion under the statute.  \n\nOn June 14, 2025, Arevalo filed an emergency ex parte application for a writ of habeas corpus after being granted asylum in a June 9, 2025, immigration hearing but remaining detained. The court denied this application on June 20, 2025, holding that his detention under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) was lawful pending the government’s appeal of the asylum decision. The preliminary injunction against AEA-based removals remained in effect, with a nominal $1 bond posted.  \n\nThe case is connected to prior litigation, including *Trump v. J.G.G.* (2025) and *A.A.R.P. v. Trump* (2025), where the Supreme Court addressed notice requirements for AEA removals. The government appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on August 1, 2025. The factual basis centers on Arevalo’s arrest during an ICE check-in without prior notice, his asylum application, and the government’s assertion that Tren de Aragua—a Venezuelan gang—posed an “invasion” justifying the Proclamation. The court’s orders emphasize protecting detainees’ right to challenge their removal status before deportation.",
    "46635": "On May 22, 2025, Shira Perlmutter, the Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, White House officials, and Todd Blanche, whom the President had appointed as acting Librarian of Congress. Perlmutter alleged that her termination on May 10, 2025, by President Trump—and the subsequent appointment of Paul Perkins as her replacement by Blanche—violated statutes governing the Library of Congress and the U.S. Constitution’s Appointments Clause (Article II, § 2, cl. 2). Specifically, Perlmutter argued that only the Librarian of Congress, not the President, has authority to appoint or remove the Register of Copyrights under 17 U.S.C. § 701(a), and that the Library, as a legislative branch entity, is not subject to executive control under 2 U.S.C. § 136.  \n\nThe case proceeded through emergency motions. Perlmutter sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and later a preliminary injunction to block Defendants’ actions. The court denied both, ruling on July 30, 2025, that she had not demonstrated irreparable harm absent relief, citing precedents that generally disfavor equitable intervention in government personnel disputes. The court emphasized that the Copyright Office could continue operating under Perkins’ leadership and that Perlmutter’s potential reinstatement after the lawsuit would mitigate any harm. Perlmutter appealed to the D.C. Circuit and also sought an injunction pending appeal, which the district court denied on August 20, 2025, for the same reasons.  \n\nThe case remains pending on the merits, with a schedule for cross-motions for summary judgment set for September–October 2025. Perlmutter seeks declarations that President Trump’s actions were unlawful and injunctive relief to restore her position. Defendants include the President, White House personnel, and Blanche, who claims to act as Librarian of Congress. The court’s Memorandum Opinion (2025 WL 4018003) concluded that Perlmutter’s claims, while potentially valid, did not warrant immediate preliminary relief due to the lack of extraordinary harm. No settlements, monitoring mechanisms, or trial dates are currently part of the record.",
    "45143": "In April 2023, Ashley and Sean Willey (the parents) filed a lawsuit against Sweetwater County School District No. 1 and several officials, alleging violations of their constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The parents claimed the district’s policy—allowing students to use preferred names and pronouns without parental consent, while requiring staff to conceal such information from parents—violated their Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights to direct their children’s upbringing and mental health care. They also alleged First Amendment free exercise and free speech violations, asserting the policy forced staff to lie to parents and contradict their religious beliefs about gender and truth-telling.  \n\nThe district court initially granted a preliminary injunction in June 2023, requiring the district to permit staff to disclose student name/pronoun requests to parents absent concerns of physical harm. However, after the parents amended their complaint, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the court denied without prejudice in July 2023. The case proceeded through discovery, with the defendants eventually filing a motion for summary judgment in March 2025. In April 2025, the court granted the motion, dismissing Sean Willey from the case and ruling in favor of the defendants on all remaining claims against Ashley Willey. The court concluded the district’s policy did not violate constitutional rights and that the parents had no valid claims under the First or Fourteenth Amendments.  \n\nThe parents appealed the summary judgment order in May 2025. The case was presided over by Judge Scott W. Skavdahl, with assistance from magistrate judges. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel, including the Bailey Stock Harmon Cottam Lopez LLP and the Child & Parental Rights Campaign (pro hac vice). The defendants, represented by Lambdin & Chaney, LLP, retained jurisdiction to enforce the final judgment, which closed the case in April 2025.  \n\nThe factual basis centered on the parents’ daughter, A.S., who identified as transgender at school in 2021–2022. The Willeys alleged the district concealed her mental health counseling and “social transitioning” from them, worsening her trauma and family dynamics. The district defended its policy as necessary to protect student safety and consistent with federal guidance on transgender student rights. The court’s final ruling upheld the policy, rejecting claims of constitutional infringement.  \n\n**Checklist Compliance:**  \n- **Filing Date:** April 20, 2023  \n- **Parties:** The parents; the school district and its officials  \n- **Class Action?** No (individual plaintiffs)  \n- **Type of Counsel:** Private law firms  \n- **Cause of Action:** 42 U.S.C. § 1983  \n- **Statutory/Constitutional Basis:** Fourteenth Amendment (due process parental rights); First Amendment (free exercise, free speech)  \n- **Remedy Sought:** Declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, monetary damages  \n- **Judge:** Scott W.

    "PH-IL-0002": "In May 2016, a class-action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois by current and former residents of the Alexander County Housing Authority (ACHA) against ACHA and four former executives. The plaintiffs, represented by Hughes Socol Piers Resnick & Dym, Ltd., and the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, alleged racial and familial status discrimination, as well as rent overcharges, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and Illinois state law. The case targeted ACHA’s segregation of public housing developments (McBride and Elmwood) by race, with nearly all units occupied by African-American residents, while other developments housed predominantly white residents. Plaintiffs also claimed ACHA failed to maintain McBride and Elmwood, leaving them infested with pests, mold, and unsafe conditions, while directing resources to whiter developments. Additionally, ACHA allegedly enforced policies barring families with children from certain housing, violating fair housing laws.  \n\nHUD had previously found ACHA violated Title VI by segregating housing in 2014. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, rent abatement, compensatory and punitive damages, and certification of subclasses for racial discrimination, familial status discrimination, and rent overcharges. After multiple amended complaints and settlement discussions, the represented plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice in July 2017, withdrawing their claims. Three individual plaintiffs (Denieshia Childress, Latonya Lee, and Coretta Cornelius) were dismissed for failure to prosecute. The court closed the case in September 2017, with each side bearing its own fees. The case highlighted systemic inequities in public housing maintenance and access, but no court-enforced decree or monitor was established.",
    "16518": "On April 14, 2022, the United States filed a lawsuit against the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina (Case No. 3:22-cv-01221-MGL) under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (34 U.S.C. § 12601). The complaint alleged that DJJ violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause by failing to protect juveniles at the Broad River Road Complex (BRRC) from youth-on-youth violence, excessive force by staff, and punitive, prolonged isolation.  \n\nThe DOJ’s investigation, initiated in 2017, found systemic deficiencies at BRRC, including inadequate staffing, poor facility design with surveillance gaps, and untrained staff contributing to frequent assaults (e.g., 134 fights and 71 assaults over 11 months in 2018–2019). Staff used dangerous tactics like chokeholds and excessive physical force, and isolation was imposed for minor infractions, mental health issues, or as punishment, with juveniles confined for up to 225 days. These practices were deemed punitive and unconstitutional, violating the rights of youth to safe conditions and due process.  \n\nOn the same day as the lawsuit, the DOJ and DJJ filed a joint motion to dismiss the case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), accompanied by a detailed Settlement Agreement. The agreement required DJJ to implement reforms: hiring consultants to assess staffing and behavior management, improving surveillance and video retention, revising use-of-force policies to prioritize de-escalation, limiting isolation to emergencies, and creating specialized housing for vulnerable youth. A court-appointed Subject Matter Expert would monitor compliance, and the court retained jurisdiction to reinstate the case if DJJ materially breached the terms.  \n\nJudge Mary Geiger Lewis granted the motion to dismiss on April 20, 2022, with the case formally closed on the same date. The settlement, binding for five years, mandates DJJ to achieve “durable compliance” with constitutional standards, with the DOJ reserving the right to seek reinstatement for breaches. The agreement emphasizes injunctive relief, not monetary damages, to ensure BRRC’s conditions align with juveniles’ rights to safety and rehabilitation.  \n\nThe factual basis includes DOJ interviews, incident reports, and video evidence documenting assaults, improper isolation, and staff misconduct. DJJ acknowledged these issues and committed to reforms, including training, policy revisions, and structural changes to the facility. The case remains subject to judicial oversight to enforce compliance with the settlement terms.",
    "46815": "In *United States v. Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia* (Case No. 3:25-cr-00115), the U.S. government indicted Abrego on May 21, 2025, for conspiracy to transport illegal aliens and illegal transportation of aliens for financial gain under 8 U.S.C. § 1324. Abrego was arrested in Nashville on June 6, 2025, upon his return from El Salvador, where he had been involuntarily removed in March 2025 (later vacated by an immigration court). The government sought pretrial detention, arguing the case involved a minor victim and posed serious risks of flight or obstruction of justice.  \n\nMagistrate Judge Barbara D. Holmes denied the detention motion on June 22, 2025, finding the government failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that the case involved a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(1)(E). The government’s evidence relied on a disputed birthdate (2007 vs. 2001) in a passenger roster from a 2022 traffic stop and hearsay from cooperating witnesses about Abrego allegedly transporting his own children during smuggling trips. The court emphasized the unreliability of this evidence, noting inconsistencies among witnesses and lack of corroboration. It also rejected claims of flight risk, citing Abrego’s lack of criminal history, strong ties to Maryland, and the inevitability of ICE custody if released.  \n\nOn appeal, District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr., conducted a de novo review and upheld the denial of detention on July 23, 2025. While adopting a broader interpretation of “involves a minor victim” under § 3142(f)(1)(E), the court concluded the government still failed to meet the clear and convincing standard for dangerousness or flight risk. Conditions of release, including electronic monitoring and restrictions on firearm possession, were deemed sufficient to ensure Abrego’s court appearances and community safety. A release order was issued on August 22, 2025, after the government did not oppose modified conditions. The case remains pending, with a jury trial scheduled for January 2026.  \n\nThe government’s appeal of the detention denial and subsequent motions to revoke release were dismissed, as the court found no statutory basis for detention and no evidence of Abrego’s gang affiliation (MS-13) or prior criminal conduct justifying preventive detention. The factual dispute over whether minors were “victims” during smuggling trips remained unresolved, but the court emphasized that release with conditions was consistent with the presumption of innocence and the Bail Reform Act’s limited exceptions.",
    "46755": "On July 1, 2025, the City of Columbus (Ohio), the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (Md.), the City of Chicago (Ill.), Doctors for America, and Main Street Alliance filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) “Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Rule” (2025 Rule). The plaintiffs, represented by Democracy Forward Foundation, alleged the Rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, specifically the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Rule, effective August 25, 2025, includes provisions imposing a $5 monthly surcharge on fully subsidized enrollees, revoking guaranteed coverage for individuals with past-due premiums, shortening open enrollment periods, and tightening income verification requirements.  \n\nIn a memorandum opinion dated August 22, 2025, Judge Brendan A. Hurson granted a partial stay of the Rule’s effective date under 5 U.S.C. § 705. The court found seven provisions likely unlawful: the $5 surcharge (contrary to ACA formulas for premium tax credits), the revocation of guaranteed coverage for past-due premiums (violating the ACA’s guaranteed-issue requirement), the failure-to-reconcile policy (impermissibly conditioning tax credits on prior reconciliation), and changes to special enrollment period verification and income-matching procedures (lacking adequate justification). These provisions were stayed to prevent irreparable harm to plaintiffs, including increased uncompensated care costs for cities and higher premiums for small businesses and healthcare providers. The court denied a stay for two provisions—the revised premium adjustment methodology and expanded actuarial value ranges—because HHS provided reasoned explanations for the changes.  \n\nThe factual basis for the case centers on the ACA’s goal of expanding affordable coverage and the plaintiffs’ claims that the 2025 Rule undermines this by creating enrollment barriers and worsening risk pools. Independent analyses and insurer rate adjustments supported plaintiffs’ arguments that the Rule would reduce enrollment by at least 1.8 million people in 2026, increase premiums, and burden safety-net healthcare providers. The court referenced prior litigation (City of Columbus v. Cochran, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731 (D. Md. 2021)) where it vacated similar policies as arbitrary. The case remains pending resolution on the merits.",
    "46576": "On April 10, 2025, the State of New York, Arizona, California, Delaware, the District of Columbia, and 13 other states and Pennsylvania’s Governor filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon. They alleged that the Department’s March 28, 2025, rescission of prior approvals extending the deadline to liquidate Education Stabilization (ES) funds—awarded under the American Rescue Plan Act and other pandemic relief laws—was arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The ES funds, totaling over $50 billion, were intended to address pandemic-related educational disruptions, including infrastructure upgrades and student support services. The plaintiffs had submitted requests for extensions to liquidate funds (due by September 2024) and received approvals extending deadlines to March 2026. The Department abruptly reversed its policy, claiming the pandemic’s 2023 end made further extensions inconsistent with its priorities.  \n\nThe district court granted a preliminary injunction on May 6, 2025, blocking the rescission and requiring 14 days’ notice for any future modifications. On June 3, 2025, it expanded the injunction to 30 days’ notice and mandated processing of liquidation requests. The government appealed, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act and that the rescission was lawful. The Second Circuit denied an emergency stay on June 20, 2025, finding the district court’s APA jurisdiction valid and the rescission unreasonable under the “change-in-position doctrine.” A dissent argued the Tucker Act likely applied and the rescission was justified. The case remains pending, with the preliminary injunction in effect, requiring the Department to honor prior extension approvals until litigation concludes.  \n\nPlaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prevent termination of programs and services, including HVAC upgrades, tutoring, and mental health support, which would be disrupted by the rescission. The Department’s May 11, 2025, letter introduced a project-specific extension process, but the court ruled this did not mitigate the harm of immediate rescission without adequate explanation or consideration of reliance interests. The injunction ensures states can continue accessing funds to fulfill obligations already incurred under the original extensions.",
    "46637": "In *National Public Radio, Inc. v. Trump* (Case No. 1:25-cv-01674), filed on May 27, 2025, plaintiffs National Public Radio (NPR) and three local public radio stations (Aspen Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio, and KSUT Public Radio) sued President Donald J. Trump, the Office of Management and Budget, the Treasury Department, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and other officials. The plaintiffs alleged that Executive Order 14290, issued on May 1, 2025, violates the First Amendment’s free speech, press, and association protections, as well as the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (PBA) and the Constitution’s Spending Clause. The Order, titled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,” mandates that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and federal agencies cease all direct and indirect funding to NPR and PBS, citing perceived bias in their news coverage.  \n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the Order’s retaliation against their journalism and editorial discretion is unconstitutional, as it chills protected speech and coerces local stations to alter programming. They also contended that the PBA explicitly bars federal officials from controlling CPB or its grantees, and that the Order’s vague criteria for “bias” violate due process. The case proceeded on motions for summary judgment: plaintiffs sought to enjoin the Order, declaring it unlawful, while federal defendants claimed the claims were unripe and that the Order lawfully exercised discretion in funding decisions.  \n\nThe court considered whether the Order’s directives to CPB and agencies exceeded statutory authority and whether its content-based restrictions on funding constituted viewpoint discrimination. Related litigation, *Corporation for Public Broadcasting v. Trump* (Case No. 25-cv-1305), addressed the President’s authority to remove CPB board members. As of July 25, 2025, the case remained pending, with plaintiffs asserting immediate harm from the Order’s chilling effect and federal defendants maintaining no final agency action had occurred to justify judicial intervention.",
    "46340": "On April 3, 2025, six national labor unions—American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees (AFSCME), National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United (NNOC/NNU), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), National Association of Government Employees (NAGE), and National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE)—filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs alleged that President Donald J. Trump’s March 27, 2025, Executive Order 14251 (“Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs”) violated the First Amendment by retaliating against their constitutionally protected speech and petitioning activities, exceeded his statutory authority under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), and infringed on procedural due process and equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment. The order excluded over 40 federal agencies and subdivisions, including the Departments of State, Defense, and Justice, from collective bargaining protections under Chapter 71 of Title 5, which guarantees federal employees the right to unionize and negotiate working conditions.  \n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the order was issued in direct response to their lawsuits and public criticism of Trump’s policies, including efforts to reduce the federal workforce. The White House Fact Sheet accompanying the order explicitly targeted “hostile Federal unions” and stated that the president supported “constructive partnerships with unions who work with him,” which the court found evidence of viewpoint discrimination. The district court, presided over by Judge James Donato, granted a preliminary injunction on June 24, 2025, blocking implementation of the order’s exclusions for most agencies, citing a serious risk of First Amendment retaliation and irreparable harm to the unions’ financial stability and representational rights. The injunction required the plaintiffs to post a $60,000 bond, which they did.  \n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the government’s emergency motion to stay the injunction pending appeal. The appellate court concluded that the government had shown a likelihood of success on the merits, as the order’s facial justification—national security—remained plausible, and the preliminary injunction risked interfering with the president’s statutory authority to manage federal agencies. The case is ongoing, with the lower court’s injunction temporarily preserved during the appeal process. Related litigation includes a separate lawsuit filed by federal agencies against unions in the Western District of Texas (Waco Lawsuit), which challenged the validity of collective bargaining agreements excluded by the order.  \n\nThe unions are represented by private counsel from Bredhoff & Kaiser, P.L.L.C., and Feinberg, Jackson, Worthman & Wasow, LLP. The defendants, including federal agencies and officials, are represented by the Department of Justice. The case highlights tensions between executive authority over labor relations and constitutional protections for federal employee unions.",
    "46805": "On July 21, 2025, a group of state coalitions and nonprofit organizations focused on domestic violence, sexual assault, and homelessness services filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, challenging new conditions imposed by the Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Health and Human Services (HHS) on federal grants. The plaintiffs, including the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, alleged that these conditions—requiring grantees to certify compliance with executive orders banning “gender ideology” (Executive Order 14168), restricting DEI programs (Executive Order 14151), and prohibiting abortion-related funding (Executive Order 14182)—exceed statutory authority, violate the First and Fifth Amendments, and contravene binding agency regulations.  \n\nThe lawsuit sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the contested conditions. On July 28, 2025, Judge Melissa R. DuBose granted the TRO, enjoining HUD and HHS from enforcing the restrictions on specific grants. The order was revised on August 7 and August 20 to expand the scope of prohibited conditions, including HUD’s Community Development Block Grant and HHS’s requirements tied to Title IX and anti-DEI policies. The court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on claims that the conditions are arbitrary, conflict with congressional intent, and infringe on free speech and due process.  \n\nDefendants, including HUD Secretary Scott Turner and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., argued the conditions align with federal anti-discrimination laws and executive authority. However, the court emphasized the lack of statutory authorization and the vagueness of terms like “gender ideology” and “DEI.” A hearing on the preliminary injunction was scheduled for September 4, 2025, with the TRO remaining in effect until further order. The case highlights tensions between executive use of federal funding and statutory/constitutional limits, with plaintiffs seeking to preserve their ability to serve underserved populations without ideological constraints.  \n\nCounsel for plaintiffs included private law firms, the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island, and the National Women’s Law Center, while defendants were represented by federal agencies. The court’s decisions to date reflect a strong presumption against the legality of the new conditions, pending full review.",
    "46375": "The Southern Education Foundation, Inc. (“SEF”), a 158-year-old nonprofit dedicated to advancing educational equity in the Southern United States, filed a lawsuit on April 9, 2025, against the U.S. Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon, and President Donald Trump. The case challenges the Department’s February 13, 2025, termination of SEF’s five-year, $8.6 million grant to operate the Equity Assistance Center for the Southern region (“EAC-South”), which provides technical support to school districts under federal desegregation orders. The termination was linked to Executive Orders 14151 and 14173, issued by President Trump in January 2025, which targeted diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives as “illegal discrimination.”  \n\nSEF alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), claiming the termination was arbitrary and capricious, failed notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, and deprived SEF of due process. The complaint also cited Fifth Amendment vagueness concerns, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and First Amendment viewpoint discrimination. The Department’s actions were deemed unlawful because they bypassed required statutory processes, provided no reasoned explanation for termination, and hindered federal desegregation efforts.  \n\nOn May 19, 2025, SEF filed a Supplemental Complaint after withdrawing its administrative appeal and receiving partial reimbursement for pre-termination expenses. The court, presided over by Judge Paul L. Friedman, addressed jurisdictional challenges from the defendants, who argued the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims. The court rejected this, finding SEF’s claims based on statutory and constitutional violations rather than contract disputes.  \n\nOn May 21, 2025, Judge Friedman issued a preliminary injunction, ordering the Department to reinstate the grant and reimburse SEF for outstanding expenses. The court concluded the termination lacked a rational basis, used vague and overbroad language, and disrupted critical desegregation services in 130 of the 132 remaining federal school districts under desegregation orders, primarily in the South. The injunction also barred the Department from enforcing the termination under the challenged policies.  \n\nThe defendants appealed the injunction to the D.C. Circuit Court on July 18, 2025 (Case No. 25-5262). The case remains pending further proceedings.",
    "46284": "In *Yunseo Chung v. Trump et al.*, filed on March 24, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, plaintiff Yunseo Chung, a lawful permanent resident and Columbia University junior, challenged the federal government’s alleged unconstitutional targeting of noncitizen protesters for immigration enforcement. Chung alleged that her arrest in March 2025 for obstruction during a pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia led to retaliatory actions by defendants—including the Secretary of State, Homeland Security, and others—in their official capacities, who purportedly invoked 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(4)(C) and § 1182(a)(3)(C)(iii) (the “Foreign Policy Ground”) to justify her detention and deportation. The government’s actions, she claimed, violated the First Amendment (retaliation for political speech) and the Fifth Amendment (due process), as well as the Immigration and Nationality Act and Administrative Procedure Act.  \n\nChung’s complaint detailed a broader policy under which officials, including Secretary Marco Rubio, targeted noncitizens involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy. This included the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident, and the revocation of visas for other students, such as Ranjani Srinivasan. The government justified these actions as combating “antisemitism” under Executive Orders 14161 and 14188, which critics argued conflated lawful protest with terrorism. Chung’s counsel moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction, asserting the policy chilled constitutionally protected speech and imposed arbitrary detention.  \n\nOn March 25, 2025, Judge Buchwald granted the TRO, enjoining enforcement of the Foreign Policy Ground against Chung. After oral arguments on May 29 and June 5, 2025, the court issued a preliminary injunction on June 5, 2025 (Dkt. 57), broadly prohibiting the government from detaining or transferring Chung, and requiring 72-hour notice if removal proceedings were to proceed under the Foreign Policy Ground. The government appealed the injunction on July 3, 2025, arguing the district court lacked jurisdiction.  \n\nThe case highlights tensions between immigration enforcement and free speech rights, with Chung’s attorneys including legal aid organizations and the ACLU. The government’s motion to dismiss was denied in part, acknowledging jurisdiction over the First Amendment claims. The preliminary injunction remains in effect pending the appeal.",
    "46735": "In June 2025, the Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools (a New Mexico school district) filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon, and President Donald J. Trump. The School District sought declaratory and injunctive relief to challenge the termination of a $6 million federal mental health grant awarded under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (2022), which provided $1 billion over five years for school-based behavioral health services. The Department terminated the grant in April 2025, citing a shift in administrative priorities and asserting the programs violated civil rights laws or promoted “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) concepts deemed unconstitutional.  \n\nThe complaint alleged that the termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being arbitrary and capricious, infringed First Amendment rights to free speech and association, and violated the Fifth Amendment due to vagueness. It also claimed the Department exceeded its statutory authority under the Spending Clause of the Constitution by unilaterally imposing retroactive conditions on the grant. The School District emphasized the grant’s role in improving student mental health, reducing bullying, and supporting staff, and argued the termination caused irreparable harm.  \n\nThe court held a hearing on the School District’s motion for a preliminary injunction on July 16, 2025. In its July 18 ruling, the court denied the injunction and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, concluding the dispute over non-renewed grant funding was a contractual claim governed by the Tucker Act, which requires such matters to be resolved in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The court found the Department’s decision not to continue the grant was a discretionary allocation of resources under a lump-sum appropriation, not subject to judicial review under the APA. It also rejected the constitutional claims, noting the School District failed to establish a protected liberty or property interest in continued funding. The case remains dismissable without prejudice, allowing the School District to refile in the Court of Federal Claims.",
    "46342": "On April 4, 2025, the *Association for Education Finance and Policy* (AEFP) and the *Institute for Higher Education Policy* (IHEP) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and the Department of Education (DOE). The plaintiffs, two nonprofit organizations dedicated to education research and policy, alleged that the DOE’s abrupt termination of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES)—a federal agency established by the 2002 Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA)—violated statutory mandates and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Specifically, the plaintiffs challenged the DOE’s February–March 2025 actions to cancel over 90% of IES’s contracts, eliminate 90% of its staff, and suspend remote access to restricted-use data, arguing these steps rendered IES incapable of fulfilling its congressionally mandated duties to collect, analyze, and disseminate education data and research.  \n\nThe complaint highlighted statutory obligations under ESRA, including IES’s requirement to conduct studies like the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), and to maintain data accessibility via peer-reviewed research and modern technology. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to halt these terminations, restore staff and contracts, and preserve data access, asserting irreparable harm to their ability to perform research and inform policy. On April 17, 2025, they moved for a preliminary injunction, supported by declarations from IES employees and experts detailing operational disruptions and wasted resources.  \n\nJudge Trevor N. McFadden denied the preliminary injunction on June 3, 2025, ruling that the APA does not permit courts to grant broad, programmatic relief to “wholesale” challenges against agency operations. The court emphasized that the plaintiffs’ claims—which bundled multiple discrete actions (contract cancellations, staff reductions, data access changes)—were not ripe for judicial intervention under *Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation* and similar precedents. The court also consolidated this case with *National Academy of Education v. DOE* (25-1266), but both motions for injunctive relief were denied on the same grounds.  \n\nOn July 16, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint narrowing their focus to six specific IES program terminations (e.g., longitudinal studies and peer review systems). However, the court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss as moot, given the amended pleading. The case remains active, with the core dispute centering on whether the DOE’s actions exceeded its authority under ESRA and violated statutory requirements for reasoned decisionmaking. The plaintiffs continue to seek declaratory and injunctive relief to restore IES functions, while the defendants maintain that their actions fall within executive discretion to streamline operations.  \n\nThe court’s opinion underscores the limits of judicial review under the APA, requiring plaintiffs to challenge individual agency actions rather than broad reorganizations. The case illustrates tensions between executive efficiency initiatives and statutory mandates for sustained educational research and data transparency.",
    "46322": "On March 31, 2025, three non-profit organizations—the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Secure Families Initiative, and Arizona Students’ Association—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging Executive Order 14248 issued by President Donald J. Trump on March 25, 2025. The order, titled “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,” mandates changes to federal voter registration and absentee ballot procedures. Specifically, it requires the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to add a documentary proof of citizenship (DPOC) requirement to the national mail voter registration form (the “Federal Form”) and instructs federal agencies to condition election-related funding on compliance with the order’s policies. The case was consolidated with two related lawsuits by the Democratic National Committee and other civil rights groups.  \n\nThe plaintiffs, representing diverse voter constituencies including military families, college students, and minority communities, alleged that the order violates the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers by unilaterally encroaching on authority reserved for Congress and the states. They argued that the EAC, an independent, bipartisan agency created by Congress under the Help America Vote Act, cannot be directed by the President to alter the Federal Form without following statutory rulemaking procedures. The Federal Form’s design, governed by the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), permits only limited information to ensure voter eligibility, and Congress explicitly rejected DPOC requirements as unnecessary and burdensome. The plaintiffs also contended that conditioning federal funds on compliance with the order’s mandates would coerce states into adopting policies that conflict with their existing laws.  \n\nOn April 24, 2025, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly granted a preliminary injunction against the implementation of Sections 2(a) and 2(d) of the order. The court held that the President lacked constitutional or statutory authority to direct the EAC to impose the DPOC requirement on the Federal Form, as such changes must be made through Congress-prescribed procedures requiring bipartisan consensus and public input. The injunction barred the EAC and its officials from taking actions to enforce the DPOC mandate. The court also ruled that the order’s directive for federal agencies to “assess citizenship” before providing the Federal Form to public assistance recipients likely violated the NVRA and the Privacy Act, but further factual development was needed. Other provisions, such as conditioning funding on ballot receipt deadlines, were deferred pending additional briefing. The decision emphasized that the EAC’s independence and the constitutional allocation of election authority to Congress and the states precluded unilateral executive action.",
    "46510": "In *Washington State Association of Head Start et al. v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al.* (Case No. 2:25-cv-00781-RSM), plaintiffs—including four state Head Start Associations (Washington, Wisconsin, Illinois, Pennsylvania) and two parent-led organizations (Family Forward Oregon and Parent Voices Oakland)—filed a lawsuit on April 28, 2025, alleging that the Trump administration’s actions to dismantle the Head Start program violate federal law and the U.S. Constitution. The case was amended on May 13, 2025, to add Tala Hooban as a defendant and clarify claims.  \n\nPlaintiffs argue that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has unlawfully implemented policies to terminate Head Start without Congressional approval. These include (1) freezing federal funding for DEIA-related activities via executive orders and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memoranda, (2) issuing a March 14, 2025, “DEI Ban” and an April 16, 2025, “DEIA Certification” requiring agencies to certify they do not engage in DEIA initiatives, and (3) closing half of OHS’s regional offices and laying off 60% of its staff in April 2025. The plaintiffs assert these actions conflict with the Head Start Act, which mandates funding for culturally and linguistically appropriate services, inclusive classrooms for children with disabilities, and outreach to vulnerable populations like homeless families and foster care children.  \n\nThe lawsuit claims the DEI Ban and DEIA Certification are unconstitutionally vague, suppress protected speech, and exceed HHS’s statutory authority. For example, agencies face uncertainty about whether standard practices—such as providing translation services, hiring bilingual staff, or modifying classrooms for children with disabilities—comply with the bans. The mass layoffs and office closures have disrupted grant renewals, delayed funding access, and left agencies without guidance, leading to closures like the Sunnyside, Washington, program that lost 400 children and 70 staff.  \n\nPlaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction on May 16, 2025, to halt enforcement of the DEI policies and staffing reductions, arguing irreparable harm would result from program disruptions. The court extended procedural deadlines to July 1, 2025, for a joint status report. Defendants responded that the policies align with Congressional intent and executive authority, but plaintiffs counter that no statute or appropriation authorizes these cuts or restrictions.  \n\nThe case centers on whether the administration’s actions comply with the APA, the Head Start Act, and constitutional checks on executive power. Plaintiffs emphasize the program’s 60-year history of serving 40 million children and its role in reducing poverty and improving educational outcomes, particularly for marginalized communities. The court has not yet ruled on the preliminary injunction.  \n\n**Legal Foundation:** Plaintiffs rely on 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction), the APA’s prohibition of arbitrary agency action (5 U.S.C. § 706), and constitutional claims under the Spending Clause (Art. I, § 8) and Separation of Powers. The amended complaint expands on the connection between the DEIA policies and HHS’s failure to meet its statutory obligations to monitor and support Head Start agencies.  \n\n**Proceedings:** The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, with Judge Ricardo S. Martinez overseeing it. Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction remains pending. The court has permitted extensive briefing on the motion, with defendants allowed up to 10,000 words in their response.  \n\n**Factual Basis:** Head Start, established in 1965, provides early childhood education, health services, and family support to low-income children. Plaintiffs allege the administration’s policies have caused chaos, including delayed funding, loss of program oversight, and forced closures, disproportionately harming children of color, those with disabilities, and families in rural “childcare deserts.” The government’s enforcement of the DEIA Certification threatens clawbacks and liability under the False Claims Act for agencies deemed noncompliant.",
    "46734": "On May 29, 2025, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle and the Dioceses of Yakima and Spokane, along with their bishops and priests, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against Governor Robert Ferguson, Attorney General Nicholas Brown, and 48 county prosecuting attorneys. Plaintiffs alleged violations of the First Amendment’s Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, and Article I, Section 11 of the Washington Constitution, stemming from Senate Bill 5375 (SB 5375), enacted on May 2, 2025. The law amended Washington’s mandatory child abuse reporting requirements to compel clergy to report suspected abuse or neglect, even when learned through sacramental confession, under penalty of gross misdemeanor charges, imprisonment, or civil liability.  \n\nPlaintiffs argued that SB 5375 forces them to choose between violating the sacramental seal—which the Church teaches prohibits priests from disclosing confessions under any circumstances, including to avoid excommunication—or facing state penalties. They highlighted that the law uniquely targets clergy, exempting other privileged communications (e.g., attorney-client, spousal) for non-clergy supervisors in similar roles. Legislative materials, including committee reports and testimony, confirmed the law’s intent to override religious practices, with lawmakers dismissing the sacramental seal as incompatible with child protection.  \n\nOn June 5, 2025, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of SB 5375 as applied to confessions. The U.S. Department of Justice intervened on June 23, 2025, under 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2, asserting the law’s equal protection violations. After hearings and briefing, Judge David G. Estudillo granted the injunction on July 18, 2025, enjoining enforcement of SB 5375 against plaintiffs and all Roman Catholic priests under their diocesan administration. The court found plaintiffs likely to succeed on their Free Exercise claim, concluding the law was neither neutral nor generally applicable, as it treated religious conduct less favorably than comparable secular exemptions (e.g., attorneys at universities). The injunction preserved the status quo while litigation proceeds, with the court declining to rule on church autonomy or establishment clause claims at that stage.  \n\nThe case remains pending, with plaintiffs seeking permanent relief and defendants contesting the injunction’s scope. Over 40 county prosecutors have stipulated to the injunction’s terms, while state defendants continue to oppose the motion. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and other amici supported plaintiffs’ position, emphasizing the law’s conflict with religious doctrine and historical protections for confessional secrecy.",
    "46678": "In June 2025, the State of California and Governor Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to challenge the federalization of 4,000 California National Guard members without lawful authority. The plaintiffs alleged violations of 10 U.S.C. § 12406, which permits the President to call the National Guard into federal service only under narrow conditions: (1) foreign invasion, (2) rebellion or danger of rebellion, or (3) inability to execute federal laws with regular forces. The plaintiffs argued that the protests in Los Angeles, triggered by ICE immigration raids, did not meet these statutory criteria and that the orders bypassed Governor Newsom, violating the requirement that such orders be “issued through the governors of the States.” They also claimed the deployment infringed on state sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment and violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits military involvement in civilian law enforcement.  \n\nOn June 10, plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to halt the deployment. The district court granted the TRO on June 12, ruling that the President’s actions were likely unlawful, as the protests did not constitute a “rebellion” or “invasion” and the federalization orders were not properly issued through the Governor. The TRO directed the DOD to return control of the National Guard to California. Defendants immediately appealed, and the Ninth Circuit granted a stay pending appeal, concluding that the President likely had authority under § 12406(3) to federalize the Guard due to risks to federal law enforcement and that the procedural requirement to issue orders “through the Governor” was satisfied by transmitting them to the Adjutant General. The district court’s preliminary injunction hearing was set for June 20, with a bench trial scheduled for August 11–13, 2025. The case centers on the balance of federal and state authority during domestic unrest, with significant implications for the use of military forces in civilian law enforcement.",
    "46287": "On March 25, 2025, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Education (ED), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and other federal agencies and officials. The plaintiffs alleged that the Trump administration unlawfully terminated approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University on March 7, 2025, and imposed sweeping conditions on its future funding as part of an effort to combat antisemitism on campus. These actions, they claimed, violated the First Amendment by coercing the university to suppress disfavored speech and academic inquiry, as well as the APA by bypassing required procedural safeguards for terminating federal funding.  \n\nColumbia had faced investigations by the Trump administration since February 2025 under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in federally funded programs. On March 13, 2025, federal agencies sent a letter demanding nine structural and policy changes within a week, including abolishing the University Judicial Board, banning masks in protests, and placing the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies department under academic receivership. Columbia partially complied with these demands by March 21, 2025, but the plaintiffs argued that the funding cuts and threats of further action had already chilled academic freedom and research among their members.  \n\nThe plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to restore terminated funds and block future terminations unless federal agencies followed Title VI and APA procedures. In their motion, they emphasized the procedural violations, including the lack of notice, hearings, and congressional reporting required under Title VI, and the constitutional risks of executive overreach. Defendants countered that the funding terminations were lawful exercises of agency discretion under 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, citing Columbia’s failure to address antisemitism and align with federal priorities. They argued the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the terminations, as the grants and contracts were awarded to Columbia, not the unions or their members.  \n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil denied the preliminary injunction and dismissed the case for lack of standing. The court held that the plaintiffs’ injuries—loss of funding and alleged speech chill—were not directly caused by the defendants, as the unions were not parties to the grants or contracts. It also ruled that the dispute over federal funding was channeled to the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, not the district court. The court noted that Columbia had initiated administrative appeals and was not seeking relief in this case, further undermining the unions’ standing.  \n\nThe case is connected to *Khalil v. Trustees of Columbia University*, a separate lawsuit where Columbia students sought to block the funding cuts. The court in this case emphasized that its role was not to second-guess executive enforcement of civil rights laws but to ensure plaintiffs had legal standing to bring their claims.",
    "46580": "On May 7, 2025, the State of Washington and 15 other states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), its Secretary Sean Duffy, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and its Acting Administrator Gloria M. Shepherd. The plaintiffs, represented by their Attorneys General, alleged that Defendants’ February 6, 2025, rescission of NEVI Formula Program guidance and suspension of approved state EV infrastructure plans unlawfully withheld $5 billion in Congressionally appropriated funds for EV charging infrastructure, violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the U.S. Constitution, and statutory obligations.  \n\nThe NEVI Program, established by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), required FHWA to distribute funds to states using a fixed formula to build EV charging networks. The states submitted and received approval for State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans for fiscal years 2022–2025. However, FHWA’s Biondi Letter rescinded the guidance and suspended all plan approvals, claiming alignment with DOT Order 2100.7, which prioritized factors like “marriage and birth rates” over statutory criteria. The states argued this action ignored the IIJA’s strict procedural requirements for withholding funds, such as 60-day notice and opportunities for appeal, and usurped Congressional authority over spending.  \n\nOn June 24, 2025, Judge Tana Lin partially granted the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court ruled that FHWA’s actions exceeded its statutory authority, were arbitrary and capricious, and violated separation of powers and the IIJA’s mandate. The injunction, effective July 2, 2025, barred Defendants from suspending or revoking state plans for 14 states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin) and from withholding NEVI funds without following IIJA procedures. The motion was denied for the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont due to insufficient evidence of harm. Public interest organizations, including the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council, were permitted to intervene as plaintiffs.  \n\nThe Court emphasized that the states’ reliance on NEVI funds for contracts, infrastructure projects, and climate goals constituted irreparable harm, and FHWA’s “temporary pause” on funding disrupted EV deployment and violated the APA’s requirement for reasoned decision-making. The ruling reaffirmed Congress’s exclusive control over appropriations and the Executive Branch’s duty to comply with statutory obligations. The case remains pending further proceedings on the merits.",
    "46259": "In *Mahmoud Khalil et al. v. The Trustees of Columbia University et al.* (1:25-cv-02079-AS), eight pseudonymous Columbia and Barnard students filed a lawsuit in March 2025, alleging that the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce, along with federal agencies and Columbia University officials, violated their First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs claimed the Committee’s February 13, 2025, letter demanding disciplinary records related to pro-Palestine activism at Columbia was an unconstitutional attempt to suppress protected speech. They argued the Committee used threats of withholding $5 billion in federal funding to coerce the university into violating FERPA and exposing students to doxxing, harassment, and retaliation. The plaintiffs also challenged Columbia’s compliance with the request, alleging the university became a tool for government overreach by altering disciplinary policies and implementing a mask ban.  \n\nThe case arose amid broader congressional investigations into antisemitism on college campuses, including prior subpoenas to Columbia and reports that leaked student disciplinary records. Plaintiffs cited examples of reputational harm, including the public shaming of university leaders and faculty, and referenced the Supreme Court’s *Vullo* decision, which prohibits government coercion of private parties to suppress disfavored speech. Columbia and the Committee defendants moved to dismiss, asserting the Speech or Debate Clause protected legislative actions and that the plaintiffs lacked standing. In April 2025, Judge Arun Subramanian denied a temporary restraining order but required Columbia to notify the court and plaintiffs 30 days before producing records to Congress. The plaintiffs later amended their complaint to include federal agency defendants, alleging additional violations through funding threats and curriculum changes.  \n\nIn June 2025, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed several individual-capacity federal defendants without prejudice. As of July 2025, motions to dismiss the remaining claims were pending, with defendants arguing immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause and failure to state a claim. The court had issued a protective order sealing plaintiffs’ identifying information and required non-disclosure agreements for parties accessing sensitive materials. The case centered on whether congressional pressure to address antisemitism crossed into unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination and whether Columbia’s compliance rendered it a state actor under the First Amendment. The outcome would determine the scope of legislative investigative authority and protections for student speech in academic settings.",
    "46557": "On May 5, 2025, 19 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, alleging that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its leadership violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the U.S. Constitution through the “March 27 Directive.” This directive, announced on March 27, 2025, mandated the termination of 10,000 HHS employees, restructured 28 HHS agencies into 15, and shuttered half of HHS’s regional offices, aiming to “Make America Healthy Again.” The states argued that the Directive disrupted statutorily mandated functions, including infectious disease surveillance, maternal health programs, occupational safety research, and tobacco regulation, and usurped Congressional authority by unilaterally dismantling agencies.  \n\nOn May 9, 2025, the states moved for a preliminary injunction to halt the layoffs and reorganization at the CDC, FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, Office of Head Start, and Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. HHS opposed the motion, asserting jurisdictional barriers under the Civil Service Reform Act and Tucker Act. On July 1, 2025, Judge Melissa R. DuBose granted the injunction, ruling the Directive was arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and threatened irreparable harm to public health. The court emphasized that HHS’s actions conflicted with statutes requiring specific agency functions and that the Secretary lacked authority to unilaterally restructure the Department, violating the Appropriations Clause and separation of powers.  \n\nHHS later sought to vacate the injunction or stay it pending appeal, but the court denied the request on July 18, 2025, noting the Supreme Court’s summary stays in similar cases did not establish precedent. The preliminary injunction remains in effect, requiring HHS to suspend terminations and reorganization of targeted sub-agencies until further order. The case continues, with HHS required to file a motion to dismiss by August 15, 2025.",
    "46511": "In April 2025, the Trump administration, through the Corporation for National and Community Service (AmeriCorps) and its interim head Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, initiated a mass dismantling of AmeriCorps by terminating approximately $400 million in grants, placing 85% of agency staff on administrative leave, and removing over 750 National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) members from service. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on April 29, 2025, alleging that these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Constitution’s separation of powers. The states argued that AmeriCorps’ abrupt closures disregarded statutory requirements for public notice and comment before making “significant changes to program requirements, service delivery, or policy,” as mandated by the 2024 and 2025 Appropriations Acts, and failed to provide recipients with a hearing.  \n\nOn May 6, the states moved for a preliminary injunction and stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705. After a hearing and supplemental briefing, Judge Deborah L. Boardman issued a preliminary injunction on June 5, 2025, enjoining AmeriCorps from enforcing the April 25 grant terminations and NCCC member removals within the plaintiff states. The injunction required reinstatement of grants and service members, compliance with notice-and-comment rulemaking for future changes, and a bond of $100 per plaintiff. The court found the states had shown a likelihood of success on their APA claims, irreparable harm from disrupted services (e.g., disaster relief, public health, and education programs), and that the balance of equities and public interest favored relief.  \n\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s June 27, 2025, decision in *Trump v. CASA*, which limited the scope of universal injunctions, the defendants moved to modify the injunction to apply only to the plaintiff states. On July 10, 2025, Judge Boardman modified the injunction accordingly, narrowing the requirement for notice-and-comment rulemaking to changes that directly harm the plaintiff states. The modified order remains in effect pending further proceedings. The states’ motion for a stay of the injunction was denied as moot.  \n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on the administration’s use of Executive Orders (14,210 and 14,222) to reduce federal spending and staff, including targeting AmeriCorps’ grants and programs. The states highlighted reliance on AmeriCorps for critical services, such as tutoring, disaster response, and healthcare, and argued that the agency’s actions without procedural compliance or legal justification threatened these services and violated congressional intent. The court’s rulings emphasized the APA’s requirement for reasoned decision-making and the unreviewability of broad agency actions without finality.",
    "46350": "On April 7, 2025, the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the Trump administration’s dismantling of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The plaintiffs allege that Executive Order 14238, issued on March 14, 2025, and subsequent actions—placing IMLS staff on administrative leave, terminating grants, and disbanding the National Museum and Library Services Board—violate the separation of powers, the Take Care Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the First Amendment. They seek a preliminary and permanent injunction to halt the agency’s closure, restore operations, and prevent unconstitutional funding conditions.  \n\nDefendants, including IMLS Acting Director Keith Sonderling, President Trump, and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), oppose the injunction, arguing the plaintiffs lack standing and that claims regarding grants and employment must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims or administrative bodies, not this court. On May 1, 2025, Judge Richard J. Leon issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) to preserve the status quo, but it was extended pending jurisdictional guidance from the D.C. Circuit. After a June 6, 2025, ruling, the court denied the preliminary injunction, finding the plaintiffs had not established jurisdiction or irreparable harm, and dismissed the TRO motion as moot.  \n\nThe case centers on whether the executive branch can unilaterally eliminate a congressionally created agency. Plaintiffs assert that IMLS’s statutory duties to fund libraries and collect data cannot be overridden by the Executive Order. Defendants counter that the APA does not permit “wholesale” challenges to agency operations and that grant terminations are contractual disputes under the Tucker Act. The court’s schedule for dispositive motions remains active, with IMLS’s administrative record due by July 15, 2025. Related litigation, such as *Rhode Island v. Trump*, highlights similar jurisdictional disputes. The outcome will determine the boundaries of executive authority over federal agencies and the appropriate forum for challenging such actions.",
    "46746": "On June 27, 2025, environmental groups Friends of the Everglades, Inc., and the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (SDFLD) to block the construction of a migrant detention and deportation center at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (TNT Site), a 17,000-acre area within the ecologically sensitive Big Cypress National Preserve. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), claiming the project proceeded without required environmental reviews and threatened endangered species like the Florida panther and bonneted bat.  \n\nThe Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM), under Executive Director Kevin Guthrie, had assumed control of the TNT Site on June 23, 2025, to build the facility, which the federal government agreed to fund under a 2025 FEMA grant program. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were named as defendants for their oversight role under 287(g) agreements, which allow state agencies to assist with immigration enforcement under federal supervision. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to halt construction and operations until compliance with environmental laws, which the district court granted on August 21, 2025, requiring removal of infrastructure within 60 days.  \n\nDefendants challenged venue, arguing the SDFLD was improper because the facility is primarily in Collier County (Middle District of Florida). The court rejected this, citing plaintiffs’ ties to Miami-Dade County and the project’s federal-state nexus. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit granted a stay pending resolution of the appeal, with the federal defendants arguing the district court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin immigration operations and that NEPA does not apply to state-led projects. The case remains pending, with the federal government emphasizing the detention center’s role in addressing immigration enforcement needs and the plaintiffs contending its construction undermines decades of Everglades conservation efforts.  \n\nThe litigation underscores tensions between immigration enforcement and environmental protections, with the court’s injunctive relief temporarily halting the project while legal arguments over federal authority and procedural compliance continue.",
    "46388": "On April 11, 2025, the American Association of University Professors–Harvard Faculty Chapter and the AAUP (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts against multiple federal agencies and officials, including the Departments of Justice, Education, Health and Human Services, and the General Services Administration. Plaintiffs, represented by private law firms Selendy Gay PLLC and Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC, allege that the Trump administration misused Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and federal funding authority to coerce Harvard into curtailing academic freedom and free speech.  \n\nThe case arises from a series of actions targeting Harvard’s federal funding, including a March 31, 2025, announcement of a “comprehensive review” of over $9 billion in grants and contracts. On April 3 and April 11, 2025, federal officials sent letters demanding sweeping changes to Harvard’s governance, admissions, hiring, and disciplinary policies, framed as preconditions for continued funding. Harvard rejected these demands, citing violations of its First Amendment rights and statutory obligations. Hours later, the administration froze $2.2 billion in NIH grants, followed by terminations of funding from USDA, DOE, DOD, NSF, and HUD by May 2025.  \n\nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants bypassed Title VI’s mandatory procedures, which require findings of noncompliance, voluntary compliance efforts, notice to Congress, and hearings before terminating funding. They also contend that the executive orders targeting “DEI” programs and antisemitism (E.O. 14151, 14173, 14188) and the DOJ Task Force’s actions amount to unconstitutional coercion and viewpoint discrimination. The factual basis includes public statements by officials like Leo Terrell, who threatened to “bankrupt” universities and impose “mask bans” or receiverships on academic departments.  \n\nPlaintiffs seek to enjoin the funding freezes and declare them unlawful, citing harm to research, graduate students, and academic freedom. The case is linked to related lawsuits against Columbia, Cornell, and Northwestern, where similar funding cuts and demands were applied without formal investigations. Key filings include a motion for a temporary restraining order (withdrawn), an amended complaint adding the UAW as a plaintiff, and a motion for summary judgment. The court has issued procedural orders but has yet to rule on the merits.  \n\nThe case hinges on whether the administration’s actions constitute arbitrary and capricious agency conduct under the APA and violate the First Amendment by leveraging federal funds to enforce political preferences. Plaintiffs highlight Harvard’s compliance with prior civil rights obligations and the lack of evidence for the new allegations, asserting that the freezes are punitive and designed to suppress dissent. The Trump administration maintains the actions are necessary to combat antisemitism and ensure merit-based admissions.",
    "46625": "In May 2025, the Vera Institute of Justice, Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Affirmative Action (doing business as Stop AAPI Hate), FORCE Detroit, and Health Resources in Action filed a class action against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi, the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), and Acting Head Maureen A. Henneberg. The plaintiffs alleged that in April 2025, OJP abruptly terminated over 370 multi-year grants and cooperative agreements totaling $820 million, including their own awards, without notice or reasoned explanation. The grants funded programs addressing violence reduction, victims’ services, juvenile justice, mental health, and community safety.  \n\nOJP cited a regulatory provision (2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4)) allowing termination if grants “no longer effectuate program goals or agency priorities,” but provided no specific evidence or individualized justification for the plaintiffs’ awards. The plaintiffs, who had never had federal grants terminated in their histories, argued the terminations violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, and the separation of powers. They sought a preliminary injunction to restore funding and certify a class of all affected grantees.  \n\nDefendants moved to dismiss, asserting the court lacked jurisdiction over the APA claims under the Tucker Act, which reserves contract disputes involving monetary relief to the Court of Federal Claims. The district court agreed, dismissing the case on July 7, 2025, and denying class certification as moot. It ruled the plaintiffs’ claims were contractual in nature and thus outside its jurisdiction.  \n\nOn July 10, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for injunctive relief pending appeal. They contended the Supreme Court’s recent decision in *Department of Education v. California* did not bar their APA claims, distinguishing their request for injunctive relief to halt unlawful terminations from claims seeking monetary recovery. The plaintiffs emphasized irreparable harm to vulnerable communities and the risk of ongoing violence due to disrupted programs. The district court denied the motion on July 21, 2025, reaffirming its earlier jurisdictional conclusion. The case remains pending on appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  \n\n**Key Elements:**  \n- **Filing Date:** May 21, 2025.  \n- **Parties:** Five nonprofit organizations (plaintiffs) and DOJ/OJP officials (defendants).  \n- **Class Action:** Yes; seeks to represent all U.S. entities with terminated OJP grants under § 200.340(a)(4).  \n- **Type of Counsel:** Plaintiffs represented by Perry Law and Democracy Forward Foundation.  \n- **Cause of Action:** APA (arbitrary and capricious action), Fifth Amendment due process, and separation of powers.  \n- **Statutory/Constitutional Basis:** 5 U.S.C. § 706 (APA), Fifth Amendment, and U.S. Const. art. I, § 8 (Spending Clause).  \n- **Remedy Sought:** Preliminary and permanent injunctions to halt terminations and restore funding.  \n- **Judge:** Amit P. Mehta (D.D.C.).  \n- **Related Cases:** Cited *California v. Dep’t of Education*, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025), and appeals to the D.C. Circuit.  \n- **Court Rulings:** Dismissal for lack of jurisdiction (July 7, 2025); denial of injunctive relief pending appeal (July 21, 2025).  \n- **Factual Basis:** DOJ’s sudden terminations disrupted services for at-risk populations, leading to staff layoffs and halted programs. Defendants claimed the cuts aligned with new agency priorities but provided no evidence of regulatory compliance or individualized review.",
    "46387": "In *Susman Godfrey LLP v. Executive Office of the President* (D.D.C., 2025), the law firm Susman Godfrey sued the U.S. government, challenging President Trump’s April 9, 2025, executive order titled *Addressing Risks from Susman Godfrey*. The order accused the firm of undermining election integrity, supporting military-detrimental activities, and engaging in racial discrimination through its DEI programs. It directed federal agencies to suspend the firm’s employees’ security clearances, terminate contracts involving Susman, and restrict access to government buildings and employment opportunities for its staff.  \n\nSusman, a prominent trial firm representing diverse clients, alleged the order violated the First Amendment by retaliating against its protected speech and associational rights, as well as the Fifth Amendment’s due process and equal protection clauses. The firm argued the order exceeded the President’s constitutional authority, infringing on judicial independence and the separation of powers. The government defended the order as a lawful exercise of procurement and personnel authority, asserting it targeted illegal activities and promoted national security.  \n\nThe case proceeded through motions for a temporary restraining order (TRO), summary judgment, and dismissal. On April 15, the court granted a TRO, blocking enforcement of the order’s punitive measures. After full briefing and a hearing, Judge Loren L. AliKhan ruled on June 27, 2025, that the executive order was unconstitutional. The court found it constituted impermissible retaliation for Susman’s advocacy, viewpoint discrimination, and void-for-vagueness violations, while also overstepping presidential authority under Article II. Judgment was entered for Susman on Counts I–IV (First Amendment claims) and VI–IX (Fifth Amendment and separation-of-powers claims). The court permanently enjoined the order’s implementation, declaring it null and void.  \n\nThe ruling aligned with prior decisions invalidating similar orders against other law firms, reinforcing that the government cannot penalize legal representation or speech based on political disagreements. The case underscored the importance of an independent bar in safeguarding constitutional rights and judicial review.",
    "46245": "The United States Institute of Peace (USIP), an independent nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1984, filed a lawsuit on March 18, 2025, against the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), alleging unlawful removal of its presidentially appointed board members and president. The dispute arose after President Trump issued Executive Order 14217 on February 19, 2025, labeling USIP part of the “Federal bureaucracy” and directing its reduction or elimination. On March 14, 2025, the White House notified 10 of USIP’s 15 board members of their immediate termination, bypassing statutory removal requirements under 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f). The remaining ex officio board members (Secretaries of State and Defense and the National Defense University president) then replaced USIP’s president, George Moose, with DOGE-affiliated officials Kenneth Jackson and later Nate Cavanaugh.  \n\nOn March 17, 2025, DOGE personnel, accompanied by law enforcement, forcibly entered USIP’s headquarters, causing damage and seizing control of its infrastructure. Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to halt these actions, which the district court denied on March 19, 2025, citing insufficient likelihood of success on the merits. After expedited briefing, the court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on May 19, 2025, declaring the removals of board members and Moose invalid and enjoining defendants from accessing USIP property or resources. The court held that USIP’s board members are not “executive officers” under Article II, making the statutory removal protections constitutional under *Humphrey’s Executor v. United States*.  \n\nDefendants appealed, and a D.C. Circuit motions panel granted an emergency stay on June 27, 2025, pending appeal. The panel reasoned that USIP exercises executive power through its foreign policy and grant-making activities, thereby subjecting its board to the President’s Article II removal authority. The plaintiffs petitioned for en banc review, arguing the panel’s decision conflicts with the Supreme Court’s recognition of statutory removal limits for non-executive entities. The district court’s order remains in effect unless modified.  \n\nThe case centers on whether USIP, despite its independent corporate structure and congressional funding, falls within the Executive Branch for removal purposes. Plaintiffs assert that the Trump administration’s actions violate the USIP Act and threaten the Institute’s mission to promote nonviolent conflict resolution. Defendants contend the President’s removal authority is unbounded by the statute, framing USIP as an executive entity. The litigation has also involved disputes over the transfer of USIP’s headquarters to the General Services Administration and the termination of nearly all staff. The D.C. Circuit’s en banc decision will determine the scope of the President’s removal power and the validity of the district court’s injunction.",
    "46274": "Plaintiff Climate United Fund (a Delaware nonprofit focused on clean energy financing) filed a lawsuit on March 8, 2025, against Citibank, N.A., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case arose after EPA terminated Climate United’s $6.97 billion grant under the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Climate United alleged that EPA’s termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), due process protections, and federal regulations, while Citibank breached its Account Control Agreement (ACA) by freezing grant funds at EPA’s direction.  \n\nThe GGRF authorized EPA to award grants for clean energy projects, with Climate United selected as a recipient in April 2024 after a competitive process. Grant funds were held in Citibank accounts under a Financial Agency Agreement (FAA) with the Treasury and an ACA between Citibank, EPA, and Climate United. The ACA required Citibank to disburse funds upon Climate United’s request unless EPA issued a “Notice of Exclusive Control,” which it did not. EPA claimed it terminated the grant due to concerns about fraud, waste, and misalignment with agency priorities, but provided no factual basis for these assertions.  \n\nClimate United moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on March 10, 2025, arguing that the fund freeze threatened its ability to operate, including paying staff and fulfilling clean energy projects. The court granted the TRO on March 18, 2025, and extended it pending a preliminary injunction (PI) motion. Federal defendants opposed the TRO and PI, asserting the case was moot because the grant was terminated and that jurisdiction lay in the Court of Federal Claims. The district court rejected this, holding it had authority to review EPA’s compliance with the APA and due process.  \n\nOn April 15, 2025, the court issued a PI, enjoining EPA from terminating the grant and directing Citibank to disburse funds as requested. The court found EPA’s termination arbitrary and capricious, noting the expired appropriation for GGRF funds and the lack of evidence supporting EPA’s claims of misconduct. The case was consolidated with similar suits by other GGRF recipients, including the Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities. EPA filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit shortly thereafter.  \n\nThe litigation centers on whether EPA’s post-election termination of grants exceeded its statutory authority and whether Citibank properly followed ACA terms. Climate United emphasized the public interest in advancing clean energy projects, while EPA argued it needed to reclaim funds to reform the program. The court’s rulings focused on procedural compliance, contractual obligations, and the separation of powers, with no mention of a court-appointed monitor or settlement.",
    "46142": "On February 19, 2025, the National Urban League, National Fair Housing Alliance, and AIDS Foundation of Chicago filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump and multiple federal agencies and officials in their official capacities. The plaintiffs, all non-profit organizations receiving federal grants or contracts, alleged that Executive Orders 14151, 14168, and 14173—issued in January 2025—violated the First and Fifth Amendments and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The orders targeted DEIA initiatives and transgender-related policies, directing agencies to terminate contracts or grants deemed “equity-related,” ban references to DEIA principles, and cease funding for programs promoting “gender ideology.”  \n\nThe plaintiffs argued the orders were unconstitutionally vague, chilling their speech and threatening funding for programs addressing systemic racial, gender, and disability-based disparities. They cited specific harms, including the termination of an EPA grant and restrictions on federally funded activities by agencies like HUD and HHS. The case was consolidated with National Council of Nonprofits v. OMB and related to New York v. Trump, where courts initially issued temporary injunctions against the orders.  \n\nIn March 2025, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the orders. Do No Harm, a non-profit opposing DEIA, filed a motion to intervene as a defendant but was denied by the court, which ruled that intervention was unnecessary at the preliminary stage. After briefing and a hearing, Judge Timothy J. Kelly issued a memorandum opinion on May 2, 2025, denying the preliminary injunction. The court found the plaintiffs unlikely to succeed on most claims, noting that four provisions (List, Report, Government Mandates, and Contract Terms) lacked standing because they did not directly harm the plaintiffs. For the remaining provisions, the court held that the government could lawfully withhold funding for activities violating civil rights laws and that the First Amendment does not compel federal subsidies for disfavored speech.  \n\nThe court emphasized that the plaintiffs’ facial challenges to the orders were speculative, as agency enforcement had not yet caused concrete harm. While acknowledging some procedural flaws in the orders’ implementation, it concluded that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate irreparable injury or a balance of equities favoring injunctive relief. The case remains pending, with the court allowing amicus participation for Do No Harm and leaving the door open for renewed intervention motions.",
    "46110": "In *NTEU et al. v. Trump et al.* (Case 1:25-cv-00420), five federal employee unions—National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), and UAW—sued President Donald J. Trump and multiple federal agency heads in February 2025. The unions alleged that Executive actions, including Executive Order 14210 (directing mass reductions-in-force targeting “nonessential” employees and probationary workers) and the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) deferred resignation program, violated separation of powers principles and federal statutes governing workforce reductions. They sought injunctive relief to block these actions, arguing that the firings would irreparably harm their membership revenue and bargaining power.  \n\nThe unions contended that Congress holds exclusive authority over agency funding, structure, and missions under Article I, and that the Executive’s mass firings intruded on this legislative role. They also claimed the OPM’s directives bypassed statutory requirements for reductions-in-force (RIFs), such as retention criteria based on tenure and performance. The government countered that the unions lacked standing to sue, as their injuries (loss of members) stemmed from voluntary employee choices and were not immediately irreparable. It further argued that claims were channeled through the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), which requires administrative review by the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) before judicial action.  \n\nAfter expedited proceedings, the court denied a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on February 20, 2025, ruling it likely lacked jurisdiction. The court held that the FSLMRS barred direct judicial review of the unions’ claims and required them to first pursue administrative remedies. This conclusion was reinforced in subsequent motions, with the court dismissing the case on May 15, 2025, for lack of jurisdiction. The unions’ appeal of the deferred resignation program in Massachusetts had already been denied, and the court emphasized that its decision aligned with existing precedent channeling labor disputes through FLRA. The case did not proceed to trial, and no settlement was reached. The court’s order reflected a strict adherence to procedural requirements, prioritizing administrative avenues over immediate judicial intervention.",
    "46098": "In *Global Health Council v. Trump*, No. 25-cv-402 (D.D.C.), filed on February 11, 2025, a group of nonprofit and small business plaintiffs, including the American Bar Association, HIAS, and Management Sciences for Health, sued President Trump and executive branch officials for halting foreign assistance funding via Executive Order 14,169. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and constitutional separation-of-powers principles, claiming the freeze unlawfully obstructed congressionally appropriated funds for global health, development, and democracy programs. The order directed a 90-day pause on foreign aid to “realign” it with the President’s policy preferences, leading to immediate stop-work orders and mass contract terminations by USAID and the State Department.  \n\nThe district court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 13, 2025, enjoining defendants from enforcing the freeze on existing contracts and grants. After plaintiffs demonstrated irreparable harm—including layoffs, program shutdowns, and disrupted humanitarian efforts—the court granted a preliminary injunction on March 10, 2025, finding the freeze arbitrary and capricious and contrary to the 2024 Appropriations Act. The injunction required defendants to make funds available for obligation and disburse payments for work completed before the freeze.  \n\nDefendants appealed, but the D.C. Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court also denied a stay. The district court later denied a motion to dismiss, emphasizing that plaintiffs’ APA claims were not moot. However, the D.C. Circuit ultimately vacated the preliminary injunction’s impoundment-related provisions, holding that plaintiffs lacked a cause of action under the APA and that the Impoundment Control Act (ICA) reserved enforcement authority to the Comptroller General. The court affirmed that the ICA precluded private suits to compel fund disbursement, leaving the Comptroller General as the sole entity empowered to challenge the freeze.  \n\nThe case remains pending, with the district court’s constitutional and ultra vires claims not yet addressed. The parties continue to litigate the scope of executive authority over foreign aid.  \n\n*This summary is based on publicly filed documents and court orders. No analysis beyond the record is included.*",
    "46090": "In February 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) and other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The plaintiffs alleged that Acting Director Russell Vought, appointed under disputed authority, issued stop-work orders, canceled contracts, and initiated mass layoffs—actions they claimed violated constitutional separation of powers principles and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The CFPB, created by Congress in 2010 to regulate financial markets and protect consumers, was accused of ceasing statutorily mandated functions, including processing consumer complaints, supervising financial institutions, and enforcing anti-discrimination laws.  \n\nOn March 28, 2025, the district court granted a preliminary injunction, finding plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits. The court ordered the CFPB to reinstate employees, resume operations, and maintain consumer complaint systems, citing irreparable harm to workers and consumers. The government appealed, and the D.C. Circuit issued a partial stay on April 11, 2025, permitting RIFs for employees deemed unnecessary to statutory duties. After further litigation and a full expedited appeal, the Circuit Court vacated the injunction on August 15, 2025. It held that the plaintiffs’ claims were not reviewable under the APA, which requires specific, final agency actions, and that the CFPB’s leadership decisions (e.g., stop-work emails) were not conclusive shutdown orders. The court emphasized that generalized challenges to agency management are barred by the CSRA and APA, which delegate employment and regulatory disputes to specialized forums. The case remains pending in the district court, with the CFPB permitted to proceed with reductions-in-force consistent with its statutory obligations.  \n\nThe case highlights tensions between executive reorganization efforts and judicial oversight of agency actions, with the D.C. Circuit reinforcing strict limits on APA review of broad, evolving administrative decisions.",
    "PN-NY-0014": "In *Ligon v. City of New York* (Case No. 12-cv-02274), filed on March 28, 2012, African-American and Latino Bronx residents sued the City of New York and NYPD officers, alleging unconstitutional practices under the \"Operation Clean Halls\" program. This program permitted NYPD officers to patrol private residential buildings, leading to unlawful stops, searches, summonses, and arrests without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. Plaintiffs argued these actions disproportionately targeted Black and Latino individuals, violating the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.  \n\nThe case was certified as a class action representing residents and visitors of buildings enrolled in the program. Judge Shira A. Scheindlin granted a preliminary injunction in January 2013, halting trespass stops without reasonable suspicion. The city appealed, and the case was reassigned to Judge Analisa Torres in 2014 after concerns about impartiality arose from the original judge’s media comments.  \n\nIn 2017, the parties reached a settlement. The City agreed to revise NYPD policies on stops and frisks, enhance training and supervision, and implement a body-worn camera pilot program. A monitor, Peter Zimroth, was appointed to oversee compliance, with a requirement for the City to demonstrate substantial adherence to reforms within three years. The settlement also included a Joint Remedial Process for community input.  \n\nThe case remains closed as of 2019, with ongoing compliance evaluations by the monitor. Related cases included *Floyd v. City of New York* (challenging broader stop-and-frisk practices) and *Davis v. City of New York* (focusing on public housing stops).

    "PB-CT-0007": "In 2010, six same-sex couples and a surviving spouse from Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines “marriage” as a union between one man and one woman for federal law purposes. Plaintiffs argued that DOMA violated the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause by denying them benefits under federal programs such as the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB), the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Social Security survivor benefits, and tax filing options. They were legally married under state law but excluded from federal recognition, leading to harms like higher health insurance costs, inability to claim FMLA leave for caregiving, and denial of joint tax filings.  \n\nIn 2012, the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, declaring DOMA unconstitutional. The court found that DOMA imposed invidious discrimination rooted in moral prejudice and failed even rational basis review, as its asserted justifications (e.g., preserving traditional marriage, conserving resources) were not rationally connected to its discriminatory effects. The court emphasized the long history of anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination and the immutability of sexual orientation.  \n\nDefendants, including the Office of Personnel Management and federal agencies, appealed the decision to the Second Circuit. Plaintiffs and intervenor-defendant BLAG (the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives) also filed petitions for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, seeking expedited review. The Supreme Court was asked to resolve whether DOMA’s exclusion of same-sex marriages violated the Fifth Amendment, given its nationwide impact on over 1,100 federal statutes and the ongoing legal uncertainty. The case highlighted the tension between federal deference to state marriage laws and Congress’s broad definition of marriage, ultimately contributing to broader litigation that culminated in *United States v. Windsor* (2013), which invalidated DOMA.  \n\nThe case underscored the constitutional obligation of the federal government to treat legally married same-sex couples equally under federal law, rejecting arguments that DOMA reflected legitimate governmental interests. It remains a significant example of judicial intervention in LGBTQ+ rights and federalism disputes.",
    "PC-AL-0034": "The United States of America filed a lawsuit on May 28, 2015, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, alleging that the State of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) violated the constitutional rights of incarcerated women at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women. The case arose from a DOJ investigation under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, which found systemic failures to prevent and address sexual abuse and harassment by staff, creating an unconstitutional risk of harm under the Eighth Amendment. The DOJ cited a history of unaddressed misconduct, toxic environments, inadequate investigations, and insufficient staff training or oversight.  \n\nThe parties resolved the case via a settlement agreement filed the same day, which the court approved as a consent decree on June 18, 2015. The decree required ADOC to implement gender-responsive policies to prevent sexual abuse, improve staff training, enhance inmate privacy, and address staffing shortages. Specific measures included adopting PREA (Prison Rape Elimination Act) standards, establishing a full-time PREA Compliance Manager, and ensuring access to hygiene supplies and medical care. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the decree.  \n\nA court-appointed monitor, Kathleen Dennehy, evaluated compliance from 2015 to 2019. Reports noted substantial progress, including revised policies, camera systems, and training programs, but ongoing challenges like staff vacancies and facility overcrowding persisted. By 2019, ADOC had achieved \"substantial compliance\" with most provisions, though staffing and infrastructure issues remained. The case underscores systemic reforms to protect incarcerated women from sexual abuse, emphasizing institutional accountability and gradual implementation of trauma-informed practices.",
    "ED-MI-0001": "In November 2006, Michigan voters approved Proposal 2, a constitutional amendment banning race- and gender-based preferences in public education, employment, and contracting. The following day, the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (BAMN) and other plaintiffs, including students and faculty, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleging that Proposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and federal civil rights laws (Titles VI, VII, and IX). The case was consolidated with a similar suit by Chase Cantrell and other students (Cantrell plaintiffs), who argued that Proposal 2 created unequal political burdens by forcing racial minorities to amend the state constitution to restore affirmative action, unlike other groups who could petition universities directly.  \n\nThe universities (University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University) initially sought a temporary injunction to maintain their existing admissions policies during the 2006–2007 cycle. A stipulation among parties led to a preliminary injunction delaying Proposal 2’s enforcement until July 1, 2007. However, the Sixth Circuit later stayed the injunction, and the district court dismissed the universities as unnecessary parties in 2008. The plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment was denied, with the court holding that Proposal 2 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  \n\nOn appeal, the Sixth Circuit initially ruled (in a panel decision) that Proposal 2 unconstitutionally burdened racial minorities by restructuring the political process to require a state constitutional amendment for affirmative action. This decision was later vacated and replaced by an en banc Sixth Circuit ruling affirming the district court. The case reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which unanimously reversed the Sixth Circuit, holding that Proposal 2 was constitutional. The Court emphasized that states may prohibit affirmative action through democratic processes and that the political-process theory applied in *Hunter v. Erickson* and *Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1* was inapplicable here. The Supreme Court concluded that Michigan voters’ decision to ban racial preferences did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, as it did not impose invidious discrimination but rather reflected a legitimate democratic choice.  \n\nThe case underscored the tension between federal judicial oversight of state constitutional amendments and the principle of state sovereignty in policymaking. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the ACLU, sought to invalidate Proposal 2 as a violation of equal protection, while the state and universities defended its legality. The Supreme Court’s 2014 decision affirmed the right of states to adopt such bans, rejecting the argument that voters could not democratically end affirmative action programs.",
    "DR-CA-0033": "In August 2005, Maurizio Antoninetti, a paraplegic using a wheelchair, filed a lawsuit against Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. He alleged that two Chipotle restaurants in San Diego and Encinitas violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act and Disabled Persons Act by constructing food preparation counters with walls 44 inches high, obstructing his view of the food preparation process. Antoninetti claimed this denied him equal access to the “Chipotle Experience,” which includes visually inspecting ingredients and watching their preparation, a key aspect of the restaurant’s service model.  \n\nThe case was consolidated with a later-filed class action (06-CV-2671) for discovery purposes. Chipotle defended by arguing that its 34-inch-high transaction stations and a 2007 written “Customers with Disabilities Policy” (allowing staff to show food samples or describe preparation) satisfied ADA requirements. The district court initially ruled that Chipotle’s prior unwritten accommodations did not provide “equivalent facilitation” under ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) § 7.2(2)(iii), but its written policy did. However, the court denied injunctive relief to lower the walls and awarded $5,000 in statutory damages for five visits.  \n\nAntoninetti appealed, and Chipotle cross-appealed the fee award. The Ninth Circuit vacated the district court’s judgment in 2010, holding that Chipotle’s written policy also violated ADAAG § 4.33.3, which requires wheelchair users to have comparable sightlines in restaurants. The case was remanded for injunctive relief and reconsideration of fees. On remand, the district court found Antoninetti’s death in 2011 mooted the injunctive relief claim but affirmed liability. The court awarded $545,079 in attorneys’ fees for the district court proceedings and $5,000 in damages.  \n\nThe case highlights the ADA’s requirement for architectural accessibility in new construction, rejecting the argument that policies alone can remedy physical barriers. It also underscores the limited success of the plaintiff in fee awards, as the court reduced fees based on proportionality to the damages recovered. The Ninth Circuit’s 2010 decision clarified that ADAAG standards must be strictly followed for new facilities, not circumvented by procedural accommodations.  \n\n**Legal Terms:**  \n- **Cause of Action:** ADA Title III and California Civil Code §§ 51, 54, 54.3.  \n- **Statutory/Constitutional Basis:** ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a); California Civil Code § 54.3.  \n- **Remedy Sought:** Injunctive relief to lower walls, declaratory judgment, and monetary damages.  \n- **Judge:** Hon. Napoleon A. Jones, Jr. (district court), later remanded to Hon. Barry Ted Moskowitz.  \n- **Related Cases:** Consolidated with 06-CV-2671 (class action) for discovery.  \n- **Court Rulings:** Denied injunctive relief initially but affirmed liability on remand.  \n- **Appeals:** Ninth Circuit reversed portions of the district court’s ruling (2010).  \n- **Settlements:** None; each party bore own costs.  \n- **Factual Basis:** Chipotle’s 44-inch walls blocked wheelchair users’ view of food preparation, violating ADAAG standards.",
    "CJ-FL-0009": "In June 2019, multiple lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida challenging Senate Bill 7066 (SB7066), enacted by the state legislature to implement Amendment 4, a 2018 voter-approved constitutional amendment restoring voting rights to most Florida felons upon completing their sentences. Plaintiffs, including individuals with unpaid LFOs (fines, fees, restitution) and civil rights organizations like the Florida NAACP and League of Women Voters, alleged SB7066 violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment’s ban on poll taxes, and procedural due process. They argued the law effectively disenfranchised low-income individuals by conditioning voting rights on wealth, creating a two-tiered system where only those who could pay retained their voice in elections.  \n\nThe district court, in consolidated cases (e.g., *Jones v. DeSantis*, No. 4:19-cv-00300), granted a preliminary injunction in October 2019, blocking enforcement of SB7066’s LFO requirements against plaintiffs unable to pay. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed this injunction in 2020, finding wealth-based discrimination under heightened scrutiny. However, the Florida Supreme Court later ruled that Amendment 4’s “completion of all terms of sentence” included LFOs. On remand, the district court issued a permanent injunction in May 2020, declaring SB7066 unconstitutional for requiring payment of LFOs as a condition to vote, particularly for indigent plaintiffs. It also certified a class of all Florida felons denied voting rights due to unpaid LFOs.  \n\nIn September 2020, the Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court, holding that SB7066’s LFO requirements survived rational basis review and did not violate the Equal Protection or Twenty-Fourth Amendments. The appellate court emphasized that requiring felons to complete all financial terms of their sentences was rationally tied to Florida’s interest in reenfranchising rehabilitated individuals and that the laws were not void for vagueness or procedural defects. The case, involving over 85,000 registered felons, concluded with the reinstatement of state enforcement procedures for voting rights restoration under Amendment 4.  \n\nThe litigation highlighted tensions between state authority to impose conditions on reenfranchisement and constitutional protections against wealth-based discrimination. Plaintiffs sought to ensure access to the ballot for those unable to pay LFOs, while defendants argued the law aligned with Florida’s discretion to define voter qualifications post-conviction. The Eleventh Circuit’s reversal left in place the requirement that felons pay LFOs to vote, provided they are not indigent.",
    "CW-CA-0005": "In July 2002, plaintiffs (five foster children using pseudonyms and a certified class of similarly situated children) filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that the California Department of Health Services (DHS), Los Angeles County, and related agencies violated the Medicaid Act’s Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions and constitutional rights by failing to provide necessary mental health services to foster children. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, private counsel, and advocacy organizations, sought injunctive relief to mandate community-based services like wraparound care and therapeutic foster care (TFC) for children with behavioral, emotional, or psychiatric impairments.  \n\nThe court certified a statewide class in 2003, defined as children in foster care or at imminent risk of placement who required individualized mental health services. In 2006, the court granted a preliminary injunction, ruling that EPSDT required California to provide wraparound and TFC as medically necessary services. The state appealed, and in 2007, the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the district court erred by assuming a duty to bundle services rather than ensuring individual components were effectively provided. On remand, the court required a renewed analysis of compliance with EPSDT.  \n\nIn 2011, the court approved a settlement with state defendants, obligating them to implement a plan for providing mental health services under the Core Practice Model (CPM), including Intensive Care Coordination (ICC) and Intensive Home-Based Services (IHBS). The settlement included court retention of jurisdiction until 2014 and a Special Master to monitor compliance. An advisory panel reported ongoing challenges, such as underutilization of services, data system limitations, and inconsistent caseload management. By 2018, the panel noted progress in staffing and CFT facilitator training but emphasized the need for stronger implementation of trauma-informed care and data tracking. The case highlighted systemic failures in addressing foster children’s mental health needs and the legal obligations under Medicaid and the ADA.",
    "PC-VA-0022": "On December 19, 2014, Eric J. DePaola, a Virginia prisoner, filed a civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, alleging violations of the Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual punishment) and the Fourteenth Amendment (procedural due process) due to his prolonged solitary confinement. DePaola, who was sentenced to 38 years for violent crimes including malicious wounding, was transferred to Red Onion State Prison in 2007 and placed in administrative segregation after stabbing a guard in 2009. He spent over eight years in solitary confinement, housed in an 8x10-foot cell with 15-minute weekly showers and limited recreation in a small cage. The Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) classified him as “Intensive Management (IM-0),” the most restrictive level, under policies requiring inmates to complete behavioral programs and demonstrate compliance to progress to lower security levels. DePaola argued the VDOC’s step-down process was ineffective, denying him meaningful opportunities to reintegrate into the general population.  \n\nThe defendants, represented by the Office of the Attorney General, filed a motion to dismiss in October 2015, which the court denied in May 2016. DePaola submitted an amended complaint in May 2016, and the defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting no genuine dispute of material fact. On September 28, 2016, the district court granted the motion, concluding DePaola’s claims were without merit. The court emphasized that VDOC’s procedures for reviewing segregation status (via Institutional Classification Authority hearings) provided adequate due process and that solitary confinement did not constitute cruel punishment under the circumstances. DePaola appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which received amicus briefs from correctional experts and psychiatrists attesting to the severe psychological harms of prolonged solitary confinement. The appeal argued the district court erred in dismissing claims without discovery and that the VDOC’s policies violated constitutional protections. The Fourth Circuit’s docket reflects the case was terminated in 2017, though its unpublished memorandum opinion is not detailed in the provided documents.  \n\nThe case centered on whether indefinite solitary confinement, absent meaningful review or progress toward reintegration, violated DePaola’s rights. The district court’s summary judgment dismissal hinged on its determination that VDOC procedures satisfied constitutional standards, while DePaola contended the system was functionally irreversible and excessively punitive. No trial occurred, and the appeal remains unresolved in the provided materials.",
    "CJ-MD-0001": "Vernon Evans, Jr., a death-row inmate in Maryland since 1984, filed a federal lawsuit in January 2006 challenging the state’s lethal injection protocol as unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The case involved multiple plaintiffs, including the NAACP, ACLU, and Maryland Citizens Against State Executions, who argued that the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services’ (DPSCS) procedures violated state law and risked unnecessary suffering. The DPSCS used a three-drug cocktail (sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) administered through a protocol criticized for lacking proper safeguards. Plaintiffs alleged that the protocol deviated from the state’s Death Penalty Procedures Statute (Md. Code Ann., Corr. Servs. § 3-905), which mandates a continuous intravenous barbiturate and paralytic agent, and that it failed to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which requires public notice and comment for regulations.  \n\nIn January 2006, Evans moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to halt executions until the state corrected its procedures. The district court denied the motions in February 2006, finding that while plaintiffs had raised serious questions about the protocol’s compliance with state law and constitutional standards, the balance of harms favored the state. The court emphasized the state’s interest in enforcing its criminal judgments and concluded that plaintiffs’ claims could proceed to trial without immediate injunctive relief.  \n\nA trial in September 2006 featured expert testimony from anesthesiologists, who highlighted risks of inadequate anesthesia, IV leakage, and the unnecessary use of pancuronium bromide, which masks suffering but does not prevent it. The court acknowledged these concerns but upheld the state’s protocol. Appeals to the Fourth Circuit were dismissed, and the case was later stayed. The litigation ultimately did not prevent Evans’ scheduled execution, though the state agreed to revise some procedures, including removing a pressure-infusion bag and improving lighting in the execution room. The case underscored tensions between administrative discretion in execution methods and constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment.",
    "CW-DC-0001": "In 1989, a class action lawsuit was filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by children in the District of Columbia Department of Human Services (DHS) foster care system and those known to the DHS due to abuse or neglect. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), alleged that the DHS violated federal and DC laws, including the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and the DC Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act. The case targeted systemic failures in the child welfare system, such as untimely investigations, lack of services to prevent foster care placements, inadequate foster care oversight, and prolonged stays in foster care (nearly five years on average).  \n\nAfter a two-week trial in 1991, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas F. Hogan ruled that the DHS violated federal and DC laws, as well as the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause. The court ordered a remedial consent decree in 1991, which was modified in 1993 to align with DC law after the D.C. Circuit affirmed the judgment on local law grounds. The decree mandated reforms, including timely abuse/neglect investigations, proper case planning, and ensuring permanency for children. The Center for the Study of Social Policy (CSSP) was appointed as a court monitor to oversee compliance.  \n\nDespite initial progress, the court found repeated noncompliance with the decree, leading to the imposition of a partial receivership in 1995 and a full receivership in 1998. The case continued through multiple appeals, with the D.C. Circuit ultimately affirming the court’s authority to enforce the decree under DC law. Over the years, the court approved updated implementation plans and consent orders, including a 2010 Exit and Sustainability Plan. Monitoring reports highlighted persistent issues, such as insufficient staffing, delayed investigations, and inadequate medical services, though some benchmarks improved. In 2020, the parties filed a joint motion to terminate the litigation, which was approved.  \n\nThe case’s remedies included injunctive relief, court-ordered reforms, and ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with DC laws. The CSSP’s reports documented both progress and setbacks, such as reduced foster care placements and challenges in maintaining staff and resources. The litigation marked a decades-long effort to reform a dysfunctional child welfare system, emphasizing children’s rights to safety, permanency, and adequate care."
