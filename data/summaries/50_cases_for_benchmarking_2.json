    "summary/long": "This case is about the cancellation of “Draggieland,” an annual student-funded drag show at Texas A&M, due to a drag ban implemented by the university’s Board of Regents (“Board”). On March 5, 2025, the student organization that produces Draggieland, Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council (“Council”), filed suit against Texas A&M in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas.\n\nThe Council sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the university’s prohibition of drag violated the students’ right to free speech. The Council also argued that the Board violated the Texas Open Meetings Act by holding a meeting without providing proper notice. According to the Council, because the drag ban was promulgated at this illegally-held meeting, it was void. Represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, the Council sought: (1) a temporary restraining order to prevent the cancellation of Draggieland, (2) an injunction against the enforcement of the Board’s drag ban, (3) an injunction to void any action taken by the Board at the meeting where it established the drag ban, and (4) declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Lee Hyman Rosenthal.\n\nThe District Court ruled in favor of the Council on March 24, 2025, enjoining Texas A&M from enforcing the drag ban and permitting Draggieland to proceed as scheduled. On March 28, 2025, Texas A&M filed an appeal and requested a stay of the preliminary injunction. As of March 31, 2025, this case was ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the freezing of federal grant funds meant for community financial development. Plaintiffs, Inclusiv, Inc., a nonprofit financial institution, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs named Citibank, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the EPA Administrator as defendants. Inclusiv sought injunctive relief and damages, claiming the defendants unlawfully blocked access to grant funds that had already been awarded and disbursed.\n\nThe dispute stemmed from the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), a program under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), which Congress established through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Inclusiv was selected as a grantee in April 2024 and awarded $1.87 billion under the CCIA grant program, allowing them to make commitments to 108 credit unions to help low and moderate-income communities reduce energy costs, create jobs, and improve financial security. Under the terms of the grant, the funds were held at Citibank, which served as a financial agent under an Account Control Agreement (ACA) executed with the EPA.\n\nThe dispute arose in February 2025, when the EPA allegedly froze Inclusiv’s GGRF funds, preventing the organization from distributing them to community lenders. This came following the EPA Administrator’s public remarks expressing his opposition to the GGRF, calling it “criminal” and vowing to recover the funds. On March 11, 2025, the EPA formally terminated Inclusiv’s grant, citing unspecified compliance concerns. Simultaneously, Citibank, which managed Inclusiv’s grant funds under an Account Control Agreement (ACA), declined to process any disbursements. On March 18, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a TRO in Climate United Fund v. Citibank [../../../../case/46274/], halting the effects of the March 11 termination letter. In reliance on the TRO order, Inclusiv sought disbursement of funds on March 21. Citibank did not respond to this letter, nor disperse any funds.\n\nOn March 31, Inclusive filed its complaint alleging claims against both the EPA and Citibank. Against the EPA, it claimed the agency’s actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act for engaging in actions that were contrary to federal law and EPA regulations, and for being arbitrary and capricious. It also claimed that the EPA violated the Separation of Powers and the Vesting, Spending and Appropriations, and Take Care Clauses by failing to distribute funds appropriated by Congress. Additionally, Inclusiv claimed the EPA deprived it of the Fifth Amendment right to Due Process by terminating its funds without notice or an opportunity to be heard. Finally, plaintiffs asserted an Ultra Vires claim that the EPA exceeded their constitutional and statutory authority under the “Administrative Procedure Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, and the Anti-Deficiency Act by withholding obligated funds in contravention of these plain congressional mandates.” Against Citibank, plaintiffs asserted state law claims of breach of contract and conversion.\n\nPlaintiffs sought a declaration that (1) the notice of termination was void; (2) the suspension of the grant award violated the APA, Separation of Powers, and the Due Process Clause, and exceeded statutory authority conferred on the EPA; (3) and that Citibank’s freezing of Inclusiv’s account was contrary to law and violated their contractual obligations under the ACA. They also requested a permanent injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the March 11 termination letter, and enjoining defendants from “[s]uspending, terminating, or attempting to suspend or terminate Inclusiv’s grant award, except as permitted by governing law.”\n\nOn April 1, plaintiffs filed both a preliminary injunction motion and a temporary restraining order (TRO). The preliminary injunction motion requested the Court to prevent the government defendants from enforcing the March 11 termination letter or suspending Inclusiv’s grant award, and Citibank from violating its contractual obligations under the ACA. The TRO requested a restoration of the plaintiffs’ grant funds to its Citibank account, which had been removed when Inclusiv’s CFO checked the balance of its Citibank account on April 1. Plaintiffs previously did not seek a TRO on reliance on the EPA’s statement that they would not move the money while the TRO in Climate United Fund v. Citibank [../../../../case/46274/] was in effect. There was a dispute over the nature of this removal, as defendants argued this was a routine transfer that occurred monthly. Plaintiffs stated that if the money was returned to their account, they would withdraw their request for TRO. However, they requested that the Court engage in more careful monitoring of the money.\n\nOn April 1, plaintiffs also filed notice of a related case, Climate United Fund v. Citibank. The court consolidated this case with Climate United Fund v. Citibank on April 15. On April 16, in light of the preliminary injunction granted in Climate United Fund v. Citibank and this case's consolidation with Climate United Fund, the Court denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction as moot. Further updates on this case can be found on Climate United Fund's Clearinghouse page [../../../../case/46274/].",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 11, 2025, five international students—attending school on F-1 visas—filed this lawsuit in the U.S.  District Court for the Northern District of California, against President Donald Trump, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Acting Director of the ICE San Francisco Field Office. In early April, the defendants had abruptly terminated the plaintiffs', and other international students’, record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information (SEVIS) system, effectively stripping them of their ability to remain a student in the United States. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants actions were unlawful and designed to coerce them and other international students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting in contravention to the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that SEVIS termination is unlawful unless a student actually violates the terms of their status, and they argue that none of them did. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief restoring their SEVIS status and preventing further enforcement actions or removal based on the unlawful terminations. The case was originally assigned to District Judge Noel Wise.\n\nOn April 16, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to enjoin the defendants from (1) arresting and incarcerating the plaintiffs pending the resolution of these proceedings; (2) transferring the plaintiffs outside the jurisdiction of this district pending the resolution of these proceedings; and (3) preventing any legal effect that the unlawful termination of the plaintiffs' SEVIS statuses or the potential unlawful revocation of their F-1 visas may have.\n\nThe following day, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a TRO, preserving the status quo pending further developments in this case.  The case was then marked as related to Doe v. Trump, 4:25-cv-03140  and reassigned to that case's judge, Jeffrey White, who held a hearing on April 25 and extended the TRO.  Numerous other cases were also marked related, and the Clearinghouse will follow the ongoing litigation in that case's record, here [../../../../case/46353/].",

They challenged defendants' purported termination of plaintiffs' positions on the CPB board, arguing that as a congressionally-created private corporation, President Trump lacked removal power over CPB. They alleged that their purported termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act, separation of powers, and the Presentment, Appropriations, and Take Care Clauses.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss the day it was filed, and Plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) the same day. By agreement of the parties, the court considered Plaintiffs' motion for a TRO as a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn June 8, 2025, while noting that the merits of the case were not yet before the court, the court denied Plaintiffs a preliminary injunction.  The court held that plaintiffs did not adequately demonstrate they were likely to succeed on the merits, because Congress likely intended for the President to exert a degree of control over CPB. The court additionally concluded that plaintiffs could not prove they faced a risk of irreparable harm, because their replacements would have to be nominated and Senate-confirmed, a lengthy process likely to take longer than a final verdict in this case. The court denied the requested injunction without prejudice, allowing plaintiffs to renew their motion if defendants or their affiliates \"take steps to interfere\" with CPB's independence.\n\nOn July 24, 2025, one of the board members voluntarily dismissed all her claims against defendants.

    "summary/long": "This is a proposed class action challenging the Trump administration's near-dissolution of the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program. On April 7, 2025, a coal miner filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary. Represented by private counsel, the Plaintiff challenged the termination of HHS employees overseeing the screening and job transfer programs related to coal mine dust lung disease (CMDLD). The Plaintiff, seeking to represent a class of similarly situated coal miners, argued that the termination of these HHS employees endangered him and other coal miners and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Irene Cornelia Berger.\n\nOn April 21, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding procedural due process claims and moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe court held an evidentiary hearing on May 7 and on May 13 issued a preliminary injunction. The court found that the plaintiff had standing, since as \"an active coal miner with diagnosed black lung, he is within the group intended to be protected by the Mine Act and Part 90, and he is among those served by the CWHSP at NIOSH,\" and is therefore harmed by the elimination of those services. The court found that through the elimination of the vast majority of employees at the Respiratory Health Division (RHD) and the CWSHP, the agencies had been shut down, constituting final agency action reviewable under the APA. The court then found the defendants' actions to be arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law under the APA. Under the Mine Act and associated regulations, HHS is required to \"to provide medical examinations to screen for black lung, to evaluate chest radiographs and spirometry tests, to issue Part 90 findings to miners with signs of black lung, to maintain a mobile health unit that travels to mines and mining communities, to maintain the B-Reader program, and to provide chest autopsies to examine for black lung in deceased miners.\" However, with the terminations of the employees, HHS was not fulfilling those obligations. Therefore, the court found that the plaintiff had established a strong likelihood of success on the merits of his APA claims.\n\nThe injunction requires restoration of all personnel and continuation of the miner health programs at issue. The court also ordered that, in the event of a reorganization at HHS, there be no pause in the protections mandated by statute. The court did not address class certification. On June 17, the court set a schedule for the case going forward. However, on July 9, the plaintiff asked the court for leave to file an amended complaint. The court has not yet ruled on the request.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../case/46411/].\n\nOn May 17, 2025, a Venezuelan noncitizen detained in the Central District of California brought this habeas and civil lawsuit as a proposed class action. The petition-complaint names President Donald Trump, the Attorney General, the U.S. Department of Defense and its Secretary, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, the U.S. Department of State and its Secretary, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its Acting Director and LA Director, and other ICE officials as Defendants. The case challenged both ICE's notice practices for noncitizens facing removal under the Alien Enemies Act, and the underlying question of the legitimate application of the Act. The case was assigned to District Judge John W. Holcomb.\n\nOn May 19, 2025, Judge Holcomb issued a class wide preliminary injunction - issued ex parte - prohibiting the government from removing any putative class members from the Central District of California pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act, pending a hearing on a motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nOn June 2, Judge Holcomb rejected government arguments challenging jurisdiction and standing, extended the preliminary injunction, and certified the class.  Judge Holcomb found that petitioner was unlikely to succeed on his challenge to the Alien Enemies Act because the act granted \"close to unlimited\" power to the President to determine the applicability of the act.  The court held it inappropriate for courts to construe the terms of the AEA because doing so inappropriately reflects the court's \"own determinations.\"  In contrast, Judge Holcomb found the petitioner likely to succeed in establishing a violation of his due process rights particularly because the government declined to provide necessary details about the process they proposed to employ.\n\nJudge Holcomb found the requirements for class certification without difficulty and accepted the petitioner's putative class as proposed:\n\n\"All noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled “Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua” and/or its implementation, with the exception of any noncitizen who filed an individual habeas petition prior to the commencement of this action.\"\n\nJudge Holcomb imposed a nominal $1 bond on the petitioners.\n\nOn June 14, petitioner filed an emergency ex party application for a permanent injunction.\n\nOn June 20, Judge Holcomb denied petitioner's ex party application for a permanent injunction without prejudice and ordered the government \"to file a Status Report no later than July 10, 2025, and every 30 days thereafter, that advises the Court regarding the status of the Government's appeal in [petitioner's] removal and asylum proceedings.\"\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This lawsuit challenged President Trump’s removal of Shira Perlmutter as Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office and the installation of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as acting Librarian of Congress. On May 22, 2025, Shira Perlmutter filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Todd Blanche, Paul Perkins (purported acting Register), Sergio Gor (Director, White House Presidential Personnel Office), Trent Morse (Deputy Director, White House Presidential Personnel Office), the Executive Office of the President, and President Donald J. Trump. Perlmutter was represented by Democracy Forward Foundation and Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Timothy J. Kelly.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, President Trump removed Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden and subsequently appointed Blanche—Deputy Attorney General—to act as Librarian, invoking the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA) and Article II of the Constitution. Two days later, Blanche purported to remove Perlmutter from her position as Register of Copyrights, immediately installing Paul Perkins as acting Register. Perlmutter alleged that the President lacked statutory and constitutional authority to remove Hayden, appoint Blanche as acting Librarian, or remove Perlmutter. Specifically, she argued the FVRA does not authorize the President to appoint acting officials in legislative entities such as the Library of Congress, and that the President’s actions violated the Appointments Clause and separation-of-powers principles. She emphasized that, under federal law, only the Librarian could remove or appoint the Register of Copyrights.\n\nOn May 22, Perlmutter sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to enjoin her removal and to reinstate her as Register. Following a hearing on May 28, Judge Kelly denied the TRO, finding that Perlmutter had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm. The court held that her loss of a \"statutory right to function\" and any alleged institutional harm to the Library and Copyright Office did not meet the high threshold for irreparable harm under controlling D.C. Circuit precedent.\n\nOn June 10, Perlmutter filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI), reiterating claims of irreparable institutional harm and injury to her statutory role. Defendants opposed the motion, arguing that the Library is an \"Executive agency\" under the FVRA, thus subject to presidential authority, and that Blanche’s appointment and Perlmutter’s removal were lawful. Alternatively, defendants contended that the President possessed inherent constitutional authority to designate an acting Librarian and remove Perlmutter directly.\n\nOn July 23, the court held oral argument on the preliminary injunction. On July 30, Judge Kelly denied the PI, ruling that Perlmutter again failed to demonstrate irreparable harm, reasoning that temporary deprivation of her role, absent a \"genuinely extraordinary situation,\" did not justify emergency injunctive relief. The court found no compelling evidence that Perlmutter could not be adequately reinstated at a later date, nor any indication that the Copyright Office would suffer permanent institutional harm without her immediate reinstatement.\n\nOn July 31, Perlmutter filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit challenging the district court’s July 30 order denying her preliminary injunction. On the same day, the district court denied defendants’ unopposed motion to stay their deadline to respond to the complaint as moot, ordering instead that the parties submit a proposed briefing schedule for anticipated cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, Perlmutter filed an emergency motion for injunction pending appeal, which the district court denied on August 20, 2025.  The court reasoned that she had again failed to show that she would be irreparably harmed absent relief.\n\nAs of August 2025, the appeal remained pending before the D.C. Circuit, and proceedings continued in district court toward summary judgment.",

    "summary/long": "At the start of the 2022-23 school year, Sweetwater County School District No. 1 in Wyoming adopted a new policy pertaining to the use of transgender students’ preferred name and pronouns in school. The policy required school staff to use a student’s preferred name and pronoun if the student asks (Preferred Names Policy). The policy further prohibited school staff from disclosing the transgender student’s name and pronouns to the student’s parents without their permission, even if the parents specifically ask (Student Privacy Policy). Plaintiffs in this case are the parents of a student attending Black Butte High School in Sweetwater County. Their child requested that the school refer to him by his preferred name and he/him pronouns, which differed from the name and gender marker on his birth certificate. One of the parent plaintiffs is also a teacher in the school district. Upon finding out that the school had been referring to her child as a boy without notifying her, the plaintiffs brought a lawsuit against Sweetwater County School District No. 1 on April 20, 2023 in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming.\n\nThe complaint alleged that the school district’s Preferred Names Policy violated plaintiff’s First Amendment right to freedom of speech and free exercise of religion as a teacher by compelling her to use names and pronouns inconsistent with her religious beliefs. The complaint also alleged that the Student Privacy Policy violated plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment due process right to direct the upbringing of their children and to familial privacy, and their First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion. Represented by the Child & Parental Rights Campaign as well as private counsel, plaintiffs brought this case against Sweetwater School District, three district officials, and the principal of Black Butte High School, a high school in the district. Plaintiffs asked for declaratory relief, injunctive relief enjoining the school district from following the Preferred Names and Student Privacy policies, and monetary damages for psychological and emotional distress. Judge Kelly H. Rankin presides over the case.\n\nOn April 21, 2023, plaintiffs moved for preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from continuing to follow their Preferred Names and Student Privacy policies while the case proceeded. The court determined that it would rule on preliminary injunction without hearing oral argument, and while the ruling was pending, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on June 29, 2023.\n\nThe district court ruled on plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction on June 30, 2023, denying and granting it in part. Regarding the Preferred Names Policy, the court found that the policy was neutral (i.e. did not target plaintiffs’ religion) and that the policy rationally related to defendant’s legitimate goal of complying with Title IX and avoiding discrimination against transgender students. Therefore, the court denied preliminary injunction relating to the Preferred Names Policy and allowed the policy to remain in effect while the case proceeded. Regarding the Student Privacy Policy, the court similarly found plaintiffs’ first amendment claim unpersuasive, since the policy was neutral and did not target plaintiffs’ religion. Furthermore, the court was largely unpersuaded by plaintiffs’ due process claims to direct the upbringing of their child and to familial privacy, reasoning that plaintiffs were asking the court to extend both due process rights far beyond the bounds of current case law. On the other hand, the court took issue with the portion of the Student Privacy Policy which required school staff to keep a student’s preferred name and pronouns secret from parents even if a parent asks, including lying to parents if necessary. The court found that such a policy “shocks the conscience” and could cause irreparable harm to plaintiffs. Under this reasoning, the court partially granted preliminary injunction. Specifically, absent a reasonable concern of physical harm or abuse, the court enjoined the school district from precluding a school district employee from responding to a parent’s inquiry regarding their child’s requested name or pronouns or requiring an employee to lie to parents about a student’s requested name or pronouns. In all other respects, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. 680 F.Supp.3d 1250.\n\nOn July 20, 2023, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which removed the claim that the Student Privacy Policy violated plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment due process right to familial privacy. Otherwise, the parties and remaining claims in the amended complaint stayed the same. In response to the amended complaint, also on July 20, 2023, the court denied defendants June 29 Motion to Dismiss as moot, since it addressed the initial complaint and not the operative amended complaint.\n\nDefendants filed a new motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on August 17, 2023, and as of October 31, 2023, the motion remains pending before the district court.",

The plaintiffs sued ACHA under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and state law, seeking injunctive relief and damages. Represented by the Sargent Shriver National Center of Poverty Law and private counsel, the plaintiffs claimed that ACHA has persisted in racially discriminatory practices for the past 40 years, pointing to a previously settled lawsuit in which the Department of Justice found a pattern and practice of racially segregated housing. The plaintiffs also alleged that ACHA had ignored multiple requests to adequately maintain the housing units. \n\nAfter filing three additional amended complaints, which included adding and removing individual plaintiffs and dropping the putative class-action claims for damages, as well as engaging in some discovery, the parties started participating in settlement conferences with Magistrate Judge Reona J.

    "summary/long": "In October 2017, the Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of Justice and the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of South Carolina (collectively, “the DOJ”) initiated an investigation of the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (SCDJJ) pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), and the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act. The investigation was focused on the Broad River Road Complex (BRRC), which was South Carolina’s long-term juvenile commitment facility.\n\nAfter the DOJ's initial investigation, it issued a findings report on February 5, 2020, in which it concluded that it had reasonable cause to believe that the SCDJJ failed to keep the young people in its custody reasonably safe from assaults by other young people and that it used prolonged and punitive isolation in violation of CRIPA. The investigation did not reveal a reasonable basis to believe that the SCDJJ violated the ADA through its use of pre-sentencing secure evaluation centers. To complete its investigation, the DOJ conducted several onsite tours and interviews, and reviewed available video footage of instances related to the alleged violations.\n\nThe DOJ continued its investigation and issued a second findings report on April 14, 2022, concluding that: 1) the conditions at the BRRC violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and 2) the violations were pursuant to a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. More specifically, the DOJ found that the SCDJJ failed to keep young people reasonably safe from excessive force by staff at the BRRC. Furthermore, the DOJ concluded that through its policies and procedures, failure to train its staff, and inadequate investigations, the Department seriously harmed young people and placed them at substantial risk of serious harm by staff.\n\nIn addition to issuing its findings, the DOJ made several suggestions for remedial measures:\n\n• improve the physical plan to ensure adequate surveillance and retain video to enable facility leadership to investigate allegations of abuse;   • conduct a staffing study to determine the appropriate staffing levels and staffing patterns to adequately supervise youth in the male living units, and make changes to staffing patterns as necessary;   • train staff on positive behavior management tools and de-escalation to reduce youth-on-youth violence and the use of isolation as a response to youth behavior;   • eliminate the use of isolation for minor misbehavior, protective custody, and mental health observation;   • replace long-term isolation with a short-term cool-down room in each housing unit for youth who are a threat to safety and develop policies to ensure that youth who are placed in the cool-down room are returned to the general population as soon as they are no longer a threat to safety;   • develop admissions screening protocols to identify youth who are vulnerable to victimization by other youth in the facility and create a specialized housing unit for these youth with access to equal recreational and educational services as youth in the general population;   • develop agreements with the state Department of Mental Health to ensure the prompt transfer of suicidal youth to appropriate placements for mental health treatment;   • revise the use of force policy to emphasize age-appropriate interactions and de-escalation techniques, make clear that force may be used only to prevent imminent potential harm to staff or others, require timely reporting and review of all uses of force, and require immediate training and corrective action where staff action does not conform to the policy;   • train staff on age-appropriate interactions with young people and adolescent development, de-escalation techniques, positive behavior management responses, and the revised use of force policy; and   • conduct timely investigations of allegations of staff-on-youth harms, including retention of all relevant video footage, and at the conclusion of each investigation, conduct necessary training to prevent future harms and impose discipline, as appropriate, for abuses of young people.\n\nAlso on April 14, 2022, the DOJ filed a complaint pursuant to the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act. On the same day, the DOJ filed a settlement agreement resolving its investigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. The matter was assigned to Judge Mary Geiger Lewis. In the agreement, the SCDJJ agreed to implement all of the DOJ's suggested remedial measures. The agreement also appointed an independent subject matter expert to monitor the agreement and make recommendations to ensure the SCDJJ’s compliance. Lastly, the agreement would expire in 5 years so long as SCDJJ attained substantial compliance with all provisions and maintained that compliance for one year. The parties jointly moved to conditionally dismiss the case and requested that the court retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement permitting reinstatement of the action in case of breach.",

    "summary/long": "On March 15, 2025, the second Trump administration deported almost 300 noncitizens—mostly Venezuelan nationals and some Salvadoran nationals—to El Salvador without going through any legal process in front of an immigration judge. Upon arrival, they were sent to the country’s mega-prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center or CECOT.\n\nThe defendant in this case, Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, is a Salvadoran national residing in the United States who had previously received protection from removal from an immigration judge. Despite this order withholding his removal, Abrego-Garcia was deported due to what the U.S. government termed an \"administrative error.\"  On March 24, 2025, Abrego-Garcia filed a habeas petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (8:25-cv-00951). It may be useful to read about that habeas case [../../../../case/46283/] before reading the summary of this one; throughout this case summary, we refer to that lawsuit as the habeas case or habeas court. On April 4, 2025, the habeas court ordered the government to facilitate Abrego-Garcia's return to the United States.\n\nOn June 6, 2025 the government informed the habeas court that it had \"successfully facilitated Abrego-Garcia’s return,\" and that he would stand trial on criminal charges in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The government filed a human smuggling indictment against Abrego-Garcia; press reports [https://abcnews.go.com/US/mistakenly-deported-kilmar-abrego-garcia-back-us-face/story?id=121333122] said that disagreement with how the prosecution was being handled prompted the criminal section chief's resignation in the U.S. Attorney's office that brought the case. The indictment charged Abrego-Garcia with one count of conspiracy to transport undocumented individuals and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented individuals. Abrego-Garcia made his initial court appearance that same day in the Middle District of Tennessee before U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, the government requested a pretrial detention hearing. The court granted the request, but the judge ultimately denied the government’s motion to detain Abrego-Garcia. The government moved to stay that decision on June 22, 2025, but the motion was also denied. In her opinion denying the stay, Judge Crenshaw found that the government had not made a “strong showing” that the four stay factors weighed in the government's favor.\n\nAbrego-Garcia remained in custody as the government and his attorneys submitted statements regarding potential release conditions. On July 2, the government moved for the court to revoke the magistrate judge's release order. The government made separate statements that once Abrego-Garcia is released from criminal custody, it will take him into immigration custody and again remove him to El Salvador.\n\nIn response, Abrego-Garciamoved for the court to delay his release until the July 16 hearing on the government's motion for revocation. Abrego-Garciaalleged that this would be the only way to ensure that the government does not remove him to a '\"third country\" as soon as the Court released Abrego-Garciafrom pretrial detention. The court granted this motion on June 30, 2025. On July 20, Abrego-Garciamoved, with the government's consent, for a 30-day stay of the issuance of any release order. Abrego-Garciaclaimed he had been \"advised by the government that if the Court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of [DHS], and DHS would begin removal proceedings.\"\n\nIn response, Abrego-Garcia moved for emergency relief in the District Court of Maryland on June 26, 2025. Abrego-Garcia requested the court order the government to:\n\n• Return him to Maryland immediately upon his release from confinement in Tennessee.   • Refrain from removing him from the United States or from transferring him outside the District of Maryland.\n\nOn July 24, Judge Xinis prohibited the administration from re-arresting Abrego-Garcia upon his release in Tennessee. Judge Crenshaw denied the administration’s motion to revoke the release order for Kilmar Abrego-Garcia from criminal detention, noting the administration failed to justify continued pretrial detention. Later that day, Magistrate Judge Holmes granted a 30-day stay of the order, keeping Garcia in U.S. Marshal custody.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Abrego-Garcia waived his right to a speedy trial and consent to a continuance of up to 127 days. Following this waiver, on August 19, Abrego-Garcia moved the court to dismiss for vindictive and selective prosecution. In the alternative, the defendant requested discovery and an evidentiary hearing to investigate his claims.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged a rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that allegedly endangered 24 million Americans' health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). CMS, which is a subagency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), proposed the challenged rule in March 2025, soon after the Trump Administration took office. The rule, entitled \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability,\" allegedly added several roadblocks to the acquisition of ACA health insurance; these included new fees, reductions in the enrollment period, and even a revocation of the ACA's central promise that any American can purchase health insurance. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nPlaintiffs the City of Columbus, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the City of Chicago, Doctors for America, and the Main Street Alliance filed this lawsuit on July 1, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit named HHS, its Secretary, CMS, and its Administrator as defendants. Plaintiffs were represented by Democracy Forward. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the CMS rule was unlawful under the APA; vacatur of the rule; a stay of, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against, the rule's enforcement; and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Brendan Abell Hurson.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting a stay, or alternatively a preliminary injunction, of the new CMS rule. The municipal plaintiffs argued that as healthcare providers of last resort for those who lose insurance under the new rule, the rule would bestow a heavy financial burden on them. The organizational plaintiffs argued that the rule would make it harder for them to pay their employees or to receive adequate compensation for healthcare services rendered.\n\nThe court held a hearing on the requested preliminary injunction on August 14, 2025. On August 22, 2025, it issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion and entering a stay enjoining certain provisions of the CMS rule that were to take effect on August 25. 2025 WL 2426382. It reasoned that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their challenges to seven provisions of the rule, but that they failed to show likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to warrant preliminary relief as to their remaining challenges to two other provisions of the rule. As to the seven, the plaintiffs had also shown that they faced irreparable harm – economic harms that could not adequately be remedied at the conclusion of litigation –  and that the balance of the equities and the public interest weighed in favor of a stay.\n\nFirst, the court found that Main Street Alliance and the city plaintiffs had standing based on the increased premiums and uncompensated care costs that would be \"predictable results\" of the challenged provisions. Next, it addressed the plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits of their claims across three categories: (1) challenges to provisions that eroded the value of coverage, including a provision imposing a $5 monthly surcharge to reconfirm eligibility, a provision revising the premium adjustment methodology, and a provision revising the actuarial value policy; (2) challenges to provisions that imposed barriers on enrollment, including a provision requiring enrollees to pay past-due premiums before receiving new coverage and a provision adding verification requirements for some enrollments; and (3) challenges to provisions that limited the availability of subsidized coverage, including a provision re-instituting a policy regarding failure-to-reconcile tax data and two provisions requiring heightened income verification under certain circumstances.  As to the first category, the court held that CMS lacked authority to impose the challenged fees, which were untethered to the statutory formula, and that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by revising the actuarial value policy because it provided an insufficient and conclusory rationale for the changes. However, the court concluded that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim that the provision revising premium adjustment methodology was arbitrary and capricious because the agency provided the necessary and reasoned explanation for the changes. As to the second category, the court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their challenge to past-due payment requirements, because the agency was not authorized to create a new exception to the ACA’s categorical guaranteed-issue rule, and to the verification requirements provision because defendants’ rationale for imposing the requirements was not indicative of reasoned decision-making. As to the third category, the court first held that plain text of the ACA contradicted the agency’s failure-to-reconcile provision, and therefore that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the provision was imposed contrary to law. Next considering the agency’s decision to rescind an automatic 60-day extension to reconcile income verification data, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the agency had misinterpreted its modification authority. The court did find, however, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the agency acted arbitrarily by instituting additional verification requirements for income below the federal poverty line and by rescinding a regulation requiring acceptance of self-attestation of projected household income because those changes were made without sufficient data justifying the need to impose them and in light of the agency’s circular reasoning and conclusory statements offered in support of the changes.\n\nUltimately, the court held that the appropriate course of action was to temporarily stay the seven challenged provisions as to which it found likelihood of success on the merits, postponing the effective date until final resolution of the lawsuit.  It reasoned that the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision in  CASA  [../../../../case/45965/] did not preclude such relief, because that decision did not limit a court’s ability to preliminarily set aside new agency rules under the APA. On August 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to clarify the scope of the preliminary injunction, which the court granted that same day, amending its August 22, 2025 order as clarified to order that the effective dates of the following provisions of the rule were stayed pending resolution of the merits of the case:\n\n• The imposition of a $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees, through the addition of 45 C.F.R. § 155.335(a)(3) and (n) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.330(j);   • The revocation of guaranteed insurance coverage for individuals with past-due premiums, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 147.104(i);   • The failure to reconcile policy in 45 C.F.R. § 155.305(f)(4), including the final rule’s amendments to that policy through the addition of 45 C.F.R. § 155.305(f)(4)(iii);   • The imposition of eligibility verification for the special enrollment period, through the revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.420(g);   • The imposition of a requirement that Exchanges verify household income inconsistencies when a tax filer’s attested projected annual household income differs from “trusted data sources,” through revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.320(c)(3)(iii) and the addition of 45 C.F.R. § 155.320(c)(3)(vi)(C)(2);   • The changes to the de minimis ranges for actuarial value calculations, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. §§ 156.140(c), 156.200(b)(3), and 156.400;   • The changes to the policy regarding self-attestation of projected income, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.320(c)(5).\n\nThe effective dates of the following provisions were not stayed:\n\n• The change to the measure for calculating the premium adjustment percentage set forth in 90 Fed. Reg. 27,166 through 27,178;     • The elimination of the 60-day extension of time to resolve inconsistencies in household income data, through the removal of 45 C.F.R. § 155.315(f)(7) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.320(c)(5).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

They alleged that Defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Edgardo Ramos.\n\nOn April 11, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, subject to an expedited briefing schedule agreed with the Defendants and ordered by the court on April 15. On May 6, the court held argument and the same day issued a preliminary injunction. The injunction blocked the challenged reaction letters and further prohibited Defendants from taking any action to modify previously-granted grant approvals without 14 days' notice to the affected state.

That same day, Defendants filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On June 6, in the Court of Appeals, they moved for a stay pending appeal and requested an immediate administrative stay while the motion was under consideration.

    "summary/long": "Issued on May 1, 2025, Executive Order 14290, “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,” required federal agencies to withhold all funding from National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and barred local stations receiving federal grants from using those funds to purchase their programming. This case is about whether the President of the United States can unilaterally strip public broadcasters of federal funding based on perceived political bias.\n\nOn May 27, 2025, NPR, Colorado Public Radio, Aspen Public Radio, and KSUT Public Radio filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs sued President Donald Trump and several federal agencies and officials, including the Office of Management and Budget, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The plaintiffs sued under the First and Fifth Amendments, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that Executive Order 14290 was unlawful and unconstitutional, and a permanent injunction barring agencies from cutting funds to NPR, PBS, or affiliated stations or restricting use of grants to purchase their programming. They argued the order exceeded presidential authority and constituted retaliation, viewpoint discrimination, and infringement of associational rights.\n\nOn May 30, 2025, PBS filed a parallel suit [../../../../case/46646/] against President Trump and federal agencies, challenging Executive Order 14290 as an unlawful effort to defund public media for political reasons. Raising similar First and Fifth Amendment, APA, and Public Broadcasting Act claims, PBS sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss and has proceeded on a parallel track.\n\nOn June 10, 2025, the court granted a joint proposal from the parties to resolve the case through cross-motions for summary judgment. On June 13, 2025, the plaintiffs filed their motion for summary judgment, asserting that the Executive Order lacked any legal basis and violated the APA, the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, the Spending Clause, and the Public Broadcasting Act’s mandate of editorial independence. The motion was supported by declarations outlining the severe consequences of the order, including the disruption of NPR’s national satellite system—used to transmit emergency alerts—and the financial destabilization of local public radio stations.\n\nOn July 12, 2025, the defendants moved for summary judgment and opposed the plaintiffs’ motion, arguing the case was unripe because no funding had been terminated and no concrete injury suffered. They asserted the order did not violate the First Amendment, as the government may choose which speech to subsidize and may consider content and viewpoint when allocating funds. They maintained the Executive Order simply declined to fund NPR and PBS, without retaliation, viewpoint discrimination, or infringement of associational rights. The defendants further argued no Fifth Amendment violation occurred because federal grants are not protected property interests. Finally, they contended the President is not subject to the APA and that no agency had taken final action subject to statutory challenge.\n\nOn July 25, 2025, the plaintiffs opposed the defendants’ cross-motion and replied in support of their own, arguing the Executive Order was “textbook retaliation and viewpoint discrimination.” They claimed the administration sidestepped the Public Broadcasting Act violation by relying on procedural defenses and a flawed view of the First Amendment. The plaintiffs argued the order was unconstitutionally vague, deprived NPR of a protected property interest in federal funding, and that its general disclaimer of compliance was meaningless given its direct conflict with statutory requirements.\n\nThe case remains ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This is a case about the federal government's alleged retaliation against labor unions for opposing President Trump’s policy agenda.\n\nOn April 3, 2025, several labor unions, representing hundreds of thousands of federal employees nationwide, including veterans' healthcare workers, defense personnel, and regulatory staff, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Donald Trump, multiple federal agencies, and their heads. The plaintiffs, including AFGE, AFSCME, NNOC/NNU, SEIU, NAGE, and NFFE, challenged Executive Order 14180, titled “Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Programs,” signed on March 27, 2025, alleging that it unlawfully retaliated against their protected speech in support of civil servants and violated the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Separation of Powers Doctrine. They also alleged statutory overreach under 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b) of the Civil Service Reform Act, claiming the order targeted them for engaging in protected activity such as litigation, public criticism, and union advocacy. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, vacatur of the order, and attorneys’ fees. Judge James Donato was assigned to the case\n\nThe Exclusion Order targeted nearly 40 federal departments and sub-agencies—including the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Justice, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services—citing national security grounds. However, the complaint alleged that the order was pretextual and driven by political animus, referencing the administration’s rhetoric and social media statements attacking “hostile unions” and “grievance filers.” The order also uniquely authorized only a few departments, such as DOD and VA, to restore bargaining rights to specific subdivisions, leaving thousands of workers' rights in limbo.\n\nIn parallel, the Trump administration filed a related lawsuit in Waco, Texas, seeking to nullify collective bargaining agreements with local union affiliates, underscoring a coordinated legal strategy. Plaintiffs in the California case argued that these actions reflected a broader campaign to dismantle the statutory framework protecting federal labor-management relations established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause, accompanied by 50 supporting declarations from affected workers. On April 25, the government filed its opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the March 27 Executive Order was a lawful exercise of presidential authority in the interest of national security. In response, the court ordered both parties to submit by May 2 a joint statement identifying any other pending lawsuits challenging the Executive Order and to address potential coordination under local rules.\n\nOn June 24, 2025, Judge Donato granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1755442. The court rejected the government’s argument that Congress had precluded judicial review by providing administrative review through the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). It explained that the FLRA has authority “over those disputes which arise under Chapter 71,” but the Executive Order “expressly removed the employees of the listed departments, agencies, and subdivisions from Chapter 71’s coverage.” As a result, the court concluded it was “not precluded from exercising jurisdiction.”\n\nThe court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on their First Amendment retaliation claim, noting they engaged in protected activity by “frequently speak[ing] against actions undertaken by President Trump and his administration since January 2025.” It concluded the government’s conduct would “chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in protected activity” and that the evidence raised “a serious question whether the agency exclusions in EO 14251 constitute retaliation for protected speech.” Thus, the court held the plaintiffs had shown a serious First Amendment issue warranting preservation of the status quo pending further litigation. As such, the court declined to address the plaintiffs’ other arguments and enjoined the implementation of Section 2 of the EO. It also required the plaintiffs to post a $60,000 bond.\n\nOn June 26, 2025, the government appealed to the Ninth Circuit, seeking both an administrative stay and a stay pending appeal. The government also sought a stay from Judge Donato, which was denied. On July 7, the Ninth Circuit granted the government’s administrative stay pending the appeal, without providing an explanation.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit granted the government's motion for a stay pending appeal. 2025 WL 2180674. The court found that the government was likely to succeed on the merits, reasoning that even if the unions could show a prima facie case of retaliation, the President would have issued the order regardless of the unions' protected speech due to national security concerns. The court also found that the government would suffer irreparable harm without a stay, as an injunction would \"tie the government's hands\" in a national security context. Regarding the harm to other parties, the court found that any injury to the unions would be mitigated, as terminated collective bargaining agreements could be reinstated and a pause in dues collection could be managed by voluntary payments and future monetary damages. Finally, the court determined that a stay would serve the public interest by \"preserving the President's autonomy under a statute that expressly recognizes his national-security expertise.\"\n\nThis case remains ongoing in the district court and Ninth Circuit.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenges federal agencies' imposition of alleged unlawful funding conditions on federal grants related to domestic violence, sexual assault, and homelessness services.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, several nonprofit organizations that receive federal grants to serve victims of domestic violence, victims of sexual assault, and homeless individuals filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary; the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and its Acting Assistant Secretary; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its Acting Director; the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) and its Administrator; and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and its Secretary. The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and were ultra vires. Judge Melissa R. DuBose presides over the case.\n\nPlaintiffs challenged funding restrictions imposed by the Trump Administration, including anti-Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEI/DEIA) requirements; \"Gender Ideology\" conditions, as defined in Executive Order 14168; and a \"HUD Abortion Condition\" that restricts the use of grant funds for elective abortions, following Executive Order 14182. Plaintiffs claimed these restrictions were ideologically motivated and designed to advance the Administration’s agenda, rather than to further the statutory purposes of the underlying grant programs. They claimed the conditions were unlawful, arbitrary and capricious, and untethered to the authorizing statutes, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nPlaintiffs argued that these conditions placed them in an untenable position: either fundamentally alter their programming or lose essential federal funding—jeopardizing critical services and displacing survivors from safe housing. They further contended that the executive branch unilaterally imposed these restrictions without congressional authorization, violating the separation of powers.\n\nIn addition, plaintiffs claimed the conditions were unconstitutionally vague, offering no clear guidance on prohibited conduct or enforcement standards, and thereby opening the door to arbitrary and discriminatory application. They also asserted that the rules violated the First Amendment by compelling grantees to endorse the Administration’s views on gender and chilling speech related to DEI. Finally, they argued that the restrictions conflicted with federal statutory mandates requiring services for “underserved” and “racial and ethnic minority” populations and were adopted without complying with the Administrative Procedure Act’s procedural requirements.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the new conditions were unlawful, as well as an order vacating and setting them aside, along with the defendants’ decision to include them in individual award programs. They also sought a stay of the conditions as applied in agency policies, funding opportunities, and grants, and requested preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the defendants from including or enforcing the conditions in any funding notices or awards.\n\nAlongside the complaint, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to block enforcement of the new conditions. They argued that immediate relief was necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the communities they serve, including the loss of housing and essential services. They reiterated that the conditions unlawfully compelled speech, threatened the stability of life-saving programs, and created confusion due to vague and unclear standards.\n\nA hearing on the motion for a temporary restraining order was held on July 24, 2025, and Judge DuBose granted the motion on July 28. 2025 WL 2104144. The court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed, at risk of immediate irreparable harm, and entitled to access their grant funding without the new HUD and HHS conditions after weighing the hardships and public interest. The temporary restraining order barred HUD from enforcing conditions related to gender ideology and elective abortions for Continuums of Care grants, and barred HHS and ACF from enforcing a condition requiring Family Violence Prevention and Services Act grant recipients to advance or promote DEI or related ideologies. The court declared these conditions null, void, and rescinded, and ordered defendants to take immediate compliance steps.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the challenged conditions. They specifically targeted HUD policies that barred grantees from using funds to promote “gender ideology,” as defined in Executive Order 14168; prohibited the use of funds for elective abortions under Executive Order 14182; and required certification that DEI-related activities would not violate federal antidiscrimination laws. They also challenged HHS policies requiring grantees to certify that they do not operate programs promoting DEI or “discriminatory equity ideology,” and to affirm compliance with Executive Order 14168 as a condition of Title IX funding.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Judge DuBose issued a revised TRO that clarified the scope of the earlier order and restated the specific prohibitions against HUD, HHS, and ACF in enforcing the challenged grant conditions. 2025 WL 2262896. Later that day, the court granted a third motion to amend the TRO, and the parties were instructed to appear for a virtual chambers conference on August 8. 2025 WL 2301661.\n\nA hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for September 4, 2025.",

    "summary/long": "In 2022, the Southern Education Foundation (SEF) was awarded a five-year, discretionary grant by the Department of Education (ED) to operate the Equity Assistance Center-South (EAC-South). This grant was terminated abruptly by President Trump’s Executive Order 14173, which directed the ED to terminate funding for programs that promote or take part in DEI initiatives. On April 9, 2025, represented by private counsel, the Southern Education Foundation filed this lawsuit against President Donald Trump, the ED, and the Secretary of Education in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman.\n\nThe SEF brought three separate claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA): that the grant termination was arbitrary and capricious, that the termination failed to comply with relevant rules, and that it failed to comport with Due Process Procedures. SEF also brought a Fifth Amendment claim, a First Amendment claim and a claim under VI of the Civil Rights Act. Lastly, the SEF brought an ultra vires claim, alleging that the grant termination exceeded the scope of the DOE’s authority.\n\nThe SEF requested that the court enjoin the Defendants from terminating SEF’s EAC-South grant award, from taking adverse action based on the original notice of grant termination, and from withholding any funds owed to SEF under the grant. SEF also sought reasonable attorney’s fees and declaratory relief, asking that the Court declare the grant termination unlawful.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, SEF moved for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order. The SEF claimed that it was likely to succeed on the merits, that the Defendants would face minimal harm, and that a preliminary injunction would serve the public interest by allowing SEF to continue desegregation efforts. Defendants opposed by challenging the court’s jurisdiction. First, the Defendant argued that SEF’s request for reinstatement agreement was a contract claim that belonged in the Court of Federal Claims. Secondly, Defendants argued that because SEF administratively appealed the Department’s termination decision, the grant termination was not a final agency action and could not be brought under the APA.\n\nOn May 16, 2025, while the motion for the temporary restraining order was pending, the SEF filed a consent motion to supplement the record. The SEF then filed an amended complaint with leave of the court that alleged it withdrew its administrative appeal before the Department. SEF further alleged that the Department remitted payment of the outstanding balance before the date of EAC-South’s grant termination.\n\nJudge Friedman granted the SEF's motion for a preliminary injunction on May 21, 2025. The court found that the plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits of all of its claims as there was no evidence introduced by the ED that would offer a reasonable explanation for the grant termination as a defense. Judge Friedman rejected the defendants’ claim that the SEF’s request for relief sounded in contract law. The court held that the Tucker Act did not require the plaintiff’s claims to be channeled through the Federal Court of Claims because SEF’s request that the court declare the termination unlawful sounded in the type of relief afforded under the APA. The Court also rejected the argument that the grant termination was not a final agency action as SEF had withdrawn its appeal, and found that the harms alleged by SEF were ripe for judicial review. Southern Education Foundation v. United States Dep. of Ed., F. Supp. 3d., 2025 WL 1453047 (D.D.C 2025).\n\nThe government appealed the preliminary injunction.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "On March 24, 2025, Yunseo Chung, a lawful permanent resident and undergraduate student at Columbia University, filed this complaint and petition for writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, challenging the government's retaliatory immigration enforcement actions against her in response to her participation in pro-Palestine campus protests. She sued President Trump and several high-ranking officials, including the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Acting Director of the New York ICE Office. The case was assigned to Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald.\n\nChung, who immigrated from South Korea at the age of seven and became a permanent resident in 2021, was arrested on March 5, 2025, for “obstruction of governmental administration\" during a student sit-in and protest at Columbia University related to the university’s disciplinary actions against other pro-Palestinian student activists. The complaint asserts that the federal government thereafter engaged in a series of unlawful actions to arrest, detain, and remove Chung from the United States. For example, she asserts that on March 10, 2025, a federal law enforcement official advised her counsel that her lawful permanent resident status was being \"revoked.\" Chung argued that this targeting is part of a broader pattern by the federal government of using immigration enforcement to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment.\n\nAccording to the complaint, DHS and ICE pursued Chung for removal because Secretary of State Marco Rubio determined that Chung's presence harms U.S. foreign policy interests. That determination, Chung contended, is made alongside a new Trump administration policy that permits the deportation of noncitizens who engage in protests if the Secretary of State determines that their presence harms U.S. foreign policy interests.\n\nChung argued that the defendants' actions violate the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and the Non-Delegation Doctrine. She sought the following relief: vacatur of the government's unlawful policy of targeting noncitizens for removal based on First Amended protected speech; vacatur of Secretary Rubio's determination that Chung's presence harms U.S. foreign policy interests; injunctions barring the defendants from detaining or removing Chung from the U.S. during these proceedings; and a declaration that the government’s actions toward Chung are unconstitutional and unlawful.\n\nOn March 25, Judge Buchwald issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the defendants from detaining or transferring Chung pending further proceedings. The court scheduled a hearing for May 20, 2025.\n\nOn April 10, Chung wrote a letter to the court requesting leave to conduct expedited discovery in support of her motion for a preliminary injunction. On April 11, 2025, the defendants moved to dismiss this action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim; they also opposed Chung's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn June 5, following a hearing, the court preliminarily enjoined the defendants from arresting or transferring the plaintiff, required 72 hours' notice before any non-removal-based detention to allow for First Amendment retaliation review, and waived the Rule 65(c) bond requirement. The court denied the government's motion to dismiss.\n\nOn July 8, 2025, Defendants filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the termination of a $6 million award under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to the Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools (Board). On February 14, 2025, the Department of Education (DOE), by and through its Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, issued a Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) threatening schools and colleges across the country with the loss of federal funding if these education institutions continued to pursue ambiguously defined \"DEI programs\" that \"teach students that certain racial groups bear unique moral burdens that others do not\" and/or \"stigmatize students who belong to racial groups.\" The Department of Education canceled the grants to the Board on April 29, 2025, announcing that the grants \"violate the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; conflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; undermine the well-being of the students these programs are intended to help; or constitute an inappropriate use of federal funds.\"\n\nThe Board sued on June 20, 2025, in the District Court for the District of New Mexico. The Board alleged that the termination of the grants violated the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause, violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and violated the Spending Clause. The Board also claimed that the termination was void for vagueness, was ultra vires, and was contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. The Board asked the court to declare the DOE's actions unlawful and to enjoin the DOE from terminating the grants.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge William P. Johnson. On June 23, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), or in the alternative, for a preliminary injunction barring the defendants from terminating the Board's grants.\n\nJudge Johnson denied the plaintiffs' motion on July 21 and dismissed the case without prejudice. The court first found that the plaintiffs' claims were, in essence, contract claims that belonged exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims. \"The non-continuation of Plaintiff’s grant funding is the type of contract claim that gives rise to Tucker Act jurisdiction.\" \"Rather than challenging a regulatory action with some monetary implications, Plaintiff seeks payment of 'the grant monies' it claims entitlement to,\" which is the essence of a contract claim.\n\nThe court also conducted a preliminary injunction analysis on the supposition that the case was not one that belonged exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims. The court held that the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims. On the First Amendment claim, the court ruled that \"discontinuation of grant money does not infringe on free speech because Defendants’ actions do not prohibit or compel private speech.\" Turning to the Due Process claim, the court said that the plaintiffs had \"not identified a protected property or liberty interest in a continuation of the grant funding (which is fatal to the void-for-vagueness due process claim).\"\n\nThe court also rejected the plaintiffs' Spending Clause claim, since under the statutory framework, the Secretary is required to determine whether the continuation of the grant is in the \"best interests of the Federal Government.\" The Secretary made that determination here, and the decision to terminate the plaintiffs' grant was within that discretion. This discretion also doomed the plaintiffs' ultra vires claim, since the defendants did not act outside of their authority. Finally, on the plaintiffs' APA claims, the court held that the defendants' decision on how to allocate a grant award \"seems like a quintessential decision committed to agency discretion by law,\" meaning that it would not be reviewable under the APA.\n\nBased on these findings, the court said that the plaintiffs could not succeed on their request for preliminary injunction, given that they were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims. Therefore, the court rejected the plaintiffs' request and, based on its holding that the claims were contractual in nature, dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the abrupt dismantling of the federal government's primary education research agency. On April 4, 2025, the Association for Education Finance and Policy, Inc. and the Institute for Higher Education Policy filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. They sued the U.S. Department of Education under various laws, primarily the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and raised constitutional concerns. Represented by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the plaintiffs sought a court order to stop the Department of Education's actions and to restore the functions of the research agency. They argued that the Department was acting illegally by shutting down the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), an agency created by Congress. This case was assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Congress established IES in 2002 to conduct and share high-quality research, statistics, and evaluations related to education from early childhood through postsecondary study. The plaintiffs, organizations that rely on IES research for their work in education finance, policy, and higher education access, claimed that the Department of Education took several actions that effectively halted IES's operations. These actions included the mass cancellation of contracts that supported IES research, the elimination of approximately 90% of IES staff positions, and the termination of remote access for outside researchers to existing data. The plaintiffs argued that these actions exceeded the authority of the Department, violated specific laws, and were made without proper reasoning.\n\nThe lawsuit outlined five legal claims:\n\n• The plaintiffs asserted a non-statutory claim arguing that the defendants' actions were ultra vires, meaning they went beyond their legal powers and encroached upon the authority of Congress, which created IES.   • They claimed that the defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by acting contrary to law, specifically the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 and the Higher Education Opportunity Act, which established IES and its responsibilities.   • The plaintiffs argued that the defendants' actions were arbitrary and capricious under the APA because they offered no reasoned explanation and failed to consider the impact on researchers and other stakeholders who rely on IES.   • They claimed a violation of the APA based on the Impoundment Control Act, alleging that the defendants unlawfully rescinded or deferred funds appropriated by Congress for IES.   • Lastly, the plaintiffs asserted a violation of the APA based on the Anti-Deficiency Act, arguing that the defendants illegally refused to spend funds Congress had allocated to IES.\n\nThe plaintiffs asked the court to declare the defendants' actions unlawful and to issue several orders. These included orders to restore the terminated contracts, vacate the reduction in force of IES employees, and reverse the termination of remote access to restricted-use data. They also requested the court to prevent the defendants from taking any further actions that would hinder IES's ability to perform its legally required tasks and sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to immediately stop the shutdown of IES. Additionally, they asked for their legal costs and attorney’s fees to be covered.\n\nSubsequently, on April 17, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, detailing the harm the plaintiffs and their members were already experiencing due to the lack of access to IES data and the cancellation of research programs.\n\nOn June 3, Judge McFadden denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the plaintiffs were \"improperly bundling together a series of actions for wholesale correction rather than challenging one 'circumscribed [and] discrete' action.\" Instead of bringing a challenge to a discrete and final agency action, the plaintiffs brought a “challenge [to] an entire program by simply identifying specific allegedly-improper final agency actions within that program.\" The court also rejected the plaintiffs' constitutional claims, finding that they were simply repackaged APA claims to the \"entire program.\" Since the plaintiffs' APA claims failed, so too did the constitutional claims. Therefore, the court found that the plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, which doomed their request for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1568301.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 18. The amended complaint challenged the termination of eight specific programs run by the Department of Education: (1) the termination of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study;  (2) the termination of the 2020/25 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study; (3) the termination of the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009; (4) the termination of the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 2022; (5) the termination of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten: 2024; (6) the termination of IES’s peer review program for new grant funding; (7) the termination of IES’s program for remote access to restricted-use data; and (8) the termination of processing applications for access to restricted-use data. The amended complaint added/removed factual allegations and causes of action under the APA to match the new focus of the complaint.\n\nOn July 2, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the court still lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' claims under the Tucker Act, and that the plaintiffs still were making a programmatic challenge, rather than a challenge to a discrete, final agency action as required by the APA.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on July 16. The second amended complaint removed the challenges to two of the terminations mentioned in the first amended complaint: the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study and IES's program for remote access to restricted-use data. The amended complaint also added more concrete allegations detailing how the remaining terminations caused harm to the plaintiffs and emphasized that the plaintiffs were challenging the final agency action of terminating the programs. Given the second amended complaint, the court denied as moot the defendants' motion to dismiss and ordered them to file a renewed motion by August 19.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenges President Trump’s March 2025 executive order titled, \"Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections\" (EO 14248). In relevant part, EO 14248 seeks to make several changes to the rules governing elections. First, it directs the Election Assistance Committee (EAC) to alter the federal voter registration form prescribed by Congress (\"Federal Form\") to require documentary proof of United States citizenship. Second, it directs the EAC to change the Federal Form to require a state or local official to record on the form the type of documentary proof of U.S. citizenship that the voter provided. Third, it directs the EAC to take appropriate action to cease providing federal funds to states that do not comply with federal voting requirements, including the proof of citizenship requirement. Fourth, it directs the EAC to amend the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) 2.0 to prohibit the use of barcodes or \"quick response\" (QR) codes to encode votes and to require voting systems to provide a voter-verifiable paper record. Fifth, it directs the U.S. Attorney General to take all necessary action to enforce the federal statutes that establish a uniform election day for federal elections against states that include absentee or mail-in ballots received after election day in the final tabulation of votes. Finally, the EO directs the Secretary of Defense to update the Federal Post Card Application to require voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship and proof of eligibility to vote in the relevant state election.\n\nOn March 31, 2025, three nonprofits filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Represented by counsel from the State Democracy Defenders Fund and the Campaign Legal Center, they named the Executive Office of the President, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and its director and commissioners, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Defense, the Federal Voting Assistance Program, and their agency heads as Defendants. On April 3, the case was consolidated with two other cases, Democratic National Committee et al. v. Trump et al., and League of Women Voters Education Fund et al. v. Trump et al. (linked below under Related Cases) that also challenged the EO. The plaintiffs in all three cases alleged that the President exceeded his constitutional powers by purporting to impose federal election rules on states in violation of the Separation of Powers, the Constitution's Electors and Elections Clauses, the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The court ordered this case to be the lead one, and all updates for the three cases are located here.\n\nAll three cases were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on March 31, 2025, and assigned to District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.  On April 24, 2025, she granted a preliminary injunction, barring operation of the Executive Order's Sections 2(a) and 2(d), which (a) order the Election Assistance Commission—a bipartisan, independent regulatory commission—to amend the standardized national voter registration form to require certain documentary proof of U.S. citizenship, and (b) order federal voter registration agencies to “assess” the citizenship of individuals who receive public assistance before providing them a voter registration form. Since \"[o]ur Constitution entrusts Congress and the States—not the President—with the authority to regulate federal elections,\" the court found that the defendants' actions here were beyond their authority. \"Consistent with that allocation of power, Congress is currently debating legislation that would effect many of the changes the President purports to order,\" but the ability to unilaterally order such changes does not lie with the President. 2025 WL 1187730.\n\nHowever, the court rejected (for now) the challenges to the other sections of the EO, stating with respect to some that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they were likely to succeed on the merits and that they had failed to demonstrate standing with regard to others. Therefore, the court declined to issue a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of Section 2(b), Section 7(a), and Section 7(b) of the EO.\n\nOn May 31, the defendants filed their answer to the complaint, arguing as affirmative defenses that the plaintiffs' claims were not ripe, that the plaintiffs lacked standing, and that the plaintiffs' claims were unreviewable under the APA. The Republican National Committee (RNC) moved to intervene on June 3, asserting \"interests in ensuring 'that only qualified voters vote and that unqualified voters do not dilute the votes cast by lawful voters,' in promoting 'efficient election administration,' and in protecting 'their voters’ confidence in elections by ensuring the accuracy and integrity of election outcomes.'\" After the parties briefed the motion, the court granted the motion in part on June 12, allowing the RNC to intervene to defend Sections 2(a), 2(b), 2(d), 3(a), and 7(a) of the EO. The court set a schedule for the case on June 20.\n\nOn July 11, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on Section 2(a) of the EO. Section 2(a) commands the EAC \"to amend the Federal Form to require that applicants provide one of the limited forms of citizenship documents the Executive Order specifies.\" Pointing to the court's earlier discussion of this section in its opinion granting a preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs argued that summary judgment on this portion of the EO was appropriate.\n\nDiscovery in the case is ongoing.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged a Washington state law, SB 5375, which required priests to report any suspected child abuse or neglect disclosed by penitents in confession. Confession is one of the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church and has been an integral part of its theology for two millennia. \"Eternal damnation\" and automatic excommunication from the Catholic Church await any priest who breaks the confidentiality of confession.\n\nWashington's three Catholic dioceses already mandated reporting for suspected child abuse and neglect, beyond the requirements of state law, with the sole exception of information learned exclusively via confession. Plaintiffs alleged the new state law violated the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Washington Constitution.\n\nRepresented by Wilmer Hale and the Becket Fund for religious liberty, plaintiffs, eleven Catholic archbishops and priests, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on May 29, 2025. The lawsuit named the Governor and Attorney General of the state of Washington and every County Prosecuting Attorney in the state as defendants. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the state law was unconstitutional, a preliminary and permanent injunction against the criminal investigation of Catholic priests under the law, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge David G. Estudillo.\n\nThe United States moved to intervene in this case as plaintiff on June 23, 2025. The court granted the motion to intervene on July 15, 2025, reserving for a later date its ruling on the scope of relief the United States was entitled to seek. The United States filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, separate from plaintiffs' earlier motion for the same, on June 25, 2025.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the court granted plaintiffs' (not the United States') motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that SB 5375 violated the Free Exercise Clause, as it burdened plaintiffs' exercise of their Catholic faith and because it modified existing law solely for clergy as opposed to secular mandated reporters. Further, the court found that the law failed strict scrutiny, as Washington could have followed the less restrictive example of 25 other states in making Catholic clergymen mandated reporters while excluding information learned solely from confession from reporting duties.\n\nThe court declined to reach plaintiffs' Church Autonomy Doctrine and Establishment Clause claims. Defendants were thus enjoined from enforcing SB 5375 as to the sacrament of confession across all three of Washington's Catholic dioceses. (Plaintiffs did not seek, and the court did not grant, injunctive relief to faiths other than Catholicism.)\n\nOn July 23, 2025, the United States withdrew its motion for a preliminary injunction without prejudice (thereby allowing it to refile the motion in the future if necessary). The United States acted upon express assurances by defendants that if the court granted preliminary relief to plaintiffs, which it did, defendants would not seek to enforce SB 5375 \"as [applied] to confession or sacred confidences shared with any clergy\" for the duration of preliminary relief.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the federal deployment of the California National Guard to protect federal property and immigration officials from protesters in Los Angeles and the surrounding area. On June 9, 2025, Governor Gavin Newsom and the State of California filed suit in the Northern District of North California, challenging recent actions by President Trump in deploying the National Guard in the Los Angeles area. On June 6, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers carried out multiple enforcement actions in and around Los Angeles, leading to the arrest of around 44 persons with 70-80 people detained. The same day as the arrests, crowds gathered at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles to protest the Trump Administration and its immigration agenda.  The complaint alleged that, while some protestors engaged in violence against property and law enforcement, the majority were peaceful and non-violent. Protests continued on June 7 and June 8.\n\nThe complaint alleged that Los Angeles police and sheriffs had responded to the protests and had dispersed several crowds at various places during the three days of protests. However, on the evening of June 7, despite a message on social media by Gavin Newsom stating that it was unnecessary, President Trump issued a memorandum that said because of \"numerous incidents of violence and disorder\" that had taken place in response to ICE actions, he was calling into service members of the National Guard. Under 10 U.S.C. § 12406, the President is allowed to call out the National Guard if one of three conditions is met: (1) the United States, or any of the Commonwealths or possessions, is invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; (2) there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States; or (3) the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\n\nCiting this statute, President Trump authorized the Secretary of Defense to (1) \"coordinate with the Governors of the States and the National Guard Bureau in identifying and ordering into Federal service the appropriate members and units of the National Guard under this authority,” (2) call out up to 2,000 National Guard personnel for up to 60 days, and (3) use them to perform protective activities for the protection of federal personnel and property.\n\nThat same evening, Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense, sent a memorandum to the Adjutant General of California, who commands the California National Guard under the Governor. Relying on President Trump's memo, and without the consent of the Governor, Secretary Hegseth called into service 2,000 members of the California National Guard for 60 days of service. Control of the Guard members was handed over to the General of the U.S. Northern Command, and the Guard began to arrive in Los Angeles on June 8. On June 9, Secretary Hegseth called into federal service another 2,000 Guard members, again without the consent of the California Governor.\n\nRepresented by the State's Attorney General, the plaintiffs sued President Trump, the Secretary of Defense, and the Department of Defense. The plaintiffs alleged that the President's and the agency's actions were ultra vires and exceeded the scope of their authority under 10 U.S.C. § 12406 and the Posse Comitatus Act. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants violated the Tenth Amendment and Article I, § 8 of the Constitution. Finally, the plaintiffs alleged that the agency's action violated the Administrative Procedure Act. Therefore, the plaintiffs asked the court to declare President Trump's memo, and both of Secretary Hegseth's orders relying on it, to be unlawful, to enjoin the Department of Defense from deploying the National Guard, and to award court costs.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Charles R. Breyer. On June 10, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), asking the court to maintain the status quo \"by temporarily enjoining Defendants from ordering or deploying the active-duty members of the military and federalized National Guard soldiers to patrol communities or otherwise engage in general law enforcement activities beyond the immediate vicinity of federal buildings or other federal real property.\" The court scheduled a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for June 12. After the hearing, the court issued a TRO ordering the defendants to return control of the California National Guard to the plaintiffs. The court first found that the case was justiciable and not a political question over which the courts have no oversight.\n\nTurning next to Section 12406, the court rejected the defendants' argument that there was a rebellion sufficient to sustain Section 12406, since \"violence is necessary for a rebellion, but it is not sufficient,\" and there is no evidence \"that any of the violent protestors were attempting to overthrow the government as a whole.\" The court also disagreed that Section 12406 is triggered \"when the President faces obstacles that cause him to underperform in executing the laws,\" or when \"the President faces some risk in executing the laws.\" Instead, the statute requires the President to be \"unable\" to execute the laws, and the court found that \"did not happen here.\" Finally, the court found that the defendants had failed to comply with the statute's procedural requirement that any orders federalizing state National Guard members be issued through the governor of the state. The court held that typing the phrase \"THROUGH: THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA\" at the top of the document sent to California's adjutant general was insufficient to meet the statute's requirement.\n\nThe court also agreed with the plaintiffs that the defendants had likely violated the Tenth Amendment, finding that, given its holding that the defendants had unlawfully mobilized the National Guard under Section 12406, \"the unlawful federalization of those members has interfered with the state's legitimate police power, and thus it violates the Tenth Amendment.\" Therefore, the court ordered the defendants to return control of the National Guard to Governor Newsom; however, the court stayed its order until noon the following day to provide the defendants with the opportunity to appeal.\n\nThe defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that same day, asking the court for an immediate administrative stay and for a stay pending appeal. Without explaining its reasoning, the court granted an immediate administrative stay the night of June 12. Having received briefing and heard oral argument on the defendants' motion for a stay pending appeal, the court granted the stay on June 19. While the court of appeals agreed with the district court that the case is judicially reviewable, the court stated that any review under Section 12406 should be \"highly deferential\" to any determination made by the President.\n\nApplying that standard of review, the court found that the defendants were likely to prevail on their argument under Section 12406's provision enabling the President to federalize the National Guard when he \"is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\" Contrary to the district court's holding, the court of appeals found that \"Section 12406 does not have as a prerequisite that the President be completely precluded from executing the relevant laws,\" nor does it require \"that activation is inappropriate so long as any continued execution of the laws is feasible.\" Here, the defendants presented sufficient evidence that was sufficient interference with federal agents to support the President's finding.\n\nAs to Section 12406's procedural requirement, the court found that it was likely met \"because the federalization order was issued through an agent of the Governor in the Governor's name.\" Since the order was sent to the adjutant general, who then relinquished command and forwarded the order to Governor Newsom, the court found the requirement satisfied. Given these findings, the court found that the defendants were likely to prevail on the merits, and therefore a stay was warranted. The court also ordered further briefing on the appeal to conclude, at the earliest, by August 19.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the district court, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on June 16. After the Ninth Circuit's ruling on June 19, the plaintiffs filed a supplement to their brief arguing that the district court retained jurisdiction over issues not currently on appeal, such as their arguments (not reached by the Ninth Circuit) that the defendants had violated the Posse Comitatus Act and that the deployment of the National Guard must be tied to, and last no longer than, the exigency claimed as support for the orders. The plaintiffs also requested the court to allow for discovery prior to ruling on their motion for a preliminary injunction. The court granted expedited discovery and set a trial on the merits for August 11-13, 2025.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

Plaintiffs sued under the Plaintiffs sued under the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the Tenth Amendment, the Spending Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Separation of Powers.The case was assigned to District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil.\n\nRepresented by Protect Democracy and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring the restoration of funding and prohibiting further unlawful actions, declaratory relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that conditioning billions of dollars in congressionally authorized federal funding on Columbia University’s regulation of campus speech and expression violated the First Amendment by coercing Columbia to suppress student and faculty speech, particularly expression supportive of Palestinian rights. The plaintiffs also raised a Fifth Amendment due process claim, asserting that the government failed to provide adequate notice or an opportunity to be heard before threatening severe financial penalties. They maintained that the lack of any formal adjudication or evidentiary process deprived Columbia and its community of basic procedural protections, particularly given the vagueness of the government’s expectations and the absence of a clear standard for compliance. In addition, the plaintiffs invoked the Tenth Amendment, arguing that the federal government exceeded its constitutional authority by attempting to control the internal operations of a private university, thereby encroaching on areas traditionally governed by state law and institutional autonomy.\n\nUnder the Spending Clause, the plaintiffs contended that the government’s threats were unlawful because the conditions imposed were not clearly stated, lacked a sufficient nexus to the purpose of the funding, and were unconstitutionally coercive. They emphasized that the conditions were applied retroactively, were unrelated to the underlying federal programs and left the university with no real choice but to acquiesce. The plaintiffs also asserted violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that the agencies involved lacked statutory authority for their actions and had bypassed necessary rulemaking procedures. They described the agencies’ actions as arbitrary and capricious, driven by political pressure rather than formal findings of discrimination. Finally, the plaintiffs raised a Separation of Powers concern, contending that the executive branch had unlawfully usurped powers reserved to Congress and the judiciary. They argued that the administration’s proposed remedy—placing academic departments into federal receivership—had no legal basis and reflected an improper attempt to impose sanctions through executive fiat.\n\nOn April 3, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. On June 16, 2025, Judge Vyskocil denied this motion and dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of standing. The court held that the plaintiff unions lacked standing because they could not demonstrate a concrete and particularized injury fairly traceable to the defendants’ alleged conduct. The court emphasized that Columbia University itself was not a party to the lawsuit. Without a direct plaintiff experiencing harm, the court concluded that the unions could not seek equitable relief such as reinstatement of funds or an injunction against the government. Additionally, the court found that the unions failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm necessary to justify preliminary relief. As a result, the case was dismissed without prejudice and administratively closed. That same day, the plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Second Circuit.\n\nThe appeal to the Second Circuit remains pending.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged Columbia University’s disclosure of student disciplinary records and compliance with federal government demands aimed at suppressing pro-Palestine speech and political advocacy on campus. On March 13, 2025, Columbia students Mahmoud Khalil and seven pseudonymous co-plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Columbia University, university trustees, and multiple federal government defendants, including the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and federal executive officials. The plaintiffs were represented by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Dratel & Lewis, and private counsel.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Arun Subramanian.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from events following the escalation of Israeli–Palestinian conflict starting in October 2023, which triggered widespread campus protests. In response, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce initiated an investigation into Columbia, characterizing pro-Palestine student speech as antisemitic. Starting February 12, 2024, the Committee began pressuring Columbia through multiple letters and subpoenas demanding student disciplinary records from protests, sit-ins, and other expressive activities. The Committee specifically targeted eleven expressive incidents, including the peaceful \"Hind’s House\" art exhibition and various campus protests critical of Israel. Plaintiffs alleged that these actions intended to intimidate Columbia into harshly disciplining pro-Palestine students and chilling campus speech critical of Israel.\n\nConcurrently, starting March 2025, multiple federal agencies, including the Department of Education, Department of Justice, and Department of Health and Human Services, threatened to terminate approximately $400 million in federal funding to Columbia. The agencies announced nine \"preconditions\" Columbia had to satisfy before funding negotiations could resume, including the imposition of a definition of antisemitism based on the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) standards, and requiring student protesters to identify themselves at all campus events. On March 21, Columbia formally adopted the government’s demands, including a viewpoint-specific antisemitism definition and a policy requiring protesters to identify themselves to campus authorities, sparking significant student and faculty backlash.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged violations of the First Amendment, privacy rights, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They argued that the Committee’s demands were illegitimate and retaliatory, unlawfully abridging protected speech and associational rights. Plaintiffs further claimed that the federal agencies’ threats to cut Columbia’s funding without adhering to Title VI statutory procedures constituted unlawful coercion and jawboning, violating both the APA and constitutional protections. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to halt Columbia’s disclosure of disciplinary records and enjoin Columbia’s further compliance with government demands, along with a declaratory judgment invalidating the new antisemitism definition and protest-identification policies.\n\nOn March 20, Judge Subramanian temporarily restrained Columbia from providing additional student records to Congress. However, on April 4, the court denied plaintiffs’ initial motion for preliminary injunction without prejudice, citing deficiencies in standing and traceability of harm. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a second amended complaint on April 18, addressing the court’s concerns and renewing their motion for preliminary injunction on June 20. They sought an order reversing Columbia’s new antisemitism definition, halting further disclosures, and restoring Columbia’s federal funding.\n\nOn May 14, Judge Subramanian approved a stipulated protective order limiting access to sensitive student information in the proceedings. Additionally, the Congressional defendants moved to dismiss on May 23, asserting immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause and lack of standing. On June 20, plaintiffs opposed the Congressional defendants’ motion to dismiss, arguing the investigation exceeded legitimate legislative purposes and unconstitutionally targeted protected speech. That motion remained pending.\n\nAs of July 2025, the case remained pending. Plaintiffs’ renewed motion for preliminary injunction and Congressional defendants’ motion to dismiss were awaiting decision.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged mass terminations and office shutdowns at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). On May 5, 2025, nineteen states and the District of Columbia filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and numerous related federal agencies and their agency heads. The states challenged layoffs that took place due to a March 27, 2025, directive that ordered a reduction in force of about 10,000 full-time employees. The directive also ordered the restructuring of HHS, shrinking the previous twenty-eight divisions down to fifteen. The layoffs took place on April 1.\n\nRepresented by their attorneys general, the states alleged that the dismantling of HHS left it incapable of performing its statutory functions in violation of the Separation of Powers, the Appropriations Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The states also alleged that the defendants' actions were ultra vires in excess of their statutory authority. The states requested a declaration that the layoffs were unlawful, injunctive relief preventing the defendants from implementing the March 27 directive, and court costs.\n\nOn May 9, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose, who held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary relief on May 22 and issued a preliminary injunction on July 1, 2025. 2025 WL 1803260. The court held that the states had standing to bring the lawsuit, that the claims were not subject to channeling pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act, that the Tucker Act did not require the states to bring their claims in the Court of Federal Claims, that the March 27 directive constituted a final agency action subject to review under the APA, and that the states had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims that the challenged actions were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, had shown irreparable harm absent relief, and that the balance of equities and public interest weighed in their favor.  Accordingly, the court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from \"taking any actions to implement or enforce the planned RIFs or sub-agency restructuring announced\" in the directive. Finally, the court also \"preemptively\" denied the defendants' request for a stay pending any appeal they might decide to file.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, the defendants moved to clarify the preliminary injunction and also argued that the injunction was overbroad given the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Casa Inc. v. Trump [../../../../case/45965/], which held that federal courts lacked the power to grant relief to parties outside of those involved in the case before them. On July 17, 2025, the defendants also filed a motion to vacate the preliminary injunction, or in the alternative, to stay it pending appeal. The defendants pointed to the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in New York v. McMahon [../../../../case/46217/], which allowed the government to proceed with a reduction-in-force at the Department of Education while litigation over the RIF continued. The defendants argued that \"[b]ecause the facts and legal issues in [McMahon] are so similar to those presented here, the stays signal that a majority of the Supreme Court would likely reach the same conclusion if asked to consider this case.\" Therefore, the defendants asked the court to vacate its preliminary injunction or to stay it while they appealed.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the court denied all the defendants' motions except the motion to clarify, announcing that \"without any actual changes to governing case law or binding First Circuit or Supreme Court precedent, this Court declines the Defendants’ invitation to short circuit that process.\" Rejecting the defendants' claims that the Supreme Court's stay in McMahon meant that the district court should vacate its preliminary injunction, the court stated that it \"w[ould] not interpret the Supreme Court’s shadow docket summary orders (issued without any reasoning or explanation) as definitive indications as to how either the Supreme Court or the First Circuit Court of Appeals might rule on a motion to stay or on the merits of this case.\"\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the court granted in part the defendants' motion to clarify the preliminary injunction and issued a revised injunction that named the specific sub-agencies and programs subject to the order. The next day, the defendants filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (USCA Case No. 25-1780) as well as an emergency motion in the appellate court to stay the injunction pending appeal.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

They alleged that the federal government's dismantling of AmeriCorps, an independent agency, violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Separation of Powers.\n\nOn May 6, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a Preliminary Injunction (PI). On June 5, the Court granted the motion in part, enjoining Defendants from enforcing the April 25, 2025, grant terminations and AmeriCorps program closures in the plaintiff states, and from implementing the April 15, 2025, removal of National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) members. It further ordered the reinstatement of willing NCCC members and directed the agency to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking before making substantial program changes.

    "summary/long": "On April 7, 2025, the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (AFSCME) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), a federal agency tasked with supporting library and museum services nationwide. The defendants include the Institute of Museum and Library Services and its Acting Director, President Trump, DOGE, and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget and its Director.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14238, titled “Continuing Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,\" and signed on March 14, 2025, which directed the Institute of Museum and Library Services and other federal agencies to eliminate all programs and terminate all staff not required by statute. After the EO was issued, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gutted the Institute of Museum and Library Services, terminating nearly all employees and canceling its grants. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant's actions violated the Separation of Powers, the Take Care Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the First Amendment. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the dismantling of IMLS, reinstate its grants and staff, restore agency functions and access to appropriated funds, and bar the defendants from dissolving IMLS absent Congress's authorization. The case is assigned to District Judge Richard J. Leon.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction; the court decided to consider a temporary restraining order first, while it consider the preliminary injunction request.  After a hearing on April 30, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order on May 1, finding:\n\n\"the wholesale termination of grants and services and the mass layoffs appear to violate the clear statutory mandates outlined in the MLSA [Museum and Library Services Act] See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 9103(a)(3) (The Director \"shall be appointed from among individuals who have special competence with regard to library and information services\" or \"special competence with regard to museum services\"); id. § 9108(a) (\"The Director shall regularly support and conduct, as appropriate, policy research, data collection, analysis and modeling, evaluation, and dissemination of information to extend and improve the Nation's museum, library, and information services.\"); id.§ 9131(b) (\"From the sums appropriated ... the Director shall award grants from minimum allotments [ of $680,000] . . . to each State.\"); id. § 9161 (\"[T]he Director shall award grants to Indian tribes and to organizations that primarily serve and represent Native Hawaiians.\"); id. § 9162(a) (\"[T]he Director shall establish and carry out a program to enhance the quality of library services nationwide and to provide coordination between libraries and museums .... \"). Moreover, defendants' conduct contravenes Congress's appropriation of almost $300 million to IMLS. Plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed in showing that defendants' actions to unilaterally shutter IMLS violate, at minimum, the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nMoreover, the court found that plaintiffs have provided evidence of significant and irreparable injury -- \"that the grant terminations, loss of access to IMLS expertise and services, and loss of access to IMLS data have forced libraries to end programs midstream, fire employees, and, in some cases, completely shutter.\"\n\nAccordingly, the court enjoined any further diminution of MLS's capacity while the preliminary injunction request was pending. On May 6, defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's TRO order, citing the D.C. Circuit's May 3 decision to stay an analogous order in a similar case, Widakuswara v. Lake. [../../../../case/46275/]\n\nThe following day, the court extended the TRO until May 29 to allow additional time for briefing and argument.\n\nOn May 21, the court noted that the D.C. Circuit's pending en banc review in Widakuswara involved issues directly relevant to this case. To avoid issuing a premature ruling on the PI, the court ordered the parties to indicate by May 23, 2025, whether they consented to extending the TRO pending resolution of the injunction motion. The parties submitted their respective responses, with defendants objecting to the extension and plaintiffs consenting to it. The TRO expired on May 29, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, plaintiffs filed a motion for a narrow TRO prohibiting defendants from further pausing, canceling, or otherwise terminating IMLS grants or contracts, or from withholding disbursement of funds in accordance with such grants or contracts. In the alternative, plaintiffs requested that the court rule on their motion for a PI within seven days.\n\nOn June 6, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for a PI, citing recent indications from the Supreme Court and Circuit Judges that actions seeking reinstatement of federal grants fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims rather than the district courts. It further ordered the parties to file a joint status report proposing next steps by June 13, 2025, and denied plaintiffs' June 2 motion as moot.\n\nThe parties filed a joint status report on June 13, outlining defendants' intention to file a motion to dismiss and plaintiffs' proposal to proceed with expedited summary judgment briefing.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged Florida's and the Trump Administration's construction of an immigration detention facility dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" in the Everglades. The facility was built in mere days, which plaintiffs alleged circumvented or ignored regulatory and environmental standards. Designed to hold up to 5,000 noncitizens at a time, the facility was located on the grounds of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Although the airport was located in Collier County, 36 miles west of Miami, it was owned by Miami-Dade County and operated by that county's aviation department. Miami-Dade County regulations limited the use of the site to aviation purposes. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stated that the facility's construction was requested, and would be fully bankrolled, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) using Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Plaintiffs alleged violations of: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); and Miami-Dade County Code.  They also alleged that defendants' actions were ultra vires (i.e., in excess of their legal authority to act).\n\nPlaintiffs were two Florida-based environmental nonprofits, Friends of the Everglades and Center for Biological Diversity. On June 27, 2025, they filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against DHS and its Secretary; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its Acting Director; the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director; and Miami-Dade County. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that defendants' actions were unlawful, an injunction against the continued construction and use of the facility for non-aviation purposes including immigration detention, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Jose E. Martinez. The same day, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction; they renewed that motion on July 17, 2025.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, Miami-Dade County filed its response. The County argued that the state of Florida had commandeered the airport under state emergency authority and that it could not use county law to restrain the state; additionally, the County contended that plaintiffs did not have a right of action to compel the County to enforce its own regulations. The same day, the Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management filed his response, arguing that plaintiffs' complaint alleged only violations of federal law which did not bind him and his state agency.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, DHS and ICE filed their response. The federal agencies argued that plaintiffs' case was likely to fail because it did not challenge a final agency action, and did not show that they would suffer an irreparable harm from the detention center's construction given Supreme Court precedent that NEPA violations do not give rise to a presumption of irreparable injury.\n\nOn July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida moved to intervene as a plaintiff in the case. The Tribe noted that Big Cypress National Preserve, which included the land co-opted to build the detention center, had traditionally been part of its home and that the center's continued construction and operation would accelerate the land's environmental degradation. The court granted the Tribe's motion to intervene on July 30, 2025.\n\nTwo days later, Judge Martinez recused himself from the case. The case was automatically reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.\n\nOn July 28, 2025, the court granted in part plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery. 2025 WL 2253243. Defendants were ordered to produce any agreements among themselves relating to Alligator Alcatraz. The next day, defendants filed a motion requesting limited reciprocal discovery from plaintiffs; that motion is still pending before the court.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, while a multi-day hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was ongoing, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' renewed motion for a limited temporary restraining order. First, it noted that it would withhold ruling on the defendants' venue challenge until the conclusion of the preliminary injunction hearing. It further rejected defendants' challenge to the court's jurisdiction, reasoning that because the plaintiffs did not seek to enjoin or restrain the operation of any immigration statute, the statute cited by the defendants to assert lack of jurisdiction was inapplicable.  As to the TRO, the court concluded that, at minimum, the federal defendants' legal control over the facility's operations, evidence that it was constructed at the request of DHS, and regular inspections of the site by ICE officials, as well as undisputed lack of prior environmental assessment under NEPA, created a sufficient likelihood of success of the merits of the APA claim to warrant preliminary relief. Citing minimal harm to the defendants from briefly suspending expansion of the facility and the difficulty of reversing course at a later date, the court entered a temporary restraining order that prohibited the state and federal defendants from installing any additional industrial-style lighting, doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing, or doing any other site expansion including placing or erecting buildings and other structures. The TRO was to last fourteen days from the date of the order or until the court entered an order on the preliminary injunction.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, after a hearing, the court granting in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 242325. First, it again found that it had jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claim, which neither challenged the fact nor the manner of detention or removal, nor sought to halt, suspend, or alter operation of any INA provision, nor otherwise challenged the defendants' authority to implement or enforce immigration laws (as would preclude jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. 1252).  Next, the court held that the defendants had waived challenge to venue in the Southern District of Florida by litigating the case on the merits for a month before raising venue issues.  Rejecting the venue argument on the merits, it reasoned that the NEPA claim did not involve \"real property\" within the meaning of the applicable venue statute and therefore that venue was proper in the Southern District as the home of plaintiff's principal place of business, and not required to lie in the Middle District of Florida, where the facility is located.  Moreover, a substantial portion of events that gave rise to the lawsuit took place within the Southern District, and some of the environmental concerns relevant to the NEPA claim would also affect the Southern District. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs met the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction. As to a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiffs' NEPA claims, the court noted that the defendants did not dispute the \"major\" environmental effects that would justify the need for an environmental impact statement or assessment.  Moreover, the decision to construct the detention camp without issuing an impact statement or conducting an assessment was a definitive position that caused actual, concrete injury to the plaintiffs' recreational and conservational interests, and therefore constituted a final agency action. In addition, evidence the federal defendants requested that the facility be built and committed federal funding precluded them from disclaiming involvement or responsibility under NEPA.  The environmental risks posed by the facility threatened irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, and the balance of equities and the public interest similarly favored granting the preliminary injunction.\n\nTherefore, the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional industrial-style lighting (so-called “Sunbelt” lighting); or doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential or administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time the order went into effect. The preliminary injunction did not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities that were made for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site. It further ordered that after no more than sixty days, and once population attrition allowed for safe implementation, the defendants were to remove 1) the temporary fencing in order to allow tribe members access to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the facility was built; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed for this project.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, appealing the district court's preliminary injunction ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On August 23, 2025, the defendants filed a district court motion to stay the injunction pending appeal and, on August 26, 2025, they filed a similar motion in the appellate court.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

On April 11, 2025, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), its Harvard Faculty Chapter (AAUP–Harvard), and the United Auto Workers (UAW) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Education (ED), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and other federal agencies and officials. The plaintiffs were represented by Selendy Gay PLLC and Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Allison D. Burroughs.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that beginning in March 2025, the administration used Title VI enforcement powers and federal grant authority to compel Harvard to restructure its internal operations in ways that violated academic freedom and chilled speech on matters related to Israel and antisemitism. On March 31, the DOJ announced a review of Harvard’s civil rights compliance. In letters dated April 3 and April 11, multiple agencies demanded that Harvard implement sweeping governance and curricular changes as conditions for continued funding. When Harvard refused, agencies began canceling grants and contracts, ultimately affecting over $9 billion in research funding. Plaintiffs claimed these actions violated the First and Fifth Amendments, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nPlaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 11, and then for summary judgment on June 2. They sought a declaration that the agencies’ actions were unlawful and a permanent injunction prohibiting any further funding terminations or conditions that infringed constitutional rights or bypassed statutory procedures. The government opposed the motions and cross-moved for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiffs lacked standing and that the agency actions were lawful exercises of grant authority under 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). The government further asserted that no final agency action had occurred and that plaintiffs could not enforce Harvard’s contractual rights. Plaintiffs withdrew their TRO motion on April 15, citing changed circumstances and reserving the right to seek other preliminary relief.\n\nSeveral amici filed briefs in support of plaintiffs. Public Citizen argued that the administration’s actions targeted protected speech and undermined university autonomy. A Jewish Voice for Peace challenged the administration’s definition of antisemitism, warning that it blurred religious and political categories in violation of the Establishment Clause. Other briefs emphasized the broader impact on research, student expression, and economic innovation.\n\nA hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment was scheduled for July 21, 2025. As of mid-July 2025, no ruling had issued.\n\nA related case—President and Fellows of Harvard College v. U.S. Department of Justice [../../../../case/46442/]—was filed separately by Harvard University itself. The case remains ongoing as of July 16, 2025.",

On May 21, 2025, five nonprofits filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and the Office of Justice Programs and its acting head. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions exceeded their executive authority and violated the Due Process Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Amit Mehta.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in April 2025, defendants abruptly terminated more than 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants awarding more than $820 million in essential funding to the plaintiffs and other nonprofits. The terminated cooperative agreements and grants cut across a broad array of critical programs, including violence reduction and intervention, policing and prosecution, victims' services, juvenile justice and child protection, substance use and mental health treatment, and other public safety programs. Also on May 21, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, and on May 22, a motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nPlaintiffs sought both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to stop defendants from implementing their mass termination of the cooperative agreements and to restore or preserve funding for affected grantees while the case proceeded. They also sought declaratory relief, asking the court to declare that defendants’ actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act because they were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and failed to follow required procedures. Finally, plaintiffs requested an award of attorneys’ fees and litigation costs.\n\nOn June 6, 2025, a coalition of 33 amici curiae, including several local governments, filed a brief supporting plaintiffs’ motion. The brief highlighted the critical importance of the terminated grants for public safety, victim services, and violence-reduction initiatives. In their response, defendants dismissed the amici curiae brief as irrelevant, arguing that the dispute concerned routine contract administration rather than a broad, unlawful policy change, and therefore did not warrant extraordinary judicial intervention.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and to deny plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. defendants argued that the court lacked jurisdiction and that plaintiffs’ claims were likely to fail on the merits. Additionally, defendants contended that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. Later that day, plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief addressing a recent Supreme Court decision (Dep’t of Education v. California), which defendants had cited to argue that district courts lack jurisdiction to order payment of federal grant funds. plaintiffs argued that other forms of relief—such as reinstating grants—remained available.\n\nOn June 26, 2025, the court held a hearing on all pending motions, including the motions for class certification and a preliminary injunction, as well as the government’s motion to dismiss. Then, on July 7, 2025, the district court granted the government’s motion and dismissed the case. 2025 WL 1865160. Judge Mehta held that plaintiffs lacked a valid cause of action to compel reinstatement of federal funding under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThere is no doubt in the court’s mind that OJP’s award terminations were unfair and indiscriminate. When a government agency, especially the Department of Justice, agrees to fund private organizations to carry out a public purpose, such organizations expect regularity and respectful treatment. That is not what occurred here. The court laments that the limits of its own power prevent it from helping plaintiffs and similarly situated grantees. But the court cannot cure an injustice by exceeding its own authority.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed the district court’s July 7 decision to the D.C. Circuit on July 8, 2025 and filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal on July 11.\n\nPlaintiffs similarly sought an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal in the district court on July 10, 2025, arguing that, despite the dismissal, the district court’s memorandum opinion indicated that all factors supporting injunctive relief were present. Plaintiffs asserted that the grant terminations had already caused, and would continue to cause, severe irreparable harm, including layoffs of specialized staff, elimination of critical programs, and damage to organizational reputations. They provided specific examples of harm, such as increased homicides in King County, Washington, following the layoffs of gang outreach specialists; FORCE Detroit’s inability to intervene in gun violence; HRiA’s loss of resources for violence interruption efforts during the summer; and Stop AAPI Hate’s accelerated layoffs and program cuts amid rising threats against Asian-Americans. plaintiffs noted that the district court itself had concluded that defendants’ actions were “likely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence.”\n\nPlaintiffs also argued that both the public interest and the balance of equities strongly supported injunctive relief. They noted that the district court itself had described defendants’ abrupt and unexplained termination of the grants as “unquestionably arbitrary,” “shameful,” and “unfair and indiscriminate.” plaintiffs further emphasized that serious legal questions remained. They pointed out that the court’s own opinion suggested their Administrative Procedure Act claims were likely meritorious, having found defendants’ actions “arbitrary, at least in lay terms” and “indiscriminate.” Although the district court denied preliminary relief based on a perceived lack of jurisdiction, it acknowledged that its conclusion was “far from obvious” and that other district courts within the Circuit had interpreted the controlling Supreme Court decision (California III) differently, highlighting a substantial question warranting injunctive relief pending appeal. Finally, plaintiffs asked the court to waive any bond requirement, arguing that a bond would impede access to judicial review and further harm organizations already suffering from the funding cuts.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the district court denied the plaintiffs’ emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal but granted a narrower, stipulated injunction. The court found that plaintiffs had not met the high bar for such an “extraordinary remedy,” emphasizing that this was not a “rare” case warranting that relief. It concluded the threat of irreparable harm was not “so grave” as to justify an affirmative injunction, noting no plaintiff claimed they would be forced to close without the funding. The court also observed that plaintiffs had not addressed the jurisdictional ruling in depth and cited no case granting an injunction pending appeal after dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. However, because the parties agreed to a more limited injunction, the court barred defendants from re-obligating or diminishing the terminated grant funds. It declined to require an injunction bond, reasoning that the order did not compel any public expenditures the government might be unable to recover.\n\nIn the appellate court, on August 1, 2025, the D.C. Circuit denied the plaintiffs' emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, stating that the appellants did not satisfy the stringent requirements for such an injunction. Specifically, the court found that the appellants had not substantiated their claims of irreparable harm.\n\nThe case remains ongoing in the district court and the D.C. Circuit.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the constitutionality of an executive order (EO) that targeted a private law firm for its client representation and public positions. On April 11, 2025, Susman Godfrey LLP filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Executive Office of the President, the Department of Justice, the Office of Management and Budget, and other federal agencies and officials. Represented by Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP, the firm sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that Executive Order 14263—entitled “Addressing Risks from Susman Godfrey”—violated the First and Fifth Amendments and the Constitutional principle of separation of powers. The EO imposed restrictions on Susman’s access to federal buildings and contracts, threatened its security clearances, and directed agencies to sever relationships with the firm and its clients.\n\nThis case was assigned to Judge Loren L. AliKhan.\n\nOn April 15, the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining implementation of Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the order, which included the factual findings against the plaintiff, the contract-related provisions, and access restrictions. 2025 WL 1113408. The parties then agreed to extend the TRO until final judgment.\n\nThe case proceeded on an expedited schedule. The plaintiff moved for summary judgment (SJ) on April 23, supported by dozens of amicus briefs from legal ethics professors, bar associations, law student organizations, and current and former judges, scholars, and corporate counsel. The government moved to dismiss, arguing lack of standing, sovereign immunity, and failure to state a claim.\n\nOn May 12, the plaintiff amended its complaint to add additional federal agencies affected by the order. Pursuant to a streamlined procedure approved by the court, the parties refiled their dispositive motions without additional briefing.\n\nOn June 27, the court denied the government’s motion to dismiss and granted Susman’s motion for summary judgment. 2025 WL 1779830. The court held that Executive Order 14263 violated multiple constitutional provisions, including the First Amendment’s prohibitions on viewpoint discrimination and retaliation, the Fifth Amendment’s guarantees of due process, equal protection, and right to counsel, and the separation of powers. The court found the order impermissibly punished Susman for representing politically disfavored clients and engaging in protected expression. The court emphasized that Susman’s reputation, business, and client relationships had been harmed by an unlawful attempt to coerce and chill disfavored legal advocacy.\n\nThe court declared the executive order null and void, and entered a permanent injunction (PI) barring the federal government from enforcing, referencing, or giving effect to any part of it. The injunction required rescission of all related guidance, restoration of revoked security clearances, cessation of any related investigations, and notification of all affected agencies and personnel.\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the court issued a clarification, in response to the defendants' unopposed motion to clarify, that the injunctive relief granted as to Section 4 of Executive Order was to run \"only in favor of Plaintiff Susman Godfrey LLP (including its affiliates, predecessors, successors, assigns, directors, officers, partners, employees, and agents).\"\n\nOn August 23, 2025, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  The case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the allegedly unlawful takeover of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), an independent nonprofit created by Congress.\n\nOn Feb. 19, 2025, an executive order issued by President Trump—Executive Order 14217, “Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy” (Feb. 19, 2025)—designated USIP as a federal entity subject to dissolution. On March 14, 2025, the White House allegedly notified certain board members of their termination. On March 17, 2025, government agents, including personnel from the U.S. DOGE Service, entered USIP headquarters, expelled its leadership, and attempted to take control of its infrastructure. The administration purported to install Kenneth Jackson as acting president.\n\nThe next day, USIP and five of its board members filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, multiple high-ranking officials, and DOGE. This case was assigned to Judge Beryl A. Howell.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the executive order and subsequent actions were unlawful. Plaintiffs argued that the executive order overstepped the President’s authority by attempting to dismantle an independent nonprofit entity created by Congress, thereby violating the separation of powers. They claimed that the removal of board members violated the United States Institute of Peace Act (22 U.S.C. § 4601 et seq.), which required congressional involvement for such removals. The lawsuit further asserted that the government’s attempt to install new leadership at USIP was beyond its lawful authority. Plaintiffs also claimed that government officials unlawfully entered USIP’s headquarters, seized control of offices, and attempted to access sensitive data, amounting to trespass and property rights violations.\n\nIn their request for relief, the plaintiffs sought a court order preventing the government from removing USIP board members without complying with statutory procedures. They also requested a declaration that the executive order was unlawful as it applied to USIP. Additionally, they asked for an injunction preventing further government trespass or interference with USIP’s operations and property. Finally, they sought restoration of USIP leadership, recognizing George Moose as the rightful USIP president.\n\nOn March 19, 2025, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order. On March 24, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which added several plaintiffs and an additional defendant. It also added a claim under the administrative procedure act involving arbitrary and capricious actions, and added an ejectment claim. Plaintiffs filed an amended motion for summary judgment on April 5, 2025, in which they sought summary judgment on all claims, declaratory relief confirming the unlawfulness of the Board removals, and an injunction to restore USIP’s leadership and assets. On April 11, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.\n\nOn May 19, 2025, Judge Howell granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, and denied it for the defendants; she held that the Trump administration exceeded its authority when it dismantled the Institute, because it was not part of the executive branch:\n\nThe President’s efforts here to take over an organization outside of those bounds, contrary to statute established by Congress and by acts of force and threat using local and federal law enforcement officers, represented a gross usurpation of power and a way of conducting government affairs that unnecessarily traumatized the committed leadership and employees of USIP, who deserved better. . .\n\nAccordingly, change in Institute leadership was unlawful and subsequent actions were “effectuated by illegitimately-installed leaders who lacked legal authority to take these actions, which must therefore be declared null and void.”\n\nOn May 21, defendants filed a motion to stay the district court's order pending appeal, which the court denied on May 23. Defendants subsequently appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That same day, they filed an emergency motion in the Court of Appeals to stay the lower court's order.\n\nOn June 27, the Court of Appeals granted the stay, finding that the government was likely to prevail on its argument that the Board's removal protections were unlawful because the Institute exercises substantial executive authority, and that the President would suffer irreparable harm by being unable to fully exercise his executive powers.\n\nTwo days later, Plaintiffs filed an emergency petition for rehearing en banc and requested an emergency administrative stay of the June 27 order staying the District Court's judgment. On July 24, the Court denied the petition for rehearing en banc.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the freezing of federal grant funds meant for green infrastructure projects. Plaintiffs, the Climate United Fund, a non profit financial institution, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs named Citibank, N.A., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the EPA Administrator as the defendants. Climate United sought injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming that the defendants unlawfully blocked access to grant funds that had already been awarded and disbursed.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan.\n\nThe dispute stemmed from the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), a program under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), which Congress established through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Climate United was selected as a grantee in April 2024, receiving $6.97 billion in funding to support clean energy projects across the United States, particularly in low-income, rural, and tribal communities. Under the terms of the grant, Climate United’s funds were held at Citibank, which served as a financial agent under an Account Control Agreement (ACA) executed with the EPA.\n\nProblems began in early 2025 after the EPA administrator publicly expressed opposition to the GGRF, calling it \"criminal\" and vowing to recover the funds. On February 18, 2025, Climate United submitted a routine request to withdraw funds from its Citibank account. However, Citibank refused to process the transaction, citing the need for further guidance from the EPA. Despite multiple follow-ups, Citibank continued to deny access to the funds, even though the EPA had not legally exercised its right to take exclusive control of the accounts.\n\nIn its complaint filed on March 8, 2025 (and subsequent amended complaint on March 17), Climate United claimed that Citibank breached its contractual obligations under the ACA by refusing to disburse funds. The lawsuit further accused Citibank of conversion and wrongful withholding of funds. Against the EPA and its Administrator, Climate United alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing that the agency had suspended or terminated the grant without following legal procedures, that it violated the Inflation Reduction Act, and that its actions were arbitrary and capricious. The complaint also included a constitutional claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, asserting that the EPA had deprived Climate United of a protected property interest without legal justification. Further, the plaintiffs argued defendants violated the Appropriations Clause by re-obligating funds appropriated by Congress. Climate United sought a court order requiring Citibank to release the frozen funds, an injunction preventing the EPA from interfering with grant disbursements, and declaratory relief confirming that the EPA’s actions were unlawful.\n\nOn March 10, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) asking the Court to order defendant Citibank to comply with its contractual obligations under the ACA, including disbursement of NCIF grant funds. In addition, the TRO requested the Court to order the EPA to stop impeding Citibank from complying with its contractual obligations. Citibank opposed the TRO motion, claiming the plaintiffs failed to show they were likely to succeed on the merits because “Citibank has lawfully followed instructions received from the United States Government under its Financial Agency Agreement and therefore has fully complied with its contractual obligations to Treasury, EPA, and Climate United.” The EPA opposed the TRO motion, claiming the plaintiff's TRO request was moot because the Grant was terminated on March 11, 2025, ending the plaintiff’s performance and right to request disbursement of funds—among other claims.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, Judge Chutkan granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs' TRO. This order enjoined the EPA and Citibank from giving effect to the EPA termination letter, from transmitting or taking action to implement the termination of plaintiffs’ grants, and from moving or transferring the grant funds to any party other than the account holders.\n\nOn March 25, Judge Chutkan ordered this case consolidated with California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank v. Citibank [../../../../case/46247/] (1:25-cv-00820); Coalition for Green Capital v. Citibank [../../../../case/46215/], N.A. (1:25-cv-00735); Power Forward Communities, Inc. v. Citibank [../../../../case/46257/] (1:25-cv-00762). This case was designated as the lead case, and all further filings in this case were directed to be filed here.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the EPA from (1) “effectuating EPA’s March 11, 2025 “Notice of Termination” as to each Plaintiff”; (2) “unlawfully suspending or terminating Plaintiffs’ grant awards, including by issuing a Notice of Exclusive Control, effectuating the Notice of Termination, or limiting access to funds in accounts established in connection with Plaintiffs’ grants, including funds in accounts established by Plaintiffs’ subgrantees, except as permitted in accordance with the applicable Account Control Agreement (“ACA”) with Citibank, the grant awards, and applicable law”; or (3) “directly or indirectly impeding Citibank or causing Citibank to deny, obstruct, delay, or otherwise limit access to funds in accounts established in connection with Plaintiffs’ grants.” The motion further requested the Court to enjoin Citibank from (1) violating its obligations under the ACA, or (2) transferring or moving funds out of accounts established in connection with the plaintiffs’ grants.\n\nOn March 26, defendants filed their response in opposition to the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. Citibank claimed it did not violate its contractual obligations to the plaintiffs, and the federal defendants argued their actions were not in violation of statutory or constitutional law.\n\nOn March 28, plaintiffs filed to extend the TRO by fourteen days to allow the Court time to decide on the preliminary injunction motion. The Court granted the request on March 31, but only extended the TRO by seven days. On April 8, the court extended the TRO again until April 15. The Preliminary Injunction was granted on April 15, enjoining the defendants from effectuating the termination letter, terminating grant funds, transferring funds out of accounts, and ordered them to disperse all funds to the plaintiffs.\n\nOn April 15, defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the proceedings pending an appeal \"[b]ecause the government would face immediate irreparable injury through the disbursement of approximately $625 million, and potentially up to $14 billion, in taxpayer funds to external accounts that would be unrecoverable if this Court granted the injunctive relief Plaintiffs have requested.\" Plaintiffs filed their response in opposition to this motion on the same day. They argued, \"EPA’s contingent emergency motion does not add anything of substance to the briefing already before this Court.  EPA offers no new arguments on the merits, nor any justification that would entitle it to the “extraordinary remedy” of a stay pending appeal.  If the Court issues a preliminary injunction, EPA may appeal that order in the ordinary course, as is its right, but there is no reason for this Court to stay its own order pending that appeal. \"The court denied the motion to stay on April 15.\n\nOn April 15, this case was consolidated with Climate Justice Fund v. Environmental Protection Agency [../../../../case/46320/] (25-cv-00938-TSC) and Inclusiv, INC, v. Environmental Protection Agency [../../../../case/46324/] (25-cv-00948-TSC).\n\nIn the district court, plaintiffs filed a motion to clarify the preliminary injunction order on April 17, which the court granted April 19. The court again clarified that Defendant Citibank must disburse any funds properly incurred since the mid-February suspension of plaintiffs’ funds.\n\nOn April 16, the federal defendants appealed the preliminary injunction order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (25-5122). Citibank filed a separate appeal of the order on April 17 (25-5123); both appeals were consolidated under 25-5122. The Court of Appeals administratively stayed the preliminary injunction order on April 16 to allow itself time to review the case and instructed parties to file briefing on whether a longer stay pending the resolution of the appeal was necessary. The court of appeals stayed the preliminary injunction order requiring disbursement, but denied a stay with respect to the part of the order that required Citibank to hold on to the money and not return it to the government.  That is, the court of appeals froze the status quo.\n\nOral argument was held on May 19, 2025. On June 6, 2025, EPA filed a letter with the court expressing concern that plaintiffs interpreted the stay as set to dissolve automatically upon the appellate decision. EPA requested clarification or extension of the stay to avoid irreversible disbursement of funds pending further proceedings. On June 9, the court denied a pro se motion to intervene. On July 8, the rejected movant filed a pro se petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. As of July 2025, the D.C. Circuit had not yet ruled on the merits, and disbursement remained stayed.\n\nThe appeal remains pending.",

    "summary/long": "This lawsuit challenged three executive orders issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, which significantly altered federal policies on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) programs and transgender rights. On February 19, 2025, the National Urban League (NUL), the National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), and the AIDS Foundation of Chicago (AFC) filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. They named as defendants: President Trump, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Institutes of Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Administration for Community Living, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Justice, and their corresponding agency heads. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, arguing these executive orders violated the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nThe lawsuit challenged three executive orders. First, Executive Order 14151, titled “Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs and Preferencing” (Jan. 20, 2025), which terminated all federal DEIA programs, positions, grants, and contracts. Second, Executive Order 14168 titled “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” (Jan. 20, 2025), which eliminated federal recognition of transgender identities and barred agencies from funding “gender ideology.” Third, Executive Order 14173 titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” (Jan. 21, 2025), which banned federal contractors and grantees from using DEIA programs and imposed penalties for noncompliance.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued these executive orders were in violation of the First Amendment for (1) chilling the plaintiffs’ speech, (2) imposing an unconstitutional restriction on speech, (3) content and viewpoint discrimination, and (4) impermissibly conditioning funding on the relinquishment of plaintiffs’ free speech rights. They also argued the orders violated the Fifth Amendment for being impermissibly vague, thereby allowing for discriminatory and arbitrary enforcement, and denying people adequate notice as to what speech and activities were prohibited. They also argued the orders violated Equal Protection under the Fifth Amendment for discrimination on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and transgender status. Finally, they argued the orders violated the Administrative Procedure Act for being arbitrary, capricious, and exceeding executive authority. Plaintiffs requested a declaration that the executive orders were unlawful, unconstitutional, and invalid. They also sought a permanent injunction against the enforcement and implementation of the orders, as well as requiring the defendants to rescind all agency-wide directives implementing the orders.\n\nOn the same day they filed the complaint, plaintiffs filed a motion for notice of designation of related civil cases pending, arguing that National Council of Nonprofits, et al. v. Office of Management and Budget [../../../../case/45977/#:~:text=This%20case%20challenged%20the%20Trump%20Administration%27s%20authority%20to,ensure%20that%20the%20spending%20accords%20with%20Administration%20priorities.], (2025) shared similar operative facts and legal theories as this case. On February 21, Judge AliKhan denied plaintiffs’ motion for notice of designation of related civil cases, and ordered the case to be reassigned–leading to the appointment of Judge Kelly over the proceedings.\n\nA motion to intervene as a defendant in the case was filed on March 5 by DO NO HARM, a nonprofit dedicated to \"promoting controversial programs concerning race and gender.\" They claimed plaintiffs' challenge to the EOs directly threatened their mission. The court denied their request to intervene on March 12.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on February 28, requesting that defendants be prohibited from \"enforcing and implementing key provisions of Executive Order Nos. 14151, 14168, and 141734.\" The defendants' opposition, filed March 12, argued that (1) the plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claim failed on the merits because the void-for-vagueness doctrine did not apply where \"the President direct[ed] his own subordinates with respect to policy and enforcement priorities;\" and (2) the First Amendment claim failed because the plaintiffs did not properly establish that the orders “prohibit[ed] a substantial amount of protected speech relative to [their] plainly legitimate sweep,” so as to be facial unconstitutional.\n\nAfter a hearing on March 19, the court rejected the preliminary injunction on May 2, 2025, writing:\n\nFor half the challenged provisions, Plaintiffs fail to establish a prerequisite to success on the merits: standing.  Presidential directives to subordinates that inflict no concrete harm on private parties—or at least not on these parties— do not present a justiciable case or controversy.  And for the remaining provisions, Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims falter for various reasons.  Two throughlines explain most of them.  The government need not subsidize the exercise of constitutional rights to avoid infringing them, and the Constitution does not provide a right to violate federal antidiscrimination law.  And those pressure points are even harder to overcome for Plaintiffs, who bring facial rather than as-applied challenges.\n\nThe court reserved judgment on the merits of any as-applied challenges to specific enforcement actions the government might initiate. On May 20, the parties filed a joint motion proposing a schedule for the case going forward. The first deadline was on June 27, when the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint. The amended complaint removed a plaintiff, the National Fair Housing Alliance, and any related factual and legal allegations. The amended complaint added additional details regarding more examples of harm and chilling effects resulting from the defendants' actions. These allegations were intended to support the plaintiffs' First Amendment claims. Finally, the amended complaint removed the plaintiffs' claims under the APA, leaving only their First and Fifth Amendment claims.\n\nThe court ordered the defendants to file a response to the amended complaint by August 8.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the Trump Administration's attempt to shrink the workforce in several federal agencies. On February 12, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union; National Federation of Federal Employees, AFL-CIO; International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO; International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO; and International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint was filed against President Donald Trump and the acting heads of nine federal agencies and departments–the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Department of Treasury, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the U.S. Forest Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged the defendants' attempt to fire hundreds of thousands of employees (those considered \"nonessential\" for purposes of a government shutdown and those on probationary status), and the \"deferred resignation program\" that pressured federal workers to quit their jobs. The plaintiffs alleged that these actions violated the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act. Each plaintiff was represented by their general counsel and private counsel and sought declaratory and injunctive relief and court costs.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Christopher Cooper. On February 14, the plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order, claiming that the TRO was necessary since mass firings were taking place that would cause great harm to the plaintiffs' membership and dues. The plaintiffs requested the court to enjoin President Trump's Executive Order directing the firing of nonessential employees and the mass firings taking place in various agencies. The court denied emergency relief on February 20, explaining that under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (“FSLMRS”), the unions were required to pursue their challenges first in an administrative review process run by the Federal Labor Relations Authority (“FLRA”), with judicial review in the courts of appeals. 2025 WL 561080.\n\nOn May 15, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The defendants argued that under the court's analysis of the plaintiffs' motion for a TRO, the court also lacked jurisdiction over the entirety of the case. On May 27, the plaintiffs requested leave to amend their complaint, while the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America voluntarily dismissed all of its claims. Judge Cooper instructed the government to reply to the plaintiffs' motion to amend by June 4.\n\nThe court granted the plaintiffs' motion to amend, and the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 6. The complaint changed the defendants in the case, which now encompass President Trump and the heads of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the U.S. Forest Service, the Department of Veteran's Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Department of the Interior, along with the Director of the Goddard Space Flight Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nThe complaint also updated and expanded on the plaintiffs' causes of action. In addition to their separation of powers and APA claims against all the defendant agencies, the plaintiffs also claimed that the attempts to force resignations at the IRS were ultra vires under the Inflation Reduction Act and added additional APA claims against OPM and OMB for their implementation of the executive order.\n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' amended complaint on July 11.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the Trump Administration's authority to suspend nearly all congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance funding and dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). On February 11, 2025, the Global Health Council and several non-profit organizations filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, the U.S. State Department of State, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and USAID. The plaintiffs sued under the Administrative Procedure Act and Ex Parte Young. Represented by private counsel, Plaintiffs alleged that a January 20, 2025 Executive Order (EO) calling for the suspension of foreign aid funding and subsequent implementation guidance from the State Department, USAID, and OMB terminating existing foreign aid obligations violated the Administrative Procedure Act and Separation of Powers. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary and permanent injunction, declaratory relief, and attorney’s fees. The case was assigned to Judge Amir H. Ali.\n\nOn the same day Plaintiffs filed the complaint, they also filed a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and a Preliminary Injunction (PI).\n\nOn February 11, Judge Ali related this case to AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. U.S. Department of State [../../../../case/46099/], which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 10.\n\nOn February 12, 2025, Judge Ali held a telephonic hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion. The next day, the Court issued a TRO prohibiting the State Department, USAID, and OMB from pausing disbursement of congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance funds on contracts that were in place as of January 19, 2025.\n\nThe Court ordered Defendants to submit a status report detailing their compliance with the order by February 18, 2025. Two days after the status report was filed, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion asking the court to enforce the TRO against Defendants because their status report and other evidence demonstrated that they had not followed the TRO. The same day, Judge Ali partially granted an enforcement motion on the same grounds in the related case [../../../../case/46099/], finding that the defendants hadn't substantially complied with the terms of the TRO.\n\nOn February 21, Defendants asked the court to clarify or stay the TRO, arguing that the TRO as written purported to prohibit Defendants from relying on existing statutory and contractual authorities to review, suspend, and terminate existing foreign assistance grants. Such an order, Defendants argued, would implicate constitutional concerns warranting a stay pending emergency appellate relief. Judge Ali rejected the request for a stay the next day, February 22. Then on February 25, at a status conference, Plaintiffs made an emergency oral motion to enforce the TRO.  This was granted; Judge Ali ordered Defendants to comply with the TRO by Feb. 26, 2025.\n\nOn February 25, Defendants sought relief from this last order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (Docket No. 25-5047), filing a motion for an immediate administrative stay and a stay pending appeal. The following day, Plaintiff-Appellees' filed a cross-motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals subsequently denied Defendants' motions and dismissed the appeal. Defendants sought relief from the Supreme Court, filing an application (Docket No. 24A831) to vacate the District Court order. Chief Justice Roberts granted an administrative stay on February 26 and ordered further briefing.\n\nOn March 5, 2025, the Supreme Court withdrew the administrative stay, and denied the motion to vacate the TRO, which was therefore permitted to go into effect; the Court instructed, \"Given that the deadline in the challenged order has now passed, and in light of the ongoing preliminary injunction proceedings, the District Court should clarify what obligations the Government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order, with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines.\" As is usual in emergency motions, the Court did not explain itself. Justice Alito, joined by Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, dissented, objecting to both the procedure followed by the District Court and to the rejection of the government's sovereign immunity defense, which the dissent characterized as the district court's \"blithely discard[ing] of sovereign dignity.”\n\nMeanwhile, PI briefing moved forward in the District Court; a hearing was held on March 6, 2025. The court issued a PI on March 10 prohibiting Defendants from enforcing the State Department guidance regarding implementation of the EO, or giving effect to any actions taken to restrain foreign assistance between January 20 and February 13, 2025. The court further restrained Defendants from \"unlawfully impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds\" and required them to make available \"the full amount of funds that Congress appropriated for foreign assistance programs in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024.\"\n\nOn March 17 the Court ordered Defendants to submit a status report by March 19 \"which includes the updated total number of payments for work completed prior to February 13, 2025 (1) which have been processed since March 10 for Plaintiffs; (2) which have been processed since March 10 for non-Plaintiffs; and (3) which remain to be processed for Plaintiffs and non-Plaintiffs. Defendants' status report shall include a proposed timeline for processing the remaining payments that is consistent with the Court's [300 payments per day feasibility] benchmark.\"\n\nAfter some back and forth between the parties regarding Defendants' compliance with the PI, the Court issued an order on March 28 finding that Defendants' proposed compliance timeline was consistent with the Court's feasibility benchmark and ordering the parties to meet and confer regarding any outstanding disputes regarding compliance with the PI.\n\nDefendants appealed the PI to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on April 2 (Docket No. 25-5097). On May 6, the Court of Appeals consolidated this appeal and the appeal filed in AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (Docket No. 25-5098), and issued a briefing schedule, requiring Defendant-Appellants to submit their brief by May 9. The Plaintiff-Appellees' brief was due June 6, with Appellants' reply brief due June 18.\n\nMeanwhile in the District Court, Defendants filed an unopposed motion to stay the PI on April 11, 2025, citing the Supreme Court's April 4 decision in Department of Education v. California [../../../../case/46201/] issuing a stay of a preliminary injunction and indicating that suits involving contracts with the federal government must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Defendants also sought an indicative ruling from the court that if the D.C. Circuit returned jurisdiction over the PI to the district court, it would \"dissolve the provision of the preliminary injunction mandating monetary payments to non-Plaintiffs for work completed prior to February 13, 2025.\" The District Court issued a partial administrative stay the same day.\n\nPlaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 22, adding a claim under the Fifth Amendment and a request for a writ of mandamus in the event the Court declined to grant relief on the other claims.\n\nOn May 13, the District Court denied Defendants' motion for an indicative ruling on the PI, stating that if Defendants wished to rely on the Department of Education in support of their argument on appeal, the proper forum for that argument was the Court of Appeals.\n\nOn June 12, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. On June 24, Plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the PI.\n\nOn August 13, the Court of Appeals issued a decision reversing the District Court's PI, holding that Plaintiffs lacked a cognizable cause of action to pursue their claims. The majority reasoned that the Impoundment Control Act (ICA) provides a specific enforcement mechanism, which, together with existing case law, precludes the claims as brought. In dissent, one judge argued that the majority improperly waived consideration of a central argument and emphasized that the President's actions constituted a clear violation of the constitutional separation of powers, rather than merely a statutory violation.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the Trump Administration's endeavor to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). On February 7, 2025, Elon Musk posted, “CFPB RIP” on social media. The next day, the Acting Director of the CFPB instructed CFPB staff to “immediately” stop all work and informed the Federal Reserve that the CFPB would not take any additional funding for its operations in the next quarter. This action happened in the larger context of the Trump Administration’s effort to dismantle several federal agencies and shrink others.\n\nOn February 9, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), as the representative of CFPB employees, filed a short complaint (later supplemented), in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Acting Director of the CFPB. The plaintiff sought both declaratory and injunctive relief. The complaint alleged that the Administration violated the separation of powers by beginning to dismantle the CFPB, an agency created by Congress through its established authority to define and fund agencies. This case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson.\n\nThe plaintiff asserted that Congress had specifically established the CFPB to safeguard American consumers. It claimed that the government's actions to effectively halt the CFPB's mandated work--by ordering the workforce to “cease” all activity, engagement, and enforcement actions and to close the agency’s headquarters--were a direct violation of the separation of powers, citing the Constitution. The complaint emphasized Congress's comprehensive authority over the creation, operational mission, and financial resourcing of Executive Agencies. Plaintiff sought judgment declaring that the CFPB directive was unlawful and enjoining the government from further attempts to halt the CFPB’s work.\n\nOn February 13, 2025, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding as plaintiffs the National Consumer Law Center, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Virginia Poverty Law Center, a Pastor, and the CFPB Employee Association; they also added CFPB as a defendant. The amended complaint further alleged violations of constitutional tenets and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). It asserted that the CFPB was planning mass firings and its acting director's actions were unlawful he lacked Senate confirmation.\n\nThat same day, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a limited administrative stay and a temporary restraining order, aiming to prevent the imminent firing of CFPB employees and to mandate the agency's return to its statutorily defined operations. Plaintiffs contended that the challenged actions would precipitate immediate and irreparable harm to the affected employees, consumers, and the broader public interest.\n\nIn response, on February 14, 2025, the Court issued an administrative stay order to maintain the status quo, ordering, pending resolution of the motion for preliminary injunction, that the defendants were prohibited from deleting or impairing any CFPB data, terminating employees without just cause, or transferring funds from the CFPB’s reserve. The Court stated it would consider the motion for a temporary restraining order as a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn February 21, 2025, a group of 13 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nAfter hearing the issues in this case, the Court granted a preliminary injunction to preserve the CFPB on March 28, 2025. The order mandated that the defendants maintain all CFPB data, reinstate terminated probationary and term employees, and refrain from further terminations or reduction-in-force notices. The stop-work order cannot be enforced, and the defendants must facilitate employees' ability to perform statutory functions, including remote work access. Further, all contract termination notices issued after February 11th must be rescinded, and while specific contracts can be halted based on necessity for statutory functions, no terminations can be finalized.\n\nThe Court granted the preliminary injunction due to a strong showing that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and would suffer irreparable harm without it. Regarding the likelihood of success, the Court found that “the defendants were in fact engaged in a concerted, expedited effort to shut the agency down entirely when the motion for injunctive relief was filed.” The Court reasoned that “the defendants are not free to eliminate an agency created by statute on their own, and certainly not before the Court has had an opportunity to rule on the merits,” indicating a likely overreach of executive authority. Additionally, the Court viewed the stop-work order as a discrete and final agency action taken “in violation of law and without a rational basis to support it,” as it halted all work, including legally required duties.\n\nThe Court also concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to suffer irreparable harm absent the injunction. The opinion noted that “the elimination of the agency was interrupted only because plaintiffs sought and obtained the Court’s intervention on the day the overwhelming majority of the employees were going to be fired,” highlighting the disruption of the CFPB's crucial functions in protecting the borrowing public. The potential loss of agency data and the harm to the missions of consumer advocacy organizations, which rely on the CFPB's work, also contributed to the finding of likely irreparable harm. The court emphasized that “if the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants’ own witness warned, the harm will be irreparable.” 2025 WL 942772.\n\nIn response to this court order, the defendants filed a notice of appeal and a request for a stay of the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on March 29, 2025. [Case No. 25-5091] The DC Circuit granted a partial stay on April 11, permitting the government to conduct Reductions in Force (RIFs) of employees “whom defendants have determined, after a particularized assessment, to be unnecessary to the performance of defendants’ statutory duties.”\n\nThe government proceeded to announce an intended RIF of over 1400 employees--over 90% of the agency's employees--prompting the plaintiffs to file an emergency motion to enforce the preliminary injunction; they argued that this large and broad RIF, was not covered by the stay, and therefore violated the preliminary injunction.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, in the District Court, Judge Jackson issued an order suspending the RIF. 778 F.Supp.3d 144. The court expressed concern that the defendants were not complying with the injunction, citing the scope and speed of the RIF, the apparent lack of consultation with heads of statutorily mandated offices, and troubling accounts of RIF meetings suggesting that the focus was on numbers rather than a particularized assessment. The court scheduled further briefing and an evidentiary hearing to determine compliance but deemed it necessary to preserve the status quo by suspending the RIF and maintaining system access in the interim. The court emphasized its power to enforce its unstayed judgments.\n\nThe government filed a second appeal, challenging Judge Jackson's suspension of the RIF, on April 19, 2025. [Case No. 25-5132]  The two appeals were consolidated in the appellate court.\n\nOn April 28, 2025, the Court of Appeals panel revisited the stay issue. 2025 WL 1721136. Noting the ongoing dispute as to whether its prior stay language permitted judicial review of announced RIFs, the court (with one judge dissenting) said,\n\nwe think it best to restore the interim protection of paragraph (3) of the preliminary injunction, which ensures that plaintiffs can receive meaningful final relief should the defendants not prevail in this appeal, rather than continue collateral litigation over the meaning and reviewability of the “particularized assessment” requirement imposed by this court’s stay order.\n\nTo accommodate the government's concerns about the separation of powers, the court scheduled expedited resolution of the appeal, with oral argument three weeks later. The same day, April 28th, the trial court denied without prejudice as moot the plaintiffs' motion to enforce the preliminary injunction in light of the order issued by the D.C. Circuit. The court also held in abeyance the motion to compel records and deferred the defendants' obligation to respond to the complaint until the court of appeals had ruled on the preliminary injunction.\n\nOn May 7, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to voluntarily dismiss the government's second appeal (No. 25-5132, challenging the suspension of the RIF), noting that the order appealed from had expired by its own terms and the appeal was therefore moot.  The appellate court granted the motion and dismissed that appeal on May 12, 2025.\n\nThe court of appeals held oral argument in the remaining appeal (No. 25-5091, challenging the preliminary injunction) on May 16, 2025. On August 15, 2025, it issued its ruling, vacating the preliminary injunction and remanding the case for further proceedings in the district court. 2025 WL 2371608. It first held that the court lacked jurisdiction over the claims of the organizational plaintiffs, NTEU and the CFPB Employees Association, pertaining to their members' loss of employment, which must be brought under the specialized-review scheme established in the Civil Service Reform Act. As to the remaining plaintiffs, it concluded that their claims were not reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act. It reasoned: \"The plaintiffs seek to set aside an abstract decision, inferred from a constellation of discrete actions, to prophylactically ensure that the Bureau can fulfill its statutory mandate. This theory contravenes all the APA limits discussed above—agency action, finality, ripeness, and discreteness alike. If the plaintiffs’ theory were viable, it would become the task of the judiciary, rather than the Executive Branch, to determine what resources an agency needs to perform its broad statutory functions.\" Finding no express cause of action under the APA, the court considered whether the claims were reviewable in equity; finding no implied equitable claim, it held that the claims failed as a matter of law. Judge Pillard, in dissent, rejected the majority's \"constricted view of our statutory and equitable power,\" cautioning that \"[t]he notion that courts are powerless to prevent the President from abolishing the agencies of the federal government that he was elected to lead cannot be reconciled with either the constitutional separation of powers or our nation’s commitment to a government of laws.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This is one of four ongoing cases challenging the constitutionality of the New York Police Department's \"Stop and Frisk\" program.  See: Floyd v. City of New York (<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021\">PN-NY-0009</a>); Daniels v. City of New York (<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12023\">PN-NY-0010</a>); and Davis v. City of New York (<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12494\">PN-NY-0013</a>).\n\nOn March 28, 2012, twelve New York City residents and one former New York City resident filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the City of New York and the New York City Police Department (NYPD) on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals.  They challenged the city's \"Operation Clean Halls\" initiative (later renamed the \"Trespass Affidavit Program\"), which allowed police officers to patrol in and around private residential apartment buildings, and allegedly resulted in thousands of illegal stops, searches, summons (citations), and arrests.  The plaintiffs were represented by a group of public interest lawyers from the New York Civil Liberties Union, Bronx Defenders and LatinoJustice.  They filed the lawsuit under the Fair Housing Act and state law, alleging violations of the Federal and State Constitutions.  The plaintiffs asked for a declaration that the NYPD's practices were unlawful and an injunction against those practices.\n\nOperation Clean Halls had the stated purpose of combating illegal activity in apartment buildings with records of high crime.  In Manhattan alone, there were at least 3,895 Clean Halls buildings. Searches and seizures occurred in public areas such as courtyards, lobbies, and sidewalks, and NYPD officers engaged in vertical patrols (floor-by-floor sweeps), much like those that were challenged in litigation surrounding New York City Housing Authority residences.  The plaintiffs alleged that they had been stopped without suspicion of unlawful behavior, and that they had been arrested or issued summons (citations) without probable cause.  In multiple instances, plaintiffs were arrested for trespassing despite having another resident vouch for them.  The plaintiffs alleged that these incidents were part of a larger pattern and practice in buildings enrolled in Operation Clean Halls, without meaningful correlations to actual crime levels.  The residents of Clean Hall buildings were disproportionately Black and Latino.  The plaintiffs also alleged that the City had been deliberately indifferent to these violations in their failure to train and supervise the NYPD.\n\nThe plaintiffs asked for a class certification for all residents of Clean Hall buildings and their families, guests, and visitors and for all individuals who had been or were likely to be unlawfully stopped or arrested for being in or around buildings in the Operation Clean Halls initiative.   The plaintiffs claimed violations of the Fourth Amendment; First and Fourteenth Amendments (free association and due process); the Fair Housing Act (discriminatory implementation); the New York Constitution; and New York Common Law (false arrest and malicious prosecution).  The plaintiffs asked for a declaration that these laws had been violated.  The plaintiffs also demanded an injunction that required the defendants to refrain from these violations, to establish citywide standards regarding Operation Clean Halls, to establish a system for tracking and monitoring NYPD practices (with care paid to tracking race, national origin, and geography), develop appropriate training for NYPD officers; and report to the plaintiffs and the court about the steps taken to cure the violations.  The plaintiffs also asked for compensatory damages and attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nOn June 12, 2012, the Court (Shira A. Scheindlin, J.) issued a memorandum opinion and order.  Ligon v. City of New York, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81526, 2012 WL 2125989 (S.D.N.Y. June 12, 2012).  The defendants wanted access to paperwork on the plaintiffs' prior arrests, even if they were terminated in the plaintiffs' favor and were now sealed pursuant to state law.  Judge Scheindlin ruled that there was no legitimate reason for the defendants to access those files unless they were for charges of trespass or related crimes in the past ten years.  The Court also ruled that the plaintiffs must make other disclosures about the length of time they were incarcerated and any injuries they suffered as a result of prior arrests, but that that could be done by sworn affidavit.\n\nOn August 21, 2012, Judge Scheindlin issued an opinion and order allowing the plaintiffs' evidentiary hearing to proceed, regarding their request for a preliminary injunction.  Ligon v. City of New York, 2012 WL 3597066 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2012).  The defendants had asked the Court to deny the plaintiffs' motion summarily, prior to a hearing.  The defendants had argued (among other reasons) that there was overlap in the plaintiff classes between this case and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021\">Floyd</a>, so there was a risk of inconsistent adjudications.  The Court pointed out that both matters were assigned to the same judge and gave the defendants a choice:  they could cease delaying <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021\">Floyd</a> with interlocutory appeals or they could agree to let these plaintiffs pursue preliminary injunctive relief. The Court wrote: \"the City cannot have it both ways.\" This case went forward with the preliminary injunction proceedings. \n\nThe preliminary injunction hearing took place in October and November 2012. On January 8, 2013, Judge Scheindlin ruled for the plaintiffs, finding that they had demonstrated the likelihood that they would prevail on the merits, and proved the city's deliberate indifference toward a widespread practice of unconstitutional trespass stops by the NYPD outside TAP buildings in the Bronx.  Judge Scheindlin summarized that her conclusion was based on five categories of evidence: \n(1) the testimony of a Bronx Assistant District Attorney that the NYPD frequently made trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx for no reason other than that the officer had seen someone enter and exit or exit the building; \n(2) a sample of \"decline to prosecute\" forms prepared by the Bronx District Attorneys' Office, which revealed the alarming frequency of unlawful trespass stops in the vicinity of TAP buildings in the Bronx; \n(3) the testimony of eight plaintiffs and a non-party witness, who described remarkably similar encounters with the police when stopped in the vicinity of TAP buildings in the Bronx; \n(4) the analysis by Dr. Jeffrey Fagan, plaintiffs' expert, of an NYPD database of recorded stops, which provided further evidence of the frequency of apparently unlawful trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx; and \n(5) NYPD training materials that misstated the minimal constitutional standards for making stops.  \n\nThe Court issued a preliminary injunction, ordering the NYPD to immediately cease performing trespass stops (in which a reasonable person would not feel free to terminate the encounter) outside TAP buildings in the Bronx without reasonable suspicion of trespass.  In addition, Judge Scheindlin set out proposed relief, and consolidated a hearing on it with the already-scheduled remedial hearing in the related <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021\">Floyd</a> litigation.  The proposed relief included requirements to develop constitutionally adequate policy guidance on stops, to collect data on each such stop, and to improve supervision and training.  Ligon v. City of New York, 2013 WL 71800 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2013).\n\nOn January 11, 2013, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  On January 22, 2013, District Judge Scheindlin granted the defendants' stay of relief, pending their appeal in the circuit court.  \n\nOn February 11, 2013, Judge Scheindlin granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification solely for the purpose of preliminary injunctive relief. The class included \"all individuals who have been or are at risk of being stopped outdoors without legal justification by NYPD officers on suspicion of trespassing in Bronx apartment buildings enrolled in the NYPD's Trespass Affidavit Program (commonly referred to as \"Operation Clean Halls\"). Ligon v. City of New York, 2013 WL 500272 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 11, 2013).\n\nAfter a nine-week bench trial, on August 12, 2013, Judge Scheindlin issued an order in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021\">Floyd</a>, finding that the City had violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by acting with “deliberate indifference” toward the NYPD's practice of making suspicion-less “stops” and “frisks” and by adopting “a policy of indirect racial profiling by targeting racially defined groups” for “stops” and “frisks.” That same day, Judge Scheindlin issued an order imposing remedies in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021\">Floyd</a> and Ligon in the form of various “reforms” to the NYPD's “stop and frisk” practices to be overseen by a court-appointed monitor.  The Court appointed Peter Zimroth, former New York Corporation Counsel and former First Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan, to oversee the implementation of the relief.  With respect to specific remedies, the Court ordered the NYPD to adopt a written policy spelling out the specific circumstances where stopping a person suspected of trespass outside a TAP building is legal.  Additionally, the Court ordered the city (1) to develop procedures to ensure proper paperwork is completed for each stop outside a Bronx TAP building; (2) to develop and adopt a system for reviewing the legality of stops outside Bronx TAP buildings; and (3) to revise the NYPD's training materials and training programs to enter conformity with the law.  Additionally, the Court ordered that attorney's fees and costs be rewarded on appropriate application.  The City appealed in both cases and sought a stay.\n\nIn September 2013, four police unions filed notices of appeal and motions to intervene in the District Court. Three of the unions moved to intervene in both Floyd and Ligon.  One union only moved to intervene in Floyd.\n\nOn October 31, 2013, the Second Circuit granted the City’s motion for a stay and ordered that the cases be reassigned from Judge Scheindlin to another district judge.  The Second Circuit wrote that the \"District Judge ran afoul of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges\" in (a) speaking to the press and (b) encouraging the plaintiffs' counsel in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12023\">Daniels</a> to file the <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021\">Floyd</a> litigation, separately, rather than litigating racial profiling as part of <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12023\">Daniels</a> -- particularly in stating that she would treat the new case as related.  538 F. App'x 101 (2d Cir. 2013).\n\nAfter the Second Circuit ruled, both <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021\">Floyd</a> and Ligon were reassigned (as related) to District Judge Analisa Torres.  On November 13, 2013, the Court of Appeals rejected Judge Scheindlin's motion asking to be heard on the disqualification issue and clarified the reason for reassigning the case. The Second Circuit held that the rationale for the reassignment was an appearance of impropriety, not its actual presence.  736 F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2013). \n\nIn the meantime, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio was elected, and took a very different approach to these cases.  The city moved for limited remand from the Second Circuit to the district court for the purpose of exploring settlement.  On February 21, 2014, the Second Circuit granted the City’s motion to remand to the district court to explore settlement for 45 days. The Second Circuit declined to decide the police unions' motion to intervene, preferring to let the district court decide that motion first. 743 F.3d 362 (2d Cir. 2014).\n\nOn March 4, 2014, the parties informed Judge Torres that they had “reached an agreement in principle for resolving the City's appeals in both Floyd and Ligon. The City agreed to substantially comply with the injunctive relief set forth in Judge Scheindlin's August 12, 2013, remedial order, subject to the parties' application to Judge Torres to limit the term of the court-appointed monitor to three years. When the monitor’s term ended, the City agreed to authorize the Inspector General of the NYPD to take over monitoring and reporting responsibilities. The parties agreed that the agreement could be terminated once the City has maintained compliance for two years. On July 30, 2014, Judge Torres granted the parties' joint motion to modify the remedial order and to enter it as an embodiment of their agreements.\n\nOn July 30, 2014, Judge Torres also issued an order denying the police unions' motions to intervene, finding, inter alia, that the motions were untimely and that the police unions did not assert a legally protectable interest. 302 F.R.D. 69 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).  The police unions appealed.\n\nHowever, on August 6, 2014, with the consent of the plaintiffs in Floyd and Ligon, the City moved to voluntarily dismiss its remaining appeals, with prejudice, stating that the parties had reached an agreement that resolved all the issues raised by the City's appeals in both Floyd and Ligon, and cleared the way for the parties to begin the remedial process and settlement negotiations.\n\nOn October 31, 2014, the Second Circuit granted the City’s request to voluntarily dismiss all appeals, with prejudice.  In addition, the Second Circuit held that the unions’ motions to intervene were untimely and that the unions failed to establish legally protectable interests, as required to allow intervention.  770 F.3d 1051 (2d Cir. 2014). \n\nThe parties continued to work with the monitor on developing appropriate reforms.  On February 3, 2015, Judge Torres issued an order regarding the procedure for the monitor to develop and the City to implement the reforms of NYPD’s stop-and-frisk activities.  The monitor would consult with the parties to create a final recommendations for the implementation of remedies.  Then, the court would approve or deny the final recommendations. \n\nFirst, on February 23, 2015, the monitor submitted and Judge Torres approved, a memo that was read by the NYPD at 10 consecutive roll calls in all precincts detailing the reforms ordered by Judge Scheindlin in Floyd. The memo was also posted in police stations and provided to all officers. The document detailed the constitutional standards governing stop and frisks, explicitly prohibited racial profiling by police, ordered officers to include a narrative explanation for stops in their UF250 forms, and ordered the start of a pilot program outfitting police officers with body cameras.\n\nMeanwhile, on March 18, 2015, the City suggested a way for all five police unions to participate in the remedial process. Under the City's approach, the City would share proposals with the unions before providing them to the monitor and the plaintiffs. The unions could then offer their comments, which the City would convey to the monitor. This approach would afford the unions an opportunity to inform the monitor of their viewpoints before the monitor reached conclusions and submitted the final recommendations to the Court. On March 19, 2015, Judge Torres issued an order approving this framework.\n\nOn August 7, 2015, the monitor submitted his final recommendations for reforms on racial profiling and street encounters.  The new racial profiling policy imposed a categorical prohibition on racial and national origin profiling; it also prohibited other forms of biased policing not covered in the NYPD’s current policy, such as profiling on the basis of religion, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, and housing status.  The new street encounters policy regarding placed clearer legal limits on stops and frisks. It required supervisory review of officer conduct to ensure compliance with the Constitution.  On August 24, 2015, Judge Torres approved the final recommendations. \n\nOn December 8, 2015, Judge Torres issued an order modifying the remedial order’s requirement that NYPD institute a pilot project in which body-worn cameras would be used for a one-year period.  Judge Torres modified the order so that the NYPD would use a randomized experimental design for the body-worn camera pilot program. \n\nBy February 2017, the parties had a settlement agreement and began the formal process for court approval of a class-action settlement. Judge Torres approved the stipulation of settlement on July 19, 2017. The settlement includes payment to the named plaintiffs totaling $235,000 and attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses totaling $2,640,533. The stipulation also articulates specific standards for stopping, frisking, searching, arresting, and issuing summonses in and around TAP buildings and requires the NYPD to implement and consistently adhere to those standards. In addition to the specific reforms outlined in the settlement, it provides that further reforms will be developed as part of the remedial process described in the August 2013 Floyd/Ligon joint remedial order.\n\nWhile the settlement of the claims in this case was being negotiated, the joint remedial process, part of the 2013 remedial order, included a comprehensive input process regarding recommended reforms. The input process concluded in April 2017, and in January 2018 the plaintiffs, describing the parties' impasse regarding the remedial process, requested that the facilitator issue a report and the parties hold a status conference. In an order of January 29, 2018, Judge Torres provided a schedule for the parties to work with the facilitator regarding reforms under the joint remedial process. Monitoring is ongoing in this case; see Floyd (<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021\">PN-NY-0009</a>) for the implementation and monitoring proceedings of the settlement agreements.\n\nIn February of 2018, the monitor filed proposed training materials for newly promoted lieutenants and sergeants.  The materials involved guidebooks and powerpoint presentations that would be used during a four week training course (for lieutenants) and a six week training course (for sergeants).  The next month, Judge Torres approved the materials.  In June 2018, the monitor filed additional training materials regarding In-Service Stop and Frisks by Patrol Officers, which were approved by Judge Torres the next month.  \n\nOn July 19, 2018, Judge Torres issued an order about the recommendation to document police-citizen encounters.  The order stated that by September 13, 2018, the parties must submit a joint proposal for a pilot program to study the electronic recording of first- and second-level police-citizen encounters, to be overseen by the monitor. The proposal shall consider social science best practices. In developing the proposal, the parties shall consult with experts and the monitor.  The monitor shall report to the Court whether the benefits of recording lower-level encounters outweigh the financial, administrative, and other costs, and whether the program should be expanded or terminated.\n\nOn July 27, 2018, the monitor filed a report on the use of body cameras by NYPD officers that outlines how the data from the pilot program will be used to analyze police/civilian interactions, police activity, and police lawfulness.  \n\nOn August 13, 2018, Judge Torres approved a stipulation of fees for the time period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017.  The City agreed to pay fees of $275,149.00 to the New York Civil Liberties Union Foundation. \n\nIn December of 2018, the monitor issued a report recommending the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) Guide on Processing and Investigating Complaints of Profiling and Bias-Based Policing Patrol, and two Internal Investigations courses on profiling and police bias as training materials.  Judge Torres granted these recommendations in January 2019.\n\nOn May 9, 2019, Judge Torres approved a stipulation of fees for the time period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018.  The City agreed to pay fees of $85,352.00 to the New York Civil Liberties Union Foundation. \n\nOn May 28, 2019, the monitor made a recommendation regarding training materials for Housing Bureau members, including housing one-day training scenarios on lobby trespass, stairwell trespass, shots fired interior patrol, and roof trespass, which the Judge granted the next day.\n\nJudge Torres approved a proposed confidentiality order regarding the pilot study, which severely restricted public access to data collected on police encounters with civilians.  The confidentiality order will protect the information that is obtained and created by trained observers studying officer behavior in the NYPD pilot study from disclosure to anyone other than the monitor and his team.  In the related <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021\">Floyd</a> case, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the confidentiality order, and Judge Torres denied this motion on October 25, 2019.  Floyd v. City of New York, 2019 WL 5537875 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 25, 2019).\n\nOn June 2, 2020, Judge Torres issued an order instructing the NYPD to systematically obtain and report various categories of information.  This information included declinations of prosecutions by district attorneys in New York, suppression decisions by courts excluding evidence as a result of unlawful stops and searches, court findings of incredible testimony by police officers, denials of indemnification and/or representation of police officers by the New York City Law Department, and judgments and settlements against police officers in civil cases where, in the opinion of the New York City Law Department, there exists evidence of police malfeasance.  This information will be compiled regularly by the NYPD and sent to a committee, who will review the information and make assessments of individual officers, as well as the extent and manner of the intervention to be applied.  This committee will also track metrics to evaluate the efficacy of the program.  The committee, in conjunction with the monitor, will also develop a program for receiving and assessing information regarding adverse conduct of police officers, and this information will be provided to the Police Commissioner.\n\nIn light of the COVID-19 pandemic, on June 2, 2020 the plaintiffs filed a motion to compel the defendants to produce information about the NYPD's use of investigative encounters and social distancing enforcement practices.  The city has filed its opposition brief in response to this motion, and the monitor filed a letter opposing the plaintiffs' motion.  On June 12, Judge Torres denied the plaintiffs' motion.\n\nThis case is ongoing. ",

    "summary/long": "On November 9, 2010, several citizens of Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire who were or had been married to partners of the same sex under the law of their states filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut against the Office of Personnel Management, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Postal Service, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, and the United States. The plaintiffs, represented by Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) and by private counsel, sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, alleging a violation of equal protection. Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that operation of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 1 U.S.C. § 7, to deny them a variety of state and federal benefits that would be available to similarly situated individuals with spouses of the opposite sex violated the equal protection component of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief.\n\nOn February 25, 2011, the Department of Justice, representing the defendants, notified the court that it had come to the conclusion that DOMA is unconstitutional and that it would thus cease defending it. In response, on April 26 the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the House of Representatives (BLAG) moved to intervene in defense of the act, and the Court (Judge Vanessa L. Bryant) granted its motion on May 27. <i>Pedersen v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</i>, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155323 (D. Conn. 2011).\n\nOn July 15, 2011, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, and on August 15, BLAG moved to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint. Briefing on both motions continued over the course of the following year.\n\nOn June 20, 2012, BLAG moved to stay the proceedings pending the decision of the Second Circuit in <i>Windsor v. United States</i>, No. 10-cv-08435 (S.D.N.Y.) [<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12113\">PB-NY-0017</a>]. The District Court (Judge Bryant) denied BLAG's motion on July 4, finding BLAG's assertion that the Second Circuit's decision would be dispositive in the case to be speculative.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, the Court (Judge Bryant) issued an order denying BLAG's motion to dismiss and granting plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. <i>Pedersen v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</i>, 2012 WL 3113883, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106713 (D. Conn. 2012). The Court found that \"homosexuals display all the traditional indicia of suspectness and therefore statutory classifications based on sexual orientation are entitled to a heightened form of judicial scrutiny,\" but also found that application of heightened scrutiny was unnecessary to resolve the case, as Section 3 of DOMA failed to pass muster even under rational basis review.  BLAG filed notice of appeal with the Second Circuit on September 26, 2012.  \n\nOn August 17, 2012, plaintiffs filed a petition for certiorari before judgment under the Supreme Court Rule that permits deviation from normal appellate practice \"upon a showing that the case is of such imperative public importance as to...require immediate determination in [the Supreme] Court.\" Sup. Ct. R. 11.  On June 26, 2013 the Supreme Court held Section 3 of DOMA to be unconstitutional in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12113\">Windsor v. United States</a> and denied certiorari in this case the next day, June 27, 2013.  On July 23, 2013, parties agreed to withdraw appeals before the Second Circuit in this case.  ",

    "summary/long": "On February 26, 2013, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division sent notice to the Alabama Department of Corrections that it would be conducting an investigation of the Julia Tutwiler Prison. The investigation sought to address allegations that prisoners were subjected to sexual abuse by prison staff in violation of their constitutional rights; allegations that the prison failed to report and prevent sexual abuse; and allegations that the prison failed to provide adequate mental health and medical care to victims of sexual abuse. On January 17, 2014, the DOJ issued a findings letter. The department's findings detailed unconstitutional conditions that subjected women prisoners to a substantial risk of harm. These conditions included staff sexual abuse and sexual harassment of prisoners, prison officials' failure to adequately respond to and investigate allegations of sexual abuse and harassment, and systemic deficiencies that directly contributed to staff and prisoner sexual abuse and staff sexual harassment.\n\nOn May 28, 2015, the DOJ Civil Rights Division filed this lawsuit against the state of Alabama and its Department of Corrections (ADOC) under CRIPA for the heinous sexual abuse committed by the ADOC's male officers at Tutwiler. And the parties had reached a settlement agreement and subsequently submitted a motion for its approval, which Judge Myron Thompson accepted on June 18, 2015. The court issued a consent decree and designated an independent monitor.\n\nThe settlement required the ADOC and Tutwiler to make recommended changes and file compliance reports every six months. The substantive part of the settlement agreement contained sections on General Policies and Procedures, staffing and training, risk assessment and education, rights to privacy and reporting, and response and investigation procedures to reports of sexual assault.\n\nThe policy section of the agreement required ADOC and Tutwiler to: <ul> <li> Develop, submit to the Monitor and DOJ for review, and implement policies and procedures regarding the management of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and gender nonconforming prisoners; <li> Comply with its policy ensuring women receive essential supplies; <li> Develop and implement policies and procedures that incorporate gender-responsive strategies, including policies and procedures governing the use of force against women prisoners and other disciplinary actions; <li> Develop, submit to the Monitor and DOJ for review and implement facility-specific policies and operational practices specific to Tutwiler' s population regarding the supervision and monitoring necessary to prevent inmates from being exposed to an unreasonable risk of harm from sexual abuse and harassment; and <li> Revise and/or develop and implemen any other policies, practices, procedures, protocols, training curricula, and other written documents as necessary, including but not limited to, screening tools, logs, handbooks, manuals, and forms. </ul> \nThe consent decree was set to be in effect until ADOC was found in substantial compliance in three consecutive compliance reports.\n\nThe monitor filed the first report on February 26, 2016 on the assessment period for May–Dec. 2015. The monitor noted positive progress and granted a 3-month extension for compliance on the general policies and procedures and training. From February 2016 through August 2019, the monitor filed a total of eight reports indicating steady progress. In the eighth and most recent report, the monitor noted that Tutwiler and the ADOC achieved \"substantial compliance\" with 41 sections of the settlement agreement and \"partial compliance\" with two sections of the agreement. \n\nAs of August 2019, Tutwiler's and the ADOC's general policies continued to work toward preventing sexual abuse and harassment. The monitor noted that staff exhibited knowledge of procedures related to reporting sexual harassment, safety for inmates, and investigative processes. In addition, the monitor found that Tutwiler and the ADOC fully implemented the required Behavior Intervention & Discipline Policy and Disciplinary Segregation policies. Tutwiler's and the ADOC's use of camera recording also satisfied the monitor, although the monitor found that audio capabilities would further surveillance efforts. Further, the ADOC's and Tutwiler's inmate education program communicating the right to be free from sexual abuse and harassment and right to privacy satisfied their duties as outlined in the agreement. \n\nThe monitor found some challenges still exist at the Tutwiler facility. Specifically, staffing vacancies could impact safety and security at the facility. Additionally, recruitment and retention problems with women candidates do not allow for a finding of substantial compliance with terms in the agreement.  \n\nAs of November 2019, the monitor will conduct further research on compliance and submit a ninth report to the court in December. The case is ongoing.\n\n(There were also two earlier CRIPA matters involving Tutwiler.  The first was in the mid 1980s. For information, see <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=550\">PC-AL-0023</a>. The second was in the mid 1990s.

    "summary/long": "Until and through the latter part of 2006, the University of Michigan's admissions policies allowed for the consideration of race among the factors it considered in making admissions decisions. In 2003, this policy was expressly approved by the United States Supreme Court in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003).  \n\nOn November 7, 2006, the people of Michigan approved by majority vote a statewide ballot initiative, Proposal 2, which amended the Michigan Constitution to prohibit discrimination or preferential treatment based on race or gender in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting in the State. Under the Michigan Constitution, the proposal was scheduled to go into effect on December 23, 2006. In response to the enactment of Proposal 2, the University of Michigan announced that it would change its admissions and financial aid policies so that its \"admissions and financial aid processes will not discriminate, nor grant preferential treatment to, any individual on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin,\" apparently by altering its admissions procedures \"such that race and gender will have no effect on the decision-making process\" except to \"recognize exceptions provided in [Proposal 2] including one for programs that receive federal funds.\"  Both Proposal 2 and the university's announcement triggered litigation.\n\nOn November 8, 2006, several civil rights organizations, students, labor organizations, a political organization, and a former petition circulator (for the initiative that resulted in enactment of Proposal 2) filed, as plaintiffs, a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Represented by Detroit-based private counsel, they named as defendants the state's governor and the regents of three large state universities, including the University of Michigan, as well as broadly identifying as additional defendants unnamed \"trustees of any other public college or university, community college, or school district.\" The plaintiffs' 42 U.S.C. § 1983 lawsuit sought declaratory and injunctive relief to block the implementation of Proposal 2, claiming it violated the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1964, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the First Amendment.\n\nOn December 12, 2006, the university defendants filed a cross-claim against the governor, saying that they were unsure of the meaning and constitutionality of Proposal 2, were in the middle of their admissions and financial aid cycles, and wanted to continue to act in accord with past policy and practices until the uncertainties about Proposal 2 were resolved. Accordingly, the universities sought an order preserving the status quo and permitting them to act until the court ruled upon the injunctive relief requested by the initial plaintiffs.  The universities, too, were represented by private counsel.\n\nTwo days later, District Judge David D. Lawson granted the state attorney general's motion to intervene as a defendant in the case. The attorney general had cited his duty to defend the constitutionality of the new provision.\n\nOn December 17, 2006, the plaintiffs filed their amended complaint. Basically, the amendment added the state's attorney general as a defendant, asserted more factual detail about racial discrimination and its myriad effects, asserted that Proposal 2 violated federal constitutional and statutory law, and added the assertions that federal statutes preempted Proposal 2 and that the provision also violated Executive Order 11246. The amended complaint sought the same declaratory and injunctive relief and added a claim for an award of attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe next day, the district court received a stipulation from all parties consenting to the temporary injunctive relief sought by the universities and agreeing to the dismissal of the request in the cross-claim for an injunction. In an unpublished order on December 19, 2006, Judge Lawson accepted the stipulation and enjoined the application of Proposal 2 against the university defendants until July 1, 2007, unless the injunction should be earlier vacated.  Also on December 19, other plaintiffs (\"the Cantrell plaintiffs\") filed a separate complaint in the same court, also seeking to enjoin the effect of Proposal 2 (Docket #: 06-cv-15637-DML-SDP).\n\nMeanwhile, motions to intervene in the initial lawsuit had been filed by various parties. On December 27, 2006, Judge Lawson ruled upon three of these motions. The American Civil Rights Foundation and the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative Committee had moved to intervene as plaintiffs on December 14, while a group called Toward a Fair Michigan, and an individual seeking admission to the University of Michigan Law School in the fall, had moved to intervene as defendants on December 18. That same day, the City of Lansing filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff.  Applying federal civil procedure rules governing intervention of right and permissive intervention, Judge Lawson granted only the individual's motion to intervene.  Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm, 240 F.R.D. 368 (E.D. Mich. 2006).\n\nThe day Judge Lawson issued the temporary injunction (December 19, 2006), the individual intervenor and Toward a Fair Michigan had filed a motion requesting a stay of the order enjoining enforcement of Proposal 2 before its effective date-December 23. Having heard nothing from the district court and with the effective date fast approaching, on December 21, these two would-be intervenor-defendants filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The next day, they filed in that court both an emergency motion for a stay, pending appeal, of the preliminary injunction and a petition for a writ of mandamus directing the district court to grant their then-pending motion to intervene and to vacate its preliminary injunction. Also in the Sixth Circuit, on December 28, the organizations whose intervention was denied by Judge Lawson's December 19's ruling filed appeals of that ruling.\n\nCircuit Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton wrote the panel opinion for the appellate court, which decided that (1) the prospective student had standing; (2) the stipulated injunction was invalid; (3) Proposal 2 did not violate the First Amendment or the Equal Protection Clause; (5) neither the Civil Rights Act or Title IX  preempted Prop. 2; and (7) a stay of the district court's order granting the injunction was warranted. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm, 473 F.3d 237 (6th Cir. 2006).\n\nOn January 5, 2007, Judge Lawson issued an unpublished order consolidating the two cases seeking to enjoin Proposal 2, noting that the proposal was also known as Proposal 06-2 and, now, as Article 1, section 26 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963. Also, the parties were directed to work toward joint proposed stipulations of fact, to submit a discovery plan, and to have lead counsel for the parties attend a status and scheduling conference in March 2007.\n\nOn January 17, 2007, the first amended complaint after consolidation was filed. In more measured tones than used in  the complaints filed by the initial plaintiffs, this amended complaint described a variety of plaintiffs (high school, undergraduate, and graduate and law students, as well as university professors) who sought class action status for the case and asserted that Proposal 2 violated their equal protection rights by placing on them and racial minorities a substantial and unique burden in seeking legislation, because groups seeking beneficial legislation including considerations of race face a different and much more onerous burden in the political process than do those seeking beneficial legislation based on other characteristics. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and costs. This amended complaint reflected a host of attorneys serving plaintiffs, including private counsel, counsel from numerous organizations (i.e., Detroit Branch NAACP, ACLU Fund of Michigan, ACLU Foundation of Southern California, NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Michigan State Conference-NAACP, ACLU Foundation Racial Justice Program), and several law professors from a variety of law schools.\n\nOn March 28, 2007, the original plaintiffs' counsel filed a second amended petition. It added a gender discrimination component to their earlier equal protection arguments, as well as claims that that Fourteenth Amendment clause was violated by racial and gender discrimination in the very structure of government in Michigan. The second amended complaint added university presidents as defendants, sought class action status for the case, and re-asserted earlier federal constitutional and statutory claims, including those based on preemption under the Supremacy Clause. It extended the claims based on the asserted violation of First Amendment rights by contending students' rights were violated, too, by the state enactment. Plaintiffs continued to seek declaratory and injunctive relief, together with attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nOn October 5, 2007, the Cantrell plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment as to intervening defendant Russell, arguing that he should be dismissed from the litigation because he no longer represented an interest distinct from that of the attorney general. On October 17, 2007, the university defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On November 30, 2007, the attorney general filed a motion to dismiss for lack of standing or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment on the merits as to all Plaintiffs. Russell and the Cantrell Plaintiffs likewise filed motions for summary judgment the same day. On March 18, 2008, District Court Judge Lawson issued two orders ruling on these motions. In the first published order, the court denied the University Defendants' request to be dismissed as parties and the Cantrell plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted the attorney general's motion for summary judgment, rejecting the plaintiffs' arguments that Proposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v. Regents of University of Michigan, 539 F.Supp.2d 924 (E.D. Mich. 2008).\n\nIn the second published order on the same day, Judge Lawson adjudicated a series of other motions. Among other things, the court granted the Cantrell plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to intervening defendant Russell, denied the motion to intervene by Jennifer Gratz, and denied as moot plaintiffs' respective motions for class certification. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v. Regents of University of Michigan, 539 F.Supp.2d 960 (E.D. Mich. 2008).  (The Cantrell plaintiffs subsequently moved the court to reconsider the first order, but the court denied the motion on December 11, 2008. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v. Regents of the University of Michigan, 592 F.Supp.2d 948 (E.D. Mich. 2008).)\n\nMultiple appeals followed the district court's decisions on March 18 and December 11, 2008. The university defendants appealed the court's denial of their motion to be dismissed as parties. Russell appealed the court's grant of the Cantrell plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment dismissing him as a party to the action. The Cantrell plaintiffs appealed the court's grant of the attorney general's motion for summary judgment and its denial of their motion for reconsideration. Similarly, the Coalition plaintiffs appealed the court's grant of the attorney general's motion for summary judgment.\n\nOn July 1, 2011, in an opinion delivered by Judge R. Guy Cole, Jr., the Sixth Circuit found that Proposal 2 unconstitutionally altered Michigan's political structure by impermissibly burdening racial minorities. Accordingly, the appellate court reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment for the defendants and ordered the district court to enter summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. Also, the appellate court affirmed the district court's decision granting the Cantrell plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to intervening defendant Russell, and affirmed the district court's decision denying the university defendants' motion to be dismissed as parties. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v. Regents of the University of Michigan, 652 F.3d 607 (6th Cir. 2011).\n\nOn September 9, 2011, the Sixth Circuit granted en banc rehearing; the panel decision/judgment was vacated, and the mandate was stayed.  After a new round of briefing and argument, on November 15, 2012, in an opinion delivered by Judge R. Guy Cole, Jr., the Sixth Circuit en banc majority found, as the panel had, that Proposal 2 created a comparative structural burden that undermined the Equal Protection Clause (which the court calls the \"political process\" argument).  Accordingly, the en banc court found Proposal 2 unconstitutional and reversed the judgment of the district court on this issue.  The Court affirmed the denial of the University Defendants' motion to be dismissed as parties (deferential to lower court on this type of issue), and affirmed the grant of Cantrell Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to Russell (because he is no longer an interested party).  \n\nThe majority explained that equal protection of the laws includes \"a guarantee that minority groups may meaningfully participate in the process of creating laws and the majority may not manipulate the channels of change so as to place unique burdens on issues of importance to them.\" The Court found that \"Proposal 2 targets a program that 'inures primarily to the benefit of the minority' and reorders the political process in Michigan in a way that places special burdens on racial minorities.\"  It reorders the political process because admissions procedures are set by the popularly elected governing boards of the universities.  To enact other preferential admissions criteria (the court uses the example of legacy applicants), a citizen need only convince the existing officials on the board or seek to elect someone who shares their views.  But to enact a race-conscious preference, a citizen must first obtain a constitutional amendment, and then seek to persuade the board or elect board members who agree.  It was the process, not the outcome, that the Court held to be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  The Court did not reach the question of whether the Proposition violates Equal Protection under what it called the \"traditional analysis\" (impermissibly classifying individuals on the basis of race). Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v. Regents of the University of Michigan, --- F.3d ---, 2012 WL 5519918 (6th Cir. 2012).\n\nThe Michigan Attorney General sought certiorari review in the Supreme Court, and on March 24, 2013, the Court granted cert.    \n\nOn October 15, 2013 the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the case.  In an opinion written by Justice Kennedy and joined by Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, the court reversed the Sixth Circuit (134 S. Ct. 1623).  There were two concurring opinions and a single dissent.  Writing for the Court, Kennedy asserted that this case was not about resolving the debate of racial preferences, but whether or not it is constitutional for Michigan to allow its voters to decide the issue.  The Court held that there was no authority in the Federal Constitution or in the Court’s precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit to the voters the determination whether racial preferences may be considered in governmental decisions, in particular with respect to school admissions.

    "summary/long": "On Aug. 22, 2005, a paraplegic individual who uses a wheelchair sued Chipotle, alleging that two of the defendant's restaurants did not provide full and equal access to customers in wheelchairs.\n\nIn his complaint, the plaintiff alleged that when he had visited two Chipotle restaurants, one in Encinitas and one in San Diego, 44-inch high walls in front of the food preparation area obstructed his view, and thus he was denied full and equal access as non-disabled people have the opportunity to view foods available for selection and the construction of their food. He also alleged that there were structural barriers at the entrance to the restaurants, dining tables, parking lots, and restrooms, making them inaccessible to those in wheelchairs, in violation of (1) the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §12102; (2) the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, § 504 (as amended 29 U.S.C. § 794); (3) the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, codified as California Civil Code §§ 51, 52, and 54.1, 54.3, and 55; and (4) other statutory measures which refer to the protection of the rights of \"physically disabled persons.\" The plaintiff sought an injunction ordering the defendants to provide full and equal access (by removing architectural barriers), statutory damages, compensatory damages, and attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe defendant filed cross-complaints against the owners and operators of the properties on which the restaurants are located. The defendant also completed modifications to the restaurants to address the alleged lack of compliance with the ADA by Oct. 5, 2006.\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2007, the defendant moved to dismiss the case or in the alternative, to consolidate it with <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=11469&search=source%7Cgeneral%3BcaseName%7CAntoninetti%20v.%20Chipotle%20Mexican%20Grill%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B\">Antoninetti v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Case No. 3:06-cv-02671</a>, a lawsuit filed on Dec. 6, 2006 by the same plaintiff, involving the same defendant and questions of law, this time as a putative class action. \n\nOn Mar. 20, 2007, Judge Napoleon A. Jones, Jr. for the U.S. District Court for the District of Southern California, denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the case and granted their motion to consolidate for purposes of discovery only and leaving open the question of consolidation for trial. \n\nMeanwhile, on Feb. 23, 2007, the defendant had implemented a written nationwide \"Customers with Disabilities\" policy (\"the Policy\"), and formally began training its employees on the policy between March and May 2007. Among other things, the Policy required managers to greet disabled customers and ask them whether they required accommodations, and instructed managers and crew that efficiency was secondary to ensuring a positive experience for disabled customers. \n\nOn Apr. 16, 2007, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the plaintiff's claims for injunctive relief under the ADA were moot because the defendant had modified the restaurants to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (\"ADAAG\"), including adoption and implementation of the effective nationwide Policy.\n\nOn June 14, 2007, the court found that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the defendant's food-preparation counters complied with state and federal accessibility laws and thus denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant had argued that its Policy that required its staff to offer suitable accommodations for customers with disabilities (including, for example: (1) showing samples of the food to the customers in soufflé cups, (2) offering customers an opportunity to see and even sample food at a table in the dining area, (3) describing foods and food preparation processes to customers if they wished, or (4) any combination of above accommodations that was requested or appropriate) provided \"equivalent facilitation\" under Section 7.2(2)(iii) of the ADA.\n\nAs for parking, the court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiff's ADA claims, since the defendant cured the defects in both parking lots and only injunctive relief was available under the ADA. On the state law claims, the court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and granted the plaintiff's because it was undisputed that parking at both restaurants previously violated the ADAAG and therefore, the Unruh Act and the California Disabled Persons Act (DPA). \n\nThe court denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on his claim that the tables at both restaurants violated the ADA because these claims were not part of the Complaint or any timely amendment to the Complaint.\n\nThe court also granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiff's claims relating to the entrances at the San Diego restaurant and the bathrooms at both restaurants. \n\nThe court denied motions to reconsider by both parties. 2007 WL 2456223 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 23, 2007). \n\nOn Sept. 6, 2007, the defendant moved to consolidate cases for trial. At this time, the individual case was already ready for trial, and the class action was still in the formative stages. On Sept. 7, 2007, the Court found that consolidation for purposes of trial was not merited because the potential for delay and prejudice outweighed any savings of time or effort. 2007 WL 2669531 (Sept. 7, 2007). The cases remained consolidated for discovery purposes.\n\nA four-day bench trial was held in late November 2007 and early December to determine the following issues: (1) whether the defendant’s prior practice of accommodating customers with disabilities constituted equivalent facilitation; (2) whether the Policy constituted equivalent facilitation; (3) whether the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction requiring the defendant to lower the wall in front of the restaurants’ food preparation counters; and (4) the amount of damages, if any, that the plaintiff is entitled to under the California Disabled Persons Act (CDPA) based on his visits to the restaurants.\n\nOn Jan. 10, 2008, Judge Jones concluded that the defendant's prior practice of informally accommodating customers had been insufficient to comply with the ADA, but that the Policy was sufficient. The court also found that the plaintiff was not entitled to an injunction requiring the defendant to lower the wall, but that the plaintiff was entitled to $5,000 in damages for the occasions on which he encountered barriers to his entrance into the restaurants. 2008 WL 111052 (S.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2008). \n\nOn Apr. 21, 2008, the court denied the plaintiff's motion to amend findings of facts and for additional findings of fact. Later that month or in May 2008, the plaintiff appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the defendant cross-appealed.\n\nOn Feb. 6, 2009, Judge Jones awarded attorneys' fees to the plaintiff in the amount of $136,537.83, less than a quarter of the $550,651.33 in fees and costs the plaintiff had sought, and ordered the parties to pay their own costs. The plaintiff appealed, and on May 15, 2009, Judge Jones ordered a stay regarding attorneys' fees pending the decision of the Court of Appeals. 2009 WL 1390811 (S.D. Cal. May 15, 2009). During this period, Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz replaced Judge Jones as the district judge assigned to the case. \n\nAfter a hearing on Nov. 16, 2010, the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's decision that the Policy was compliant with the ADA, finding that the Policy was not equivalent because the “substitute experience” for disabled customers lacked the customers’ personal participation in the selection and preparation of the food that the full “Chipotle Experience” furnished and, therefore, violated the ADA. The Ninth Circuit remanded to the district court to determine the scope of injunctive relief necessary to remedy the plaintiff's inability to view the food preparation counters.\n\nOn Nov. 18, 2010, the Ninth Circuit awarded attorneys’ fees on appeal to the plaintiff, and referred the determination of the appropriate amount of fees to the court’s special master, Appellate Commissioner Peter L. Shaw. \n\nOn Nov. 29, 2010, Judge Moskowitz entered judgment against the defendant for violation of the ADA. The district court declined to enter injunctive relief, as the defendant represented that its food-preparation counters at all of the defendant's restaurants in California, including the two restaurants at issue in this case, had been lowered to a suitable height that made them visible to wheelchair-bound customers. Because the defendant had not yet furnished evidence of these modifications or that the modifications would be permanent, the court ordered that limited discovery and briefing take place. Judge Moskowitz referred the question of additional damages to the magistrate judge for a settlement conference. Finally, the court found that the plaintiff was entitled to more than the $136,357.83 in attorneys' fees awarded in the original district court action, but would wait to determine the amount until the other issues were resolved. \n\nThe plaintiff moved for summary judgment, on Apr. 22, 2011, and for attorneys' fees, on Apr. 29, 2011. \n\nThe plaintiff died on May 9, 2011, and on May 20, 2011, his widow and successor in interest to the claim filed a motion to substitute the plaintiff, and the motion was granted. \n\nOn Mar. 21, 2012, Judge Moskowitz granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees and expenses. The plaintiff's death rendered moot any claim for injunctive relief under Title III of the ADA, thus the court denied the requested injunction requiring the defendant to maintain the current heights of the walls at the food preparation areas. \n\nRegarding damages, California Civil Code § 54.3 entitled a CDPA plaintiff to statutory minimum damages award of $1,000 for \"each offense\" established by the plaintiff. Upon determining that the defendant's unwritten policy constituted a violation of the ADA (and thus the CDPA as well) and that the original plaintiff had made five \"bona fide\" visits to the defendant's restaurants while that policy was in effect, the district court granted the plaintiff's request for $5,000 in statutory damages for each of his \"bona fide\" visits to the restaurant. Previously, on appeal, the Ninth Circuit had vacated the damages award and remanded for further proceedings. On remand, the plaintiff sought an additional $3,000 in damages because the original plaintiff had made three additional visits for the purposes of gathering evidence for this litigation. Here, the district court denied the plaintiff's request for $3,000 in additional damages, finding that these litigation-related visits should not be considered for the purposes of assessing damages, as he admitted in his deposition that his goal during the visits was to have bad experiences, and \"allowing § 54.3 statutory damages for visits made with the <i>express</i> intention of advancing a CDPA plaintiff's position in litigation would enable CDPA plaintiffs essentially to write their own damages check.\" 2012 WL 12845619 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 21, 2012).\n\nLast, the court denied the plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees without prejudice, finding that it was premature. \n\nOn May 2, 2012, the plaintiff entered another motion for attorneys’ fees.  On July 17, 2012, Judge Moskowitz granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff’s motion. The court granted the plaintiff an award of $545,079.05 in attorneys' fees and costs (in addition to the $5,000 in statutory damages). The plaintiff filed a motion in the Ninth Circuit for attorneys' fees and costs and was awarded an additional $353,469.95 in attorneys’ fees and expenses related to the appeals work that took place in 2008-2010.\n\nAs of January 22, 2014, the case appears to be closed.",

    "summary/long": "In the fall of 2018, Florida voters amended the Florida Constitution, restoring voting rights to most people convicted of felonies “upon completion of all terms of sentence, including parole or probation.”  (This excluded people convicted of murder or sexual offenses.)  On June 28, 2019, Governor Ron DeSantis signed Senate Bill 7066 into law, defining “all terms of sentence” to include payment of all conviction-related restitution, fines, fees, and costs (“legal financial obligations”).  People who could not determine the amount of their obligations, or who could not afford to pay them, were effectively disenfranchised.\n\nIn June and July 2019, five lawsuits were filed challenging SB7066: \n<ul> <li>June 15, <i>Mendez v. DeSantis</i></li> <li>June 28, <i>Jones v. DeSantis</i></li> <li>June 28, <i>Raysor v. Lee</i></li> <li>June 28, <i>Gruver v. Barton</i></li> <li>July 1, <i>  McCoy v. DeSantis</i></li> </ul> All five suits, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida, were assigned to Chief Judge Mark Walker.  Consolidated on June 30, 2019 for purposes of case management, they were ultimately tried together as a single consolidated case.  Chief Judge Walker recused himself on July 17, 2019, because his wife’s law firm had been retained to represent one of the defendants.  The consolidated case was reassigned to Judge Robert L. Hinkle.\n\nThe plaintiffs were 19 individuals, the League of Women Voters of Florida, the NAACP Florida State Conference, and the Orange County Branch of the NAACP.  Each group of plaintiffs advanced different legal theories and named different defendants.  Combined, the consolidated suit named as defendants Governor DeSantis, his Secretary of State, and the Supervisor of Elections for each county where an individual plaintiff resided.  The consolidated suit alleged that SB7066 violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution; the First, Eighth, Fourteenth, and Twenty-Fourth Amendments; the National Voter Registration Act; and the Florida Constitution.  The plaintiffs, represented by the Brennan Center for Justice, the Campaign Legal Center, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ACLU, the ACLU of Florida, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief restoring their voting rights.\n\nIn their amended complaint of July 16, 2019, the <i>Raysor</i> plaintiffs sought class certification (which was eventually granted on April 7, 2020).  The proposed class included “all persons who would be eligible to vote in Florida but for unpaid financial obligations.”  Class members asserting that they were “genuinely unable to pay” would form a subclass. \n\nThe Governor petitioned the Florida Supreme Court on August 9, 2019 for an advisory opinion on the validity of SB7066.  The court’s <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2020-01/Supreme%20Court%20Opinion.pdf\">advisory opinion</a> of January 16, 2020 announced that the constitutional amendment’s language “all terms of sentence” would have been understood by Florida voters to include “all legal financial obligations imposed in conjunction with an adjudication of guilt.”  While awaiting this advisory opinion, the Governor unsuccessfully sought a stay of proceedings in the district court.\n\nOn August 15, 2019, the court denied the Supervisors of Elections’ motion to dismiss the case or to stay discovery.  The <i>Gruver</i> plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction the same day.  The injunction was granted on October 18, 2019, effective against all defendants except the Governor and the Supervisor of Elections for Orange County.  The injunction prohibited officials from taking any action to prevent the named plaintiffs from registering to vote (if they <i>asserted</i> inability to pay) or from voting (if they <i>demonstrated</i> their inability to pay).  Simultaneously, the court denied the Governor and the Secretary of State their motion to dismiss or abstain.  410 F. Supp. 3d 1284.  The Eleventh Circuit upheld on February 19, 2020.  950 F.3d 795.\n\nThe <i>Gruver</i> plaintiffs sought in late October to expand the preliminary injunction to cover four additional named plaintiffs who were seeking to vote in November municipal elections.  This motion was denied the first week of January 2020.\n\nIn the meantime, the district court partially stayed the injunction on December 19, 2019.  While still protecting the plaintiffs’ ability to <i>register</i>, the modified injunction did not guarantee their ability to <i>vote</i>.  This partial stay expired on February 11, 2020.  The Eleventh Circuit upheld the preliminary injunction on February 19, ruling that, among other things, the state’s pay-to-vote requirement should be analyzed under a standard of heightened scrutiny rather than rational basis review.  950 F.3d 795.\n \nOn March 30, 2020, the court denied the state defendants’ motion for summary judgment, but dismissed the plaintiffs’ abandoned Ex Post Facto and Florida Constitution claims.  The plaintiffs’ class certification motion was granted the following week, on April 7 (not in time for class members to vote in the March 2020 presidential primaries).\n\nThe trial was held from April 27–May 6 by videoconference (due to the COVID-19 pandemic). The court issued its opinion on the merits on May 24, 2020.  Ruling that the state was in violation of the Fourteenth and Twenty-Fourth Amendments and the National Voter Registration Act, the court declared Florida’s requirements unconstitutional as applied to: those who could not vote because they could not afford to pay; those who could not vote because the amount to pay was unknown and “cannot be determined with diligence”; and those who could not vote because they owed the state “fees” or “costs.”  However, a requirement to pay “fines and restitution…is not unconstitutional as applied to those who are able to pay.”  The court named each plaintiff and specifically declared his or her eligibility to vote.  It ruled that the plaintiffs in <i>McCoy</i>, <i>Raysor</i>, and <i>Gruver</i> could collect attorneys’ fees and costs (the plaintiffs in <i>Jones</i> and <i>Mendez</i> had not actively participated in the majority of the litigation).  \n\nAs to the class and the subclass, the court issued an injunction requiring the state to create and advertise a form for obtaining an individual advisory opinion on voting eligibility.  The injunction specified that if the state failed to respond to an individual submission within 21 days, the person would be automatically eligible to vote.  It further directed the state to publish requirements for voting eligibility following a felony conviction.\n\nThe court explicitly retained jurisdiction to enforce the declaration and injunction.\n\nThe state defendants appealed the ruling on June 1, 2020.  On June 14, the district court denied their motion to stay the ruling pending appeal.  On July 1, the Eleventh Circuit granted the state’s motion for initial hearing <i>en banc</i> (that is, before the entire court, rather than a panel of three judges).  Without explanation, it also granted a stay of the district court’s injunction, pending appeal.  The Supreme Court, also without explanation and over a dissent by Justices Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and Kagan, denied a request to lift the stay.\n\nOn July 15, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion in the Eleventh Circuit seeking to disqualify 3 of the court’s 12 judges from hearing the appeal.  Judges Lagoa and Luck had been justices of the Florida Supreme Court when it issued its advisory opinion in this case in August 2019; both had committed to the United States Senate that they would recuse themselves from cases in which they had previously played a role.  Judge Brasher, as the Solicitor General of Alabama, had vigorously <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15502\">defended Alabama against a similar lawsuit</a> shortly before his appointment to the federal judiciary.\n\nJudge Brasher disqualified himself on July 21, 2020, but denied the plaintiffs’ motion to disqualify as moot: he emphasized that he was recusing because of his chambers policy, not as a result of the plaintiffs’ motion.  Judges Lagoa and Luck denied the motion to disqualify on July 27, 2020.\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit heard oral arguments on August 18, 2020. On September 11, 2020, the court issued an opinion that reversed the judgment of the district court on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to prove Constitutional violation. \n\nThe court held that: (1) the amendment and the statute did not violate Equal Protection Clause; (2) the amendment and the statute did not violate Twenty-Fourth Amendment; (3) felon re-enfranchisement laws were not void for vagueness; and (4) the amendment and the statute did not deny the plaintiffs' rights to procedural due process. \n\nBecause section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment expressly allows for felon disenfranchisment, the Supreme Court had held in <i>Richardson v. Ramirez</i> that the Equal Protection Clause does not forbid it. Applying that precedent, the court held that Florida's Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause under rational basis review. Additionally, the court held that because court costs and fees are legitimate parts of a criminal sentence, there was no basis to regard them as a tax. As such, the laws did not disenfranchise the individuals for failure to pay a tax, but rather because they had not \"satisfied the demands of justice\" as mandated by state statute. The state's justification for these voting requirements qualified as a constitutionally legitimate interest. Therefore the statutes satisfied the requirements of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. Lastly, the criminal processes necessary for a conviction were sufficient to justify denying individuals the right to vote. The deprivation was a consequence of a felony conviction in Florida, so the court upheld Florida's conditional restoration of the right to vote.\n\nThe appeals court reversed the judgment of the district court and vacated the challenged portions of its injunction. Additionally, the Ninth Circuit severed and lifted the stay of the cross-appeal (Case No. 20-12304). This cross-appeal had been filed on June 19, 2020 by the plaintiffs in the <i>McCoy</i> case, which has been consolidated earlier in the litigation. \n\nOn October 21, 2020, the plaintiffs in the <i>McCoy</i> case filed an opening brief for the cross appeal on the questions of (1) whether a Nineteenth Amendment claim requires proof of discriminatory intent and (2) the appropriateness of the test applied by the lower court to the equal protection claims, given that the plaintiffs in <i>McCoy</i> are women.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This lawsuit was filed in the Central District of California on July 18, 2002, by the class of children and young adults who (a) are in the custody of Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services; (b) have a behavioral, emotional, or psychiatric impairment; and (c) need individualized mental health services.  The suit is against County and State agencies for neglecting their responsibilities to provide mental health care services to foster children in California.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the State and Los Angeles County under provisions of the Medicaid Act, Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT), 42 U.S.C. § 1396; the Substantive Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; Article I, section 7(a) of the California Constitution; the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701; and California Government Code § 11135.   Plaintiffs are represented by the ACLU of Southern California, Center for Public Interest, Western Center for Law and Poverty, Protection & Advocacy, Inc., Youth Law Center, and Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. \n\nIn March 2003, Plaintiffs and L.A. County began settlement negotiations.  On June 19, 2003, United States District Judge A. Howard Matz certified class status, and on July 16, 2003, the Court approved a jointly submitted settlement agreement as fair, reasonable, and adequate.  The settlement agreement has four objectives: (1) to facilitate a provision of services delivered in a coordinated, comprehensive, community-based fashion; (2) to support the development and delivery of a service structure and fiscal system that supports core practices and services model; (3) to support an effective and sustainable solution that will involve standards and methods to achieve quality-based oversight; and (4) to address the need for certain class members with more intensive needs to receive medically necessary mental health services in their own home, a family settings, or the most homelike setting appropriate to their needs, in order to facilitate reunification, and to meet their needs for safety, permanence, and well-being. \n\nPursuant to the Agreement, the parties to the settlement appointed a six-member expert advisory panel to determine whether the County met the objectives set forth and implemented the plans. The Panel was required to make regular written reports to the parties and Court of its findings and recommendations. In August 2005, the Panel issued a two-year report finding that the County had not complied with the terms of the Agreement. \n\nBecause the state agencies did not participate in the settlement, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction against them on September 15, 2005. Judge Matz granted the motion on March 14, 2006, ordering the State to provide \"wraparound services\" and \"therapeutic foster care,\" to thousands of Medi-Cal eligible children who are in foster care or at risk of foster care placement. There are approximately 85,000 children in foster care in California and an even greater number of children served by the child welfare system in their own homes. The court's order extends to both groups of children.  \n\n(In the meantime, on February 16, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Compel Compliance with the Settlement Agreement against LA County. In November 2006, Judge Matz ordered the County to address deficiencies in its implementation plan.)\n\nThe State of California appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On March 23, 2007, the Ninth Circuit vacated the March 14th, 2006, preliminary injunction, holding that Judge Matz had erroneously interpreted the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions of the Medicaid Act by not \"explor[ing] the possibility that the State might only have an obligation to fund the component services of wraparound and TFC, rather than to offer the coordinated complex of services in a single package.\" Katie A. v. Bonta, 481 F.3d 1150 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\nAfter further discovery, Plaintiffs filed another Motion for Preliminary Injunction against the state defendants on January 11, 2008. In response, the Court ruled that wraparound services are Medi-Cal eligible and ordered the parties to address how to provide and bill for those services. A Special Master was appointed in March 2009 to facilitate a settlement between the parties.\n\nThe parties reached a settlement agreement in December 2011, which included the development of an Implementation Plan to be evaluated by the Special Master. The agreement included a payment of $3.75 million in attorneys' fees, including costs and expenses, to plaintiffs' counsel. The parties developed a two-phase Implementation Plan. On August 28, 2012, the Special Master informed the District Court that he found the Implementation Plan reasonably and sufficiently calculated to meet the objectives of the agreement, and the Court accepted his recommendations on September 13, 2012. \n\nThe Special Master and Advisory Panel continued to monitor and report on the completion of the Implementation Plan. \n\nIn light of the fact that the District Court's jurisdiction was scheduled to end in December 2014, the Special Master put forth a set of recommendations in his report on September 26, 2014 to sustain the growth in the development and delivery of the intensive services agreed to by the parties. The Special Master submitted a final report to the Court on November 20, 2014. The report identified areas of progress and growth, but also found that there remained significant unfinished deliverables from the settlement agreement and identified the key activities the State should begin or continue implementing.\n\nA status conference was held on November 24, 2014. Judge John A. Kronstadt determined that there was no need for the court to extend its jurisdiction at that time. Subsequently, in August of 2015, Judge Kronstadt issued a minute order stating that while the parties should continue to file reports consistent with the implementation of the settlement, the matter was considered closed. As of October 19, 2017, the parties had stipulated, with approval from the court, that the Panel monitoring L.A. County's progress toward implementation of the settlement agreement should continue to operate through December 31, 2018.\n\nOn December 21, 2018, the Panel issued its report for 2017. The plaintiff then filed this report with the court on January 23, 2019. The 2017 report identified major continuing concerns regarding the County's slow progress in implementing the settlement and uncertainty that County strategies would succeed in implementing the Shared Core Practice Model, which the report identified as a key strategy for compliance. The Panel noted its hope that the County's work would have developed data indicators that reflected progress towards full implementation, but because the County has concluded its data systems will not support those tasks, other strategies would be needed to improve performance. Among other things, the report was particularly troubled by the County's decision to change from using an Immersion Process, in which the Shared Core Practice Model would be fully implanted in only a few offices every eighteen months, to instead deciding to use a countywide approach in an attempt to reform all 19 offices and 3 specialized units simultaneously. The Panel report expressed doubt that this approach would bring the County any closer to full implementation of the Shared Core Practice Model, and disapproved of the County's decision to make this change without first notifying the parties or Panel, both of which had treated the immersion approach as a part of the strategic plan. \n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the case is now closed.

    "summary/long": "On December 19, 2014, three Virginia prisoners placed in administrative segregation at Red Onion State Prison, filed this pro-se lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. The plaintiffs sued the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC), various VDOC prison officials, and the External Review Team, Dual Treatment Team, and Unit Management Team of the Virginia Department of Corrections. The plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Eighth Amendment. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the VDOC Operating Procedure 830.A, a self-described Segregation Reduction Step-Down Program designed to help prisoners progress in stages toward a return to the general prison population, violated plaintiffs’ rights. Specifically, they alleged that they had been assigned to the most restrictive status (“IM”) without adequate due process. Due to their classification, they had also been denied the opportunity to participate in the step down process. They claimed that the IM classified prisoners were treated in a discriminatory manner as compared to other prisoners in administrative segregation, and that these conditions of confinement constituted cruel and unusual punishment. They sought to abolish the procedure, be reassigned to a lower classification, and to be granted monetary damages. \n\nOn January 14, 2015, the plaintiffs moved to certify a class and to appoint counsel. On March 6, 2015, District Judge James P. Jones denied both these motions, finding that the circumstances were not “exceptional” so as to justify appointing counsel. Therefore, because the plaintiffs were still bringing the case pro-se, Judge Jones found it inappropriate to grant class certification. \n\nOn April 8, 2015, Magistrate Judge Robert S. Ballou severed this action into three separate civil suits, one for each plaintiff; the immediate case is for the named plaintiff’s action. Judge Ballou held that the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) required prisoners to file separate filing fees. The purpose of the act was to force “prisoners to think twice” before filing civil litigation. \n\nThe court subsequently filed the original complaint under separate dockets for the two other plaintiffs. Both cases were referred to Magistrate Judge Ballou. He dismissed one case (Velazquez v. Virginia Department of Corrections, 7:15-cv-00157-JPJ-RSB) on September 27, 2016. The plaintiff in the other case (Rivera v. Virginia Department of Corrections, 7:15-cv-00235-JPJ-RSB) moved to voluntarily withdraw his action on May 28, 2015.\n\nOn May 18, 2016, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. In it, he alleged that OP 830.A discriminated against IM inmates, who suffered a much more restrictive environment than inmates in other forms of administrative segregation; that IM status permanently prevented an inmate from working his way out of segregated confinement; that officials arbitrarily assigned him to IM status without allowing him to be present or offer argument, contradictory testimony, witnesses, or evidence; that review between the various privilege level status steps was not meaningful; that spiteful officers could falsely report poor behavior or fail to accurately record participation in programming, thus preventing progress to the next step; and that officers routinely approved their own recommendations during the step-down program reviews, in violation of VDOC policy. The plaintiff also complained that OP 830.A affected inmates’ opportunities for parole and earning good conduct time.\n\nOn July 28, 2016 the defendants filed a motion for summary judgement. On September 28, 2016, Judge Jones granted the defendants’ motion. He held that the plaintiff had failed to show that his conditions of confinement were atypical or significantly harsh as compared to conditions expected within a prison environment. Nor, according to Judge Jones, had the plaintiff shown that the procedure violated his due process rights. Moreover, Judge Jones rejected the plaintiff’s equal protection claim because he held that the plaintiff was not similarly situated to the other prisoners in less restrictive confinement. Judge Jones dismissed all claims against the Virginia Department of Corrections as legally frivolous, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b)(1). He held that neither the Commonwealth of Virginia nor any governmental entity acting as an arm of the state, such as the VDOC, was a “person” subject to suit under § 1983. 2016 WL 5415903. \n\nOn October 6, 2016, the plaintiff appealed the district court’s September 28th ruling to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On March 30, 2017, the Circuit Court assigned counsel for the plaintiff. On October 26, 2017, oral arguments were held before Judges Paul V. Niemeyer, Robert B. King, and Henry F. Floyd. On November 22, 2017, the Circuit Court panel, in an unpublished per curiam opinion, affirmed the judgment on the reasoning of the district court. The case is now closed.",

    "summary/long": "On January 19, 2006, a death-sentenced inmate of the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center in Baltimore, Maryland filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Maryland Department of Correction in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.  The plaintiff, whose execution was scheduled to take place during the week of February 6, 2006, sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from carrying out his execution using their current practices and procedures for lethal injection.  The plaintiff's specific objection was to the three-drug cocktail (sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) used in Maryland's lethal injections.  He alleged that particular skill was required to properly administer sodium pentothal, which was intended to induce general anesthesia, and that improper administration of the drug would lead to excruciating, torturous pain during the administration of the other two drugs.  Due to this, the plaintiff argued that the defendants' lethal injection procedures arbitrarily and unnecessarily created a grave risk that he would suffer extreme pain during his execution, thus violating his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  \n\nThe next day, the plaintiff filed a similar complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, naming as co-plaintiffs the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Maryland (ACLU), and the Maryland Citizens Against State Executions (MCASE).  In this complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had failed to follow Maryland law (Md. Code Ann., State Gov't §3-905) in adopting their execution protocol because it had not been formally adopted under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA), thereby depriving the state's citizens of the opportunity to ensure that executions were carried out in a proper and humane manner and increasing the risk that the executed prisoners would suffer unnecessarily during their executions.  They asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order and to enjoin the defendants from performing any executions until they had come into compliance with the law.  \n\nOn February 1, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Judge Benson Everett Legg) denied both the plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order and his motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that Maryland's three-drug protocol did not endanger the plaintiff's constitutional rights.  The court reasoned that thirty-five of the thirty-seven states who used lethal injection as a means of execution used the same protocol as Maryland, and that the Fourth Circuit had already ruled that this protocol did not run afoul of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.  \n\nThe plaintiff appealed the following day, asking the District Court to stay the execution pending the outcome of the appeal.  On the same day, the District Court (Judge Legg) denied the request to stay the execution.  On February 3, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Judge James Harvie Wilkinson III) denied without opinion the plaintiff's motion for an injunction pending appeal.  \n\nOn February 13, the plaintiff asked the Fourth Circuit to dismiss the appeal, and on February 15, 2006, the Fourth Circuit (Judge Wilkinson) granted that motion.  \n\nFrom September 19-22, 2006, the U.S. District Court held an evidentiary hearing, and both sides filed motions for summary judgment.  On December 1, 2006, the District Court ordered the defendants to explore the potential availability of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and certified registered nurse anesthetists to assist in the execution.  On December 7, 2006, the Court ordered the defendants to submit a written plan describing the parameters of a proposed search.  \n\nMeanwhile, on December 19, 2006, the Maryland Court of Appeals invalidated the Maryland execution protocols until such time as they were properly adopted under the MAPA or exempted from that requirement by an act of the Maryland General Assembly.  The court enjoined the defendants from utilizing its current lethal injection protocol and checklist until one of these two events occurred.  Evans v. Saar, 396 Md. 256 (Md. Ct. App. 2006).\n\nOn January 29, 2007, Senate Bill 239 was introduced in the Maryland General Assembly and assigned to committee.  If adopted that bill would exempt the death penalty protocols from the requirements of the MAPA.  On the same day, House Bill 225 was introduced in the Maryland General Assembly and assigned to committee.  If adopted, that bill would repeal the death penalty in Maryland.  In light of these rapid changes, the parties issued a joint motion asking the District Court to stay the proceedings in this case until the passage of one of the two proposed bills in the legislature.  On February 21, 2007, the District Court agreed to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the legislation and ordered the parties to file a status report every 90 days.\n\nOn March 14, 2011, the parties filed a joint status report pursuant to the Court's order of February 22, 2007. The status report stated that all executions in Maryland had been stayed until the administrative regulations governing the death penalty process are properly adopted. On August 16, 2012 the Court ordered that the case be administratively closed. Subsequently, in May 2013, the Maryland legislature repealed the death penalty for all future convictions, and in December 2014 Governor O'Malley <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/gov-omalley-commutes-sentences-of-marylands-remaining-death-row-inmates/2014/12/31/044b553a-90ff-11e4-a412-4b735edc7175_story.html\">commuted the death sentences </a>of the four remaining death-row inmates to life without the possibility of parole. \n\n",

    "summary/long": "In 1989, Children's Rights and the ACLU filed a federal class action on behalf of children placed in foster care under the supervision of the District of Columbia's Department of Human Services (DHS), and abused and neglected children who are (or should be) known to DHS by virtue of abuse or neglect. The case asserted violations of Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, due process, the District of Columbia Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act of 1977, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and the District of Columbia Youth Residential Facilities Licensor Act of 1986.\n\nIn 1991, Judge Thomas F. Hogan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia approved a negotiated remedial order following trial and a liability judgment against the defendant. LaShawn A. v. Dixon, 762 F. Supp. 959 (D.D.C. 1991).  Under the consent decree DHS agreed to develop policies and procedures in the areas of protective services; family preservation and preventive services; child placement; case reviews; adoption; staffing (qualifications, training, and caseload standards); resource development (foster homes, adoptive homes, and community based services); contracts with private providers and agencies; and development of a uniform computerized information system.\n\nThe decision was appealed and remanded a number of times. The District of Columbia argued that the remedy sought by the plaintiffs could not be provided under federal law; the Court of Appeals instructed the district court to modify the consent order to be based entirely on local law. LaShawn A. v. Kelly, 990 F.2d 1319 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The district court kept the entire content of the order finding that local law provided adequate support for the measures in the decree.\n\nIn October 1994, the plaintiffs filed a contempt motion, and the court ordered the creation of a limited receivership to address specific problems.  In 1995, the judge found defendants in contempt of court and granted plaintiffs' request for appointment of a general receiver who would run the department. LaShawn A. v. Kelly, 887 F. Supp. 297 (D.D.C. 1995).\n \nThe District made another appeal, this time regarding orders of receivership. The Court of Appeals found two orders moot, but held that the district court could not direct the receiver to disregard District law even if it interfered with the receiver's discharge of her responsibilities. LaShawn A. v. Barry, 107 F.3d 923 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\nIn June 2001, the parties proposed and the court agreed to terminate the receivership and appoint a monitor. In addition, the District agreed to create of a new agency, the Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA), with cabinet-level control of child welfare matters and consolidated jurisdiction over neglect and abuse cases.  The District also agreed to fund additional lawyers to represent the CFSA in Superior Court and a variety of child welfare reforms.\n\nIn May 2003, the monitor issued a post-Receivership Implementation Plan, a comprehensive outline for reform negotiated among plaintiffs, CFSA, the District mayor, and the court monitor.  The Plan envisioned that by December 2006, defendants would fully comply with the district court's 1991 remedial order.\n\nThe monitor continued to assess defendants' progress in 2004 and 2005.  At one point during this period, the District failed to maintain an adequate number of attorneys on staff, and this failure apparently led to a severe case backlog for children who had a permanency goal of adoption. CFSA addressed the backlog and was required to ensure that such a backlog not recur.\n\nIn December 2006 (the Implementation Plan deadline), despite numerous marked improvements, CFSA had failed to comply fully with several benchmarks. Accordingly, in February 2007, the court approved a jointly-submitted Amended Implementation Plan, which established a new reform deadline of December 2008 and required CFSA to produce annual strategy plans in 2007 and 2008.\n\nSetbacks in the reform effort prompted plaintiffs to file a contempt motion against the District in July 2008. The motion cited chronic problems, including a large backlog of unresolved abuse and neglect investigations, failure to move children into permanent homes on a timely basis, and frequent moves for children in foster care.  \n\nIn an attempt to resolve these problems, the parties negotiated yet another stipulated order, approved by the Court in October 2008.  The stipulated order set forth a number of requirements that CFSA was to meet by January 2009. However, CFSA was unable to meet these requirements, and plaintiffs renewed their contempt motion in January 2009.\n\nIn April 2010, the court ruled on plaintiffs' motion, holding the District and its mayor in contempt. LaShawn A. v. Fenty, 701 F. Supp. 2d 84 (D.D.C. 2010). The ruling cited the District's failure to implement an annual strategy plan approved by the court-appointed monitor and specifically mentioned the Mayor's failure to consult with the monitor or with plaintiffs' counsel as stipulated in the 2008 order.  In addition, the court rejected defendants' argument that under Horne v. Flores, 129 S.Ct. 2579 (2009), the consent decree should be terminated altogether. The court also ordered that more funds be allocated to assist children aging out of the foster care system.  Defendants appealed the district court's decision; the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling in February 2011. LaShawn A. v. Gray, 412 F. App'x 315 (D.C. Cir. 2011). \n\nIn December 2010, the Court approved another Implementation and Exit Plan, superseding the 2007 Amended Implementation Plan. This document set forth which outcomes needed to be maintained, which outcomes still needed to be achieved, and a strategy plan for exiting the consent decree. In accordance with this new plan, CFSA developed strategy plans in each year after 2012 to develop means to achieve compliance and exit. Regular six-month monitoring reports were filed. \n\nThe parties submitted a joint motion for an order approving an Exit and Sustainability plan on August 29, 2019, which was approved by the court on October 31, 2019. The plan included 19 outcomes to be achieved, self-regulation and public reporting commitments, and placement array commitments. The court monitor would continue to provide monthly review. The exit plan also detailed that the defendants may independently seek to exit court supervision after they had maintained all outcomes to be achieved for two consecutive six-month reporting periods, by petitioning the court, or by other court order. \n\nAs of May 20, 2020, reporting continues, and the case is ongoing.
