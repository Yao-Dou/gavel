    "46567": "G.M.G., a Venezuelan national detained in Rhode Island, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against President Trump and several federal agencies and officials in May 2025. The lawsuit challenges the President’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) through a Proclamation targeting individuals allegedly associated with the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua (TdA). G.M.G. argues the Proclamation is unlawful because it applies the AEA to a criminal gang rather than a foreign nation or government, and because it bypasses established immigration procedures and fails to provide adequate due process, including a meaningful opportunity to contest designation as a TdA member or seek protection from torture.\n\nThe Petitioner alleges the government secretly attempted to remove individuals under the Proclamation without proper notice, leading to a temporary restraining order issued by a D.C. court, which was later vacated by the Supreme Court, but with a stipulation that those subject to the Proclamation were entitled to due process and adequate notice before removal. The lawsuit seeks to prevent G.M.G.’s potential removal under the Proclamation and to challenge the Proclamation’s validity.\n\nFollowing the filing of the petition and motion for a temporary restraining order, District Judge Melissa R. DuBose issued orders temporarily preventing G.M.G.’s removal from the District of Rhode Island without advance notice to the court and the Petitioner. The court held a hearing on the matter and amended the initial order to require 72 hours’ notice on business days before any transfer. The government has filed appearances on behalf of all Respondents. The transcript of the hearing is pending redaction.",
    "46582": "Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian woman lawfully present in the United States, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, along with a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, against Kristi Noem (Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security), Pamela Bondi (Attorney General), Todd Lyons (Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement), Josh Johnson (Acting Director of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations Dallas Field Office), and Thomas Bergami (Warden of the Prairieland Detention Facility) on April 30, 2025, in the Northern District of Texas. Kordia alleges she was detained in Texas after voluntarily appearing for an interview with ICE following her participation in a protest supporting Palestinian rights and a prior monetary transfer to family in Palestine. She argues this detention violates her First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association, as well as her Fifth Amendment rights to due process and religious freedom.\n\nKordia contends her arrest and detention are part of a broader effort by the current administration to suppress advocacy for Palestinian rights, citing executive orders and statements targeting such advocacy. She further alleges that ICE violated its own policies in her transfer to Texas, failing to consider her community ties and a prior assessment indicating she posed no flight risk or danger. She claims the Prairieland Detention Facility has failed to accommodate her religious needs, specifically providing halal meals and a proper space for prayer.\n\nThe government responded, defending its actions, and the court held a hearing on Kordia’s motion for a preliminary injunction on June 5, 2025. The court granted Kordia’s request to attend the hearing remotely and authorized live audio streaming of the proceedings for public access. The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation to grant the petition, but the case was recommitted to the magistrate judge for further findings after the parties presented new information. Multiple motions were filed regarding access to the docket and scheduling, and some attorneys were permitted to withdraw from the case. As of August 18, 2025, an amended complaint had been filed, and briefing on the amended complaint was ongoing. The core relief sought is Kordia’s release from detention pending a final judgment on the merits of her claims.",
    "46496": "This case originates from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) abrupt closure of three internal oversight offices – the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CISOM), and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) – on March 21, 2025. The plaintiffs, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, Southern Border Communities Coalition, and Urban Justice Center, filed suit alleging that these actions were *ultra vires* (beyond legal authority) and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. They asserted that Congress specifically mandated the existence and functions of these offices, and DHS lacked the authority to eliminate them unilaterally.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to restore the offices’ functions and prevent further dismantling, arguing they and their constituents would suffer irreparable harm without the oversight these offices provided. DHS maintained it was acting within its authority and had plans to restaff the offices, although the plaintiffs presented evidence suggesting the administration intended to eliminate funding for at least one of the offices in the upcoming fiscal year. The plaintiffs repeatedly expressed concern over inconsistent statements from DHS, first claiming the offices were being closed, then suggesting a plan for re-establishment, and ultimately revealing a budget proposal to eliminate one of the offices. \n\nThe court initially denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order but scheduled further proceedings. Ultimately, the court issued an order establishing a schedule for expedited discovery and briefing on cross-motions for summary judgment, effectively mooting the motion for a preliminary injunction. The case is now proceeding toward summary judgment, with a schedule established for administrative record submission, motions, and potential argument in January 2026. The central dispute remains whether DHS acted lawfully in dismantling these oversight offices and whether its subsequent actions demonstrate a good-faith effort to restore their functions.",
    "46432": "Mohammed H., a Bangladeshi national and student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in April 2025, challenging his detention by federal authorities. He alleged his detention violated his First Amendment rights, Fifth Amendment due process rights, and the Administrative Procedure Act, claiming he was targeted for expressing pro-Palestinian views. The government initially justified his detention based on a visa revocation linked to a prior misdemeanor, but the rationale shifted during the proceedings.\n\nUpon initial review, Judge Jerry W. Blackwell granted a temporary restraining order preventing the government from transferring or removing Mr. H. from Minnesota. After multiple extensions, and following a request from Mr. H., the court ordered his release on bail, finding a substantial likelihood of success on his constitutional claims and exceptional circumstances warranting release pending adjudication. The Court found the government’s justifications for detention lacked a sound legal basis and were suspect given the timing and context surrounding Mr. H.’s protected speech.\n\nUltimately, in June 2025, Judge Blackwell granted Mr. H.'s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, finding that his detention was unlawful. The court determined the government had not established a legitimate basis for the detention and found evidence suggestive of retaliatory action against Mr. H. for exercising his First Amendment rights. The government subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "46477": "This case originates from the abrupt termination of F-1 and M-1 student status records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) for thirty-one international students and recent graduates attending institutions across the United States. The students, acting as plaintiffs, filed suit against Kristi Noem (in her official capacity as DHS Secretary), Todd Lyons (Acting ICE Director), and Robert Lynch (Field Office Director) alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs argued that the terminations were arbitrary, capricious, and lacked a valid legal basis.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to compel the defendants to restore their SEVIS records to active status, preventing potential deportation or disruption to their studies and employment. The court granted a TRO on April 23, 2025, ordering the restoration of the records and barring the defendants from further adverse actions based on the terminations.\n\nFollowing the TRO, the court held hearings and considered further briefing on a request for a preliminary injunction. The court granted the preliminary injunction on May 7, 2025, finding that the plaintiffs demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their APA claim and would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction. The court noted that the government had not provided a clear legal justification for the terminations and that the restoration of the records, while helpful, did not fully eliminate the harm as the records still reflected a period of termination. \n\nThe defendants subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the Sixth Circuit. The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed claims on behalf of two students, Ronit Rajesh Shetty and Rita Mawuena Kpormego. The case remains pending on appeal.",
    "46239": "Erie County, New York, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Corporation for National and Community Service (AmeriCorps) and its interim agency head, Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, in March 2025. The County sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that AmeriCorps’s new requirements for grant recipients, stemming from Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 concerning “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” (DEI), were arbitrary, capricious, and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. Specifically, AmeriCorps requested grantees certify they did not promote DEI activities, which Erie County argued conflicted with its existing grant terms requiring a diverse advisory council.\n\nErie County had received a grant to fund a Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), which provides services to seniors. After the Executive Orders were issued, AmeriCorps requested Erie County to certify compliance with the new DEI directives. Erie County initially resisted, citing the conflict with its existing grant obligations and a preliminary injunction in a separate case temporarily blocking enforcement of the Executive Orders. After AmeriCorps clarified its position and the preliminary injunction was stayed, Erie County found itself in a position where it could either certify compliance (potentially falsely) or risk losing grant funding. \n\nAmeriCorps opposed the County’s motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that Erie County lacked jurisdiction and had not demonstrated imminent irreparable harm. Ultimately, Erie County voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice in April 2025 after AmeriCorps changed its certification requirements, rendering the dispute moot.",
    "46230": "This case originated from a complaint filed on March 14, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by twelve nonpartisan career civil servants (Plaintiffs) employed within the Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Equity Assurance (OEA) against Douglas A. Collins, in his capacity as Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Defendant). The Plaintiffs alleged violations of their First and Fifth Amendment rights and the Administrative Procedure Act stemming from the Defendant’s actions following the issuance of Executive Order 14151, which aimed to end “radical and wasteful government DEI programs.”\n\nThe core dispute centered on the Defendant’s designation of the OEA as a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) office and the subsequent placement of the Plaintiffs on administrative leave, followed by a notice of potential termination through a Reduction in Force (RIF). Plaintiffs argued this action was retaliatory, based on a perceived viewpoint, and violated their due process rights. They asserted that the OEA’s work focused on ensuring equitable access to benefits for Veterans and was unrelated to the criticized DEIA programs. The Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the Defendant from designating the OEA as a DEIA office and blocking their access to employment benefits and opportunities. \n\nThe Defendant countered that the actions were taken in accordance with the Executive Order and applicable regulations, and that the RIF process was being followed correctly. The Plaintiffs submitted evidence alleging irregularities in the application of RIF procedures and potential interference with their ability to seek reassignment within the VA. \n\nOn May 2, 2025, the Court denied the Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order. The case was subsequently voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on July 17, 2025.",
    "46242": "BlueRibbon Coalition, Inc., Sage Riders Motorcycle Club, and Paul Wells filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Department of the Interior challenging the December 2024 San Rafael Swell Travel Management Plan (TMP). The plaintiffs allege the TMP unlawfully restricts motorized vehicle access, violates the Dingell Act by creating *de facto* wilderness areas and buffer zones, and fails to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). They seek to overturn the TMP and restore broader access to motorized trails within the San Rafael Swell area.\n\nThe Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA) subsequently filed a motion to intervene as a defendant in the case, arguing its substantial interest in protecting the area's sensitive lands from motorized vehicle damage. SUWA’s motion was granted by the court, recognizing its long-standing advocacy for the region and the potential for its interests to diverge from those of the BLM. \n\nThe case centers on a 1.1 million-acre area in southeastern Utah, where the BLM designated 1,496 miles for motorized use and closed 665 miles, a decision stemming from a prior settlement agreement requiring a new travel management plan. Plaintiffs contend the BLM improperly relied on outdated data and ignored public comments, while SUWA supports the restrictions as a means of protecting the area's natural and cultural resources. Currently, the court has established a briefing schedule for the plaintiffs' claims and SUWA’s participation as an intervenor-defendant.",
    "46039": "This case originated with a complaint filed on February 4, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by the Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association (FBIAA), along with individual plaintiffs (John and Jane Does 1-9), against the Department of Justice and the United States of America. The plaintiffs alleged unlawful retaliation for their involvement in investigations related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, specifically fearing the disclosure of their personal information and potential harm from those investigated. The Complaint asserted claims under the Privacy Act, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the First Amendment, seeking injunctive relief to prevent the disclosure of their information and declaratory relief.\n\nThe FBIAA and individual plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the Department of Justice from disseminating a list of FBI personnel involved in the January 6th investigations and related prosecutions. The Department of Justice opposed the motion, arguing the information request was lawful under the Privacy Act and that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm.\n\nThe Court initially issued an administrative stay to preserve the status quo pending further consideration. Subsequently, with the consent of the parties, the Court entered a consent order on February 7, 2025, prohibiting the government from disseminating the list to the public before a ruling on a preliminary injunction. The court then vacated the administrative stay and scheduled a hearing on a motion for preliminary injunction, which was ultimately not pursued. The case was then voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs on February 23, 2025, with a stipulation filed on April 9, 2025, dismissing John Doe #4 as a plaintiff.",
    "46681": "Gary L. Barnes, a private citizen, filed a complaint in the United States Court of International Trade on February 3, 2025, against the United States, specifically President Donald Trump, challenging the constitutionality of tariffs imposed on goods from Mexico, Canada, and China. Barnes alleged that the President’s imposition of these tariffs, through a series of Executive Orders, violated the U.S. Constitution by infringing on Congress’s power to regulate trade and raise revenue, as outlined in Article I, Sections 7 and 8. The complaint centered on the claim that the President was exceeding his authority and violating a “constitutional contract.”\n\nThe United States filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on March 21, 2025, arguing that Barnes lacked standing to bring the suit. The Government contended that Barnes had not demonstrated a concrete and particularized injury, and that any alleged injury was not directly traceable to the tariffs or redressable by a court decision. Barnes responded, asserting his right to challenge unconstitutional actions by the President, but the Government maintained that his claim was based on a generalized grievance not sufficient for standing. \n\nOn May 23, 2025, the Court granted the United States’ motion to dismiss, finding that Barnes lacked Article III standing. The Court found that Barnes’s claim of a breach of the “constitutional contract” did not constitute a concrete and particularized injury. However, the Court dismissed the case *without prejudice*, allowing Barnes to file an amended complaint addressing the deficiencies. Barnes subsequently filed a request to have the decision reversed, and the Court allowed the Defendant to file a response. On July 1, 2025, the Court ordered the Defendant to file an answer to Barnes's amended complaint or a renewed motion to dismiss. The Defendant filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to oppose Barnes’s motion for reconsideration on July 21, 2025, and Barnes responded on August 11, 2025.",
    "46758": "This case originated with a petition for habeas corpus and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief filed on June 20, 2025, by several individual plaintiffs and organizational plaintiffs (United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Los Angeles Worker Center Network, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center) against various Department of Homeland Security officials, including Kristi Noem. The plaintiffs allege unlawful detentions and a pattern of stops based on race and ethnicity by federal agents during “Operation At Large” in the Central District of California, violating their Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nFollowing an initial request for a temporary restraining order, the district court granted a TRO on July 11, 2025, preventing the defendants from conducting detentions without reasonable suspicion. The defendants appealed the TRO to the Ninth Circuit, which denied their motion for a stay except as to a specific clause. Simultaneously, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the TRO, which was denied. The plaintiffs subsequently filed motions for preliminary injunction and to certify a class action related to the alleged unlawful stops.\n\nSeveral procedural developments occurred, including the intervention of multiple California cities, various motions to amend complaints, and extensive briefing on the motions pending before the district court. A separate ex parte application for release from immigration custody filed by petitioner Carlos Osorto was granted on July 30, 2025, ordering his release on bond with electronic monitoring. The case is currently proceeding with briefing schedules set for the preliminary injunction motion and the class certification motion, with hearings scheduled for September 24, 2025. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong is presiding over the case in the Central District of California, and Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym issued an order regarding Osorto’s release. The plaintiffs are represented by a team of attorneys from multiple firms, while the defendants are represented by attorneys from the Department of Justice. Multiple amici curiae briefs have been filed in support of the plaintiffs.",
    "46378": "Four international students – Chinmay Deore, Yogesh Joshi, Xiangyun Bu, and Qiuyi Yang – filed suit against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and related officials after their records were terminated in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The students alleged that this termination effectively revoked their F-1 student status in violation of their due process rights under the Fifth Amendment and constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They sought a temporary restraining order to compel the Government to restore their SEVIS records and F-1 status.\n\nThe Government responded that a SEVIS record termination does not automatically equate to a loss of F-1 status and that, as of their response, they had no intention of initiating removal proceedings against the students. They also pointed to the procedural requirements for reinstatement if status was indeed lost. The Court, finding ambiguity regarding whether the SEVIS terminations actually resulted in a loss of F-1 status and lacking sufficient information to assess the legal consequences of the terminations, denied the motion for a temporary restraining order. The Court scheduled further briefing and a hearing on a preliminary injunction. \n\nSubsequently, the parties stipulated to dismissal of the case. The dismissal followed the Government's submission of additional information concerning unlawful presence and the SEVIS system, as well as the Plaintiffs' statements regarding potential SEVIS reinstatements. The court had also granted, in part, a motion for expedited discovery. The reasons for the dismissal are not specified in the provided documents.",
    "46385": "On April 9, 2025, Sheila Bedi and Lynn Cohn, both professors at Northwestern University’s Pritzker School of Law, filed suit in the Northern District of Illinois against the United States House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce, Committee Chair Tim Walberg, and Subcommittee Chair Burgess Owens. They also named Northwestern University, University President Michael Schill, and Board of Trustees Chair Peter Barris as nominal defendants. The plaintiffs allege that the Committee’s demands for documents relating to the Law School’s curriculum and advocacy work, particularly concerning pro-Palestinian protests and related legal representation, violate their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association, as well as their clients’ rights to counsel and due process.\n\nThe lawsuit stems from a series of demands made by the Committee, initiated in December 2024 and escalating in March 2025, seeking information about the Law School’s Bluhm Legal Clinic and the work of Professors Bedi and Cohn. The plaintiffs contend that these demands are pretextual, motivated by disagreement with the “left-wing” views expressed by the Law School and its faculty, rather than legitimate legislative inquiry. They allege that the Committee's actions are part of a broader effort to punish individuals and institutions perceived as opposing the current administration.\n\nThe plaintiffs immediately sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the University from complying with the Committee’s demands, arguing that compliance would cause irreparable harm. However, a hearing was held on April 10, 2025, and the motion for a TRO was denied as moot. The case is currently stayed pending further order of the court, with a status hearing scheduled for September 22, 2025. Judge Elaine E. Bucklo is overseeing the case.",
    "46353": "This case, along with several related matters, originated from the abrupt termination of SEVIS records for international students in F-1 visa status. The initial complaint, filed on April 7, 2025, by plaintiff John Doe, alleged that the terminations were unlawful and lacked due process. Doe and other plaintiffs argued that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) acted arbitrarily and capriciously, potentially targeting students based on national origin, and that the termination of their SEVIS records jeopardized their legal status and employment.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent DHS from taking further action based on the terminations and to restore their SEVIS records to active status. After hearings and consideration of the arguments, Judge Jeffrey S. White granted temporary restraining orders in all related cases, extending them to May 15, 2025. The Court subsequently granted motions for preliminary injunctions, preventing DHS from imposing legal consequences based on the terminations. \n\nDuring the proceedings, DHS indicated it was developing a policy regarding SEVIS record terminations and began re-activating some of the affected records. The Court ordered DHS to provide further information regarding the process and notice provided to students before any future terminations. The defendants appealed the injunctions to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The District Court also denied the defendants’ motion to stay the injunctions pending appeal, allowing the preliminary injunctions to remain in effect. Case management conferences were scheduled to further address the underlying issues.",
    "46337": "On March 25, 2025, nineteen state Attorneys General (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Donald J. Trump, Pamela Bondi, Pete Hegseth, Thomas Hicks, Benjamin W. Hovland, Christy McCormick, Donald L. Palmer, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (the Defendants), challenging the constitutionality of Executive Order No. 14248 (“Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections”). The Plaintiffs alleged that the Executive Order, specifically sections 2(a), 2(d), 3(d), 7(a), and 7(b), unconstitutionally overstepped the President’s authority and violated the separation of powers by interfering with states’ constitutionally protected authority over federal elections. \n\nThe Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment and preliminary injunction preventing the Defendants from implementing these challenged provisions. These provisions included requirements for documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, assessment of citizenship prior to providing voter registration forms, implementing changes to the Federal Post Card Application for overseas voters, and conditioning federal funding on compliance with specific ballot receipt deadlines. The Plaintiffs argued these actions imposed undue burdens on voters, threatened to disenfranchise eligible citizens, and violated federal statutes like the National Voter Registration Act and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act.\n\nThe Court granted the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, finding a likelihood of success on the merits. The Court reasoned that the Executive Order’s provisions were likely unlawful because they conflicted with Congressional intent, imposed requirements not authorized by statute, and infringed upon states’ constitutional authority over elections. The injunction prevents the Defendants from implementing the challenged provisions, but does not affect the President’s ability to pursue lawful actions not based on the enjoined sections. Defendants subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "46238": "On March 17, 2025, Logan Ireland and Nicholas Bear Bade filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Peter B. Hegseth (Secretary of Defense), the United States of America, Gary Ashworth (Acting Secretary of the Air Force), and the Department of the Air Force. The plaintiffs, both transgender men serving in the Air Force, challenged the constitutionality of recent Executive Orders and Department of Defense policies that effectively banned transgender individuals from military service. They alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, arguing the policies were discriminatory and unsupported by legitimate government interests.\n\nThe plaintiffs immediately sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent the initiation of administrative separation proceedings, arguing imminent irreparable harm. The Court granted a 14-day TRO on March 24, 2025. The defendants requested a stay of the TRO, which was denied. Simultaneously, parallel litigation was ongoing in other jurisdictions, including a case resulting in a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn May 15, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, terminating the case without prejudice. The case was officially closed on May 16, 2025. The reasons for the voluntary dismissal are not detailed in the provided documents.",
    "46234": "On March 15, 2025, Momodou Taal, Mukoma Wa Ngũgĩ, and Sriram Parasurama filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York against President Donald J. Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem (in her capacity as Secretary of DHS), and other related officials. The plaintiffs alleged that Executive Orders 14161 and 14188, concerning national security and antisemitism, violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights by chilling protected speech and potentially leading to deportation. Specifically, Mr. Taal, a non-citizen student, expressed concern that his past and future speech critical of U.S. and Israeli policies would lead to his removal from the country. The plaintiffs further argued that the orders were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.\n\nFollowing initial motions and a hearing, the Court denied the plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order.  The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint and a subsequent motion for a temporary restraining order. The government opposed these motions. Ultimately, on March 31, 2025, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice. A transcript of the March 25, 2025 hearing was ordered and is awaiting potential redaction. The case was then closed by the court on April 2, 2025.",
    "46216": "This case arises from the removal of patient safety commentaries authored by Dr. Gordon Schiff and Dr. Celeste Royce from the Patient Safety Network (“PSNet”), a website previously hosted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (“AHRQ”). The removal occurred following the issuance of Executive Order 14168 in January 2025, which directed federal agencies to cease promoting what it termed “gender ideology.” Acting on this order, the Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”) issued guidance to all agencies, including a directive to remove content deemed to promote this ideology. AHRQ subsequently removed Dr. Schiff’s and Dr. Royce’s commentaries, which contained references to LGBTQ individuals, arguing compliance with the directive.\n\nDr. Schiff and Dr. Royce filed suit against AHRQ, OPM, and relevant officials, alleging violations of their First Amendment rights and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). They argued the removal constituted viewpoint discrimination and that the agencies’ actions were arbitrary and capricious. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to restore their articles to PSNet and prevent further censorship. The Court granted a preliminary injunction ordering the restoration of the commentaries and all other content removed under the same policy.\n\nThe defendants then filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to mootness, standing, and ripeness. They contended that the requested relief was no longer necessary given changes to the PSNet website and the cessation of active removal efforts. The plaintiffs filed an opposition, arguing the issues remain live and their claims are valid. The case is currently pending before the Court.",
    "46207": "This case concerns a challenge to Executive Order 14168, issued by President Trump on January 20, 2025, which directed the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to prohibit medical care for inmates seeking to conform their appearance to the opposite sex. Alishea Kingdom, Solo Nichols, and Jas Kapule, transgender inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria, filed suit alleging that the Executive Order and subsequent implementing memoranda violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and potentially the Eighth Amendment. They sought a preliminary injunction to halt the enforcement of the policies and class certification to represent other similarly situated inmates.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued the BOP’s actions were arbitrary and capricious, lacking reasoned explanation and failing to consider the medical needs of transgender inmates. The court agreed, finding that the BOP’s policy change lacked adequate justification and was implemented in a manner inconsistent with established medical practices. On June 3, 2025, the court granted both the motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering the BOP to reinstate access to gender-affirming care for class members, and the motion for class certification, encompassing all incarcerated individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria.\n\nFollowing the ruling, the State of Indiana, along with 21 other states, filed an amicus brief in support of the defendants. Carla Keys subsequently filed a motion to intervene. The court then granted a renewed motion for preliminary injunction on August 8, 2025, extending the relief through November 30, 2025. The case remains ongoing, with the court actively reviewing further motions and filings, including those related to the intervention request. The core of the dispute centers on the balance between the Executive Branch’s policy decisions and the rights of transgender inmates to receive medically necessary care while incarcerated, as well as the proper application of APA standards for agency action.",
    "46104": "American Oversight, a non-profit organization, filed suit against the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the U.S. Digital Service (USDS), the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), seeking records related to the activities of DOGE under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The case centers on whether DOGE qualifies as an “agency” under FOIA, which would obligate it to comply with information requests. \n\nThe dispute arose after President Trump created DOGE and appointed Elon Musk to lead it, granting it broad authority to oversee and direct changes within federal agencies. American Oversight alleges that DOGE exercises substantial independent authority, rather than simply advising the President, and is therefore subject to FOIA. The government contends DOGE functions solely in an advisory capacity and is not an agency subject to FOIA’s requirements. \n\nAmerican Oversight submitted multiple FOIA requests seeking information about DOGE’s structure, authority, and communications. After receiving inadequate responses and facing concerns about potential record destruction, American Oversight filed suit. The court granted a preservation order. Currently, the case is focused on a motion for limited discovery filed by American Oversight to gather evidence to determine DOGE’s agency status. The court has allowed discovery, recognizing the need for factual investigation into DOGE’s operations and authority to resolve this central issue. The government opposes the discovery, arguing it is unnecessary and that DOGE’s agency status is a question of law. As of June 23, 2025, the parties have filed briefing on the motion for discovery, and the court’s decision is pending.",
    "46602": "This case arises from a dispute over the National Endowment for the Humanities’ (NEH) abrupt decision in April 2025 to terminate grants and drastically restructure its operations, impacting the Federal/State Partnership designed to distribute humanities funding across the country. The plaintiffs, the Oregon Council for the Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils, allege that these actions were taken without proper legal justification and in violation of the Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Impoundment Control Act (ICA).\n\nThe dispute began when the newly appointed leadership at NEH, under the direction of the United States DOGE Service, initiated a review of all open grants, ostensibly to ensure alignment with the current administration’s priorities. This review culminated in the issuance of termination notices to numerous grantees, including the plaintiffs, effectively halting funding for humanities projects nationwide. The plaintiffs argue that NEH failed to follow legally required procedures for grant terminations, including providing notice and opportunity for a hearing, and that the agency lacked the legal authority to unilaterally disregard congressional appropriations earmarked for the Federal/State Partnership. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs contend that the NEH’s actions violated the explicit statutory framework governing the distribution of funds and that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously by offering no reasoned explanation for the terminations. They further argue that the agency’s actions contravened the ICA by failing to follow the proper procedures for deferring or rescinding appropriated funds. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to restore funding to the affected humanities councils and prevent further disruption of their programs. The defendants countered that they were acting within their discretion and that the grant terminations were justified. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for a stay, which the court granted. The case centers on fundamental questions of separation of powers, congressional control over appropriations, and the proper procedures for agency action, with significant implications for the future of humanities funding and the Federal/State Partnership.",
    "46478": "Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc. filed suit against President Trump and various government agencies challenging the legality of tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) in April 2025. The plaintiffs argued that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs and that the tariffs themselves were unlawful. The defendants countered that the President acted within his authority under IEEPA and that the Court lacked jurisdiction, arguing the case belonged in the Court of International Trade (CIT). \n\nThe district court denied the defendants’ motion to transfer the case to the CIT, finding it had jurisdiction. The court then granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that IEEPA does not authorize the imposition of tariffs. The court reasoned that the statutory language of IEEPA does not support the President’s actions and that Congress has historically delegated tariff authority through specific legislation with clear limitations. The court acknowledged concerns about disrupting foreign policy negotiations but determined that the harm to the plaintiffs outweighed those concerns.\n\nFollowing the court’s decision, the defendants filed a motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal, which was granted. The court noted the CIT had reached a different conclusion on the jurisdictional issue, emphasizing the need to allow the appellate process to unfold. Several amicus briefs were filed, supporting both sides of the dispute. The CIT also issued an order staying its own injunction, further complicating the legal landscape. The case is currently pending appeal to the D.C. Circuit.",
    "46390": "This case concerns a challenge to the application of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 following a March 2025 Proclamation by President Trump designating members of Tren de Aragua (TdA) as “alien enemies” and authorizing their removal from the United States. Petitioners D.B.U. and R.M.M., Venezuelan nationals detained in Colorado, filed a habeas petition and class action complaint alleging the Proclamation and subsequent removal procedures violated their due process rights. They sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent their removal and that of others similarly situated. \n\nThe District Court granted a TRO, preserving the Court’s jurisdiction and prohibiting removal of Petitioners and the certified class. This order prompted an appeal by the Respondents (federal officials). The Tenth Circuit denied the Respondents’ motion for a stay pending appeal.  Following this, the District Court certified the class, encompassing noncitizens in custody in Colorado subject to the Proclamation. \n\nThroughout the proceedings, key legal questions revolved around whether the Proclamation met the statutory requirements of the Alien Enemies Act, the adequacy of the notice provided to those designated as “alien enemies,” and whether class action procedures were appropriate in a habeas context. The Court determined that class certification was proper under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, finding that the requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy were met. The Respondents filed a notice of appeal regarding the District Court’s orders granting the TRO and certifying the class. As of July 7, 2025, the case was proceeding through the appellate process.",

Several students, including Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, Jing Tao, Yifeng Wu, and Wanrong Li, filed suit against Kristi Noem (Secretary of Homeland Security), Todd Lyons (Acting Director of ICE), and Marco Rubio (Secretary of State), alleging violations of due process and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nPlaintiffs argued that the terminations and revocations were conducted without due process, lacking a rational basis, and exceeding the authority of the government agencies. They sought a preliminary injunction to restore their SEVIS records and visas and prevent further adverse actions. The Court granted a preliminary injunction preventing the defendants from enforcing the terminations and revocations. \n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the injunction was overly broad, exceeding the court’s authority under the APA and applicable statutes governing immigration enforcement, and that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated irreparable harm. The government also contended that it had already rectified the situation by reinstating the SEVIS records. As of July 21, 2025, the appeal was pending. The Court has continued case management deadlines and scheduled a conference while the appeal is ongoing.",
    "46319": "The case originated from a challenge by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) to Executive Order 14,251, issued by President Trump on March 27, 2025. The Executive Order excluded numerous federal agencies and subdivisions from coverage under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), effectively limiting collective bargaining rights for a significant portion of the federal workforce. NTEU filed suit, arguing the Executive Order was ultra vires—exceeding the President’s statutory authority—and motivated by retaliatory intent against unions that had challenged the Administration's policies.\n\nThe District Court granted NTEU a preliminary injunction, finding that the President’s actions were likely unlawful and that the government had not rebutted the presumption of regularity given the stated motivations behind the order. The government appealed this decision to the D.C. Circuit, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction and that the President’s actions were within his lawful authority. The D.C. Circuit stayed the injunction pending appeal.\n\nNTEU subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the Executive Order’s broad exemptions were not justified under the Statute’s narrowly defined national security criteria. The government countered that its actions were legitimate exercises of presidential authority and did not constitute unlawful retaliation. The core dispute centers on whether the President’s actions were based on legitimate national security concerns or were motivated by a desire to weaken federal unions and ease employee terminations. The case involves questions of statutory interpretation, administrative law, and potential First Amendment concerns. As of July 7, 2025, the case remains ongoing, with the government appealing the District Court's preliminary injunction and NTEU seeking a full summary judgment in its favor.",
    "46285": "This case concerns a challenge to recent actions by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) expanding the use of expedited removal for noncitizens who have been paroled into the United States. The lawsuit was filed on March 24, 2025, by CASA, Inc., UndocuBlack Network, and the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights against Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of Homeland Security, and other DHS officials. Plaintiffs allege that DHS exceeded its statutory authority through a series of actions, including a January 23, 2025, memorandum directing agency personnel to consider expedited removal for parolees, a February 18, 2025 directive targeting paroled individuals, and a March 25, 2025, notice terminating the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole programs.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that these actions are unlawful because expedited removal is not authorized for individuals who have previously been paroled into the country and that DHS’s interpretation of the relevant statutes is inconsistent with congressional intent and agency regulations. They seek a stay of these agency actions, preventing the government from applying expedited removal to parolees and requiring DHS to restore the prior parole status of those affected. The plaintiffs contend that the challenged actions cause irreparable harm to their members, who face the risk of deportation without due process and separation from their families.\n\nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, but it was denied as moot after plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The court held a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a stay on July 9, 2025, and is currently considering the matter. Throughout the proceedings, several attorneys were granted *pro hac vice* admission to represent the plaintiffs. The case hinges on statutory interpretation, administrative law principles, and the scope of DHS’s authority over immigration enforcement.",
    "46179": "Travis LeBlanc and Edward Felten, members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), filed suit after being removed from their positions by the President. The PCLOB was established by Congress to provide independent oversight of the Executive Branch’s counterterrorism activities and to ensure the protection of privacy and civil liberties. LeBlanc and Felten argued their removal violated federal law because the statute governing the PCLOB did not authorize the President to remove them at will.\n\nThe District Court agreed, granting summary judgment in favor of LeBlanc and Felten and declaring their terminations unlawful. The court found that, despite the lack of an explicit removal restriction in the statute, the PCLOB’s structure and function—as an independent, expert board—indicated a Congressional intent to protect its members from at-will removal by the President. The court ordered the PCLOB, and its officials, to reinstate the plaintiffs to their positions.\n\nThe government appealed the District Court’s decision and simultaneously moved for a stay pending appeal, arguing that the order interfered with the President’s constitutional power to supervise the Executive Branch. The District Court denied the motion for a stay, finding that the government had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and that the balance of equities favored allowing the plaintiffs to remain in their positions. The government subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the DC Circuit Court. The case is currently pending before the appellate court.",
    "46106": "This case originated from a complaint filed on February 11, 2025, by the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, and associated plaintiffs, against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Charles Ezell (Acting Director of OPM), the U.S. Digital Service (USDS), Elon Musk, and related entities. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants improperly granted broad access to sensitive personal data within OPM systems to individuals associated with the USDS, specifically those working on the “DOGE” agenda, without adhering to proper security protocols and in violation of the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nFollowing the filing, the plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order, which was subsequently converted to a motion for a preliminary injunction. The central issue was the defendants’ alleged failure to establish a legitimate need for access to the data and their disregard for established security measures, including vetting procedures and training requirements. The defendants argued that the access was necessary for modernization efforts and that appropriate procedures were followed. \n\nOn June 9, 2025, Judge Denise L. Cote ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, granting their motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, citing concerns over unauthorized access to sensitive data and a failure to comply with the Privacy Act. A final order outlining the specific terms of the injunction was to be determined following further discussion between the parties. The ruling underscores the importance of safeguarding personal information and adhering to established legal and security protocols when accessing government data.",
    "46095": "This case arose from a challenge to a February 7, 2025, decision by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to implement a uniform 15% indirect cost rate for all NIH grant recipients, replacing the previously negotiated, institution-specific rates. Several groups of plaintiffs – including state attorneys general, medical associations, and universities – filed suit, alleging that the NIH’s action violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), exceeded the agency’s statutory authority, and was arbitrary and capricious. They sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to halt the implementation of the new policy.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the NIH failed to follow proper notice-and-comment procedures required by the APA and that the change was retroactive, thereby impairing existing contractual rights. The NIH defended its action, asserting it had the authority to adjust indirect cost rates and that the change was necessary to ensure funds were directed toward direct research costs. \n\nThe District Court granted a preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. The Court determined that the NIH had not adequately justified the policy change, failed to comply with required procedural safeguards, and violated the APA.  \n\nFollowing a full briefing and hearing, the Court converted the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction and entered final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. This decision effectively prevents the NIH from implementing the uniform 15% indirect cost rate and restores the previous system of negotiated rates. The NIH reserved its right to appeal the decision. The case highlights the importance of adhering to administrative procedures and respecting established contractual relationships in federal grantmaking.",

The plaintiffs allege unlawful access to sensitive personal and financial information held by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service by members of the U.S. Digital Service (DOGE) team, violating the Privacy Act and the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nInitially, the plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order, which was converted into a motion for a preliminary injunction. After a series of hearings and orders, the court determined it had subject matter jurisdiction but ultimately denied the motion for a preliminary injunction on March 7, 2025. The court ordered the filing of the administrative record and set a schedule for further proceedings. \n\nThe defendants subsequently filed a motion to dismiss or, alternatively, for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that the alleged actions did not constitute a final agency action. The plaintiffs responded by filing a cross-motion for summary judgment, asserting that the defendants’ actions were contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious. Discovery was briefly permitted, with the court ultimately setting deadlines for further filings related to the defendants’ motion and the plaintiffs’ cross-motion. The court’s rulings have allowed the case to proceed towards a determination on the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims. Throughout the proceedings, concerns have been raised regarding the scope of access granted to the DOGE team and the potential risks to personal data.",

The plaintiffs allege that the defendants are imposing unlawful conditions on federal grant funding, specifically related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, immigration enforcement, and reproductive healthcare.  The plaintiffs argue these conditions exceed statutory authority, violate constitutional rights, and were not included in the original grant award notices.\n\nInitially, seven plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent the implementation of these conditions. The Court granted the TRO on May 7, 2025. Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding more plaintiffs and expanding the scope of the challenge to include DOT grants.  A second motion for a TRO and a motion for a preliminary injunction were filed.  The defendants opposed these motions, arguing the conditions were lawful and within their authority. \n\nThe Court, after reviewing the motions, responses, and declarations, granted both the second TRO and the preliminary injunction on May 23, 2025, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.  The injunction prevents the defendants from enforcing the contested funding conditions or withholding funds based on those conditions. Multiple attorneys were admitted *pro hac vice* to represent the plaintiffs. The case centers on the separation of powers, administrative law, and the limits of executive authority in attaching conditions to congressionally appropriated funds.",
    "46484": "The American Bar Association (ABA) filed suit against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and several DOJ officials following the abrupt termination of multiple grants funding the ABA’s Commission on Domestic and Sexual Violence (ABA CDSV). This action occurred shortly after the ABA publicly criticized actions taken by the Trump Administration and filed a lawsuit challenging a federal grant freeze. The DOJ, through a memorandum issued by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, prohibited DOJ employees from participating in ABA events and restricted ABA leadership roles within the department, citing a conflict of interest due to the ongoing litigation.\n\nThe ABA alleges that the termination of the grants was unlawful retaliation for exercising its First Amendment right to petition the government and engage in protected speech. The DOJ argued the grant terminations were due to a change in agency priorities. However, the Court found the timing and lack of explanation suggested a retaliatory motive, and that the ABA was likely to succeed on its First Amendment claim. The government did not meaningfully contest the merits of the First Amendment retaliation claim. \n\nThe Court granted the ABA’s motion for a preliminary injunction, barring the DOJ from enforcing the grant terminations, re-obligating the funds, and requiring the DOJ to disburse funds to the ABA CDSV in the customary manner.  The Court retained jurisdiction over the case, reserving judgment on the ABA’s remaining claims. The total amount of funding at issue was approximately $3.2 million.",
    "46279": "This case centers on a challenge to the practices of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding the removal of non-citizens to third countries. A class action lawsuit was filed alleging that DHS was removing individuals to countries not originally designated in their removal orders without providing adequate notice or an opportunity to seek protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to halt these removals pending a full hearing. The District Court granted a preliminary injunction, requiring DHS to provide notice and a chance to assert CAT claims before removing individuals to third countries.\n\nDHS appealed this injunction to the First Circuit Court of Appeals and simultaneously sought a stay pending appeal, both of which were denied. DHS then sought a stay from the Supreme Court, which was granted, effectively pausing the implementation of the preliminary injunction while the appeals process continued. Following the Supreme Court’s stay, DHS filed motions for reconsideration and to stay proceedings, arguing the injunction interfered with its authority over immigration enforcement. The District Court denied the motions for reconsideration and stay. Plaintiffs subsequently filed motions for an indicative ruling and for partial summary judgment, seeking a declaration that the injunction should be dissolved given the current status of the appeal. The case remains ongoing with the First Circuit appeal pending. The core dispute revolves around the balance between DHS’s enforcement authority and the due process rights of non-citizens facing removal to countries they fear.",
    "46186": "This case centers on a challenge to actions taken by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding several parole programs allowing non-citizens to reside and work in the United States, specifically those for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV). Plaintiffs, individuals lawfully present in the U.S. under these programs, along with supporting organizations, filed suit after DHS announced the termination of the CHNV programs and paused adjudication of related immigration benefit requests. \n\nPlaintiffs alleged that DHS’s actions were arbitrary, capricious, and violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the termination of their parole status and to compel DHS to continue processing their applications for other immigration benefits. Initially, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction, halting the mass truncation of parole, but that ruling was stayed by the Supreme Court. \n\nSubsequently, the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint and further motions seeking summary judgment, arguing that DHS lacked the authority to summarily terminate the parole programs and that the agency failed to provide adequate individualized consideration. The Court allowed the filing of the amended complaint, and set a briefing schedule for consideration of the plaintiffs’ claims. The case involves complex issues of administrative law, immigration policy, and the scope of DHS’s discretionary authority. The plaintiffs are seeking a permanent injunction requiring DHS to reinstate the terminated parole grants and resume processing benefit applications.

    "46180": "This case originates from a challenge to a Dear Colleague Letter issued by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) in February 2025, and a subsequent certification requirement imposed on states and school districts. The plaintiffs – the American Federation of Teachers, American Federation of Teachers-Maryland, the American Sociological Association, and the Eugene School District 4J – alleged that the Letter and the certification requirement were procedurally flawed under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights. The Letter, they claimed, represented a significant shift in policy regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and created uncertainty and a chilling effect on speech within educational institutions. The certification requirement, requiring affirmation of compliance with the Letter’s interpretations, was seen as an overreach of agency authority and a further infringement on constitutional rights. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed for preliminary injunctions to halt both the implementation of the Letter and the certification requirement. Following initial rulings, and after a motion to amend the complaint, the District Court found that the DOE had failed to follow proper procedures in issuing the Letter and the Certification Requirement. Specifically, the Court determined that the DOE had not provided adequate notice and opportunity for comment, violating the APA. The Court also found that the actions were unconstitutionally vague, infringing on First Amendment rights and potentially violating due process under the Fifth Amendment. \n\nMultiple courts have issued preliminary injunctions halting the Letter and the certification requirement. The District Court issued an order vacating both the Letter and the certification requirement, finding that they were unlawful and inconsistent with governing law. The Department of Education did not present an administrative record to support the actions, and the Court found the actions were not supported by reasoned decision-making. The case highlights concerns regarding agency overreach, procedural compliance, and the protection of academic freedom and free speech in educational settings.",

The plaintiffs allege that actions taken by these defendants, particularly Musk and DOGE, to dismantle USAID violate the Appointments Clause and the Separation of Powers principles of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that Musk, acting through DOGE, exerted undue influence and control over USAID without proper constitutional authorization. This included personnel changes, termination of contracts and grants, and a general disruption of USAID’s operations. Following the filing of the initial complaint, a preliminary injunction was issued by the district court, but this was stayed pending appeal. \n\nSubsequent filings involved motions to dismiss from the defendants, arguing issues such as lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The plaintiffs responded, attempting to clarify the scope of their claims and supplement the record with additional evidence. Multiple motions were filed regarding sealing documents, supplementing the record, and extending deadlines. The case has involved numerous procedural events, including multiple motions for leave to file, appearances of counsel, and the submission of transcripts and exhibits.

AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Journalism Development Network, Inc. (the Plaintiffs) filed suit, seeking to enjoin the implementation of the Executive Order, arguing that it violated the separation of powers, the Impoundment Control Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The district court initially granted a temporary restraining order, preventing the government from enforcing the funding pause.  \n\nFollowing the TRO, the government continued to suspend and terminate foreign assistance awards, leading the Plaintiffs to seek enforcement of the TRO and a preliminary injunction. The district court granted a preliminary injunction, ordering the government to make available previously appropriated funds. The government appealed this decision to the D.C. Circuit.  \n\nThe D.C. Circuit dismissed the appeal, finding that it lacked jurisdiction as the preliminary injunction did not constitute a final order. The government then appealed to the Supreme Court, which declined to vacate the District Court’s order.  Upon remand, the district court addressed the scope of the injunction and the government’s compliance. \n\nThroughout the proceedings, the government argued that the Plaintiffs lacked a proper cause of action and that the relevant statutes did not provide for judicial review of their claims.  The Plaintiffs maintained that the government’s actions were unlawful and caused significant harm to their organizations and the beneficiaries of their programs. As of the latest filings, the matter remained ongoing, with the parties continuing to dispute the scope of the injunction and the government’s compliance with the court’s orders. The central issue remained whether the Executive Branch had exceeded its authority in unilaterally pausing congressionally appropriated funds.",
    "46093": "This case originated from a challenge to Executive Order 14163 (“USRAP EO”), which suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Plaintiffs, representing refugees and resettlement agencies, sought a preliminary injunction to halt the order’s implementation. The District Court initially granted a preliminary injunction, but this was partially stayed by the Ninth Circuit, which preserved protection only for refugees who had been approved for resettlement and had arranged travel plans as of January 20, 2025, and demonstrated a “strong reliance interest.”\n\nFollowing the Ninth Circuit's clarification, the District Court established a compliance framework to implement the injunction, appointing a Magistrate Judge to assist with case-by-case determinations of reliance. Disputes arose regarding the government's application of the injunction and its attempts to deny relief to certain refugees based on nationality (through Proclamation 10949) and interpretations of the travel arrangement criteria.  \n\nPlaintiffs repeatedly sought court intervention to enforce the injunction, arguing that the government was improperly narrowing the scope of protected refugees. The Court addressed these issues, clarifying that Proclamation 10949 did not override the injunction’s protection for eligible refugees and reiterating the need for individualized assessments of reliance interests. The case involved ongoing procedural battles over implementation, including motions for emergency conferences and status reports, as the parties worked to define and adhere to the court’s orders. The central legal question revolved around the scope of presidential authority over immigration and refugee resettlement, balanced against the need to protect individuals who had reasonably relied on the government's prior assurances of resettlement.",

The plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and, subsequently, a preliminary injunction to prevent the enforcement of provisions within those orders that they alleged would harm transgender individuals and disrupt medical care. Specifically, the plaintiffs objected to Section 4 of Executive Order 14,187, which directed agencies to end federal funding for institutions providing gender-affirming care, and Sections 3(e) and (g) of Executive Order 14,168, which broadly aimed to restrict federal funding based on “gender ideology.”\n\nThe Court granted a TRO on February 14, 2025, and subsequently granted a preliminary injunction on February 28, 2025, enjoining the defendants from enforcing the challenged provisions. Following the injunction, the NIH terminated a grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital, leading the plaintiffs to file a motion for contempt, arguing that the termination violated the court’s orders. The Court denied the motion for contempt but granted the plaintiffs’ request for expedited discovery to further investigate the circumstances surrounding the grant termination. The defendant’s subsequently filed a motion to stay proceedings pending appeal of the preliminary injunction, which the Court granted.

The lawsuit challenges the Defendants’ abrupt termination of funding for direct legal representation for unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings, alleging a violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA) and the associated Foundational Rule. Plaintiffs argued that the TVPRA mandates HHS to ensure unaccompanied children have legal counsel, and the funding termination contravenes that obligation. \n\nPlaintiffs immediately sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent the funding termination from taking effect. On April 1, 2025, the District Court granted the TRO, enjoining the Defendants from withdrawing funds for legal representation. The Defendants subsequently appealed the TRO to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and also moved to stay the injunction pending appeal. On May 14, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the Government’s motion to stay the injunction, finding the Government had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm.  The core of the dispute centers on whether the government has the discretion to cease funding for legal representation given the statutory language of the TVPRA and the associated regulations, and whether the court had jurisdiction to hear the claim at all. The Plaintiffs contend that the government's actions undermine the protections afforded to vulnerable unaccompanied children, while the Defendants argue they are exercising lawful discretion over the allocation of federal funds.",

The defense repeatedly raised concerns about the fairness of the jury selection process and sought to exclude potential jurors. The government opposed these motions, and the court largely denied them.\n\nThroughout jury selection, numerous motions were filed regarding evidentiary issues, including the admissibility of certain evidence and the scope of expert testimony. The defense sought to exclude evidence of uncharged crimes and limit the government's presentation of terrorism-related evidence. The court addressed these motions through a series of orders and rulings, often under seal.\n\nThe defense also filed motions concerning the handling of juror questionnaires and the conduct of the jury selection process, leading to further legal arguments and court orders. The government responded to these motions, arguing for the integrity of the selection process. Several motions were filed regarding the sealing of documents and materials related to jury selection, reflecting the sensitive nature of the information and the court’s efforts to protect juror privacy. \n\nAs of the final documents provided (February 27, 2015), jury selection was ongoing, with the court having reserved decisions on several key motions, and the defense continued to pursue challenges to the process and the admissibility of evidence.

Hegseth, and other officials within the Department of Defense, challenging Executive Order 14183 and related guidance implementing a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military. The plaintiffs, all transgender service members or prospective service members, argued that the ban violates the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment. \n\nPlaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the enforcement of the policy, arguing it was based on unsubstantiated claims and discriminatory animus. The government opposed the injunction, asserting its authority to establish military standards and maintain readiness. Following a series of filings, including motions for leave to appear *pro hac vice* for additional counsel, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction on March 18, 2025, preventing the implementation of the ban. The government subsequently filed a motion seeking a stay of that injunction pending appeal, which is currently pending before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The core dispute centers on whether the policy serves a legitimate military purpose or is instead motivated by impermissible discrimination against transgender individuals. The court has scheduled further proceedings and requested additional information from both parties as the case proceeds.",
    "45964": "On January 21, 2025, the States of Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon, along with individual plaintiffs (expectant mothers), filed suit against President Donald Trump, several federal agencies, and officials challenging Executive Order 14160. The Executive Order aimed to restrict birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who are unlawfully present or temporarily in the country. The plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent the implementation of this order, arguing it violated the Fourteenth Amendment and the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nThe district court granted a preliminary injunction, finding the States had standing and were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the Executive Order was unconstitutional. The court also issued a universal injunction, applying to all, to ensure complete relief for the States. The defendants appealed, challenging both the standing of the States and the scope of the injunction.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's decision, upholding the preliminary injunction and the universal scope of the order. The court found the Executive Order conflicted with the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause and established precedent. The court dismissed the claims of the individual plaintiffs due to their overlapping representation in a separate class action lawsuit filed in New Hampshire.  The case highlights a significant dispute over the interpretation of birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment and the limits of presidential authority in immigration matters.",
    "45965": "This case originated with a complaint filed on January 21, 2025, by CASA, Inc., Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, and several individual plaintiffs challenging Executive Order 14,160, which sought to deny birthright citizenship to children born in the United States to parents in certain immigration statuses. The plaintiffs alleged the Executive Order violated the Fourteenth Amendment and the Immigration and Nationality Act. They immediately moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which were granted by the District Court on February 5, 2025, issuing a nationwide injunction.\n\nThe defendants, including President Trump and various federal agencies, appealed the injunction, but the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision. The case then reached the Supreme Court, which partially stayed the injunction, limiting its scope to only those plaintiffs with standing and allowing the Executive Branch to develop implementation guidance. Following the Supreme Court’s ruling, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and a motion to certify a class action to represent all individuals harmed by the Executive Order. The plaintiffs seek a class-wide preliminary injunction to prevent the enforcement of the Executive Order and a declaration that the order is unlawful. The Court granted the motion for class certification. \n\nThe core of the dispute revolves around the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause and whether the Executive Order’s restrictions on birthright citizenship are consistent with established constitutional and statutory law. The plaintiffs argue for a broad interpretation of the clause, while the defendants sought to narrow its application. The case highlights the significant legal and practical implications of the Executive Order for immigrant communities and the rights of U.S.-born children.",
    "VR-LA-0120": "This case originated from a complaint filed by Telisa Clark, Lakeshia Barnett, Crescent City Media Group, and the League of Women Voters Louisiana, alongside a consolidated case brought by Power Coalition for Equity and Justice, et al., against John Bel Edwards, in his capacity as Governor of Louisiana, and Kyle Ardoin, in his capacity as Secretary of State of Louisiana. The plaintiffs alleged that provisions of Louisiana election law, particularly those related to absentee voting requirements—including limited excuses for absentee ballots, a witness signature requirement, and a lack of a cure process for ballot defects—violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as the Voting Rights Act, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs argued these provisions created undue burdens on the right to vote, especially for vulnerable populations, and posed health risks during the pandemic. \n\nThe plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief to suspend the challenged provisions and ensure safe and accessible voting options for all Louisiana voters during the 2020 election cycle. However, on June 22, 2020, Chief Judge Shelly D. Dick entered a judgment dismissing the case *with prejudice*. This dismissal effectively ended the legal challenge, preventing the plaintiffs from pursuing the same claims in the future. A subsequent motion by the Clark Plaintiffs to amend the judgment to remove the “with prejudice” designation was filed but did not alter the final outcome. The case is now closed.",
    "VR-SC-0078": "This case originated with a complaint filed on April 22, 2020, by Mary T. Thomas, Nea Richard, Jeremy Rutledge, Trena Walker, Dr. Brenda Williams, and The Family Unit, Inc. (Plaintiffs) against Marci Andino, John Wells, Clifford J. Edler, Scott Moseley, JoAnne Day, and Linda McCall (Defendants) in their official capacities as members of the South Carolina State Election Commission, and Henry D. McMaster, as Governor of South Carolina. The Plaintiffs challenged specific provisions of South Carolina election law concerning absentee voting—specifically, the requirement to provide a qualifying excuse to vote absentee and the necessity of a witness signature on absentee ballots—arguing these provisions burdened their right to vote, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSubsequently, James H. Lucas (Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives) and Harvey Peeler (President of the South Carolina Senate) filed motions to intervene in the case, which were granted. The South Carolina Republican Party also filed a motion to intervene. The case drew interest from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc., who filed briefs as amici curiae. \n\nThe Defendants and Intervenor-Defendants filed motions for summary judgment, arguing that the Plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to demonstrate a constitutional violation.  The court stayed further proceedings pending the outcome of a related case, *Middleton v. Andino*, citing a preliminary injunction issued in that case.  The case remains stayed as of September 22, 2020, with the potential for further action contingent on the resolution of the *Middleton* litigation. The core dispute centers on balancing the state's interest in election integrity with voters’ rights during a public health crisis and the appropriate forum for resolving such issues—the courts or the legislature.",
    "JC-MD-0017": "This case originated from a civil rights complaint filed on April 21, 2020, by Keith Seth, David Smith, Mario Burch, and John Does 1-5, against Mary Lou McDonough, in her official capacity as Director of the Prince George’s County Department of Corrections (PGCDOC). The plaintiffs allege unconstitutional conditions of confinement at the jail, specifically related to the inadequate response to a COVID-19 outbreak. They claim violations of their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and a writ of habeas corpus for medically vulnerable detainees.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege failures to provide basic hygiene supplies, proper medical care, and adequate sanitation, contributing to the spread of COVID-19 within the jail. They further contend the jail unlawfully detains COVID-positive prisoners awaiting negative tests before release.  An Amended Complaint was filed on July 3, 2020, expanding on these claims.\n\nDirector McDonough moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint or, alternatively, for summary judgment, arguing failures to exhaust administrative remedies, lack of standing, and that the claims fail to state a cognizable legal violation.  She asserted that the Jail implemented reasonable measures to mitigate the pandemic’s impact and that the plaintiffs' claims were not supported by facts. The plaintiffs countered, arguing that the administrative exhaustion requirement was not applicable, and that the jail’s conditions demonstrably violated their constitutional rights.  The case has also drawn involvement from amici curiae, including experts on prison conditions, who have filed briefs in support of the plaintiffs. The court has heard motions regarding pro hac vice admission for several counsel representing both sides. As of August 21, 2020, the case remains ongoing with arguments and motions pending before the court.",
    "IM-FL-0029": "This case originated with a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief filed on April 13, 2020, by a group of detainees held at three immigration detention centers in South Florida (Krome, Broward, and Glades) against ICE officials. The detainees alleged that conditions at the facilities created an unacceptable risk of contracting COVID-19, violating their constitutional rights. They sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, including the release of detainees to mitigate the risk.\n\nFollowing initial hearings and consideration of the evidence, the Court issued a temporary restraining order and subsequently a preliminary injunction in June 2020. The injunction directed ICE to improve sanitation, provide access to PPE, implement social distancing measures, and adhere to CDC guidelines. However, disputes arose regarding ICE’s compliance with the order. A Special Master was appointed to assess the conditions at the facilities and provide recommendations.\n\nThroughout 2020 and 2021, the case involved numerous motions, orders, and submissions regarding compliance with the injunction. Intervenors joined the case to further advocate for detainee safety. The Court repeatedly addressed issues of inadequate conditions, insufficient testing, and concerns about the spread of COVID-19 within the detention centers.  A settlement agreement was reached on June 28, 2021, outlining specific terms related to hygiene, vaccination, and adherence to CDC guidelines. The final outcome of the case, as reflected in the provided documents, is a settled resolution with ongoing court oversight to ensure compliance with the terms of the agreement. The case illustrates a protracted legal battle over the conditions of confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic and the constitutional rights of immigration detainees."
