    "46290": "The Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council (QEC) filed suit against the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents, alleging violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The dispute arose from the Board's February 28, 2025, decision to ban all drag shows on university campuses, specifically cancelling the QEC’s planned “Draggieland” performance scheduled for March 27, 2025, at the Rudder Theatre. The QEC argued the ban constituted viewpoint discrimination and a prior restraint on protected speech, claiming Draggieland is a form of expressive conduct. The Board justified its decision by asserting that drag shows promote an ideology inconsistent with the university’s values and potentially create a hostile environment.\n\nThe QEC sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent the enforcement of the ban and allow Draggieland to proceed. The court granted a preliminary injunction on March 24, 2025, finding that the QEC demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its First Amendment claims. The court determined the Rudder Theatre functions as a designated public forum and the Board’s ban was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. The injunction prevents the Board from enforcing the drag show ban, permitting the Draggieland performance to proceed as planned. \n\nThe Board of Regents filed a notice of appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on March 28, 2025, and subsequently filed a motion to stay the injunction pending appeal. The case is ongoing.",
    "46324": "Inclusiv, Inc., a non-profit organization, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on March 31, 2025, against the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), its Administrator Lee Zeldin, Acting Deputy Administrator W.C. McIntosh, and Citibank, N.A. The lawsuit stems from the EPA’s February and March 2025 actions to freeze and attempt to revoke a $1.87 billion grant awarded to Inclusiv under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. \n\nInclusiv alleges that the EPA’s actions are unlawful, violating the Administrative Procedure Act, the Spending and Appropriations Clauses of the Constitution, the Anti-Deficiency Act, and the Due Process Clause. The organization contends that the EPA lacks the authority to unilaterally terminate a program created by Congress and that its actions are arbitrary and capricious. Citibank is named as a defendant because it holds the grant funds and, according to Inclusiv, has refused to disburse them despite Inclusiv’s instructions, breaching a contractual agreement.\n\nInclusiv initially sought a temporary restraining order to restore the funds, but subsequently withdrew that motion. The court denied Inclusiv's motion for a preliminary injunction as moot, with a decision made in a related consolidated case (Case No. 25-cv-698). The case has been consolidated with Case No. 25-cv-698. Judge Tanya S. Chutkan is presiding over the matter. The central issue remains the legality of the EPA’s freeze on GGRF funds and Inclusiv’s ability to access and distribute those funds as intended under the terms of the grant.",
    "46391": "In April 2025, five international students (S.Y., Z.D., Y.W., H.G., and W.X.), lawfully present in the United States on F-1 student visas, filed a lawsuit against Kristi Noem (Secretary of Homeland Security), Todd M. Lyons (Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement), Moises Becerra (Acting Field Office Director of ICE San Francisco), and Donald J. Trump in his official capacity. The students allege that ICE abruptly and unlawfully terminated their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records, citing “Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status” often linked to past or alleged criminal records checks. The students claim this termination jeopardizes their legal status, potentially leading to deportation, despite their continued compliance with F-1 visa requirements.\n\nThe lawsuit asserts violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing the SEVIS terminations were arbitrary, capricious, and lacked a legal basis. The students sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to prevent their arrest, detention, or deportation and to restore their SEVIS records. The Court granted a TRO, temporarily preventing the government from taking enforcement action against the students. The case was subsequently reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White and a hearing was held on a motion for a preliminary injunction. The court ultimately granted the motion for preliminary injunction. \n\nThe government opposed the relief sought, arguing the SEVIS terminations did not affect the students’ legal status and that the students had remedies available to them. However, the court found the students likely to succeed on the merits of their claims. The defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and also filed a motion to stay the injunction pending appeal, which was heard but its outcome is not reflected in the provided documents. The case is ongoing, with further briefing scheduled.",
    "46509": "In April 2025, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), its Board of Directors, and three individual Board members (Laura G. Ross, Thomas E. Rothman, and Diane Kaplan) filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, several White House officials, and the Office of Management and Budget. The plaintiffs alleged that an email from a Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel purporting to remove Ross, Rothman, and Kaplan from the CPB Board of Directors was unlawful. The CPB and its Board asserted that the CPB was established by Congress as a private, non-profit corporation intended to be independent from governmental control, citing the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (47 U.S.C. § 396 et seq.). They argued that the President lacked the authority to remove Board members, and sought a declaratory judgment affirming this position, as well as an injunction preventing any interference with the CPB's governance.\n\nThe plaintiffs initially sought a temporary restraining order, which was later converted to a motion for a preliminary injunction. The court denied the motion, finding that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or a likelihood of irreparable harm. The court noted the lack of clarity regarding the President’s authority and the availability of mechanisms within the CPB's bylaws to mitigate any potential disruptions. Ross and Rothman subsequently voluntarily dismissed their claims. \n\nThe case was filed under the Declaratory Judgement Act, and asserted violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, and separation of powers principles. The plaintiffs ultimately filed a motion for summary judgment, the outcome of which is not reflected in the provided documents.",
    "46590": "This case originated on April 7, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia before Judge Irene C. Berger. Harry Wiley, a coal miner, filed suit individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated miners against Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The lawsuit alleges violations of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 and related regulations, specifically concerning miners’ rights to medical screening for black lung disease and subsequent job transfer options if diagnosed. The plaintiffs claim HHS arbitrarily and capriciously terminated critical personnel within the Respiratory Health Division of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), effectively halting the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) and hindering miners’ access to necessary medical evaluations and job transfer rights under Part 90 of the regulations.\n\nWiley and the proposed class seek a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, demanding HHS restore the CWHSP and reinstate the terminated personnel, ensuring continued access to medical screenings and job transfer opportunities. The core claim is that the HHS actions violate miners' due process rights and undermine Congressional intent to protect miners' health.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, the Court granted Wiley’s motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering HHS to rescind the reductions in force and fully restore the CWHSP, finding a strong likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm to miners. The Court found the agency’s actions were arbitrary and capricious. The case is currently proceeding with a scheduling order issued on June 17, 2025, setting deadlines for discovery, expert disclosures, and dispositive motions, with a trial scheduled for May 4, 2026. On August 14, 2025, the Court granted Wiley’s motion to file a Second Amended Complaint and terminated as moot prior motions relating to the original Amended Complaint.",
    "46605": "This case originated with a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan, a Venezuelan citizen detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), challenging his potential removal under Proclamation No. 10903, issued by President Trump in March 2025. This proclamation invoked the Alien Enemies Act to authorize the immediate removal of certain Venezuelan citizens. Arevalo sought to represent a class of similarly situated individuals.\n\nThe Court initially granted a temporary restraining order and certified a class for injunctive relief, preventing the government from removing class members pending further order. The primary issue was whether Arevalo and others were being detained pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act or the Immigration and Nationality Act. The government argued Arevalo was being detained under the INA and was awaiting a hearing on his asylum claim. \n\nFollowing a hearing, the Court issued a preliminary injunction restraining the government from removing or transferring class members under the Proclamation. However, after Arevalo was granted asylum, he filed an emergency application for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing his continued detention was unlawful. The government responded that it was appealing the asylum grant and was detaining him under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A) pending that appeal. \n\nThe Court ultimately denied Arevalo’s emergency application for a writ of habeas corpus, finding that his detention was lawful pending the outcome of the government's appeal. The Court directed the government to file regular status reports regarding the appeal. The government subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The case is currently pending before that court.",
    "46635": "On May 10, 2025, President Donald J. Trump removed Shira Perlmutter from her position as Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office at the Library of Congress, and appointed Todd Blanche as acting Librarian of Congress. Perlmutter subsequently filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that these actions were unlawful, violating statutory authority regarding the appointment and removal of officials within the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent her removal and to invalidate Blanche’s appointment.\n\nPerlmutter first sought a temporary restraining order, which was denied by the court. She then moved for a preliminary injunction, which was also denied, with the court finding she had not demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm. Perlmutter appealed this decision to the D.C. Circuit, and simultaneously filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, which was also denied. \n\nThe core of the dispute centers on whether the President acted within his authority when removing Perlmutter and appointing Blanche, and whether the statutory scheme vests removal power in the Librarian of Congress, not the President. The Court found that Perlmutter had not demonstrated irreparable harm, a key requirement for injunctive relief. The case is currently on appeal before the D.C. Circuit. Cross-motions for summary judgment have been scheduled, with a hearing set for November 4, 2025, and the response deadline to the complaint has been stayed pending resolution of those motions.",
    "45143": "This case originated with a complaint filed on April 20, 2023, by Ashley and Sean Willey against the Sweetwater County School District No. 1 Board of Trustees, Superintendent Kelly McGovern, Assistant Superintendent Nicole Bolton, Director of Student Services Kayci Arnoldi, and Black Butte High School Principal Bryant Blake. The plaintiffs alleged violations of their fundamental parental rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and asserted claims related to free exercise of religion. They challenged a policy implemented by the school district regarding student gender identity, specifically alleging that the district concealed information from parents about students’ requests to be treated as a different gender and affirmed those requests without parental consent, even over parental objections. \n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages. The court initially granted in part and denied in part a motion for a preliminary injunction, allowing the plaintiffs some relief regarding communication with parents about student gender identity requests. A motion to dismiss was denied without prejudice as an amended complaint was filed. The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint, which was followed by further motions and responses. \n\nUltimately, on April 28, 2025, the court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, dismissing all claims against Ashley Willey and dismissing Sean Willey from the action entirely. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on May 23, 2025, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. The case is now pending appeal.",
    "PH-IL-0002": "This case originated with a class action complaint filed on May 10, 2016, by several residents of the Alexander County Housing Authority (ACHA) alleging race and familial status discrimination, as well as improper rent overcharges, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Illinois state law. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, claimed ACHA segregated its housing developments, maintained properties in predominantly Black neighborhoods to a lower standard, and denied families with children housing in certain developments. The case had a history of discrimination dating back to a 1974 Department of Justice lawsuit alleging similar segregation practices.\n\nThroughout the litigation, several amended complaints were filed, and the plaintiff class evolved. Several motions were made regarding discovery and the continuation of settlement conferences. The court initially denied a motion to stay proceedings and ultimately denied a motion regarding privileged documents. Several plaintiffs were dismissed from the suit, either voluntarily or due to non-compliance with court orders. Specifically, Latonya Lee and Coretta Cornelius were dismissed for failing to respond to court inquiries. Denieshia Childress was ultimately dismissed for failure to participate in a scheduled conference call. \n\nUltimately, the remaining plaintiffs and ACHA reached a settlement, resulting in a Stipulation of Dismissal filed on July 27, 2017. The case was dismissed with prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs could not re-file their claims, with each party bearing its own legal fees. The court subsequently entered a judgment closing the case on September 12, 2017.",
    "16518": "In April 2022, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a complaint against the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) alleging constitutional violations at the Broad River Road Complex (BRRC), a long-term juvenile commitment facility. The DOJ’s investigation, initiated in 2017, found that DJJ failed to adequately protect youth from excessive force by staff and engaged in the improper use of isolation. Specifically, the DOJ alleged youth were subjected to force disproportionate to the threat posed and were placed in isolation for prolonged periods, often for minor infractions, violating their Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\nTo resolve these allegations, the DOJ and DJJ entered into a settlement agreement outlining a series of remedial measures. These included a staffing study to ensure adequate supervision, improvements to physical plant security with increased video surveillance, revised use of force policies, enhanced training for staff on de-escalation techniques, and reforms to the isolation process, limiting its use to situations involving serious and immediate danger. The agreement also established a multidisciplinary team to review isolation placements and mandated regular quality assurance reviews. A Subject Matter Expert was to be jointly selected to assist DJJ in implementing these changes.\n\nPursuant to the settlement, the parties jointly moved for conditional dismissal of the case, with the court retaining jurisdiction to reinstate the complaint should DJJ materially breach the terms of the agreement. On April 20, 2022, the Court granted the motion and dismissed the case without prejudice, preserving the DOJ’s ability to seek further relief if necessary. The settlement agreement aims to improve safety and conditions at BRRC and ensure compliance with the constitutional rights of the youth in its care.",
    "46815": "Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia was indicted on May 21, 2025, in the Middle District of Tennessee, charged with conspiracy to transport undocumented immigrants and the unlawful transportation of undocumented immigrants. Following his arrest on June 6, 2025, the government moved for his detention pending trial. The Magistrate Judge denied the motion, finding that the government had not established grounds for detention. The government appealed this decision, arguing that the case involved a minor victim and that no conditions of release could reasonably assure Abrego’s appearance in court or the safety of the community.\n\nFollowing a hearing on June 13, 2025, and subsequent supplemental briefing, District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. denied the government’s motion for revocation of the release order on July 23, 2025, agreeing with the Magistrate Judge. The Court found that while evidence suggested the possibility of minors being involved in the smuggling operation, the government had met its burden to show the case involved a minor victim. The Court determined that no combination of conditions would necessarily ensure public safety or Abrego’s appearance. A release order was subsequently issued on August 22, 2025.\n\nAbrego also filed a motion to dismiss the indictment based on claims of vindictive and selective prosecution, alleging improper motivations behind the charges. The government was granted an extension to respond to this motion. Additionally, Abrego filed a motion seeking an order preventing Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security officials from making prejudicial public statements about the case. The case is currently proceeding toward a jury trial scheduled for January 27, 2026, with status conferences set for September 26, 2025, and November 3, 2025. The Court has ordered the parties to submit a proposed scheduling order by July 30, 2025.",
    "46755": "This case originated from a complaint filed on July 1, 2025, by the City of Columbus, Ohio; the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland; the City of Chicago, Illinois; Doctors for America; and the Main Street Alliance (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) against Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The Plaintiffs challenged a final rule issued by CMS (“the Rule”), alleging it undermined the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by increasing health care costs and reducing access to coverage.\n\nThe Plaintiffs argued that the Rule, intended to address alleged fraud and abuse in the ACA’s health insurance marketplaces, imposed several provisions that were contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious. These included a $5 premium penalty for certain enrollees, changes to premium adjustment methodologies, revisions to actuarial value calculations, stricter income verification requirements, and a provision reinstating a policy regarding failure to reconcile tax credits. The Plaintiffs asserted that these changes would lead to approximately 1.8 million Americans losing coverage and increased financial burdens on cities providing health services. \n\nCMS defended the Rule, asserting its authority under the ACA and arguing the changes were necessary to address improper enrollments and maintain the integrity of the marketplace.\n\nOn August 22, 2025, the Court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting in part and denying in part the Plaintiffs’ motion for a stay under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The Court stayed the enforcement of seven challenged provisions of the Rule, finding that the Plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and would suffer irreparable harm without a stay. The Court declined to stay two other challenged provisions, finding the Plaintiffs had not met their burden of demonstrating likelihood of success. On August 25, 2025, the Court issued an order clarifying the scope of the stay. The case remains pending as to the provisions not subject to the stay, with the Court retaining jurisdiction pending a final resolution on the merits.",
    "46576": "This case originated from a dispute between sixteen states and the District of Columbia (collectively, “the States”) and the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and Secretary Linda McMahon regarding the liquidation deadlines for COVID-19 education stabilization funds. In March 2025, ED abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions allowing the States additional time to spend these funds, originally intended to address the impact of the pandemic on students. The States filed suit, alleging the rescission was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, seeking a preliminary injunction to restore the original liquidation periods. \n\nThe District Court granted a preliminary injunction in May 2025, preventing ED from enforcing the rescission and requiring the Department to expeditiously process pending funding requests. ED appealed, seeking a stay of the injunction pending appeal, but the Court of Appeals denied that request.  ED subsequently stipulated to withdraw the appeal, effectively ending the litigation.  \n\nThroughout the proceedings, the States argued that ED’s reversal was unjustified and disrupted their educational programs. ED maintained it was acting within its discretion and that the funds were intended for immediate pandemic-related needs. The District Court found the States likely to succeed on the merits of their claim, and issued the injunction. The case concluded with the withdrawal of the appeal, leaving the preliminary injunction in place.",
    "46637": "This case arises from a challenge to Executive Order 14290, issued on May 1, 2025, by then-President Donald J. Trump, which directed federal agencies to cease funding to National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). NPR, along with several local member stations (Roaring Fork Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio and KUTE Inc.), filed suit against the President, various federal agencies, and officials, alleging violations of the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as federal statutes, including the Public Broadcasting Act.\n\nPlaintiffs argue the Order is an unconstitutional attempt to retaliate against NPR for its news coverage, constitutes viewpoint discrimination, and violates the independence of public broadcasting established by Congress. They contend that the Order directly infringes on their First Amendment rights and disrupts their associational freedoms. They maintain the President lacks the authority to direct funding decisions of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and that the Order disregards statutory requirements regarding the distribution of funds. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking to prevent the enforcement of the Order.\n\nThe Federal Defendants argue that the Order is a legitimate exercise of presidential authority over federal spending, and that the First Amendment does not prevent the government from making funding decisions based on its assessment of the value of speech. They assert that the plaintiffs have not demonstrated a concrete injury and that the Order does not violate any specific statutory provisions. They further contend that the claims are not ripe for review and that the government is not obligated to subsidize speech it disagrees with.\n\nThe case has attracted amicus briefs from various organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, supporting the Plaintiffs’ position. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting has filed an answer, but has not taken a position on the merits. As of July 31, 2025, the case is ongoing, with motions filed for and against summary judgment. The central issue remains whether the Executive Order unlawfully infringes on the First Amendment rights of NPR and its affiliates and violates the statutory framework governing public broadcasting funding.",
    "46340": "This case originated from a challenge to Executive Order 14,251, issued on March 27, 2025, by President Donald Trump, which excluded numerous federal agencies and subdivisions from coverage under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). The FSLMRS generally grants federal employees the right to collective bargaining. The plaintiffs, a group of federal employee unions representing over a million workers, argued the Executive Order was unlawful retaliation for their protected First Amendment speech criticizing the Trump administration’s policies, an overreach of presidential authority, and a violation of due process and equal protection rights.\n\nThe unions filed suit in the Northern District of California, seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the implementation of the Order. The district court granted the injunction, finding the unions raised serious questions regarding a First Amendment violation and that they were likely to suffer irreparable harm. The government appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing the President acted within his statutory authority based on national security concerns and that the injunction would harm its ability to manage the federal workforce. \n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted a stay of the district court’s injunction pending appeal, finding the government had made a strong showing it was likely to succeed on the merits and that it would suffer irreparable harm without a stay. The court’s decision acknowledged the strong deference afforded to the Executive Branch’s national security determinations. The case is currently before the Ninth Circuit for further consideration. The unions subsequently filed a motion for a status conference, which was opposed by the government.",
    "46805": "This case originates from a complaint filed on July 21, 2025, by a coalition of non-profit organizations – including domestic violence and homelessness service providers – against Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his capacity as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and other officials from HHS and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The plaintiffs allege that new conditions imposed by HHS and HUD on federal grant funding are unlawful, violating the Administrative Procedure Act, the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, the First Amendment, and the separation of powers. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs object to conditions related to “gender ideology,” “DEI” (diversity, equity, and inclusion), and abortion, as well as a requirement to certify compliance with all applicable federal anti-discrimination laws in a way that could expose grantees to liability under the False Claims Act. These conditions were attached to grants including Continuum of Care grants (HUD) and Family Violence Prevention Services Act grants (HHS). The plaintiffs asserted they would suffer irreparable harm if forced to comply with these conditions, as it would compromise their ability to serve vulnerable populations and potentially violate their own legal obligations.\n\nThe Court granted a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on July 28, 2025, enjoining HUD and HHS from enforcing these conditions on the named plaintiff organizations. This TRO was amended twice, on August 7, 2025, and again on August 20, 2025, to clarify the scope of the injunction and address concerns raised by the parties. The amended TRO requires the defendants to treat any enforcement actions regarding the challenged conditions as null and void. \n\nFollowing the TRO, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to extend the relief to all potentially affected grantees. The defendants filed a response, and the plaintiffs subsequently filed a reply. A hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction is scheduled for September 4, 2025. The case centers around the plaintiffs’ contention that the challenged conditions exceed the agencies' statutory authority, are unconstitutionally vague, and improperly restrict their First Amendment rights and are a violation of the principles of separation of powers.",
    "46375": "In 2022, the Southern Education Foundation (SEF) received a five-year, $8.6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education to operate the Equity Assistance Center – South (EAC-South), a regional technical assistance center aimed at supporting school districts in addressing desegregation and equity issues. In February 2025, following a change in administration and the issuance of Executive Orders targeting “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) initiatives, the Department terminated the grant without providing a specific explanation. SEF filed suit, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Fifth Amendment, the Civil Rights Act, and asserting an ultra vires claim and a First Amendment claim.\n\nSEF sought a preliminary injunction to reinstate the grant funding and continue EAC-South’s operations. The Department argued the Court lacked jurisdiction and that the termination was a lawful exercise of agency discretion. The Court found the Department’s termination arbitrary and capricious, citing the lack of a reasoned explanation and the standardized nature of the termination letter. The Court determined the action was final and that SEF had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, along with irreparable harm due to the disruption of essential educational support services and potential damage to SEF’s reputation. The Court granted SEF’s motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering the Department to reinstate the grant and reimburse SEF for expenses incurred after the termination. The Department subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "46284": "Yunseo Chung, a lawful permanent resident of the United States and a student at Columbia University, filed suit in March 2025 against Donald J. Trump, Marco Rubio, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons, and William P. Joyce, in their official capacities, alleging a violation of her First Amendment rights and due process. The lawsuit stemmed from actions taken by the government following Ms. Chung’s participation in pro-Palestinian protests on campus, including an attempt to revoke her lawful permanent resident status and a search of her residence. Ms. Chung argued that the government was retaliating against her for exercising her protected speech.\n\nSpecifically, the complaint alleges that a newly implemented policy, directed by Secretary Rubio, authorizes the deportation of non-citizens who express views critical of Israel. Ms. Chung sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent her detention and deportation. On March 25, 2025, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald granted a temporary restraining order enjoining the defendants from detaining or transferring Ms. Chung, and scheduled a hearing for May 20, 2025. \n\nFollowing a hearing on May 29, 2025, Judge Buchwald granted a preliminary injunction on June 5, 2025, preventing the government from detaining or deporting Ms. Chung pending further order. The defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on July 3, 2025, challenging the preliminary injunction, claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction. As a result of the appeal, further discovery in the district court was stayed.",
    "46735": "The Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools (the “School District”) filed suit against Linda McMahon (Secretary of Education), the U.S. Department of Education, and Donald J. Trump, challenging the non-continuation of a $6 million federal grant awarded under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act for school-based mental health services. The School District argued that the decision to discontinue the grant was unlawful, violating the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as the Spending Clause, and constituted an arbitrary and capricious action under the Administrative Procedure Act. They sought a preliminary injunction to reinstate the funding.\n\nThe defendants responded that the Court lacked jurisdiction over the claim, arguing it essentially amounted to a contract dispute properly adjudicated in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims rather than federal district court. They further argued that the School District failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm.\n\nThe Court agreed with the defendants regarding jurisdiction, finding the core of the dispute concerned a contractual right to funding. The Court also found the School District had not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on its constitutional and APA claims. While acknowledging the potential benefit of the grant funding to the community, the Court determined the proper venue for resolving this dispute was the Court of Federal Claims. Consequently, the Court denied the School District's motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed the case without prejudice, allowing it to be refiled in the proper court.",
    "46342": "The Association for Education Finance and Policy, Inc., and the Institute for Higher Education Policy filed suit against the Secretary of Education and the U.S. Department of Education challenging the Department’s actions to significantly curtail the operations of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). The plaintiffs allege these actions violate the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 and constitute arbitrary and capricious agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Specifically, the plaintiffs challenge the termination of several key IES programs, including longitudinal studies (BPS, HSLS, ECLS-K), the peer review process for grant funding, and access to restricted-use data. They contend these terminations disrupt critical research, hinder their ability to conduct their work, and undermine statutory mandates. \n\nThe plaintiffs initially sought a preliminary injunction to halt these changes, but the court denied that motion, finding the challenge too broad and encompassing to be properly addressed through injunctive relief. The plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint. The Department moved to dismiss the first complaint, but that motion was denied as moot following the filing of the amended complaint. Currently, the Department has filed a renewed motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, to which the plaintiffs will respond, with briefing scheduled through October 9, 2025. The core dispute centers on whether the Department’s actions are consistent with Congressional intent and APA requirements regarding reasoned decision-making and adherence to statutory mandates. The plaintiffs seek a court order reinstating the terminated programs and ensuring the continued operation of IES in accordance with its statutory mission.",
    "46322": "This case concerns challenges to Executive Order 14,248, issued by President Trump, which directed changes to federal election procedures. The League of United Latin American Citizens, Secure Families Initiative, Arizona Students’ Association, Democratic National Committee, and League of Women Voters filed suit, alleging the Executive Order exceeded the President’s constitutional and statutory authority. Specifically, they challenged provisions requiring the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to add documentary proof of citizenship to the national mail voter registration form and directing federal agencies to assess citizenship of applicants for public assistance before providing voter registration forms. \n\nPlaintiffs argued that the President lacked the power to unilaterally dictate changes to election regulations, which are constitutionally delegated to Congress and the States. They contended the Executive Order interfered with established voter registration processes and risked disenfranchising eligible voters. The Defendants, representing various federal agencies and officials, initially argued the plaintiffs lacked standing and that the Executive Order was a lawful exercise of presidential authority. \n\nThe Court granted the Plaintiffs’ motions for a preliminary injunction, finding a substantial likelihood that the Executive Order exceeded its authority. The Court emphasized that neither the Constitution nor any statute granted the President the power to direct the EAC to alter the Federal Form, a power reserved to Congress and the independent EAC. The Court found the President’s actions incompatible with the expressed will of Congress, as demonstrated by previous legislative decisions. The Court also rejected the argument that the Executive Order was simply guiding the EAC’s discretionary actions, finding instead that it mandated specific outcomes. Following the ruling, the parties were directed to submit a joint scheduling proposal for further proceedings. A motion to intervene by the Republican National Committee was also filed.",
    "46510": "This case concerns a challenge to actions taken by the Biden Administration, specifically through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Office of Head Start (OHS), that the plaintiffs allege undermine the Head Start program. The plaintiffs—four State Head Start Associations and two parent-led organizations—filed suit seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the implementation of a new policy restricting “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility” (DEIA) initiatives and to address the impacts of significant staffing cuts and office closures within OHS.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the DEIA ban, implemented through a letter and subsequent policy change, is unconstitutionally vague and chills protected speech. They argue it conflicts with the Head Start Act's mandate to serve diverse communities and meet their specific needs, and violates the principles of separation of powers and the Spending Clause by imposing conditions on federal funding without Congressional authorization.  Further, they claim the mass layoffs and office closures within OHS have created chaos and impede the agency’s ability to effectively administer the program, provide support to agencies, and ensure compliance with program standards.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert these actions cause irreparable harm by forcing Head Start agencies to question program activities, potentially leading to program closures and disruptions in essential services for children and families. They seek a preliminary injunction to prevent further implementation of the DEIA ban and to restore adequate staffing levels and support within OHS. The defendants have filed a response, though the details are not fully available in the provided documents. The court has scheduled a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction and has continued deadlines for further filings and disclosures.",
    "46734": "This case originated from a challenge to Washington State Senate Bill 5375 (\"SB 5375\"), enacted in May 2025, which amended mandatory reporting requirements for child abuse and neglect. Specifically, SB 5375 required clergy members to report suspected abuse learned during confession, eliminating a previous privilege.  Plaintiffs, including Roman Catholic Archbishops and Bishops, and subsequently the United States government as an intervenor, filed suit, alleging SB 5375 violated the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment, arguing it unduly burdened religious practice, specifically the sacrament of confession, and discriminated against clergy.\n\nPlaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the enforcement of SB 5375 pending resolution of the case.  Defendants, including the Governor and Attorney General of Washington, argued the law was neutral and generally applicable. The United States, intervening as a plaintiff, further argued the law violated constitutional rights. Following a hearing, the Court granted the preliminary injunction, finding the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Free Exercise claim. The Court reasoned that the law was not neutral because it singled out clergy and removed a privilege afforded to other professions, and failed to demonstrate a compelling state interest justifying the burden on religious practice. \n\nThe Court enjoined the enforcement of SB 5375 as it applied to the sacrament of confession for the named plaintiffs and all Roman Catholic priests within their dioceses. The Court explicitly stated it did not reach the plaintiffs’ Establishment Clause or Church Autonomy arguments at that time. The case remains ongoing, with the stay of proceedings against the county prosecutor defendants pending a final judgment.",
    "46678": "In June 2025, the State of California, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, filed suit against President Donald Trump, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and the U.S. Department of Defense, challenging the President’s deployment of approximately 4,000 California National Guard members to Los Angeles. The action followed federal immigration enforcement operations that led to protests in the city. President Trump invoked 10 U.S.C. § 12406, authorizing the federalization of National Guard units in specific circumstances, arguing that the situation warranted federal intervention.\n\nCalifornia contended that the President’s actions were unlawful for two primary reasons. First, they argued that none of the conditions outlined in § 12406 – invasion, rebellion, or inability of regular forces to execute the laws – were met. Second, they asserted that the President failed to comply with the statute’s requirement that such orders be issued “through the governor.”  The State sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to halt the deployment and regain control of the National Guard.\n\nThe District Court granted the TRO, finding that the President likely lacked statutory authority for the deployment and had failed to follow the proper procedure. The federal government appealed, arguing that the President had broad discretion under § 12406 and that the statute did not require strict adherence to the “through the governor” provision. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted a stay pending further review. \n\nThe case also involves arguments regarding the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement, and potential concerns about the military’s role in assisting ICE enforcement activities. A bench trial was scheduled in August 2025 to fully litigate the dispute. The core of the case centers on the limits of presidential power, federalism, and the proper role of the military in domestic affairs.",
    "46287": "This case concerns a dispute between the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), as plaintiffs, and the United States Department of Justice, along with several individual officials and agencies, as defendants. The plaintiffs filed suit after the defendants terminated approximately $400 million in federal funding to Columbia University and signaled potentially broader consequences for universities perceived as failing to adequately address antisemitism on campus.\n\nThe AAUP and AFT allege that the government’s actions violated the First Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and other constitutional principles. Specifically, they argue that the funding terminations and demands placed on Columbia were arbitrary, capricious, and lacked procedural fairness. They sought a preliminary injunction to restore the funding and prevent further action.\n\nThe defendants countered that the funding decisions were within their discretion, lawfully based on agency priorities and concerns about a hostile environment for Jewish students, and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit because they were not direct recipients of the terminated funds.\n\nJudge Vyskocil denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed the case for lack of standing. The court found that the plaintiffs, as organizations representing faculty, had not demonstrated a direct injury sufficient to establish standing. The court also emphasized that the dispute concerned the government’s actions against Columbia, a non-party to the lawsuit, and that the plaintiffs lacked the authority to litigate on Columbia’s behalf. The judge further noted the government’s legitimate interest in ensuring appropriate use of taxpayer funds and upholding a safe learning environment. The court also found that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims.",

Shepherd, challenging the DOT’s decision to pause the disbursement of funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) for the National Electric Vehicle (NEVI) Formula Program. The Plaintiff States alleged that this action, stemming from an executive order issued by President Trump, violated the separation of powers doctrine, exceeded the agency’s statutory authority, and was arbitrary and capricious. They sought a preliminary injunction to compel the DOT and FHWA to restore the flow of funds and allow states to proceed with planned EV infrastructure projects.\n\nSeveral public interest organizations subsequently filed a motion to intervene as party plaintiffs, which was granted. The DOT argued the pause was a permissible exercise of agency discretion, while the Plaintiff States contended that the DOT was improperly withholding funds Congress had specifically designated for a particular purpose.\n\nOn June 24, 2025, Judge Tana Lin granted the motion for a preliminary injunction in part, enjoining the Defendants from suspending or revoking State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans and improperly withholding NEVI funds from the Plaintiff States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin). The injunction was stayed for seven days to allow for potential appeal. The court denied the motion as to the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont due to a lack of sufficient evidence of irreparable harm.\n\nFollowing the ruling, the DOT did not appeal, and on July 2, 2025, the injunction went into effect. The court subsequently extended deadlines for dispositive motions and discovery. The case remains ongoing as of July 2025.",
    "46259": "This case originated with a complaint filed on March 13, 2025, by students Mahmoud Khalil, Jane Joe, Sally Roe, Ned Noe, Lucy Loe, Sam Soe, Will Moe, and Kam Koe against various defendants including Columbia University, its trustees, committee members of the US House of Representatives, and several federal officials. The plaintiffs alleged a violation of their First Amendment rights stemming from the Committee on Education and Workforce’s investigation into campus responses to antisemitism following the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel. They claimed the Committee's requests for student records and pressure on Columbia University constituted unlawful coercion and chilled their speech.\n\nThe case underwent several iterations, including an amended complaint filed on April 18, 2025, and multiple motions to dismiss filed by the defendants. The Court granted motions to dismiss claims against several federal officials in their individual capacities on June 20, 2025, without prejudice. Throughout the proceedings, a protective order was implemented to safeguard the confidentiality of student information.\n\nMultiple motions related to filing briefs and extending deadlines were addressed by the Court. Amicus briefs were filed by Palestine Legal and Defending Rights & Dissent in support of the plaintiffs. As of the latest document in the provided record (July 10, 2025), the case remained ongoing, with motions to dismiss still pending and responses due. The Court had granted motions for extensions of time, indicating a complex and evolving legal battle over the scope of congressional inquiry and its impact on student speech and academic freedom.",
    "46557": "In May 2025, nineteen states and the District of Columbia (the “Plaintiffs”) filed suit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), its Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and several HHS officials, challenging a March 27, 2025 announcement outlining significant restructuring and workforce reductions within the Department. The Plaintiffs alleged the restructuring, detailed in the “March 27 Communiqué”, violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), contravened statutory mandates, and potentially violated the Constitution. Specifically, the Plaintiffs contended the rapid implementation of the changes, including mass layoffs and the closure of key sub-agencies, was arbitrary and capricious, and that HHS was failing to fulfill its congressionally-mandated duties.\n\nThe Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to halt the implementation of the RIFs and restructuring, arguing irreparable harm to vital public health programs and services. HHS countered that the changes were within its discretion, necessary for efficiency, and did not violate any laws. After a hearing, the Court granted the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction in July 2025, finding the Plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their APA claim that the agency action was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.\n\nFollowing the injunction, HHS filed motions seeking clarification or a stay of the order, citing recent Supreme Court decisions in similar cases. The Court denied these motions, reaffirming its initial ruling and emphasizing the distinct factual and legal basis of this case. Further briefing on a joint status report was ordered to assess ongoing compliance with the preliminary injunction. The case remains ongoing, with the potential for further appeals. The core dispute centers on the balance of power between the Executive Branch’s authority to reorganize federal agencies and Congress's responsibility to define those agencies' mandates and appropriate funding.",
    "46511": "This case originated from the decision by the Corporation for National and Community Service (AmeriCorps) to significantly restructure its programs in April and May of 2025, leading to the termination of grants, the removal of AmeriCorps members from service, and substantial staff reductions. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Maryland, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) due to the agency’s failure to engage in required notice-and-comment rulemaking before implementing these drastic changes.\n\nThe Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to halt the program closures and personnel actions. The Court initially granted a preliminary injunction, preventing AmeriCorps from enforcing the terminations and requiring restoration of programs and personnel. However, following the Supreme Court's decision in *Trump v. CASA*, clarifying the scope of permissible injunctive relief, the Court modified the injunction to apply only to actions harming the Plaintiff States.\n\nThe core of the dispute revolved around whether the agency’s actions constituted “significant changes” requiring public notice and comment under the Appropriations Act. The court ruled that because the agency did not follow the notice-and-comment process, its actions were unlawful.  Defendants argued the changes were within their authority and necessary for efficient management, but the Court sided with the Plaintiffs. \n\nFollowing further briefing and a status conference, the Court issued a modified injunction, reaffirming its core holding that the agency must adhere to the notice-and-comment requirements before making similar significant changes. The case remains ongoing, with the court scheduling further proceedings to address remaining issues and the Plaintiffs' amended complaint. The Plaintiffs also sought, and received, an extension of time to file an amended complaint.",

The plaintiffs alleged that actions taken by the defendants, stemming from Executive Order 14238, were dismantling the IMLS and violating statutory mandates. They sought a preliminary injunction to halt these actions, including the termination of grants and staffing reductions. \n\nFollowing the filing, multiple motions were made, including motions for leave to appear *pro hac vice* by attorneys for the plaintiffs and motions related to deadlines and discovery. The Court initially set a briefing schedule for the preliminary injunction. However, on May 1, 2025, the Court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, finding potential jurisdictional issues. The Court then extended the timeline for further briefing and consideration. The defendants subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied as moot. \n\nOn June 6, 2025, the Court issued a memorandum opinion and order denying the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. Subsequently, the parties filed joint status reports, and the Court established a new schedule for dispositive motions, including deadlines for responses to the complaint, administrative record production, and motions for summary judgment. The current status of the case is set for further dispositive motion practice, with a schedule established for the submission of briefs and potential motions for summary judgment and dismissal.",
    "46746": "Friends of the Everglades, Inc., and the Center for Biological Diversity filed suit in the Southern District of Florida against Kristi Noem (Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security), Todd Lyons (Acting Director of ICE), Kevin Guthrie (Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management), and Miami-Dade County, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs allege violations of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) stemming from the construction of a large-scale detention facility for non-citizen detainees at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (“TNT Site”) in Collier County, Florida. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants failed to conduct a required environmental impact assessment before commencing construction. \n\nThe plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to halt construction and operation of the facility. The district court granted a preliminary injunction, ordering a cessation of construction and detainee intake. The State of Florida, through Kevin Guthrie, appealed this decision and simultaneously filed a motion for a stay pending appeal, arguing that the injunction would harm law enforcement efforts and public safety. The State also challenged the Southern District’s venue, asserting the case rightly belonged in the Middle District of Florida, where the facility is physically located. \n\nThe State contends that the construction and operation of the facility are a state action, not subject to federal NEPA requirements, and that the federal government’s involvement is limited. The court allowed the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida to intervene as a plaintiff. The case centers on whether NEPA applies to the State’s actions in constructing the facility and whether the district court improperly exercised jurisdiction over the matter. The motion for a stay argues that the district court’s injunction was issued in error and will cause irreparable harm to the State’s ability to address the ongoing immigration situation.",
    "46388": "This case arises from actions taken by multiple federal agencies and officials—including the Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services—targeting Harvard University, alleging failures to adequately address antisemitism on campus. In March 2025, the agencies announced a “review” of Harvard’s federal funding and subsequently issued demands for sweeping changes to the university’s governance, programs, and admissions policies. When Harvard refused to comply, the agencies initiated a freeze and ultimately terminated over $2.7 billion in federal funding, citing violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. \n\nPlaintiffs—the American Association of University Professors, its Harvard chapter, and the United Automobile Workers union—allege these actions are unlawful and unconstitutional. They contend the government failed to follow proper procedures under Title VI, including conducting a legitimate investigation, providing a hearing, and offering a reasoned explanation for the funding cuts. Further, Plaintiffs argue the government’s actions violate the First Amendment by coercing Harvard into abandoning its academic independence and punishing it for allowing a diversity of viewpoints. \n\nThe plaintiffs have filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking to overturn the funding terminations and obtain a permanent injunction preventing the government from similar actions in the future. They assert the government’s actions were motivated by political considerations and represent an abuse of power, exceeding the scope of permissible enforcement under civil rights laws. The case is currently in the discovery phase, with a briefing schedule set for motions concerning preliminary relief and the administrative record. The plaintiffs are arguing that the government’s actions are unlawful and detrimental to academic freedom.",
    "46625": "In May 2025, Vera Institute of Justice, along with several other non-profit organizations (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), filed a class action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi, the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), and Maureen Henneberg, the Acting Head of OJP. The suit stemmed from the DOJ’s abrupt termination of over 370 multi-year grants, totaling over $820 million, in April 2025. Plaintiffs alleged that the terminations were unlawful, lacked a reasoned basis, and violated both constitutional and statutory provisions, including the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The DOJ terminated the grants with a standardized notice stating the awards \"no longer effectuate[d] agency priorities.\"\n\nPlaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to reinstate the funding and class certification to represent similarly situated grantees. The DOJ filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction and that the Plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The DOJ asserted that the terminations fell under its discretionary authority and did not violate any laws. \n\nThe District Court, Judge Amit P. Mehta presiding, ultimately sided with the DOJ, dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The Court found that the claims were essentially contractual in nature and thus fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. The Court also found that Plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for an injunction pending appeal, which was denied. The case is currently in the appellate stage.",
    "46387": "In April 2025, Susman Godfrey LLP filed suit against the Executive Office of the President and numerous federal agencies, challenging Executive Order 14,263, issued by President Donald Trump. The Order targeted Susman Godfrey based on the firm’s legal work, specifically its representation of clients in cases challenging the 2020 election results and its employment practices. Susman Godfrey alleged the Order violated the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, exceeded the President’s authority, and violated the separation of powers. \n\nThe government defended the Order as legitimate government speech and within the President’s authority to direct agency actions and ensure federal funds are not used to support activities deemed detrimental to national interests. However, the court found the Order’s basis to be retaliatory and unconstitutional, rejecting the government’s arguments. \n\nFollowing briefing and a hearing, the court granted Susman Godfrey’s motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the enforcement of Executive Order 14,263. The court declared the Order null and void, finding it violated Susman Godfrey’s First Amendment rights through viewpoint discrimination and retaliation, and infringed on its due process rights. The court also determined the Order exceeded the President’s constitutional authority. This decision followed similar rulings in challenges to related executive orders targeting other law firms, establishing a pattern of judicial rejection of the Trump administration’s efforts to punish legal representation based on political disagreements. The court’s ruling prevents the Executive Branch from implementing any aspect of the Order or relying on its stated findings in future actions.",
    "46245": "The United States Institute of Peace (USIP), along with several of its Board members, initiated legal action against Kenneth Jackson, other DOGE administrators, and President Donald Trump following the removal of the Board members in March 2025. The plaintiffs alleged that the President’s removal of the Board members violated statutory requirements outlined in 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f), which specifies conditions for removal, and sought to invalidate subsequent actions taken by those installed in their place, including the transfer of USIP’s assets and a restructuring of the organization. \n\nThe District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring the removals unlawful and reinstating the original Board members. The court found that the President did not comply with the statutory removal process and that the actions taken by the replacements were invalid. However, a motions panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently stayed that judgment, prompting the plaintiffs to file a petition for rehearing en banc and an application for an emergency administrative stay of the panel's order. \n\nThe plaintiffs argue that the panel's stay improperly broadens the exception to at-will presidential removal, potentially undermining established precedent and risking the dismantling of USIP before the merits of the case can be fully considered. They emphasize the unique nature of USIP as an independent, non-profit organization created by Congress and argue that the panel’s ruling disregards its distinct character and role. They seek to have the en banc court lift the stay, preserving the District Court’s judgment and protecting USIP from further disruption. The case centers on the scope of presidential authority over independent government entities and the interpretation of statutory removal protections.",
    "46274": "This case originates from the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) decision to terminate grant agreements awarded to Climate United Fund, Coalition for Green Capital, Power Forward Communities, Inc., and the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank (collectively, the Plaintiffs) under the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) program. These grants, totaling billions of dollars, were intended to support clean energy projects. Following the termination, the Plaintiffs filed suit alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), breach of contract, and other claims, seeking a preliminary injunction to restore access to the funds.\n\nThe dispute centers on the EPA’s justification for terminating the grants—a shift in priorities—and whether the agency acted lawfully in doing so. The Plaintiffs argued that the EPA’s actions were arbitrary and capricious, violated federal regulations, and improperly clawed back already-distributed funds. The EPA countered that it was acting within its authority and intended to re-obligate the funds to new grantees. A key point of contention was whether the appropriations underlying the grants had expired, preventing the EPA from making new obligations.\n\nThe District Court granted the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the EPA from effectuating the termination of the grants. The EPA subsequently filed a contingent emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, which was denied. The Court consolidated several related cases and emphasized that the Plaintiffs were seeking to maintain the status quo, not compel the disbursement of funds that had not already been allocated. The EPA then filed a Notice of Appeal to the D.C. Circuit, initiating the appellate phase of the litigation. Several *amicus curiae* briefs were filed, one of which argued that the EPA could not lawfully reobligate the expired funds. The case now proceeds on appeal, with the core issue being whether the EPA acted lawfully in terminating the grants and attempting to reallocate the funds.",
    "46142": "This case concerns a challenge to three Executive Orders issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025 – Executive Order 14151 (“Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs”), Executive Order 14168 (“Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism”), and Executive Order 14173 (“Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity”). The plaintiffs, National Urban League and AIDS Foundation of Chicago, allege these orders violate their First and Fifth Amendment rights, and seek declaratory and injunctive relief. They argue the orders are unconstitutionally vague, chill protected speech, and discriminate against individuals and organizations based on viewpoint.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend the Executive Orders threaten their funding and programmatic operations by broadly prohibiting “Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility” (DEIA) initiatives and imposing restrictions on discussions of gender identity. They assert the orders’ language is ambiguous, failing to clearly define prohibited terms and leading to uncertainty about compliance. The plaintiffs further argue the orders’ implementation, including directives from various agencies, has already resulted in the termination of funding and restrictions on program activities.\n\nThe government responded by arguing the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit and that the orders were a legitimate exercise of presidential authority.  A motion to intervene was filed by Do No Harm, a nonprofit organization opposing DEIA initiatives, but was not decided by the court at the time of these filings. \n\nThe court scheduled a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, recognizing the urgent need to address the potential for ongoing harm. The case is currently in the discovery phase, with briefing scheduled on the preliminary injunction motion. The plaintiffs seek a court order preventing the enforcement of the challenged provisions of the Executive Orders while the case proceeds.",

Trump and several agency heads (Defendants) challenging actions taken to reshape the federal workforce. The lawsuit stems from President Trump’s issuance of Executive Order 14210, directing agencies to prepare for large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), as well as directives to fire probationary employees and a program offering federal employees “deferred resignation” with continued pay and benefits.\n\nThe Unions allege that these actions violate separation of powers principles by infringing on Congress’s authority to fund and structure the federal government, and that the RIFs are being implemented improperly, failing to adhere to statutory and regulatory requirements. They seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to halt the implementation of these measures, arguing that they will cause irreparable harm by resulting in significant job losses and weakening the Unions’ bargaining power.\n\nThe Government argues that the actions are within the President's lawful authority to manage the executive branch and that the Unions lack standing to sue. They contend that the Unions have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims and that any harm is speculative. The Unions responded by emphasizing the concrete harm already occurring with the firing of probationary employees and asserting that the challenged actions exceed the President’s authority. \n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman, then reassigned to Judge Christopher R. Cooper, who heard oral arguments on February 18, 2025, and took the motion under advisement. The case remains pending as of February 20, 2025.",
    "46098": "This case, along with a related case (No. 25-cv-400), concerns a challenge to the Trump administration’s attempt to pause and ultimately alter the allocation of congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds.  A group of organizations – including Global Health Council, HIAS, and DAI Global LLC – filed suit in February 2025 alleging that the President and several executive branch officials were acting unlawfully by suspending funding for existing foreign assistance programs without proper justification or adherence to statutory requirements.  \n\nPlaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to compel the administration to release the funds. The district court granted a TRO, enjoining the defendants from suspending or terminating foreign aid programs and requiring them to honor existing contracts and grants. The government appealed this decision, and also sought a stay, but both were denied. The court found that the Plaintiff’s were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the executive branch was acting without proper statutory authority, and that the Impoundment Control Act was likely being violated. \n\nFollowing the district court’s order, the government continued to implement terminations of awards, prompting a motion to enforce the TRO by the plaintiffs. The court granted that motion, ordering the government to fully comply with the preliminary injunction. The government then appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing the district court lacked jurisdiction and erred in its rulings. The case involves complex questions of administrative law, separation of powers, and the constitutional allocation of authority over federal spending. The government argued that it was exercising legitimate authority over foreign policy and that the plaintiffs lacked a proper cause of action. The plaintiffs maintained that the administration's actions violated the law and threatened the effective operation of vital foreign assistance programs.",
    "46090": "This case originated from a challenge to actions taken by Russell Vought, in his capacity as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), to dismantle the agency following his appointment in February 2025. The National Treasury Employees Union, along with other plaintiffs including consumer advocacy groups and an individual consumer, filed suit alleging that Vought’s actions—including issuing directives halting agency work, terminating employees, and cancelling contracts—were unlawful and violated the CFPB’s statutory mandate. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to prevent further disruption of the CFPB’s operations.\n\nThe district court granted the preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and would suffer irreparable harm without relief. The court determined that Vought’s actions amounted to an attempt to effectively shut down the CFPB, a step that exceeded his authority and undermined Congress’s intent in establishing the agency. The injunction prohibited the CFPB from terminating employees, cancelling contracts, or otherwise hindering its statutorily mandated functions.\n\nThe CFPB appealed the district court’s order, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction and that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a sufficient injury. The D.C. Circuit initially partially stayed the injunction, allowing the CFPB to proceed with some personnel changes, but ultimately largely affirmed the district court's decision, finding that the CFPB lacked authority to dismantle the agency and that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a cognizable injury. The case involved complex questions of administrative law, separation of powers, and statutory interpretation, centered on the scope of the CFPB Director’s authority and the limits of executive action in altering the structure of a congressionally created agency.",
    "PN-NY-0014": "This case, *Ligon et al. v. City of New York*, originated in 2012 as a challenge to New York City Police Department (NYPD) practices concerning stops, frisks, and arrests, particularly in relation to the Trespass Affidavit Program (TAP) and New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) developments. Plaintiffs alleged violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, claiming unlawful stops and searches. Following a period of litigation and court orders, including the appointment of an independent monitor, the case underwent a series of settlements and modifications to remedial measures.\n\nKey aspects of the settlement included revisions to NYPD policies regarding stop and frisks, racial profiling, and interior patrols, alongside comprehensive training programs for officers. A pilot program was initiated to assess the impact of body-worn cameras. The court ordered ongoing monitoring of NYPD practices to ensure compliance with the agreed-upon reforms. Throughout the process, various motions and reports were filed, including those concerning the scope of the monitor’s authority, the implementation of the BWC program, and the assessment of compliance with the stipulated changes. \n\nThe independent monitor issued multiple reports detailing the progress of reforms, identifying areas of concern, and providing recommendations. The case continued through multiple revisions of the remedial order and settlement stipulations to address lingering concerns and ensure continued compliance. As of the most recent documents provided (2018-2020), the case remains under court supervision, with ongoing efforts to fully implement the agreed-upon reforms and assess their effectiveness. The court continues to oversee the monitoring process and address any outstanding issues to ensure lasting improvements to NYPD practices.",
    "PB-CT-0007": "This case originated with a complaint filed in November 2010 by several same-sex couples and one surviving spouse (the Plaintiffs) challenging the constitutionality of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). DOMA defined “marriage” and “spouse” for federal purposes as exclusively between one man and one woman. The Plaintiffs argued that this definition violated the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection by denying them federal benefits afforded to opposite-sex married couples. \n\nThe United States Department of Justice initially defended DOMA, but following a review, the Attorney General determined that Section 3 was unconstitutional and notified Congress of this position. The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives intervened to defend the statute.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs, finding that Section 3 of DOMA violated the equal protection clause. The court reasoned that classifications based on sexual orientation deserve heightened scrutiny and that the government failed to demonstrate a rational basis for the discriminatory treatment. The House appealed this decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. \n\nThe appeal centered on whether the district court erred in finding DOMA unconstitutional and whether the government, having conceded the statute’s unconstitutionality, had standing to pursue the appeal. The core of the dispute concerned the applicable standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause and the merits of the government’s arguments regarding the legislative intent behind DOMA. While the documents provided do not detail the Second Circuit’s ruling, they establish the case’s history and the central legal questions at stake.",
    "PC-AL-0034": "The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated a lawsuit against the State of Alabama in May 2015, alleging unconstitutional conditions at the Tutwiler Prison for Women, specifically regarding the systemic failure to protect inmates from sexual abuse and harassment. The DOJ’s investigation, conducted under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), revealed a pervasive culture of abuse by staff, inadequate policies, and insufficient oversight. A settlement agreement was reached, leading to the appointment of an independent monitor, Kathleen Dennehy, to assess the state's progress.\n\nOver four years of monitoring (from 2016 to 2019), Ms. Dennehy issued regular reports documenting the ADOC’s efforts to implement the settlement’s terms. These efforts included revising policies, providing staff training, improving investigations of abuse allegations, and implementing a new disciplinary system designed to be more restorative and trauma-informed. While substantial progress was made, the monitor’s reports consistently identified ongoing challenges, particularly regarding staffing levels, consistent implementation of new procedures, and addressing underlying cultural issues contributing to the problems. The monitor noted that the ADOC demonstrated a commitment to improvement, but sustained effort was crucial to achieving full compliance.\n\nThe monitor’s reports also highlighted the ADOC's strengths, including strong executive leadership committed to PREA compliance, and the dedicated work of the Tutwiler leadership team. The ADOC worked to address the issues raised in the reports, and consistently engaged with the monitor and DOJ to improve conditions at Tutwiler. While the case remained open during the reporting period, the trend indicated steady progress towards a safer and more constitutionally sound environment for inmates at Tutwiler. The case was ultimately closed upon achieving substantial compliance with the settlement agreement.",
    "ED-MI-0001": "This case, *Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary (BAMN)*, originated from a challenge to Michigan’s Proposal 2, a state constitutional amendment prohibiting the use of race-based preferences in public university admissions and other governmental decisions. The suit was initially filed in 2006 by a coalition of plaintiffs, including individual students and civil rights organizations, alleging that Proposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs argued that the amendment improperly restructured the political process by making it significantly more difficult for minority groups to achieve their goals through the legislative process.\n\nThe District Court initially granted summary judgment in favor of Michigan, upholding the constitutionality of Proposal 2. However, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision, finding that Proposal 2 violated the principles established in *Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1* regarding the equal protection of political processes. This ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court ultimately reversed the Sixth Circuit’s decision, holding that the Michigan amendment was constitutional. The Court reasoned that the amendment did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it reflected the democratic right of voters to determine whether racial preferences should be considered in state university admissions. The Court distinguished this case from *Washington v. Seattle*, finding that Proposal 2 did not create a unique burden on racial minorities. The Court emphasized that the Equal Protection Clause does not prevent voters from choosing to prohibit affirmative action policies.\n\nThe case involved numerous motions, appeals, and a complex procedural history, with multiple parties involved, including the Attorney General of Michigan, various universities, and numerous individual plaintiffs. The Supreme Court’s decision affirmed the legality of Proposal 2 and reinforced the principle that states have the authority to regulate admissions policies in their public universities, even if that means prohibiting the consideration of race as a factor.",
    "DR-CA-0033": "Maurizio Antoninetti initiated this lawsuit against Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. in August 2005, alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) due to inaccessible design features at two of its restaurants, specifically the height of the food preparation counter which obstructed viewing for wheelchair users. Antoninetti claimed this violated his right to the same dining experience as non-disabled customers. Chipotle initially denied the claims, and the case proceeded through discovery, including motions for summary judgment and various procedural challenges.\n\nThe District Court initially ruled partially in favor of Chipotle, finding its unwritten policy of accommodation sufficient, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision, holding that Chipotle's written policy did not comply with the ADA and remanded the case for further proceedings on injunctive relief and damages. Back in District Court, the Court again found in Chipotle’s favor regarding damages, awarding a limited amount, and initially denying injunctive relief. \n\nFollowing further appeals and clarifications, the Ninth Circuit ultimately ruled that Chipotle violated the ADA and that Antoninetti was entitled to injunctive relief. The District Court then entered judgment against Chipotle for the ADA violation. The case involved extensive motions regarding attorney’s fees, with the final amount ultimately determined upon remand from the Ninth Circuit. The case concluded with a determination of appropriate attorney’s fees and costs to be awarded to Antoninetti.",
    "CJ-FL-0009": "This case concerns a challenge to Florida’s implementation of Amendment 4 to the state constitution, which restored voting rights to many individuals with felony convictions upon completion of their sentences. Plaintiffs, a group of individuals with felony convictions and organizations advocating for voting rights, allege that Florida’s requirement to pay all fines, fees, and costs as a condition of regaining voting rights violates the Equal Protection Clause, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, and due process.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed suit in June 2019, and the District Court granted a preliminary injunction in October 2019, preventing Florida from denying registration or voting rights to individuals unable to pay outstanding financial obligations. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed this injunction. The State of Florida appealed, and the case underwent extensive proceedings, including a full trial.\n\nThe District Court ultimately ruled that Florida's financial requirements were unconstitutional as applied, finding that they discriminated against indigent felons and violated the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. The court issued a permanent injunction outlining procedures for determining eligibility, and allowing those unable to demonstrate ability to pay to register and vote. \n\nFlorida appealed the District Court’s decision. The Eleventh Circuit is currently reviewing the case, having heard oral arguments. The central legal question is whether a state can condition the restoration of voting rights on the payment of financial obligations, particularly for those who are unable to pay. The plaintiffs argue that this constitutes a poll tax, while the State contends that the financial obligations are a legitimate part of a completed sentence. As of September 11, 2020, the Eleventh Circuit has issued an opinion reversing the District Court’s ruling and vacating the injunction, finding that Florida’s law does not violate the Constitution. The case remains ongoing.",
    "CW-CA-0005": "This class action lawsuit, *Katie A. et al. v. Diana Bonta et al.*, originated in July 2002 with a complaint alleging systemic failures by the State of California and Los Angeles County to provide adequate mental health services to children in foster care. The plaintiffs, a group of children in the Los Angeles County foster care system, argued violations of federal law, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to ensure access to necessary mental health care. The suit was later amended to include a statewide class encompassing children in foster care or at imminent risk of placement, with documented mental health needs.\n\nIn June 2003, the court certified a class and, after a period of litigation and negotiation, a settlement agreement was reached with Los Angeles County. The State of California initially contested the case, but ultimately entered into a settlement agreement as well. The core of the settlement required the State to provide intensive care coordination (ICC), intensive home-based services (IHBS), and therapeutic foster care (TFC) to eligible class members. A crucial aspect of the settlement involved developing a process for identifying and serving children with mental health needs, and ensuring the availability of appropriate services.\n\nThe court maintained jurisdiction to oversee implementation of the settlement. An advisory panel was established to monitor progress, and the court received regular reports detailing the State’s efforts. Ongoing issues included challenges with data collection, ensuring adequate staffing, and fully implementing the Shared Core Practice Model. The case remained under court supervision for several years, with ongoing monitoring of compliance and adjustments to the implementation plan. Several motions were filed regarding discovery, class definition, and the State’s attempts to join the federal government as a party. Ultimately, the court approved the settlement and retained jurisdiction to enforce its terms until the case was closed in August 2015. The overarching goal of the settlement was to improve the mental health care available to vulnerable children in California’s foster care system.",
    "PC-VA-0022": "Eric DePaola, proceeding pro se, filed a civil rights action against the Virginia Department of Corrections and various officials alleging violations of his constitutional rights while incarcerated. DePaola, originally sentenced to 38 years for multiple felonies as a juvenile, was transferred to Red Onion State Prison, a facility housing Level S inmates requiring highly restrictive management. He was placed in indefinite solitary confinement following an incident where he stabbed a prison guard. DePaola argued his prolonged and indefinite solitary confinement violated his procedural due process rights as the Institutional Classification Authority (ICA) reviews were allegedly meaningless and did not provide a real opportunity for release. He also claimed the conditions of confinement – specifically, the prolonged isolation and limited environmental stimulation – violated the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, finding no genuine dispute of material fact. The court determined that the ICA reviews, while perhaps imperfect, satisfied procedural due process requirements, and that DePaola had not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate deliberate indifference on the part of prison officials or that the conditions of his confinement were unconstitutionally harmful. \n\nDePaola appealed the decision, arguing the district court abused its discretion by granting summary judgment before allowing discovery and challenging the court's findings regarding his due process and Eighth Amendment claims. Amici curiae briefs were filed by correctional experts supporting DePaola’s position, emphasizing the severe psychological harms caused by prolonged solitary confinement and the need for meaningful opportunities for reintegration. The case centers on the constitutionality of Virginia’s system for managing high-risk inmates and the extent to which prolonged solitary confinement can be justified under the Eighth Amendment.",
    "CJ-MD-0001": "Vernon Evans, Jr. filed a civil rights lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on January 19, 2006, against several Maryland state officials involved in the execution process, including Mary Ann Saar (Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services) and Frank C. Sizer, Jr. (Commissioner of the Maryland Division of Correction). The lawsuit, grounded in 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleged that the state's lethal injection procedures violated Evans’s Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by creating an unacceptable risk of excruciating pain during his execution.  Evans sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to halt his scheduled execution.\n\nThe core of the claim centered on the potential for inadequate anesthesia, the use of paralytic agents that could mask pain, and the qualifications of personnel administering the drugs.  The state responded, arguing the procedures were constitutionally sound and complied with relevant statutes.  Extensive discovery followed, including requests for internal documents and expert testimony.  The District Court held hearings and issued orders regarding the production of evidence, ultimately denying the preliminary injunction.\n\nEvans appealed several rulings, including decisions regarding discovery and the denial of the injunction.  The case saw a complex procedural history, with multiple motions, responses, and amended filings. The District Court granted the state’s request for a stay, and the matter was ultimately closed on August 17, 2012. While the details of the final disposition are not fully captured in the provided documents, the case record indicates a protracted legal battle over the constitutionality of Maryland's lethal injection protocol, which was ultimately unsuccessful for the plaintiff.",
    "CW-DC-0001": "This case, *LaShawn A. et al. v. Bowser et al.*, initiated in 1989, concerned the systemic failures of the District of Columbia’s child welfare system. The initial plaintiffs, representing children in foster care and those at risk of abuse or neglect, alleged violations of federal and local laws, seeking injunctive relief to improve the system's operation. After a trial, Judge Thomas F. Hogan found significant deficiencies in the District’s provision of child welfare services, violating both statutory and constitutional rights.\n\nA Modified Final Order (MFO) was entered in 1994, outlining detailed requirements for reform.  Subsequent implementation plans were developed and adjusted, with ongoing monitoring by a Court-appointed Monitor. Numerous motions and hearings were held over the years related to compliance with the MFO, including disputes over discovery, expert witnesses, and the adequacy of the District’s progress. The case involved multiple appeals to the D.C. Circuit Court, which affirmed the district court’s jurisdiction and generally supported its findings.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the court addressed issues such as timely investigations, appropriate placements, adequate medical care, and proper case documentation.  Contempt motions were filed due to perceived non-compliance, and various deadlines were set and extended for implementing necessary changes.  The defendants, representing the District of Columbia's mayoral administrations and related agencies, consistently worked towards fulfilling the requirements, but faced ongoing scrutiny from the plaintiffs and the court.\n\nBy 2019, substantial progress had been made, leading the parties to jointly propose an Exit and Sustainability Plan. This plan focused on maintaining achieved standards and addressing remaining areas needing improvement. The court approved this plan, signaling the potential conclusion of the decades-long litigation. The case demonstrates a prolonged effort to oversee and reform a critical public service through judicial intervention."
