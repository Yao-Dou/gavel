    "46290": "On March 5, 2025, the Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council, a recognized student organization, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas against the Texas A&M Board of Regents and university officials. The student organization was represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE). The case was assigned to Senior U.S. District Judge Lee H. Rosenthal.\n\nThe lawsuit challenged the Board of Regents' February 28, 2025 resolution banning drag shows from campus \"Special Event Venues.\" The student organization had been hosting an annual drag show called \"Draggieland\" at the campus Rudder Theatre since 2020, with the 2025 performance scheduled for March 27. The show was fully funded by the student group, not the university, and featured performers in a pageant-style format discussing what drag means to them. Past performances had sold out the 750-seat theater.\n\nThe Board's resolution stated that drag shows were inconsistent with the university's values because they \"demean women\" and involve \"mockery or objectification of women,\" potentially creating a hostile environment under Title IX. The Board also cited President Trump's January 20, 2025 executive order on \"Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism\" as justification, arguing that allowing drag shows might violate federal funding restrictions.\n\nThe student organization brought claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 and the Declaratory Judgment Act, alleging violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. They argued the ban constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination and a prior restraint on speech. The complaint also included a claim under the Texas Open Meetings Act, alleging the Board provided inadequate public notice for its February 28 meeting.\n\nThe student organization immediately sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to allow the March 27 performance to proceed. After expedited briefing and a hearing on March 18, 2025, Judge Rosenthal granted the preliminary injunction on March 24, 2025. The court found that drag shows are protected expressive conduct under the First Amendment and that the Board's ban constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination. The court determined the Rudder Theatre was a designated public forum and that the ban was not narrowly tailored to serve compelling governmental interests. The preliminary injunction allowed Draggieland to proceed as scheduled on March 27, 2025, without requiring the student organization to post a bond.\n\nThe defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on March 28, 2025 (case no. 25-20108), along with a motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The case remains active with ongoing proceedings regarding the stay motion and the underlying constitutional claims.",
    "46324": "This case was filed on March 31, 2025, by Inclusiv, Inc., a nonprofit Community Development Financial Institution, against the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Acting Deputy Administrator W.C. McIntosh, and Citibank, N.A. The case challenges EPA's termination of grants under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) program. Judge Tanya S. Chutkan is presiding.\n\nIn 2022, Congress created the GGRF through the Inflation Reduction Act, appropriating nearly $27 billion for clean energy and pollution reduction through three competitive grant programs. Inclusiv, which has a 50-year history of supporting credit unions and disadvantaged communities, applied for and received a $1.87 billion grant in April 2024 under the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator program. The grant was designed to provide funding and technical assistance to community lenders who would finance clean technology deployment in low-income communities.\n\nUnder the program structure, grant funds were held by Citibank as a financial agent rather than the U.S. Treasury. In September 2024, Citibank and Treasury entered into a Financial Agency Agreement, and in November 2024, Inclusiv, EPA, and Citibank executed an Account Control Agreement governing fund disbursement. The Account Control Agreement placed Citibank in a ministerial role, obligating it to comply with Inclusiv's instructions for fund disposition.\n\nInclusiv selected 108 credit unions across 27 states and Puerto Rico as subrecipients for $651 million in committed funds, providing written notice to EPA on February 12 and 14, 2025. However, on February 12, 2025, EPA Administrator Zeldin publicly announced intentions to \"claw back\" all GGRF grants and \"return the entire fund balance to the U.S. Treasury.\" Since mid-February 2025, GGRF funds have been frozen, preventing Inclusiv and other grantees from accessing their awarded funds.\n\nOn March 11, 2025, EPA sent substantively identical termination letters to all GGRF grant recipients, signed by Acting Deputy Administrator McIntosh. The letters cited \"substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the Agency's priorities.\" EPA relied on 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339-340 and claimed \"inherent authority to reconsider prior determinations.\" The letters provided no specific evidence of wrongdoing and gave recipients no opportunity to challenge the termination.\n\nInclusiv's complaint asserts ten counts against EPA defendants and three counts against Citibank. Against EPA, the nonprofit alleges violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, claiming EPA's actions were arbitrary and capricious, not in accordance with law, and exceeded statutory authority by violating the Inflation Reduction Act, Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, Anti-Deficiency Act, and EPA's own regulations. The complaint also raises constitutional challenges under the Separation of Powers doctrine (Legislative Vesting Clause, Spending and Appropriations Clauses, and Take Care Clause) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Against Citibank, Inclusiv alleges breach of contract, conversion, and replevin for the bank's refusal to disburse funds according to Inclusiv's lawful instructions.\n\nInclusiv sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including a declaration that EPA's termination letter is void, permanent injunctions against EPA's unlawful actions, and orders requiring Citibank to comply with its contractual obligations. The nonprofit filed a motion for preliminary injunction and briefly sought emergency relief through a temporary restraining order, which was later withdrawn.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, the court consolidated this case with the lead case No. 25-cv-698, which involves similar challenges to EPA's GGRF terminations by other grant recipients. The court denied Inclusiv's preliminary injunction motion as moot on April 16, 2025, directing that all future filings be made in the lead case. Private counsel from Venable LLP represents Inclusiv, with several attorneys admitted pro hac vice during the proceedings.",
    "46391": "On April 11, 2025, five international students proceeding under pseudonyms filed suit in the Northern District of California challenging the unlawful termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems (SEVIS) records by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The students sued Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons, Acting Field Office Director Moises Becerra, and President Donald J. Trump, all in their official capacities. The students were represented by private counsel from Van Der Hout LLP.\n\nBetween April 4-8, 2025, ICE's Student and Exchange Visitor Program terminated the SEVIS records of hundreds of F-1 visa holders nationwide, including all five plaintiffs. The terminations cited \"Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked\" as the reason. The students alleged that their minor criminal histories—which included a misdemeanor DUI conviction, a dismissed disturbing the peace charge, dismissed criminal charges, and arrests without charges—did not meet the regulatory standards for status termination under 8 C.F.R. § 214.1. Some students also had their visas revoked by the State Department.\n\nThe students brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging the SEVIS terminations were unauthorized, arbitrary and capricious, and violated procedural due process. They also asserted Fifth Amendment due process violations. They sought declaratory relief finding the terminations unlawful, restoration of their SEVIS records, and injunctive relief preventing enforcement actions, detention, and removal.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Noel Wise, who granted the students' motion to proceed under pseudonyms on April 17, 2025. On April 16, 2025, the students filed a motion for a temporary restraining order. Judge Wise granted the TRO on April 17, 2025, enjoining defendants from arresting, detaining, or transferring the students and from imposing legal effects based on the SEVIS terminations. The case was then reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White due to relatedness with similar cases.\n\nJudge White extended the TRO on April 25, 2025, and conducted hearings on the preliminary injunction motion. On May 22, 2025, Judge White granted the motion for preliminary injunction. The government filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025 (Case No. 25-4523), and subsequently moved to stay the injunction pending appeal in August 2025. The case was related to multiple similar cases involving international students facing SEVIS terminations under comparable circumstances.",
    "46509": "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, its Board of Directors, and individual board members Laura G. Ross, Thomas E. Rothman, and Diane Kaplan filed this case on April 29, 2025, against President Donald J. Trump and other federal defendants including the White House Presidential Personnel Office and the Office of Management and Budget. The case is being litigated by private counsel from Saul Ewing LLP before Judge Randolph D. Moss in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nThe dispute arose on April 28, 2025, when Trent Morse, Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel, sent emails to three of the five sitting CPB board members purporting to terminate their positions on behalf of President Trump. The terse email stated only: \"On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is terminated effective immediately. Thank you for your service.\" If effective, this action would have left CPB with only two active board members out of its authorized nine-member board.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that the President lacks authority to remove CPB board members because Congress deliberately structured CPB as an independent private nonprofit corporation insulated from government interference. The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 explicitly states that CPB \"will not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government\" and that board members are \"not officers or employees of the United States.\" The Act also forbids \"any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over\" CPB. Plaintiffs contend this statutory scheme provides only one mechanism for removal: automatic forfeiture when a board member fails to attend at least 50 percent of board meetings in a calendar year.\n\nThe defendants' position, as reflected in the court's analysis, is that while the Act grants the President appointment authority with Senate consent, it does not expressly address removal authority. Under D.C. nonprofit corporation law, which governs CPB, directors appointed by persons other than members may be removed by those same persons unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise. At the time of the purported removals, CPB's governing documents contained no removal restrictions, though the board subsequently amended its bylaws on May 15, 2025, to prohibit removal without a two-thirds vote of other directors.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed claims under the Administrative Procedure Act alleging the removals were not in accordance with law and exceeded statutory authority, as well as constitutional claims for violations of separation of powers, ultra vires presidential action, and violations of the Presentment, Appropriations, and Take Care Clauses. They sought both declaratory judgment that the removal email has no legal effect and injunctive relief preventing defendants from interfering with CPB's governance.\n\nThe plaintiffs immediately moved for a temporary restraining order, which the parties later agreed to treat as a motion for preliminary injunction after a hearing on May 14, 2025. On June 8, 2025, Judge Moss denied the preliminary injunction motion. The court concluded that plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm. While acknowledging the \"important questions regarding the status of the Corporation and its relationship with the federal government,\" the judge found that D.C. corporate law permitted the President's removal action at the time it occurred, before CPB amended its bylaws. The court also noted that CPB could continue operating with fewer directors through a \"designated body\" provision in its bylaws that allows former directors to serve temporarily.\n\nThe case references similar recent actions by the administration, including the forcible takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace headquarters by federal agents and Department of Government Efficiency staff in March 2025. A DOGE staff member also contacted remaining CPB board members in April 2025 about \"getting a DOGE team assigned to the organization,\" though no further government interference materialized.\n\nFollowing the preliminary injunction ruling, the parties established an expedited summary judgment briefing schedule. However, two of the individual plaintiffs—Laura Ross and Thomas Rothman—voluntarily dismissed their claims in July and August 2025, leaving CPB, its Board of Directors, and Diane Kaplan as the remaining plaintiffs. Summary judgment motions were filed in July 2025, with briefing scheduled to conclude in October 2025.",
    "46590": "This case was filed on April 7, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia before Judge Irene C. Berger. Harry Wiley, a coal miner, brought this class action lawsuit on behalf of himself and all coal miners with evidence of pneumoconiosis (black lung disease) against Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in his official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiff is represented by private counsel, Mountain State Justice (a legal services organization), and Appalachian Mountain Advocates.\n\nThe case arises from defendants' decision to effectively shut down the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) and related \"Part 90\" job transfer program operated by the Respiratory Health Division within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in Morgantown, West Virginia. These programs, mandated by the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act and Mine Safety and Health Act (30 U.S.C. § 843), provide medical screening for coal miners and the right to transfer to low-dust jobs when they develop black lung disease. On April 1, 2025, defendants terminated or placed on administrative leave nearly all employees in the Respiratory Health Division, including the chief medical officer, effectively shuttering these critical health and safety programs.\n\nThe plaintiff Harry Wiley is a coal miner with 38 years of experience who was diagnosed with black lung disease in November 2024. He submitted an application for Part 90 job transfer rights to NIOSH in November 2024 but received no response due to the program closure. Black lung is a progressive, incurable disease that worsens with continued dust exposure, making early intervention and job transfers critical to prevent debilitating progression.\n\nWiley's claims are brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706), alleging that defendants' actions were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. He also alleges violations of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The plaintiff seeks declaratory judgment that defendants must comply with their statutory duties and injunctive relief requiring restoration of the terminated programs.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction. After a hearing on May 7, 2025, that included testimony from NIOSH employees and affected miners, Judge Berger granted the preliminary injunction on May 13, 2025. The court found that plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm from continued dust exposure without access to job transfer rights, and that the public interest favored maintaining the congressionally mandated programs. The court ordered that the reduction-in-force notices be enjoined and rescinded to facilitate full restoration of the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division, and that there be no gap in the protections and services mandated by Congress. Defendants were required to submit written certification of compliance within 20 days.\n\nThe court rejected defendants' arguments that the case involved non-reviewable personnel decisions, finding instead that plaintiff challenged the elimination of statutorily required programs, not employment actions per se. The court also found that the program closure constituted final agency action subject to review under the APA, despite defendants' arguments that their reorganization was still in progress.\n\nOn July 9, 2025, plaintiff moved for leave to file a second amended complaint, which was granted on August 14, 2025. The case remains active with trial scheduled for May 4, 2026. The preliminary injunction requires defendants to maintain the coal miner health surveillance and job transfer programs during the pendency of the litigation.",
    "46605": "This case was filed on May 17, 2025, by Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan, a Venezuelan citizen and asylum applicant, against President Donald J. Trump and various federal officials and agencies. The case arose from President Trump's March 2025 issuance of Proclamation No. 10903, which invoked the Alien Enemies Act to authorize the immediate apprehension and removal of Venezuelan citizens who are members of the Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nArevalo, who had been granted work authorization and parole to remain in the United States while his asylum application was pending, was arrested during a scheduled ICE check-in without prior notice or documentation of the arrest basis. He was informed that his detention was based on his Venezuelan nationality and basketball-related tattoos that could potentially indicate gang affiliation. Arevalo filed both a habeas corpus petition and a class action complaint asserting 20 claims under the U.S. Constitution, California Constitution, and various statutes.\n\nThe case seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the government from removing class members under the Alien Enemies Act without adequate notice and process. The proposed class includes all noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California who are subject to the March 2025 Proclamation. Judge John W. Holcomb is presiding over the case.\n\nOn May 19, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order, and on June 2, 2025, certified the class and issued a preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction enjoins the government from removing Arevalo or class members under the Alien Enemies Act or Proclamation pending further court order regarding adequate notice requirements, and from transferring them out of the judicial district except for lawful removal orders under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The court required Arevalo to post a nominal $1 bond.\n\nThe government challenged Arevalo's standing, arguing he was detained under the Immigration and Nationality Act rather than the Alien Enemies Act. However, the court found Arevalo faced an imminent threat of removal under the Proclamation based on the government's inability to provide assurances otherwise. While the court concluded that Arevalo was unlikely to succeed on his challenge to the Proclamation's validity, it found he was likely to succeed on his due process claims regarding inadequate notice and process before removal.\n\nArevalo was granted asylum on June 9, 2025, but remained in ICE custody. On June 14, 2025, he filed an emergency ex parte application for a writ of habeas corpus seeking immediate release. The court denied this application on June 20, 2025, finding that the government could lawfully detain him under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A) pending the government's appeal of his asylum grant. The government filed a notice of appeal of the preliminary injunction order on August 1, 2025, which was assigned Ninth Circuit case number 25-4866.\n\nThe case is part of broader nationwide litigation challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act against Venezuelan nationals, with the Supreme Court having previously ruled in related cases that detainees subject to removal under the Act are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal in their district of confinement.",
    "46635": "On May 22, 2025, Shira Perlmutter, the Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump and other federal officials, represented by Democracy Forward Foundation and Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP. The case was assigned to Judge Timothy J. Kelly.\n\nThe dispute began when President Trump fired Librarian of Congress Carla D. Hayden on May 8, 2025, reportedly over concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Two days later, acting through White House Presidential Personnel Office officials Sergio Gor and Trent Morse, the President purportedly terminated Perlmutter from her position as Register of Copyrights, effective immediately. The President then appointed Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as acting Librarian of Congress, who subsequently designated Associate Deputy Attorney General Paul Perkins as acting Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office.\n\nPerlmutter brought two counts challenging these actions. Count I alleged that the President's appointment of Blanche as acting Librarian was ultra vires, arguing that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act does not authorize presidential appointment of acting officials in the Library of Congress because it is not an \"Executive agency\" under the statute. Count II claimed violations of the Constitution's Appointments Clause and separation of powers doctrine, contending that only the Librarian of Congress has statutory authority under 17 U.S.C. § 701(a) to appoint and remove the Register of Copyrights, not the President or his appointees.\n\nPerlmutter sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent defendants from interfering with her lawful appointment and to declare that she remains the Register of Copyrights. The case arose in the context of the Copyright Office's work on a multi-part report addressing copyright issues related to artificial intelligence, with Part 3 being released just before Perlmutter's removal.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, Perlmutter moved for a temporary restraining order. After briefing and a hearing on May 28, 2025, Judge Kelly denied the motion, finding that Perlmutter had not established irreparable harm. Following a status conference, the court established a briefing schedule for a preliminary injunction motion.\n\nPerlmutter filed her preliminary injunction motion on June 10, 2025. After full briefing and a hearing on July 23, 2025, Judge Kelly issued a detailed memorandum opinion on July 30, 2025, denying the motion. The court concluded that Perlmutter failed to demonstrate irreparable harm, applying the Supreme Court's standard from Sampson v. Murray that preliminary injunctions in government personnel cases require a \"genuinely extraordinary situation.\" Judge Kelly rejected Perlmutter's arguments that her temporary loss of a \"statutory right to function,\" inability to perform statutory duties, or institutional harm to the Library of Congress and Copyright Office constituted irreparable harm, noting that recent Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit decisions had stayed similar injunctions in comparable officer-removal cases.\n\nPerlmutter appealed the preliminary injunction denial to the D.C. Circuit on July 31, 2025, and filed an emergency motion for injunction pending appeal. On August 20, 2025, Judge Kelly denied that motion as well, reiterating that Perlmutter had not shown irreparable harm. The case remains on appeal to the D.C. Circuit under case number 25-5285, while the district court has scheduled cross-motions for summary judgment with a hearing set for November 4, 2025.",
    "45143": "This case was filed on April 20, 2023, by parents Ashley Willey and Sean Willey against Sweetwater County School District #1's Board of Trustees and four individual defendants: Superintendent Kelly McGovern, Assistant Superintendent Nicole Bolton, Director of Student Services Kayci Arnoldi, and Principal Bryant Blake. The parents were represented by private counsel from Bailey Stock Harmon Cottam Lopez LLP and the Child & Parental Rights Campaign.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from the school district's implementation of a policy regarding transgender students that the parents alleged violated their fundamental constitutional rights. The parents' daughter, A.S., was a 16-year-old student at Black Butte High School who had a history of childhood trauma and was receiving treatment for ADHD, PTSD, and symptoms of gender dysphoria from a private counselor chosen by her parents.\n\nDuring the 2021-2022 school year, A.S. told school staff she wanted to be treated as a boy, use the male name \"C\" and male pronouns, and requested that this information be concealed from her parents. Pursuant to district policy, school personnel agreed to this arrangement and for over six months treated A.S. as a boy at school while using her legal name and female pronouns when communicating with her parents. The parents only discovered this deception in March 2022 when Mrs. Willey happened to meet teachers at a district training who inadvertently revealed the situation.\n\nThe district had implemented what the parents termed \"the Policy,\" consisting of two components: a \"Preferred Names Policy\" requiring staff to use students' preferred names and pronouns even if they differ from biological sex, and a \"Parent Concealment Policy\" requiring staff to conceal this information from parents unless the student consents. Mrs. Willey, who was also employed as a teacher by the district, was told she must comply with the Policy despite her religious objections and was denied accommodations for her religious beliefs.\n\nThe parents brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of their Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights to direct their children's upbringing and make mental health decisions, and Mrs. Willey's First Amendment rights to free exercise of religion and free speech. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as monetary damages.\n\nOn April 21, 2023, the parents filed a motion for preliminary injunction. Judge Scott W. Skavdahl granted the motion in part on June 30, 2023, enjoining the district from precluding employees from responding to parental inquiries about students' preferred names or pronouns and from requiring employees to lie to parents about such requests, but denied the injunction as to other aspects of the policy.\n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss on June 29, 2023, but the parents filed an amended complaint on July 20, 2023, rendering the motion moot. The defendants then filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on August 17, 2023. On December 18, 2023, Judge Skavdahl granted the motion in part and denied it in part, allowing the parents to proceed on claims for nominal and compensatory damages on their parental rights and parental free exercise claims, dismissing Mrs. Willey's free speech claim, but allowing her individual free exercise claim to proceed.\n\nThe case proceeded through discovery with a jury trial scheduled for June 2, 2025. However, on March 24, 2025, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. On April 28, 2025, Judge Skavdahl granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all remaining claims and dismissed Sean Willey from the action, leaving Ashley Willey as the sole remaining plaintiff before dismissing all her claims as well.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on May 23, 2025, appealing to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals under case number 25-8027. The case involved significant issues regarding the balance between parental rights, student privacy, and religious accommodation in public schools in the context of transgender student policies.",
    "PH-IL-0002": "This class action lawsuit was filed on May 10, 2016, by over thirty current and former residents of the Alexander County Housing Authority (ACHA) against ACHA, Executive Director James Wilson, and Finance Director Martha Franklin. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from Hughes, Socol, Piers, Resnick & Dym, Ltd. and attorneys from the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law. The case was assigned to Chief Judge Michael J. Reagan with Magistrate Judge Reona J. Daly handling case management.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that ACHA engaged in racial and familial status discrimination at its McBride and Elmwood family housing developments in violation of the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003. According to the complaint, approximately 97% of residents in McBride and Elmwood were African-American, while white households predominated in other ACHA developments like Connell Smith. The plaintiffs claimed this segregation was intentional and echoed discriminatory practices from decades earlier—the U.S. Department of Justice had sued ACHA in 1974 for intentionally segregating these same housing complexes by race, resulting in a settlement agreement.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centered on ACHA's alleged failure to maintain the McBride and Elmwood developments in decent, safe, and sanitary conditions while adequately maintaining developments with more white residents. Plaintiffs described units infested with mice, roaches, and bedbugs; serious mold problems; broken plumbing, heating, and electrical systems; and security issues. Meanwhile, ACHA allegedly maintained the Connell Smith development in satisfactory condition and provided security cameras and guards. The complaint also alleged that ACHA improperly prohibited families with children from living in certain developments like Connell Smith and Shoemaker, which did not qualify as senior housing under federal law.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought to certify multiple subclasses: a race discrimination subclass for African-American residents of McBride and Elmwood; a familial status discrimination subclass for residents with minor children; and a residential lease breach subclass. They requested declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the discriminatory practices, along with compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney's fees.\n\nThe case proceeded through discovery with various disputes over document production, including executive session minutes and email searches. HUD's 2014 finding that ACHA had violated Title VI through intentional racial segregation was referenced as supporting evidence. The case underwent several amendments to the complaint, adding additional plaintiffs and refining the legal claims.\n\nSettlement discussions began in 2016 and continued through 2017. During the settlement process, some plaintiffs' attorneys moved to withdraw from representing certain clients who had become unresponsive. On July 27, 2017, the represented plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal, agreeing to dismiss their claims with prejudice and without costs, with each party bearing its own attorney's fees. Three plaintiffs (Latonya Lee, Denieshia Childress, and Coretta Cornelius) had lost counsel and were proceeding pro se, but they failed to respond to court orders or participate in proceedings. Chief Judge Reagan dismissed their claims for failure to prosecute on August 1 and September 12, 2017. The case was closed on September 12, 2017, with all claims resolved through the settlement and dismissals for failure to prosecute.",
    "16518": "The United States filed this civil rights enforcement action against the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice on April 14, 2022, under the pattern or practice provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, 34 U.S.C. § 12601. The case was assigned to Judge Mary Geiger Lewis in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Carolina represented the United States.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from a DOJ investigation that began in 2017 examining conditions at the Broad River Road Complex (BRRC), South Carolina's long-term juvenile commitment facility. The facility houses youth aged 17 and younger who have been adjudicated delinquent, with an average daily population of over 100 youth and average stays of six to seven months. The investigation involved multiple site visits, staff and youth interviews, document review, and video analysis.\n\nDOJ issued two findings reports documenting constitutional violations. The February 5, 2020 report concluded that the Department of Juvenile Justice failed to keep youth reasonably safe from youth-on-youth violence and subjected youth to prolonged, punitive isolation in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. The April 14, 2022 report found that staff used excessive force against youth. Specifically, DOJ found that between July 2018 and May 2019, there were 134 fights and 71 assaults resulting in 99 injuries to youth, with violence occurring on average two out of every three days. Staff engaged in dangerous tactics including choking, punching, kicking, and twisting youth's arms, often in response to verbal non-compliance rather than physical threats. Youth were placed in isolation for minor infractions like profanity or disrespect, sometimes for weeks or months in small, dark cells for 23 hours daily without meaningful education or programming. These conditions led to self-harm attempts and deteriorating mental health among youth.\n\nThe case was resolved through a comprehensive settlement agreement signed by the parties on April 13, 2022, the day before the complaint was filed. The agreement addresses staffing levels, physical plant security, use of force policies, isolation practices, staff training, investigation procedures, and quality assurance systems. Key provisions include conducting a staffing study, eliminating blind spots through improved surveillance, implementing positive behavior management programs, restricting use of force to situations involving immediate danger, limiting isolation to four hours except with supervisory approval, providing meaningful education during any isolation, and establishing a multidisciplinary team to review isolation placements.\n\nThe settlement includes extensive monitoring through a Subject Matter Expert to be jointly selected by the parties, with a budget not exceeding $225,000 in the first year. The expert will conduct semi-annual compliance assessments and provide technical assistance. DJJ appointed Wendy Leach as Director of Settlement Compliance to coordinate implementation. The agreement establishes a five-year term, subject to early termination if substantial compliance is achieved and maintained for one year.\n\nOn April 14, 2022, the parties filed a joint motion for conditional dismissal, which Judge Lewis granted on April 20, 2022. The court dismissed the case without prejudice while retaining jurisdiction to resolve any disputes over compliance with the settlement agreement. The judgment was entered the same day, with the case remaining subject to potential reinstatement if material breach occurs.",
    "46815": "On May 21, 2025, a federal grand jury in the Middle District of Tennessee indicted Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia on two counts related to human smuggling: conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and illegal transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain, both in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324. The charges stem from a November 30, 2022 traffic stop by Tennessee Highway Patrol, during which Abrego was allegedly driving a vehicle containing nine individuals who were being transported illegally for financial compensation.\n\nThe case is presided over by District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr., with Magistrate Judge Barbara D. Holmes handling pretrial matters. Abrego is represented by Federal Public Defender attorneys and later private counsel, including pro hac vice attorneys Sean Hecker, Jenna Dabbs, and David Patton.\n\nThe government's evidence includes testimony from cooperating witnesses who claim Abrego participated in a broader human smuggling conspiracy operated by a business called \"Trans Express,\" phone records showing communications with the conspiracy's leader during the traffic stop, and a roster allegedly showing that one of the transported individuals was a minor. The government argued that Abrego transported approximately 120 undocumented individuals and was paid $1,000-$1,500 per trip.\n\nA significant backdrop to this prosecution is Abrego's immigration history. He had been living in the United States for over a decade with his family and had an immigration court order granting withholding of removal to El Salvador. However, he was removed to El Salvador in March 2025. A federal court in Maryland ordered his return, leading to the Supreme Court case Noem v. Abrego Garcia, 145 S. Ct. 1017 (2025), which affirmed that the government must facilitate his return from El Salvador. He was arrested upon his return to the United States on June 6, 2025.\n\nThe government filed a motion for pretrial detention, arguing that the case involved minor victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(1)(E), that Abrego posed a serious risk of flight, and that he posed a danger to the community. On June 22, 2025, Magistrate Judge Holmes denied the detention motion in a detailed 51-page memorandum opinion, finding that the government failed to establish grounds for a detention hearing and that conditions of release could reasonably assure Abrego's appearance and community safety.\n\nThe government appealed the release decision to the district court. Following a July 16, 2025 evidentiary hearing, District Judge Crenshaw issued a July 23, 2025 memorandum opinion denying the government's motion for revocation of the release order. The court found that while the government was entitled to a detention hearing under § 3142(f)(1)(E) because the crimes involved minor victims, the government failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions could ensure Abrego's appearance and community safety.\n\nOn August 22, 2025, Magistrate Judge Holmes ordered Abrego's release on conditions including electronic monitoring, location restrictions, third-party custodian supervision, and various other standard pretrial release conditions. Abrego has filed a motion to dismiss the charges for vindictive and selective prosecution. A jury trial is scheduled for January 27, 2026.",
    "46755": "On July 1, 2025, the City of Columbus, Ohio; the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland; the City of Chicago, Illinois; Doctors for America; and Main Street Alliance filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland challenging federal regulations under the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel from the Democracy Forward Foundation, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Department of Health and Human Services, Mehmet Oz as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and CMS itself. Judge Brendan A. Hurson was assigned to the case.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges the \"Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Rule,\" a regulation published by CMS on June 25, 2025, and scheduled to take effect on August 25, 2025. The rule purports to strengthen the integrity of ACA eligibility and enrollment systems to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse, but plaintiffs argue it will have the opposite effect. According to the complaint, the rule will cause at least 1.8 million Americans to lose coverage on ACA health insurance exchanges in 2026 and result in higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs for remaining enrollees.\n\nThe challenged rule includes several key provisions: a $5 monthly surcharge on certain low-income enrollees until they confirm eligibility; changes to premium adjustment methodology that increase cost-sharing limits; expansion of allowable variation in actuarial value calculations; allowing insurers to deny coverage to individuals with past-due premiums; enhanced verification requirements for special enrollment periods; reinstating a failure-to-reconcile penalty for tax credit recipients; and stricter income verification requirements when applicant data doesn't match IRS records.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged these provisions are both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the APA. They argued the rule violates the ACA's guaranteed-issue requirement, exceeds CMS's statutory authority regarding tax credit calculations, and lacks adequate justification for burdens imposed on consumers. The city plaintiffs claimed standing based on anticipated increased costs for uncompensated care as more residents become uninsured, while Main Street Alliance asserted associational standing on behalf of small business members who rely on ACA marketplace coverage.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for a stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or preliminary injunction. After briefing and a hearing on August 14, 2025, Judge Hurson issued a memorandum opinion on August 22, 2025, granting the motion in part and denying it in part. The court found plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits regarding seven provisions of the rule but not on two others. The court concluded that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without relief, as the City Plaintiffs would face increased uncompensated care costs not recoverable due to sovereign immunity, and at least one Main Street Alliance member might be forced to close her business due to unaffordable insurance premium increases.\n\nThe court stayed seven provisions of the rule pending final resolution of the case: the $5 premium penalty, revocation of guaranteed coverage for past-due premiums, the failure-to-reconcile policy, special enrollment period verification requirements, income verification requirements when projected income differs from trusted sources, changes to actuarial value de minimis ranges, and changes to self-attestation policy when tax data is unavailable. However, the court declined to stay provisions regarding premium adjustment percentage methodology and elimination of automatic 60-day extensions for resolving income inconsistencies. The court issued a clarifying order on August 25, 2025, specifying exactly which regulatory provisions were stayed.",
    "46576": "On April 10, 2025, sixteen states and the District of Columbia, along with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, filed suit in the Southern District of New York against the U.S. Department of Education and Education Secretary Linda McMahon. The case was assigned to Judge Edgardo Ramos. The plaintiffs are represented by their respective state attorneys general.\n\nThe dispute arises from the Department of Education's handling of COVID-19 education relief funding distributed through the Education Stabilization Fund, which included hundreds of billions of dollars appropriated under the CARES Act, Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, and American Rescue Plan Act. These funds were distributed through three main programs: Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER), Homeless Children and Youth (HCY), and Emergency Assistance to Non-Public Schools (EANS). Under federal regulations, states were required to obligate these funds by September 30, 2024, and liquidate all obligations within 120 days thereafter.\n\nThe Department of Education initially granted extension requests from the plaintiff states, allowing them additional time to liquidate their obligations through March 2026. Each state received individual approvals after submitting detailed justifications and documentation. The extensions were granted well after May 11, 2023, when the federal government declared the COVID-19 pandemic over.\n\nOn March 28, 2025, at 5:03 PM, Secretary McMahon sent a letter to state education chiefs abruptly rescinding all previously granted extensions and declaring that the liquidation period had expired at 5:00 PM that same day. The Department's sole stated justification was that extending deadlines for COVID-related grants \"years after the COVID pandemic ended is not consistent with the Department's priorities and thus not a worthwhile exercise of its discretion.\" The letter offered a new process for project-specific extension requests.\n\nThe states challenged this rescission under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging the Department's action was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. They argued the rescission ignored substantial reliance interests, failed to provide reasoned explanation for the policy change, and was issued without adequate consideration of the ongoing educational needs the funds were meant to address.\n\nOn April 11, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. Following a hearing on May 6, 2025, Judge Ramos granted the motion, enjoining the Department from implementing the March 28 rescission letter and requiring 14 days' notice before any future modifications to the liquidation periods.\n\nOn May 11, 2025, the Department issued another letter providing 14 days' notice and terminating the liquidation extensions on May 25, 2025. The letter provided more detailed reasoning for the rescission, stating that states were increasingly using funds for purposes \"less and less connected to direct academic services to students and the ongoing educational harms caused by COVID.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second motion for emergency relief on May 14, 2025. After a hearing on June 3, 2025, Judge Ramos issued an expanded preliminary injunction that enjoined enforcement of both the March 28 and May 11 letters, required 30 days' notice for any future modifications, and directed the Department to process outstanding and future liquidation requests without delay.\n\nThe Department filed an interlocutory appeal on June 4, 2025 (Second Circuit Case No. 25-1424), but the appeal was later withdrawn by stipulation in August 2025. The preliminary injunction remains in effect, allowing the states to continue accessing their previously awarded education stabilization funds while the litigation proceeds.",
    "46637": "On May 27, 2025, National Public Radio (NPR) and three local public radio stations—Aspen Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio, and KSUT Public Radio—filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald Trump and various federal officials and agencies. The case, assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss, challenges Executive Order 14290, titled \"Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,\" which President Trump issued on May 1, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP (for NPR) and Zansberg Beylkin LLC (for the local stations). The defendants include the President, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of the Treasury, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), along with various officials in their official capacities.\n\nThe Executive Order directed CPB and federal agencies to terminate all direct and indirect funding to NPR and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), stating that these organizations do not \"present a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events.\" The Order specifically instructed CPB to cease direct funding to NPR and PBS, prohibit local public radio stations from using federal funds to acquire NPR or PBS programming, and directed federal agencies to identify and terminate any funding to these organizations. The Order was accompanied by a fact sheet and press release that criticized NPR's journalism as \"left-wing propaganda\" and cited specific coverage decisions the Administration opposed.\n\nThe plaintiffs' legal challenge rests on both constitutional and statutory grounds. They argue the Order violates the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech, press, and association by engaging in viewpoint-based discrimination and retaliation against NPR for its protected journalistic activities. They also claim Fifth Amendment due process violations for denying funding without adequate notice or process. On statutory grounds, they contend the Order violates the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which expressly prohibits federal officials from exercising \"direction, supervision, or control\" over CPB or its grantees, and other federal statutes governing arts funding and appropriations.\n\nThe case is related to Corporation for Public Broadcasting v. Trump, No. 25-1305, which involves the President's attempt to remove CPB board members. The factual backdrop includes the Administration's efforts to replace non-compliant CPB board members and statements by President Trump criticizing NPR's coverage dating back to his first term.\n\nOn June 13, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, seeking declaratory relief that the Executive Order is unlawful and permanent injunctive relief preventing its implementation. The federal defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on July 12, 2025, arguing that the plaintiffs lack a viable cause of action, their claims are not ripe for review, and the Order does not violate the Constitution or federal statutes when the government chooses not to subsidize particular speech. They contend the government has broad discretion in funding decisions and that no concrete harm has yet occurred since CPB has not complied with the Order.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed their combined opposition and reply on July 25, 2025, maintaining they have suffered immediate constitutional injuries from the Order's chilling effects on their speech and editorial decisions, and that the Order cannot be reconciled with either the First Amendment's prohibitions on viewpoint discrimination or the Public Broadcasting Act's protections for editorial independence.\n\nThe case also attracted significant amicus support, with briefs filed by news organizations, civil liberties groups, and 23 states supporting the plaintiffs' position. The legal dispute fundamentally concerns the extent of executive power to condition or revoke federal funding for public media based on disagreement with editorial content, and whether such actions violate constitutional protections for press freedom and statutory safeguards for public broadcasting independence.",
    "46340": "On April 3, 2025, six major federal employee unions filed suit challenging Executive Order 14251, which President Trump issued on March 27, 2025. The plaintiff unions—the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United (NNOC/NNU), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), National Association of Government Employees (NAGE), and National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE)—collectively represent over one million federal employees. The unions are represented by private counsel from Bredhoff & Kaiser PLLC and Feinberg, Jackson, Worthman & Wasow LLP, along with union attorneys. Judge James Donato presides over the case in the Northern District of California.\n\nExecutive Order 14251 excluded over 40 federal departments, agencies, and subdivisions from coverage under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Chapter 71 of Title 5), effectively eliminating collective bargaining rights for approximately two-thirds of the federal workforce. The excluded entities ranged from entire cabinet departments like the Department of State, Department of Justice, and Department of Veterans Affairs, to specific subdivisions like the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and various Chief Information Officer offices. The order was issued under Section 7103(b)(1) of the statute, which permits presidential exclusions when agencies have primary national security functions and collective bargaining cannot be applied consistent with national security requirements.\n\nAccompanying the executive order, the White House issued a Fact Sheet that criticized \"hostile Federal unions\" who \"declared war on President Trump's agenda\" and were \"'fighting back' against Trump.\" The Fact Sheet stated that \"President Trump supports constructive partnerships with unions who work with him\" but \"will not tolerate mass obstruction.\" The Office of Personnel Management simultaneously issued guidance instructing affected agencies to terminate collective bargaining agreements, cease grievance procedures, end payroll deduction of union dues, and reassign employees conducting union business on official time.\n\nThe unions alleged violations of their First Amendment rights through retaliation and viewpoint discrimination, claiming the order was issued in response to their protected speech activities, including filing lawsuits against Trump administration policies and making public statements critical of the administration. They also alleged the order was ultra vires, exceeding the President's authority under Chapter 71, and violated Fifth Amendment procedural due process, property rights in existing collective bargaining agreements, and equal protection principles. The unions sought declaratory and injunctive relief and attorney's fees.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order, which the court treated as a preliminary injunction motion. The government opposed the motion, raising jurisdictional challenges and arguing the order was a valid exercise of national security authority. On June 24, 2025, Judge Donato granted the preliminary injunction, finding plaintiffs raised serious First Amendment questions warranting preservation of the status quo pending trial. The court concluded plaintiffs demonstrated a serious question whether the order retaliated against their protected speech, evidenced by the White House Fact Sheet's hostile language toward unions and the unprecedented scope of exclusions. The court also found plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm through loss of collective bargaining rights, dramatic reductions in membership dues, and threats to union viability.\n\nThe preliminary injunction enjoined defendants from implementing Section 2 of Executive Order 14251 against plaintiffs and their members, and required plaintiffs to post a $60,000 bond. The government immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 26, 2025, and filed an emergency motion to stay the injunction pending appeal. The district court denied the stay motion on July 8, 2025. However, the Ninth Circuit granted an administrative stay on July 10, 2025, and on August 1, 2025, issued a full stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit concluded the government demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, finding that even if the order contained some retaliatory animus, the President would have taken the same action based on national security concerns conveyed in the executive order and accompanying materials.\n\nThe case involves numerous related federal court challenges to Executive Order 14251 filed by other unions and federal employees across multiple jurisdictions. The appellate proceedings have effectively suspended the preliminary injunction while the underlying constitutional and statutory claims await further litigation on the merits.",
    "46805": "This case was filed on July 21, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island by twenty-three nonprofit organizations against federal officials including the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development. The plaintiffs include state domestic violence coalitions, sexual assault coalitions, and homeless services organizations that receive federal grants from HHS and HUD. They are represented by a mix of private law firms, Democracy Forward Foundation, the National Women's Law Center, and cooperating counsel from the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island and Lawyers' Committee for Rhode Island.\n\nThe case challenges new federal grant conditions imposed by the Trump Administration in early 2025 following a series of Executive Orders. In January 2025, President Trump issued executive orders attacking diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, targeting transgender rights, and restricting abortion access. Federal agencies then implemented these orders by adding new conditions to grant awards that prohibit recipients from using funds to promote \"gender ideology,\" require certifications that recipients don't operate DEI programs that violate federal anti-discrimination laws, prohibit funding or promoting \"elective abortions,\" and mandate compliance with all current Executive Orders. The agencies explicitly tied these conditions to False Claims Act liability, stating that compliance is \"material\" for FCA purposes and threatening both civil and criminal penalties.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue these conditions violate the Administrative Procedure Act because they exceed statutory authority, are contrary to law, and are arbitrary and capricious. They also assert constitutional violations including First Amendment free speech restrictions, Fifth Amendment due process violations due to vagueness, Spending Clause violations, and separation of powers violations for the Executive Branch imposing conditions Congress never authorized. The plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that the conditions are unlawful, injunctive relief preventing enforcement, and setting aside the agency policies.\n\nJudge Melissa R. DuBose granted the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order on July 28, 2025, after a hearing on July 24, 2025. The TRO enjoined HUD from requiring certain plaintiffs and their members to agree to the challenged conditions on Continuum of Care grants, and enjoined HHS from requiring certain plaintiffs to agree to similar conditions on Family Violence Prevention Services Act Coalition grants. The court issued multiple revised versions of the TRO through August 2025 to expand its scope to additional plaintiffs and grant programs including Community Development Block Grants.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705 on August 4, 2025, seeking broader relief covering all the challenged HUD and HHS policies. A hearing on the preliminary injunction motion is scheduled for September 4, 2025. The TRO remains in effect pending further court order.",
    "46375": "The Southern Education Foundation filed this lawsuit on April 9, 2025, challenging the Department of Education's termination of a federal grant. The plaintiff is a nonprofit organization founded in 1867 that has worked to advance equitable education in the South, including supporting the legal efforts that led to Brown v. Board of Education. The defendants are the U.S. Department of Education, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, and President Donald J. Trump, all sued in their official capacities. The case is represented by private counsel from LPJ Legal PLLC and Romano Law PLLC and is assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman.\n\nIn 2022, the Department awarded SEF a five-year, $8.6 million grant to operate the Equity Assistance Center for the southern region (EAC-South) under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This center provides technical assistance to help public schools comply with desegregation requirements and address educational inequities. The southern region contains 130 of the 132 remaining open federal school desegregation cases nationwide.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14151, titled \"Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,\" which directed federal agencies to terminate \"equity-related\" grants and contracts. The next day, he signed Executive Order 14173, \"Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,\" with similar directives.\n\nOn February 13, 2025, the Department terminated SEF's grant effective immediately through a termination letter. The letter stated that the grant \"provides funding for programs that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate\" and was \"inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities.\" The termination was made without prior notice and used a boilerplate letter similar to those sent to other grant recipients.\n\nSEF's complaint alleges violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (arbitrary and capricious agency action, failure to follow notice-and-comment rulemaking, and failure to comply with due process procedures), the Fifth Amendment (vagueness), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the First Amendment (viewpoint discrimination), and claims the termination constitutes an ultra vires impoundment of congressionally appropriated funds. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, specifically requesting reinstatement of the grant and restoration of funding.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, SEF filed a motion for preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order. After oral argument on May 12, 2025, Judge Friedman granted the preliminary injunction on May 21, 2025. The court found SEF was likely to succeed on its APA claim that the termination was arbitrary and capricious, concluding the Department failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the termination and used a standardized letter without individual assessment of SEF's program. The court also found SEF would suffer irreparable harm, including loss of the sole funding source for EAC-South, potential loss of specialized staff, and damage to its reputation with school districts. The preliminary injunction ordered defendants to reinstate the grant within five business days, provide reimbursement for expenses incurred between the termination date and the court's order, and refrain from terminating the grant in the manner found likely unlawful.\n\nThe defendants filed a notice of appeal on July 18, 2025, which was docketed in the D.C. Circuit as case number 25-5262. The case references several related cases involving similar grant terminations under the Trump administration's executive orders, including California v. U.S. Dep't of Education and American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education v. McMahon.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on whether EAC-South's mission to help schools comply with federal desegregation orders constitutes impermissible \"DEI\" programming under the executive orders, or whether it represents legitimate enforcement of civil rights laws mandated by Brown v. Board of Education and Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",
    "46284": "This case was filed on March 24, 2025, in the Southern District of New York by a college student against President Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, and the Acting Field Office Director of the New York ICE Office, all sued in their official capacities. The case is represented by a mix of legal services attorneys from the CLEAR Project at CUNY School of Law, private counsel, and civil rights organizations including Human Rights First.\n\nThe case involves a 21-year-old lawful permanent resident and Columbia University junior who came to the United States from South Korea at age seven with her family and became a permanent resident in 2021. The student has maintained a 3.99 GPA and made the Dean's List every semester. Since 2023, she participated in student protests at Columbia University related to Palestinian rights and Israel's military campaign in Gaza, along with hundreds of other students. She was not a prominent organizer or spokesperson but was one of many participants.\n\nOn March 5, 2025, the student was arrested at a protest outside an academic building at Barnard College, where students were demonstrating against the university's disciplinary actions toward pro-Palestinian protesters. She received a desk appearance ticket for obstruction of governmental administration, a common protest-related charge. Within days, federal immigration enforcement began targeting her for deportation. An ICE administrative warrant was signed March 8, 2025, federal agents visited her parents' home March 9, 2025, and search warrants were executed at Columbia dormitories March 13, 2025.\n\nThe student's case is part of what the complaint describes as a broader government policy targeting noncitizen students for deportation based on their pro-Palestinian speech and protest activities. The government has used the \"Foreign Policy Ground\" provision of immigration law, which allows the Secretary of State to determine that a noncitizen's presence would have adverse foreign policy consequences. The complaint details similar enforcement actions against other Columbia students, including Mahmoud Khalil, whose arrest was publicly celebrated by President Trump and other officials as targeting \"Hamas supporters.\"\n\nThe student brought claims under the First Amendment (alleging retaliation, discrimination, and prior restraint), the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the non-delegation doctrine. She sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to prevent her detention, transfer, or deportation.\n\nJudge Naomi Reice Buchwald granted a temporary restraining order on March 25, 2025, enjoining the defendants from detaining or transferring the student pending further court order. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the court denied in part and granted in part on June 5, 2025. On the same date, Judge Buchwald granted the student's motion for a preliminary injunction, continuing the prohibition on detention or arrest and requiring 72 hours' advance notice if the government seeks to detain her on other grounds.\n\nThe defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal to the Second Circuit on July 3, 2025, challenging the preliminary injunction on jurisdictional grounds. The court noted in a July 17, 2025 endorsed letter that the appeal divests the district court of jurisdiction over aspects of the case involved in the appeal, precluding further discovery proceedings while the appeal is pending.",
    "46735": "On June 20, 2025, the Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools filed a verified complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico against Linda McMahon in her official capacity as Secretary of Education, the U.S. Department of Education, and Donald J. Trump in his official capacity as President. The case was assigned to District Judge William P. Johnson. The school district was represented by private counsel from Himes, Petrarca & Fester, Chtd.\n\nThe case arose from the Department of Education's termination of the school district's $6 million mental health grant, which was part of the $1 billion Bipartisan Safer Communities Act passed by Congress in 2022 following the Uvalde school shooting. The Act was designed to expand access to school-based behavioral health services and mental health supports. The school district had received this five-year grant and had been using the funds to hire mental health professionals, establish wellness rooms, and provide comprehensive mental health services to approximately 2,500 students.\n\nThe grant termination occurred after the Trump Administration issued several executive orders targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, including Executive Order No. 14151 (\"Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing\"), Executive Order No. 14173 (\"Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity\"), and Executive Order No. 14190 (\"Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling\"). On February 14, 2025, the Department issued a Dear Colleague Letter threatening schools with loss of federal funding if they continued pursuing ambiguously defined \"DEI programs.\"\n\nOn April 29, 2025, the Department terminated the school district's grant through a \"Notice of Non-Continuation of Grant Award,\" determining that the mental health programs violated federal civil rights law, conflicted with the Department's policy of prioritizing merit and excellence, undermined student well-being, or constituted inappropriate use of federal funds. The school district had received $3,605,500 through December 2025 and was entitled to an additional $2,394,500 through 2027.\n\nThe school district brought claims under the First Amendment (free speech and association violations), Fifth Amendment (due process and void for vagueness), the Spending Clause of the Constitution, allegations that defendants acted ultra vires, and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act. The school district sought declaratory relief that the termination was unlawful, injunctive relief to reinstate the grant funding, and reimbursement for expenditures incurred during the interim.\n\nThe school district filed a motion for temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction on June 23, 2025. The defendants filed their opposition on July 14, 2025, arguing primarily that the court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, which grants the Court of Federal Claims exclusive jurisdiction over contract claims against the United States seeking monetary relief exceeding $10,000.\n\nThe court held a preliminary injunction hearing on July 16, 2025, during which the school district presented witness testimony about the impact of losing the grant funding. The evidence showed that the grant had allowed the district to hire seven additional mental health professionals, establish wellness rooms used by 830 students (40% of total enrollment), reduce bullying reports by 30%, and decrease disruptive behavior incidents significantly.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, Judge Johnson denied the motion for preliminary injunction and dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. The court found that despite the school district's attempt to frame the case as constitutional and administrative law claims, the essence of the lawsuit was a contract dispute seeking payment of grant money from the federal government. Under the Tucker Act, such claims must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, not federal district court. The court relied heavily on the Supreme Court's recent decision in Department of Education v. California, which found that district courts lack jurisdiction to order payment of money under the APA when the core issue involves contract enforcement.\n\nThe court also analyzed the preliminary injunction factors, finding that the school district failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm. While acknowledging that continued funding would serve the public interest by providing mental health services and that the grant did not appear to promote DEI objectives, the court concluded that later monetary damages would adequately remedy any harm and that the jurisdictional bar prevented relief in district court.\n\nJudge Johnson noted that the school district could refile the case in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act to seek enforcement of the contract. The case highlighted the ongoing legal battles over the Trump Administration's efforts to eliminate DEI-related federal funding and raised important questions about the scope of federal court jurisdiction over government contract disputes framed as constitutional challenges.",
    "46342": "The Association for Education Finance and Policy and the Institute for Higher Education Policy filed this lawsuit on April 4, 2025, against Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and the U.S. Department of Education in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case was assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden. The organizations are represented by private counsel from the Public Citizen Litigation Group.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging that defendants violated the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. They sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to restore terminated education research programs.\n\nThe case arises from defendants' actions beginning in February 2025 to terminate numerous research programs and data collection activities conducted by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), a component of the Department of Education established by Congress in 2002. Starting February 10, 2025, defendants cancelled approximately 90 contracts that supported IES's statutory functions, including major longitudinal studies tracking student progress from kindergarten through college. Defendants also implemented a reduction-in-force eliminating approximately 90% of IES staff and terminated remote access programs for restricted-use education data.\n\nThe plaintiffs initially challenged these actions broadly as an effort to \"dismantle\" IES, but Judge McFadden denied their motion for preliminary injunction on June 3, 2025. In his memorandum opinion, the judge ruled that the plaintiffs' claims constituted an impermissible \"programmatic challenge\" under Supreme Court precedent in Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, which prohibits courts from reviewing wholesale agency operations rather than discrete agency actions.\n\nFollowing the preliminary injunction denial, plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on June 18, 2025, and then a second amended complaint on July 16, 2025, narrowing their claims to challenge six specific program terminations: the 2020/25 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 2022, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten 2024, IES's peer review program for grants, and the processing of applications for restricted-use data access. The Institute for Higher Education Policy also challenges unreasonable delays in processing its disclosure risk review requests for publishing research using restricted data.\n\nThe case involves a related case (No. 25-1266) with similar claims. Defendants' renewed motion to dismiss was due August 19, 2025, with briefing to continue through October 2025. The case remains in the motion practice phase with no trial scheduled.",
    "46322": "On March 31, 2025, three groups of plaintiffs filed consolidated lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump's Executive Order 14,248, \"Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,\" issued March 25, 2025. The nonpartisan plaintiffs included civil rights organizations like the League of United Latin American Citizens, League of Women Voters entities, NAACP, and student organizations. The Democratic Party plaintiffs included the Democratic National Committee, related campaign committees, and congressional leaders Charles Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries. The case was assigned to Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nThe Executive Order directed several federal agencies to take actions regarding voter registration and election administration. Section 2(a) ordered the Election Assistance Commission to require documentary proof of citizenship on the federal voter registration form within 30 days. Section 2(b) directed the Department of Homeland Security and State Department to share citizenship databases with states and the U.S. DOGE Service to identify unqualified voters. Section 2(d) instructed federal agencies serving as voter registration agencies to assess citizenship before providing registration forms to public assistance recipients. Section 7(a) directed the Attorney General to enforce federal Election Day statutes against states that count mail ballots received after Election Day. Section 7(b) ordered the EAC to withhold federal election funding from states that don't impose Election Day ballot receipt deadlines.\n\nPlaintiffs brought ultra vires challenges arguing the President lacks constitutional authority to regulate federal elections, which the Constitution reserves to states and Congress under the Elections Clause. They also raised claims under the National Voter Registration Act, Help America Vote Act, and Privacy Act. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, represented by various civil rights organizations, legal services groups, and political party counsel.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, both the nonpartisan and Democratic Party plaintiffs filed separate motions for preliminary injunctions. The Republican National Committee intervened as a defendant. After a hearing on April 17, 2025, Judge Kollar-Kotelly issued a preliminary injunction on April 24, 2025, granting relief in part.\n\nThe court enjoined implementation of Section 2(a), finding the President lacks authority to unilaterally direct the independent, bipartisan EAC to alter the federal voter registration form, which Congress assigned to the EAC through specific notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures under the NVRA and HAVA. The court also enjoined Section 2(d), ruling it violated the NVRA's mandatory requirement that voter registration agencies provide registration forms to all service applicants unless they decline in writing.\n\nHowever, the court denied preliminary relief on Sections 2(b), 7(a), and 7(b). For Section 2(b), the court found the challenge premature since the Executive Order contained saving clauses requiring compliance with applicable law, and agencies had not yet taken concrete action that would violate the Privacy Act. For Section 7(a), the court determined the Democratic Party plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge enforcement actions directed at states, not the plaintiffs themselves. For Section 7(b), the court found plaintiffs had not established the substantial likelihood of standing required for preliminary relief, as their claimed injuries from potential state responses to funding threats were too speculative.\n\nThe court's central reasoning rested on separation of powers principles. Under the Constitution's Elections Clause, states have initial authority to regulate federal elections, subject only to Congressional oversight—the President has no role. The Framers deliberately excluded presidential authority over elections, as evidenced in the Federalist Papers. Congress exercised its Elections Clause power through the NVRA and HAVA, creating specific procedures for the independent EAC to maintain election forms through bipartisan consensus and notice-and-comment rulemaking. The President cannot circumvent these congressional mandates through executive orders.\n\nThe court found plaintiffs had standing through organizational injury (interference with core voter registration activities) and associational standing on behalf of members whose voting rights would be burdened. The court noted irreparable harm given the upcoming Arizona special congressional election with a June 16, 2025 voter registration deadline, emphasizing that election-related injuries cannot be remedied after deadlines pass. The court applied the Purcell principle but found it supported rather than barred relief, since the injunction preserved the existing status quo against the Executive Order's changes.\n\nThe preliminary injunctions run against the EAC and its commissioners regarding Section 2(a), and against federal departments serving as voter registration agencies (Defense, Veterans Affairs, Interior, Small Business Administration) and their secretaries regarding Section 2(d). The court declined to require an injunction bond. The case remains pending on the merits, with summary judgment motions filed by August 2025.",
    "46510": "This case was filed on April 28, 2025, in the Western District of Washington before Judge Ricardo S. Martinez by six plaintiff organizations challenging federal defendants' actions to dismantle the Head Start program. The plaintiffs include four state Head Start associations (Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) and two parent advocacy organizations (Family Forward Oregon and Parent Voices Oakland). The defendants are HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Department of Health and Human Services, Acting Assistant Secretary Andrew Gradison, the Administration for Children and Families, the Office of Head Start, and Acting Director Tala Hooban, all sued in their official capacities. The plaintiffs are represented by the ACLU and other civil rights organizations.\n\nThe plaintiffs' claims arise under the Administrative Procedure Act, the First Amendment (free speech), Fifth Amendment (due process/void for vagueness), constitutional principles of Separation of Powers and the Spending Clause, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and ultra vires theories. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent what they characterize as the unlawful dismantling of the Head Start program.\n\nThe factual basis centers on two primary challenged actions by the Trump administration. First, defendants implemented sweeping bans on activities that \"promote\" or \"advance\" \"diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\" (DEIA) through a March 14, 2025 letter and an April 16, 2025 certification requirement incorporated into grant awards. These undefined prohibitions threaten funding termination, clawback of grants, and potential False Claims Act liability for non-compliance. Second, defendants conducted mass layoffs eliminating 60% of Office of Head Start staff and closing half of the regional offices on April 1, 2025, leaving 23 states without Head Start program support.\n\nPlaintiffs allege these actions create an impossible double-bind for Head Start agencies, which must either comply with the vague DEIA ban (risking violation of statutory obligations to serve diverse populations) or face loss of federal funding covering 80% of program costs. The complaint details how the Head Start Act specifically requires agencies to meet \"diverse needs\" of communities, provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services, serve children with disabilities inclusively, and recruit diverse staff—all potentially prohibited under the DEIA ban.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction on May 16, 2025, and a motion for temporary restraining order on July 21, 2025. After a hearing on August 5, 2025, the court issued an order on August 8, 2025, noting that defendants stipulated to certain relief making the TRO motion moot, but converted it to a preliminary injunction motion with a hearing scheduled for September 9, 2025. The case includes extensive declarations from Head Start administrators and parents documenting operational disruptions, program closures, and harms to families served by Head Start programs.\n\nThe court granted plaintiffs' motion to file declarations under pseudonym on June 16, 2025, and motion to amend the complaint on August 19, 2025, with a second amended complaint filed the same day. The docket reflects significant procedural activity including multiple pro hac vice applications for out-of-state counsel and ongoing motion practice as the case proceeds toward the preliminary injunction hearing.",
    "46734": "This case was filed on May 29, 2025, by Roman Catholic bishops and priests from the three dioceses covering Washington State against Governor Robert W. Ferguson, Attorney General Nicholas W. Brown, and all county prosecuting attorneys. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from multiple law firms including Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, and First Liberty Institute. Judge David G. Estudillo is presiding.\n\nThe dispute centers on Washington Senate Bill 5375, signed into law on May 2, 2025, and effective July 27, 2025, which adds clergy to the state's list of mandatory reporters of child abuse and neglect. The law requires clergy to report suspected abuse or neglect with no exception for information learned during the Catholic Sacrament of Confession, also known as the sacramental seal. Under Catholic Church doctrine, priests are absolutely forbidden from disclosing anything learned in confession, and any priest who violates the sacramental seal faces automatic excommunication and risks eternal damnation according to church teaching.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the First Amendment's Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, as well as Article I, Section 11 of the Washington Constitution. They seek declaratory relief that the law is unconstitutional and both preliminary and permanent injunctions preventing its enforcement as applied to confessional communications.\n\nThe factual context reveals that the Catholic dioceses in Washington already have self-imposed reporting policies that go beyond current state law requirements, mandating that church personnel report suspected child abuse or neglect to authorities, with the sole exception being information learned through confession. The dioceses have supported state legislation requiring clergy reporting, provided the sacramental seal remains protected.\n\nSignificantly, just three days before signing SB 5375, Governor Ferguson signed Substitute House Bill 1171, which exempted attorneys employed by institutions of higher education from reporting requirements when the information relates to client representation, effectively expanding privileges for secular professionals while eliminating them for clergy.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction. The United States moved to intervene on June 23, 2025, arguing that the law violates equal protection by discriminating based on religion, and the court granted intervention on July 15, 2025. After a hearing on July 14, 2025, the court granted the preliminary injunction on July 18, 2025.\n\nThe court found that SB 5375 is neither neutral nor generally applicable because it treats religious exercise less favorably than comparable secular activities, particularly given the simultaneous expansion of attorney-client privilege protections in higher education. The court concluded that the law fails strict scrutiny because Washington could achieve its compelling interest in protecting children through less restrictive means that do not burden religious exercise, especially considering the dioceses' existing voluntary reporting policies for non-confessional information.\n\nThe preliminary injunction enjoins enforcement of SB 5375 as to the Sacrament of Confession against the plaintiffs and all Roman Catholic priests in Washington who fall under the administration of the three diocesan bishops. Most county prosecuting attorneys agreed to be bound by the injunction and to stay proceedings against them pending final resolution. The case remains pending on the merits against the Governor and Attorney General.",
    "46678": "The State of California and Governor Gavin Newsom filed this lawsuit on June 9, 2025, challenging President Donald Trump's federalization of 4,000 California National Guard members in response to protests in Los Angeles. The case was assigned to Judge Charles R. Breyer in the Northern District of California and is represented by the California Attorney General's office.\n\nThe underlying dispute began on June 6, 2025, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted enforcement operations throughout Los Angeles. Protests erupted in response, with some protesters engaging in violence, throwing objects at federal officers, damaging federal property, and attacking federal buildings. On June 7, 2025, President Trump issued a memorandum invoking 10 U.S.C. § 12406 to federalize National Guard units \"to temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions\" and \"to protect Federal property.\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth subsequently issued orders on June 7 and June 9 federalizing 2,000 California National Guard members each time, totaling 4,000 troops for 60 days. An additional 700 active-duty Marines were deployed from Camp Pendleton.\n\nPlaintiffs brought three claims: (1) that defendants acted ultra vires by exceeding their statutory authority under § 12406, failing to follow proper procedures, and violating the Posse Comitatus Act; (2) that defendants violated the Tenth Amendment by unlawfully commandeering state militia; and (3) that the Secretary of Defense and DOD violated the Administrative Procedure Act. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to return control of the National Guard to the Governor.\n\nOn June 10, 2025, plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on June 12, Judge Breyer granted the TRO, concluding that defendants' actions \"were illegal—both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment.\" The court found that none of the three statutory conditions for invoking § 12406 were satisfied (foreign invasion, rebellion, or presidential inability to execute laws with regular forces) and that the federalization order was not properly issued \"through the governor\" as required by statute. The TRO enjoined defendants from deploying California National Guard members and directed them to return control to Governor Newsom.\n\nDefendants immediately appealed and sought an emergency stay. The Ninth Circuit granted a temporary administrative stay and, after oral argument on June 17, 2025, issued a stay pending appeal on June 19. The appellate court found defendants likely to succeed on the merits, concluding that under highly deferential review established by Martin v. Mott (1827), the President likely had authority under § 12406(3) based on evidence of protesters interfering with federal law enforcement. The court also found the procedural requirement likely satisfied since California's Adjutant General, authorized to issue orders in the Governor's name, received and acted on the federal directive.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction. The case proceeded to a three-day bench trial on August 11-13, 2025, to resolve the preliminary injunction motion. The court consolidated the preliminary injunction proceeding with a trial on the merits under Federal Rule 65(a)(2). Multiple amicus briefs were filed by various states, military officials, and legal organizations. The case remains pending final resolution following the trial.",
    "46287": "On March 25, 2025, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and American Federation of Teachers (AFT), both labor unions representing faculty and academic professionals, filed suit in the Southern District of New York against multiple federal executive agencies and officials, seeking to restore approximately $400 million in terminated federal grants and contracts to Columbia University. Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil presided over the case.\n\nThe case arose from escalating tensions at Columbia University following the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, which led to widespread campus protests and reports of antisemitic incidents. According to Columbia's own task force reports, Jewish students faced harassment, threats, and physical assaults, particularly during the spring 2024 occupation of Hamilton Hall and establishment of protest encampments that Columbia allowed to remain for months. On January 29, 2025, shortly after taking office, President Trump issued an Executive Order directing agencies to combat antisemitism using \"all available appropriate legal tools.\"\n\nOn February 3, 2025, the Department of Justice announced formation of a multi-agency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism led by Leo Terrell, and the Department of Education announced Title VI investigations into Columbia and four other universities. After warning Columbia on March 3, 2025 that the government was reviewing its federal funding relationships, the agencies announced on March 7, 2025 the \"immediate cancellation of approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University due to the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\"\n\nOn March 13, 2025, the agencies sent Columbia a letter listing nine demands as \"preconditions for formal negotiations regarding Columbia University's continued financial relationship with the United States government,\" including enforcing disciplinary policies with \"expulsion or multi-year suspension,\" abolishing Columbia's University Judicial Board, implementing mask bans, placing the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies (MESAAS) department under \"academic receivership for a minimum of five years,\" and reforming admissions practices. Columbia responded on March 21, 2025 by announcing eighteen actions, many of which aligned with but differed from the government's demands. Notably, evidence showed Columbia had been planning these reforms for months before receiving any government demands.\n\nThe defendants maintained they terminated funding not under Title VI procedures, but because the grants and contracts \"no longer effectuate[d] . . . agency priorities\" and \"for the convenience of the Government\" under standard grant termination provisions in 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) and Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses. The National Institutes of Health terminated over 400 grants totaling more than $250 million, while the Departments of Education and Health & Human Services terminated additional grants and contracts.\n\nPlaintiffs' complaint asserted ten claims under the First Amendment (free speech and academic freedom violations), Administrative Procedure Act (procedural and substantive violations), separation of powers/ultra vires theories, Fifth Amendment Due Process, Tenth Amendment/Spending Clause, and the \"unconstitutional conditions\" doctrine. They argued defendants violated Title VI's procedural requirements for funding termination and unconstitutionally coerced Columbia to suppress speech and academic freedom.\n\nPlaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction on April 3, 2025, seeking immediate restoration of the terminated funding and an injunction against future funding terminations without proper Title VI procedures. Five amicus briefs were filed supporting plaintiffs. Defendants opposed the motion, arguing plaintiffs lacked standing and that their actions were legally authorized discretionary funding decisions.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Vyskocil denied the preliminary injunction motion and dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of standing. The court found plaintiffs could not demonstrate Article III standing because: (1) neither plaintiffs nor their members were parties to the grants and contracts, which were awarded to Columbia University; (2) any alleged speech chilling by plaintiffs' members was speculative and not fairly traceable to defendants' actions, since Columbia had independently planned its reforms months before any government demands; (3) plaintiffs could not establish organizational standing by spending money to oppose defendants' actions; and (4) Columbia had provided salary coverage to affected personnel, mitigating any economic harm.\n\nThe court was notably critical of plaintiffs' legal theories, observing that Title VI covers only race, color, and national origin—not religion—making it unlikely to be the exclusive vehicle for combating antisemitism. The court also referenced the Supreme Court's recent decision in Department of Education v. California, which suggested that grant termination claims sound in contract and belong in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act rather than in district court under the APA.\n\nPlaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit on June 16, 2025. The related case Khalil v. Trustees of Columbia University, where Columbia students sought similar relief, was also denied for lack of standing. Notably, Columbia University itself was not a party to this litigation, appearing only in a limited capacity to oppose disclosure of internal communications, and stating it was \"actively engaged in negotiations with Defendants about the terminated awards.\"",
    "46580": "On May 7, 2025, sixteen states and the District of Columbia filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against the U.S. Department of Transportation, Secretary Sean Duffy, the Federal Highway Administration, and Acting Administrator Gloria M. Shepherd, represented by their respective state attorneys general. The case is assigned to Judge Tana Lin.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges defendants' suspension of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, a $5 billion initiative established by Congress in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to fund electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the country. Under the statute, funds must be distributed to states according to a mandatory formula, with states required to submit deployment plans describing how they will use the funds for EV charging infrastructure.\n\nThe dispute arose from President Trump's January 20, 2025 \"Unleashing American Energy\" executive order directing all federal agencies to \"immediately pause the disbursement of funds\" from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, including NEVI Formula Program funds. On February 6, 2025, FHWA sent states a letter rescinding all NEVI Formula Program guidance, revoking all previously approved state deployment plans, and prohibiting new fund obligations until updated guidance could be issued. This action effectively froze approximately $2.74 billion in available funds.\n\nPlaintiffs brought six causes of action: three Administrative Procedure Act violations (excess of statutory authority, arbitrary and capricious agency action, and failure to follow required procedures), violation of the separation of powers doctrine, violation of the Take Care Clause, and common law ultra vires. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore the program and prevent unlawful withholding of congressionally appropriated funds.\n\nThe states argued that defendants lacked authority under the IIJA to categorically suspend the program, and that the statute provides only limited circumstances under which funds may be withheld, requiring specific procedural safeguards that were not followed. They alleged immediate harm from disrupted infrastructure projects, cancelled solicitations, lost partnerships, and administrative burdens.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, the court held oral argument on plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. Seven public interest organizations, including Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council, successfully moved to intervene as party plaintiffs, with the court granting their intervention motion on July 23, 2025.\n\nOn June 24, 2025, Judge Tana Lin issued an order granting the preliminary injunction in part and denying it in part. The court found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their APA and constitutional claims, concluding that defendants had exceeded their statutory authority and violated the separation of powers doctrine. The injunction was granted for fourteen plaintiff states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin) but denied for the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont due to insufficient evidence of irreparable harm.\n\nThe preliminary injunction, effective July 2, 2025, enjoins defendants from suspending or revoking previously-approved state deployment plans and from withholding NEVI Formula Program funds except as permitted by the IIJA's specific procedures. The injunction restores the affected states' deployment plans to their legal status prior to the February 6, 2025 FHWA letter and requires defendants to process authorization requests for specific EV charging infrastructure projects. The court waived any bond requirement and the preliminary injunction remains in effect pending further court orders.\n\nThe case involves ongoing discovery and dispositive motion practice, with cross-motions for summary judgment scheduled for briefing through October 2025.",
    "46259": "This case was filed on March 13, 2025, in the Southern District of New York before Judge Arun Subramanian. Eight students at Columbia University and Barnard College, proceeding under pseudonyms, sued Columbia University and its trustees, the House Committee on Education and Workforce and its Chairman Tim Walberg, and various federal agency officials involved in a Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from multiple organizations including Dratel & Lewis and CAIR Legal Defense Fund.\n\nThe case arises from a congressional investigation into antisemitism on college campuses that began in 2024. The House Committee on Education and Workforce, led first by Chairwoman Foxx and then Chairman Walberg, conducted hearings and sent multiple letters to Columbia University requesting documents and student disciplinary records related to pro-Palestinian demonstrations and protests on campus. On February 13, 2025, the Committee sent a letter requesting disciplinary records relating to eleven specific incidents involving student activism, which the plaintiffs claim would encompass records of hundreds of students.\n\nSimultaneously, federal agencies including the Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services, and General Services Administration threatened Columbia with loss of federal funding. On March 7, 2025, the Trump administration announced it had canceled approximately $400 million in federal grants to Columbia. On March 13, 2025, these agencies sent Columbia a letter demanding compliance with specific policy changes as a \"precondition for formal negotiations regarding Columbia University's continued financial relationship with the United States government.\" The demands included harsh disciplinary measures against students involved in protests, elimination of the University Judicial Board, a campus mask ban, increased law enforcement presence, placing the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies department under \"academic receivership,\" and adoption of a specific definition of antisemitism.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege this constitutes illegal \"jawboning\" - government officials using threats and coercion against a private intermediary (Columbia) to suppress speech and association rights the government cannot directly restrict. They claim violations of the First Amendment's Free Speech and Association Clauses, breach of contract based on Columbia's promises of academic freedom, and violations of Title VI procedures and the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment, permanent injunctive relief preventing further record disclosures and compliance with federal demands, and monetary damages for records already produced.\n\nOn March 19, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which the Court denied without prejudice on April 4, 2025. The Court noted that the Speech or Debate Clause bars relief against the Congressional defendants, but granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint. The Court also ordered that Columbia must provide thirty days' notice before furnishing any student records or identifying information to Congress.\n\nDefendants filed motions to dismiss on May 23, 2025, arguing various jurisdictional and substantive defenses including Speech or Debate Clause immunity, sovereign immunity, lack of standing, and failure to state a claim. The case involves complex questions about the limits of congressional investigative power, federal funding conditions, and the extent to which government pressure on private institutions can violate constitutional rights. Briefing on the motions to dismiss and a renewed motion for preliminary injunction is ongoing.",
    "46557": "On May 5, 2025, nineteen states and the District of Columbia filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and various HHS agencies, challenging the agency's planned mass workforce reduction and reorganization. The case was assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose, with state attorneys general representing the plaintiffs.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from HHS's March 27, 2025 announcement titled \"HHS Announces Transformation to Make America Healthy Again\" (the \"March 27 Communiqué\"), which outlined plans to terminate 10,000 full-time employees, consolidate 28 divisions into 15, close half of the agency's regional offices, and create a new \"Administration for a Healthy America.\" On April 1, 2025, HHS sent termination notices to 10,000 employees, placing them on administrative leave with formal terminations scheduled for June 2, 2025. Secretary Kennedy publicly acknowledged that approximately 20% of the layoffs would likely be \"mistakes\" but stated that conducting a careful line-by-line review would \"take too long\" and result in lost \"political momentum.\"\n\nThe plaintiff states brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging the March 27 Communiqué was both arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. They also raised constitutional claims for violations of the Separation of Powers doctrine and the Appropriations Clause, arguing that the executive branch lacked authority to effectively dismantle congressionally-created agencies and programs. The states sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the implementation of the reorganization plan.\n\nOn May 9, 2025, the states filed a motion for preliminary injunction targeting specific agencies: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, the Office of Head Start, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. The states argued they would suffer irreparable harm through loss of critical public health services, laboratory testing capabilities, maternal health data collection, occupational safety programs, tobacco prevention efforts, and federal poverty guideline calculations that their programs and millions of residents depend upon.\n\nFollowing a hearing on May 20, 2025, Judge DuBose granted the preliminary injunction on July 1, 2025. The court found that the states had demonstrated a likelihood of success on their APA claims, concluding that the March 27 Communiqué constituted final agency action that was both arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. The court determined that HHS failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its actions and that the reorganization would prevent the agency from fulfilling numerous congressional mandates. The court also found the states faced irreparable harm from the disruption of critical public health functions and that the balance of equities favored granting relief. The court imposed a nominal bond of $100 and denied defendants' request for a stay pending appeal.\n\nOn August 12, 2025, defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit Court of Appeals. The case involves ongoing disputes over the scope of the preliminary injunction, with the court issuing clarifications on August 12, 2025, specifying that the injunction applies to particular HHS components including CDC divisions, the Center for Tobacco Products, Head Start offices, and the division responsible for federal poverty guidelines.",
    "46511": "Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia filed suit on April 29, 2025, against the Corporation for National and Community Service (operating as AmeriCorps) and its Interim Agency Head Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, represented by their respective state attorneys general. The case was assigned to Judge Deborah L. Boardman in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges the Trump Administration's dismantling of AmeriCorps, the federal agency for national service and volunteerism that has operated since 1993. AmeriCorps supports over 200,000 members and volunteers annually through programs like AmeriCorps State and National, the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC), and Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA). These programs provide disaster relief, education support, veterans services, conservation work, and public health assistance across all states.\n\nBeginning in April 2025, the Administration made sweeping cuts to AmeriCorps. On April 15, AmeriCorps placed all NCCC members—over 750 volunteers engaged in disaster relief and community service—on administrative leave pending termination by April 30. The next day, AmeriCorps placed 85% of its approximately 720-person staff on administrative leave, reducing the workforce to just 116 employees. On April 24, AmeriCorps began issuing reduction in force notices. On April 25, AmeriCorps terminated over 1,000 grants representing nearly $400 million in funding (about half of AmeriCorps' budget), forcing the immediate closure of programs and exit of roughly 32,465 AmeriCorps members, VISTA members, and volunteers nationwide.\n\nThe states brought five claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and constitutional law. They alleged AmeriCorps violated the APA by acting contrary to law, without observing required procedures, and arbitrarily and capriciously. They also raised a constitutional separation of powers claim and an ultra vires claim. The central legal issue was AmeriCorps' failure to comply with a statutory requirement in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, § 401, mandating that AmeriCorps \"make any significant changes to program requirements, service delivery or policy only through public notice and comment rulemaking.\"\n\nThe states moved for a preliminary injunction on May 6, 2025. After expedited briefing, a hearing on May 19, 2025, and supplemental briefing, Judge Boardman issued a memorandum opinion and preliminary injunction order on June 5, 2025. The court found the states likely to succeed on their claim that AmeriCorps violated the notice-and-comment requirement, suffered irreparable harm from program closures and loss of services, and that the balance of equities favored relief.\n\nThe preliminary injunction was granted in part and denied in part. The court ordered defendants to restore terminated AmeriCorps programs in the plaintiff states by reinstating grants and returning willing AmeriCorps and VISTA members to service. It also required restoration of NCCC members to service and compliance with notice-and-comment requirements before making significant changes to service delivery. However, the court denied relief regarding AmeriCorps staffing reductions, finding the states lacked standing to challenge those actions. The court set a nominal bond of $100 per plaintiff ($2,500 total).\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's June 27, 2025 decision in Trump v. CASA limiting universal injunctions, defendants moved to modify the preliminary injunction. The court granted the consensual modification on July 10, 2025, narrowing the notice-and-comment requirement to apply only to actions that harm the plaintiff states, rather than all AmeriCorps actions nationwide.\n\nThe states filed an amended complaint on July 24, 2025, and a second motion for preliminary injunction on August 7, 2025. The case remains active with ongoing proceedings addressing compliance with the preliminary injunction and additional relief sought by the plaintiff states.",

The case was assigned to Judge Richard J. Leon.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from President Trump's March 14, 2025 Executive Order 14238, titled \"Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,\" which declared IMLS \"unnecessary\" and directed that it \"shall be eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.\" The order required IMLS to \"reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law.\"\n\nFollowing the Executive Order, Defendants moved swiftly to dismantle IMLS. On March 20, 2025, Trump installed Keith Sonderling, the Deputy Secretary of Labor, as Acting Director of IMLS, though plaintiffs alleged he lacked the statutory qualifications requiring special competence in library or museum services. By March 31, 2025, virtually all of IMLS's approximately 75 employees were placed on indefinite administrative leave and denied access to agency offices and computer systems. On April 3, 2025, Sonderling terminated all but approximately 12 IMLS staff members and fired all 23 members of the congressionally-mandated National Museum and Library Services Board. Defendants also began canceling IMLS grants, including grants to states that are statutorily required under the Museum and Library Services Act.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged these actions violated the constitutional separation of powers doctrine and the Take Care Clause, arguing that only Congress has authority to eliminate a statutorily-created agency. They also brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging the dismantling was arbitrary and capricious and exceeded statutory authority, as well as claims under the Impoundment Control Act and Paperwork Reduction Act. Additionally, they asserted ultra vires and First Amendment claims.\n\nPlaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring defendants to restore IMLS operations, reinstate terminated employees and Board members, and restore funding to terminated grants. They moved for a preliminary injunction, which was converted to a motion for a temporary restraining order during the April 30, 2025 hearing.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, Judge Leon issued a temporary restraining order providing narrow injunctive relief that preserved the status quo as of May 1, 2025. The TRO was extended until May 29, 2025. However, after full briefing, Judge Leon denied the motion for a preliminary injunction on June 6, 2025, finding that plaintiffs had not established a likelihood of success on the merits, primarily due to jurisdictional concerns under the Tucker Act.\n\nIn his June 6, 2025 Memorandum Opinion, Judge Leon found that plaintiffs' claims were likely contractual in nature because they centered on grant terminations, and such claims belong exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act rather than in district court. The court cited recent Supreme Court precedent in Department of Education v. California and D.C. Circuit precedent in the USAGM cases, particularly Widakuswara v. Lake, which found similar challenges to agency personnel actions and grant terminations were not properly before district courts.\n\nThe court also denied defendants' motion for reconsideration as moot. A case management schedule has been set for summary judgment briefing, with defendants required to produce an administrative record by July 15, 2025, plaintiffs' summary judgment motion due September 5, 2025, and defendants' combined opposition and cross-motion due October 3, 2025. The case remains pending before Judge Leon with no trial scheduled.",
    "46746": "On June 27, 2025, environmental organizations Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and Center for Biological Diversity filed suit in the Southern District of Florida against federal and state officials challenging the construction of a mass immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades. The defendants include Kristi Noem (Secretary of Homeland Security), Todd Lyons (Acting Director of ICE), Kevin Guthrie (Executive Director of Florida Division of Emergency Management), and Miami-Dade County. The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida later intervened as plaintiffs on July 30, 2025. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Earthjustice, Coffey Burlington P.L., and the Center for Biological Diversity, while defendants are represented by government attorneys and private counsel.\n\nThe case arose after Florida's Division of Emergency Management took control of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (TNT) on June 23, 2025, pursuant to a state emergency declaration regarding illegal immigration. The state rapidly constructed a detention facility dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" capable of housing up to 5,000 immigration detainees. The facility is located within the Big Cypress National Preserve and Big Cypress Area, an environmentally sensitive region that serves as habitat for endangered and threatened species including the Florida panther, Florida bonneted bat, and wood stork. The facility operates under section 287(g) agreements between ICE and Florida law enforcement agencies, which allow state officers to perform federal immigration functions under federal supervision.\n\nPlaintiffs brought claims under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging that defendants violated NEPA by constructing and operating the facility without preparing an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. They also raised state law claims challenging the Florida Division of Emergency Management's authority to operate the facility and Miami-Dade County's acquiescence in the project. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment that defendants' actions violated NEPA and injunctive relief to halt construction and operation until NEPA compliance.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Jose E. Martinez, who recused on July 16, 2025, and it was reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams. After defendants challenged venue in the Southern District of Florida, arguing the facility is located in the Middle District, the court held a hearing on venue issues on July 30, 2025, ultimately finding venue proper in the Southern District.\n\nThe court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction motion over four days: August 6, 7, 12, and 13, 2025. During this hearing, plaintiffs presented testimony from ten witnesses, including environmental experts, organizational representatives, and members who use the Everglades area for recreation. The testimony focused on potential environmental harms from the facility, including impacts to endangered species habitat, water quality, and the broader Everglades ecosystem. Defendants presented one witness, the Executive Director of Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, who testified about the facility's operations under 287(g) agreements.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, midway through the evidentiary hearing, the court granted plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order, prohibiting defendants from installing additional lighting, paving, filling, excavating, fencing, or expanding the site for fourteen days. On August 21, 2025, Judge Williams issued an omnibus order granting the preliminary injunction in part and denying it in part. The court found that venue was proper in the Southern District, rejected defendants' arguments that immigration statutes stripped the court of jurisdiction, determined that NEPA applied to the project as a major federal action, and concluded that plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm.\n\nThe preliminary injunction ordered defendants to immediately cease transporting new detainees to the facility, immediately cease new construction, and remove all new lighting, fencing, generators, and waste receptacles within sixty days—effectively requiring closure of the facility. The court required plaintiffs to post only a $100 bond. Both state and federal defendants have filed appeals and motions to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal, arguing that the court lacked venue, that NEPA does not apply to state-built facilities, and that the balance of harms favors allowing continued operation of the detention facility.",
    "46388": "This case was filed on April 11, 2025, by three organizations—the American Association of University Professors–Harvard Faculty Chapter, the American Association of University Professors, and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America—against multiple federal agencies and officials. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from Selendy Gay PLLC and Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC, and the case is assigned to Judge Allison D. Burroughs.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges the Trump administration's systematic campaign to coerce Harvard University into implementing sweeping changes to its operations by threatening and ultimately terminating billions in federal funding. Beginning in early 2025, the administration launched what it characterized as civil rights enforcement under Title VI, but plaintiffs allege was actually an effort to suppress academic freedom and punish disfavored viewpoints on campus.\n\nThe dispute escalated rapidly in spring 2025. On March 31, defendants announced a \"comprehensive review\" of Harvard's federal funding, encompassing $255.6 million in current grants and $8.7 billion in multi-year commitments, based on alleged failures to address antisemitism. On April 3, defendants sent Harvard a letter containing nine demands as preconditions for continued funding, including shuttering all diversity, equity, and inclusion programs; implementing merit-based admissions and hiring policies; enacting a comprehensive mask ban; and overhauling student discipline procedures. An even more extreme letter followed on April 11, demanding governance reforms, mandatory viewpoint diversity audits, faculty reviews for plagiarism, and cooperation with federal authorities on immigration matters.\n\nWhen Harvard rejected these demands on April 14, 2025, defendants immediately announced a freeze of $2.2 billion in federal funding. On May 5, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon declared Harvard categorically ineligible for future federal grants. Between May 6-12, individual agencies sent termination letters ending Harvard's grants, ultimately canceling roughly $2.7 billion in federal funding across multiple agencies including NIH, NSF, DOD, DOE, and others.\n\nPlaintiffs assert two primary legal theories. First, they claim defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to follow the mandatory procedures established by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for investigating and terminating federal funding based on civil rights violations. These procedures require specific findings, opportunities for voluntary compliance, hearings, and congressional notification—none of which occurred here. Second, they argue defendants violated the First Amendment through unconstitutional coercion and viewpoint discrimination, using federal funding as leverage to force Harvard to suppress certain academic viewpoints and reshape the university according to the administration's political preferences.\n\nThe case demonstrates the severe practical impact on research and academic work. Many faculty members and graduate students represented by the plaintiff organizations have lost their federal funding, forcing them to halt research projects, lay off staff, and abandon ongoing studies. The funding cuts particularly affected Harvard's School of Public Health, where 60% of the operating budget comes from federal grants.\n\nPlaintiffs filed their motion for summary judgment on June 2, 2025, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to declare defendants' actions unlawful and restore the terminated funding. Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on June 16, 2025. Oral argument is scheduled for July 21, 2025. The court has established an expedited briefing schedule given the ongoing harm to research activities and the academic calendar. This case represents a significant test of the limits of federal power over university operations and the intersection of civil rights enforcement with academic freedom protections.",
    "46625": "On May 21, 2025, five non-profit organizations filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the Department of Justice's abrupt termination of their federal grants. The plaintiffs—Vera Institute of Justice, Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Affirmative Action (d/b/a Stop AAPI Hate), FORCE Detroit, and Health Resources in Action—sought to represent a class of all entities whose grants the DOJ terminated in April 2025, totaling over 370 awards worth more than $820 million.\n\nIn April 2025, DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) sent identical termination notices to hundreds of grantees, stating that their awards \"no longer effectuate[] the program goals or agency priorities\" under federal regulation 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). The notices explained that the Department had \"changed its priorities\" to focus on \"more directly supporting certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.\" No individualized explanations were provided, and grantees were instructed to stop work immediately.\n\nThe terminated grants funded various public safety programs including violence intervention, victims' services, juvenile justice, substance abuse treatment, and law enforcement training. The five plaintiff organizations operated programs that appeared to align with DOJ's stated new priorities: Vera provided sign language interpretation for deaf crime victims and trained law enforcement on human trafficking; CCYJ ran gang and violence prevention programs for youth; Stop AAPI Hate worked to prevent hate crimes against Asian Americans; FORCE Detroit conducted community violence intervention in Detroit; and Health Resources in Action supported hospital-based violence intervention programs.\n\nThe terminations caused immediate harm to the organizations and the communities they served. Staff were laid off, critical programs ended, contracts with partners were cancelled, and vulnerable populations lost access to services. The plaintiffs argued this made communities less safe, particularly during high-violence periods like the July 4th weekend when violence interrupters would typically be active in their communities.\n\nPlaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act alleging the terminations were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, as well as constitutional claims under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, separation of powers principles, and the Spending and Appropriations Clauses. They also asserted an equitable ultra vires claim against individual defendants. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to set aside the terminations and restore their funding, and moved for both preliminary injunctive relief and class certification.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Amit P. Mehta. The government moved to dismiss, arguing primarily that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the claims were essentially contractual in nature and belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. During a June 26, 2025 hearing, Judge Mehta expressed skepticism about the government's inability to explain why specific grants were terminated, noting the apparent contradiction between the stated new priorities and the actual work the terminated organizations were performing.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, Judge Mehta denied the preliminary injunction and granted the motion to dismiss. While the court criticized the terminations as \"unquestionably arbitrary\" and \"shameful,\" it concluded it lacked jurisdiction to hear the APA claims, finding them essentially contractual in nature following the Supreme Court's recent decision in Department of Education v. California. The court also found the constitutional claims failed on the merits, ruling that plaintiffs lacked a protected property interest in continued grant funding and that their other constitutional theories were without merit. The motion for class certification was denied as moot.\n\nPlaintiffs filed an emergency motion for injunction pending appeal, which Judge Mehta denied on July 21, 2025, finding that while the threatened harm was meaningful, it was not sufficiently \"grave\" to warrant the extraordinary remedy of an affirmative injunction pending appeal, and that plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on their jurisdictional arguments. The case is expected to be appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "46387": "On April 11, 2025, the law firm Susman Godfrey LLP filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging Executive Order 14,263, titled \"Addressing Risks from Susman Godfrey,\" which President Trump had issued two days earlier. The case was assigned to Judge Loren L. AliKhan. Susman Godfrey, represented by private counsel from Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP, sued numerous federal agencies and officials in their official capacities, seeking declaratory and permanent injunctive relief.\n\nThe Executive Order was part of a broader campaign by President Trump targeting law firms that had represented clients or causes he opposed. The order specifically targeted Susman Godfrey based on the firm's representation of Dominion Voting Systems and state election officials in litigation defending the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, as well as the firm's diversity initiatives and donations to LGBTQ advocacy organizations. Section 1 of the order accused Susman Godfrey of \"spearhead[ing] efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections\" and engaging in activities \"detrimental to critical American interests.\"\n\nThe order imposed several punitive measures: Section 2 directed immediate suspension of security clearances held by Susman employees; Section 3 required government contractors to disclose business relationships with Susman and directed agencies to terminate contracts involving the firm; Section 4 referenced investigations into the firm's employment practices; and Section 5 restricted Susman employees' access to federal buildings and limited federal employees from engaging with the firm.\n\nSusman Godfrey brought ten constitutional claims, alleging violations of the First Amendment (retaliation for protected speech, viewpoint discrimination, interference with petition rights, and restrictions on freedom of association), the Fifth Amendment (due process violations, vagueness, equal protection violations, and interference with clients' right to counsel), and separation of powers principles.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, Susman moved for a temporary restraining order. Following a hearing on April 15, 2025, Judge AliKhan granted the TRO, temporarily enjoining enforcement of Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the Executive Order. The court found that the order violated the First and Fifth Amendments and would cause irreparable harm to the firm. By agreement of the parties, the TRO was extended until final judgment and the case proceeded on an expedited summary judgment schedule.\n\nThe case drew significant attention, with twenty-one amicus briefs filed supporting Susman Godfrey from various legal organizations, law professors, former judges, bar associations, and civil rights groups. Similar executive orders targeting other law firms (Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and WilmerHale) were challenged in parallel cases in the same district, with each court finding constitutional violations and issuing permanent injunctions.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, Susman moved for summary judgment while defendants moved to dismiss. Following a hearing on May 8, 2025, Judge AliKhan issued a comprehensive memorandum opinion on June 27, 2025, granting summary judgment in favor of Susman Godfrey on nine of its ten constitutional claims. The court found that the Executive Order was issued in retaliation for Susman's protected First Amendment activities, constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination, violated due process by depriving the firm of protected interests without notice or hearing, and exceeded presidential authority in violation of separation of powers principles.\n\nThe court permanently enjoined all defendants from implementing or enforcing Executive Order 14,263 in any way, declared the order unconstitutional and null and void, and directed the Department of Justice to notify all affected agencies and personnel of the court's ruling. The final order represented a complete victory for Susman Godfrey and established important precedent protecting law firms from executive retaliation based on their client representations and advocacy activities.",
    "46245": "On March 18, 2025, the United States Institute of Peace and several of its board members filed suit in the D.C. District Court against President Trump, various Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) officials, and other defendants, challenging the President's removal of USIP board members and subsequent actions to dismantle the organization. The case was assigned to Judge Beryl A. Howell and sought declaratory and injunctive relief based on violations of the United States Institute of Peace Act.\n\nUSIP is an independent nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1984 to promote international peace through research, education, and conflict resolution activities. The organization is governed by a fifteen-member board consisting of three ex officio members (the Secretaries of State and Defense and the National Defense University President) and twelve members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The USIP Act contains specific statutory restrictions on the President's ability to remove the twelve appointed board members, requiring removal only for cause, upon recommendation of eight board members, or upon recommendation of certain congressional committees.\n\nThe dispute began when President Trump issued Executive Order 14217 on February 19, 2025, declaring USIP \"unnecessary\" and directing that its functions be reduced to statutory minimums. On March 14, 2025, the White House Presidential Personnel Office sent emails terminating all appointed board members without citing any of the statutory grounds for removal. The three remaining ex officio board members then removed USIP's Acting President Ambassador George Moose and appointed Kenneth Jackson, later replaced by DOGE representative Nate Cavanaugh, as acting president.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, DOGE personnel forcibly took control of USIP's headquarters building with assistance from law enforcement officers from multiple agencies. Over the following weeks, the new leadership fired nearly all of USIP's employees, transferred the organization's headquarters building to the General Services Administration without compensation, and moved funds from USIP's private bank accounts to the Treasury, effectively shuttering most operations.\n\nPlaintiffs initially sought a temporary restraining order, which Judge Howell denied on March 19, 2025, finding insufficient likelihood of success on the merits given the novel questions about USIP's governmental status and the scope of presidential removal authority. The court established an expedited summary judgment schedule, and plaintiffs also filed an unsuccessful All Writs Act motion on March 31 seeking to prevent further property transfers.\n\nAfter full briefing and oral argument, Judge Howell granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on May 19, 2025, in a 102-page opinion. The court held that while USIP may be considered part of the federal government for constitutional purposes, it does not exercise executive power and is not part of the Executive branch, meaning the President lacked constitutional authority to remove board members in violation of the statutory restrictions. The court alternatively held that even if USIP were part of the Executive branch, the statutory removal protections would be constitutional under Humphrey's Executor v. United States and related precedent because USIP is a multimember expert board exercising minimal executive power.\n\nThe court declared the board member removals unlawful and void, ordered the plaintiffs' reinstatement, and invalidated all subsequent actions taken by the improperly appointed leadership, including the removal of Ambassador Moose and the transfer of USIP property. The court issued permanent injunctive relief preventing defendants from interfering with the restored leadership's operations.\n\nDefendants appealed and sought a stay pending appeal, which the district court denied on May 23, 2025. However, on June 27, 2025, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit granted the stay, finding that the government was likely to succeed on the merits because USIP exercises \"substantial executive power\" in foreign affairs and therefore the statutory removal restrictions are unconstitutional. Plaintiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc, which the full D.C. Circuit denied on July 24, 2025, leaving the panel's stay in effect pending resolution of the appeal on the merits.",
    "46274": "Climate United Fund and related organizations filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on March 8, 2025, challenging EPA's termination of billions in climate funding grants. The case was assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan and later consolidated with similar suits by Coalition for Green Capital, Power Forward Communities, and several state green banks, representing over $14 billion in terminated grants.\n\nThe litigation arose from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), a $27 billion program established under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to finance clean energy projects nationwide. In April 2024, EPA awarded the plaintiffs grants after a competitive process: Climate United received $6.97 billion, Coalition for Green Capital received $5 billion, and Power Forward Communities received $2 billion. The funds were held at Citibank under a Financial Agency Agreement with Treasury and Account Control Agreements that specified procedures EPA must follow to terminate grants or control the funds.\n\nAfter the 2024 presidential election, newly confirmed EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made public statements calling the entire program \"criminal\" and announcing EPA's intention to \"recover\" the funds. In February 2025, EPA worked with the FBI and Treasury Department to freeze the plaintiffs' accounts at Citibank, despite EPA not having issued the required Notice of Exclusive Control or followed proper termination procedures. Career prosecutor Denise Cheung resigned from the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office after refusing to send legally unjustified letters to Citibank demanding the freeze.\n\nOn March 11, 2025—after requesting a courtesy extension from plaintiffs and just before a scheduled TRO hearing—EPA issued identical \"Notice of Termination\" letters to all NCIF grantees, claiming termination was based on \"substantial concerns regarding program integrity\" and \"misalignment with the Agency's priorities.\" EPA did not provide specific evidence of wrongdoing by any plaintiff or follow the procedural requirements in federal regulations (2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339-341) or the grant agreements' terms and conditions.\n\nPlaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act alleging EPA's actions were arbitrary and capricious, violated federal regulations governing grant termination, and failed to provide required due process. They also alleged constitutional violations of the Appropriations Clause and Due Process Clause, and breach of contract claims against Citibank for failing to honor the Account Control Agreements. EPA defended by arguing the district court lacked jurisdiction and that the terminations were within agency discretion, while Citibank claimed it was following government directives under its fiduciary duties.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, Judge Chutkan granted a temporary restraining order in part, enjoining EPA from implementing the termination letters and preventing Citibank from transferring the funds, but not requiring Citibank to resume disbursements. After full briefing on preliminary injunction motions, and despite EPA's last-minute contingent motion for stay pending appeal, Judge Chutkan granted the preliminary injunction on April 15, 2025, finding plaintiffs likely to succeed on their claims and suffer irreparable harm without relief. The court ordered EPA to stop effectuating the termination and enjoined interference with plaintiffs' access to their funds, while also requiring Citibank to resume processing disbursement requests in accordance with the Account Control Agreements.\n\nEPA immediately appealed to the D.C. Circuit on April 16, 2025. The case highlighted tensions between congressional appropriations and executive branch policy changes, with EPA arguing it could terminate grants due to changed priorities while plaintiffs contended such terminations violated specific statutory and regulatory procedures designed to protect grantees' rights.",
    "46142": "On February 19, 2025, three nonprofit organizations—the National Urban League, National Fair Housing Alliance, and AIDS Foundation of Chicago—filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging three executive orders issued by President Trump in his first days in office. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Covington & Burling LLP, and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. Judge Timothy J. Kelly presides over the case.\n\nThe challenged executive orders, issued January 20-21, 2025, are titled \"Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs and Preferencing,\" \"Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\" and \"Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.\" These orders direct federal agencies to terminate funding for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) programs, require federal contractors and grantees to certify they do not operate DEIA programs that violate federal anti-discrimination laws, and prohibit the use of federal funds to \"promote gender ideology.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs, which rely heavily on federal funding to serve historically marginalized communities, alleged the executive orders violate the First Amendment by chilling their protected speech about diversity and civil rights issues, and the Fifth Amendment by being unconstitutionally vague and denying due process. They claimed the orders force them to choose between abandoning their organizational missions or losing critical federal funding. The complaint alleged that agencies had already begun implementing the orders by terminating contracts and issuing stop-work orders.\n\nOn February 28, 2025, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of key provisions of the executive orders. The court held a hearing on March 19, 2025. On May 2, 2025, Judge Kelly issued a memorandum opinion denying the motion for preliminary injunction. The court found that plaintiffs failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits, concluding they lacked standing to challenge several provisions and that their constitutional claims were unlikely to succeed. The court determined that four provisions addressed only internal government operations and did not cause concrete harm to plaintiffs sufficient for standing.\n\nFor the provisions where standing existed, the court found the constitutional challenges were facial rather than as-applied, requiring plaintiffs to meet a higher burden of showing the provisions were invalid in all their applications. The court rejected the Fifth Amendment due process claims, finding plaintiffs failed to identify protected property or liberty interests and that the challenged provisions provided adequate guidance to avoid constitutional vagueness. The First Amendment claims failed because the court determined the government was acting as a funding patron rather than regulating speech directly, and that there is no constitutional right to violate federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThe case involved several related proceedings, including a motion to intervene by the organization Do No Harm, which was denied without prejudice on March 12, 2025, though Do No Harm was permitted to participate as amicus. The court noted that similar challenges to these executive orders have been filed in other federal courts, with mixed results on preliminary relief.",
    "46110": "On February 12, 2025, five federal employee unions—the National Treasury Employees Union, National Federation of Federal Employees, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, and International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America—filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging three Trump administration actions targeting the federal workforce. The unions sued President Trump and various agency heads, represented by private counsel, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe unions challenged Executive Order 14210 issued February 11, 2025, which directed federal agencies to undertake \"large-scale reductions in force\" prioritizing employees not typically designated as essential during government shutdowns, among other categories. They also challenged the Office of Personnel Management's directive to agencies to fire probationary employees across the government, and a \"deferred resignation program\" that offered federal employees paid leave through September 2025 if they resigned, while warning those who stayed that their positions were uncertain.\n\nThe unions alleged these actions violated constitutional separation of powers principles by undermining Congress's authority to create, fund, and assign missions to federal agencies. They also claimed the mass firings violated statutory reduction-in-force procedures under 5 U.S.C. § 3502 and related regulations, which require specific justifications, proper competitive areas, and consideration of factors like tenure and performance ratings rather than essential/nonessential status.\n\nThe unions moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on February 14, 2025, arguing they faced irreparable harm from loss of dues-paying members and diminished bargaining power. After a hearing on February 18 before Judge Christopher R. Cooper (the case was initially assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman), the court denied the motion on February 20, 2025. The court held that it likely lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the claims fell within the exclusive review scheme of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, which channels federal labor disputes to the Federal Labor Relations Authority for initial administrative review, with subsequent judicial review in the courts of appeals. The court found the unions' claims did not fit the narrow exceptions allowing district court review of such disputes.",
    "46098": "Global Health Council v. Trump was filed on February 11, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs included eight organizations involved in foreign assistance work: Global Health Council, Small Business Association for International Companies, HIAS, Management Sciences for Health, Chemonics International, DAI Global, Democracy International, and American Bar Association. The defendants included President Donald J. Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, various USAID and State Department officials, and the federal agencies themselves (State Department, USAID, and Office of Management and Budget). The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from Arnold & Porter.\n\nThe case arose from Executive Order 14,169, issued by President Trump on January 20, 2025, titled \"Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid.\" The order declared that U.S. foreign aid programs were \"antithetical to American values\" and directed an immediate 90-day pause on foreign development assistance spending. Following the order, State Department and USAID officials issued implementing memoranda that suspended new funding obligations and directed stop-work orders for existing foreign assistance awards. Within weeks, the agencies suspended or terminated thousands of grant awards, ultimately affecting over 90% of USAID awards and approximately 60% of State Department foreign assistance awards.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged these actions under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging arbitrary and capricious agency action and violations of statutory requirements. They also brought constitutional claims alleging violations of separation of powers principles, arguing that the Executive Branch unlawfully impounded congressionally appropriated funds in violation of the Impoundment Control Act and the Constitution's spending power provisions. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore funding and invalidate the challenged agency actions.\n\nJudge Amir H. Ali presided over the case. On February 13, 2025, after a hearing, the court granted a temporary restraining order in part, enjoining defendants from implementing certain aspects of the funding freeze for awards that existed as of January 19, 2025. The court found that plaintiffs had shown likelihood of success on their APA claims regarding the initial funding freeze, irreparable harm from the loss of funding that threatened their business operations, and that the balance of equities favored the plaintiffs.\n\nFollowing multiple enforcement motions due to continued non-compliance, the court held additional hearings and issued enforcement orders. On March 10, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction in part and denied it in part. The court found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on constitutional claims that the government violated separation of powers by unlawfully impounding congressionally appropriated funds in violation of the 2024 Appropriations Act, the Impoundment Control Act, and the Anti-Deficiency Act. The preliminary injunction required defendants to make available for obligation the full amount of foreign assistance funds appropriated by Congress in the 2024 Appropriations Act and ordered payment of outstanding invoices for work completed prior to February 13, 2025.\n\nThe government appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On August 13, 2025, a divided three-judge panel vacated the district court's preliminary injunction in a 2-1 decision written by Circuit Judge Henderson. The majority held that the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to bring their claims, finding that they could not bring a freestanding constitutional claim under the separation of powers doctrine because their underlying claims were fundamentally statutory rather than constitutional in nature, relying on Dalton v. Specter. The majority also concluded that the Impoundment Control Act precluded APA review by private parties, as the statute created a specific enforcement mechanism through the Comptroller General. Circuit Judge Pan dissented, arguing that the majority's analysis was erroneous and that the Executive Branch's policy-based refusal to spend appropriated funds raised constitutional separation of powers concerns that were properly reviewable.\n\nThe case involved extensive factual allegations about harm to the plaintiff organizations and their operations. Many plaintiffs were heavily dependent on federal foreign assistance funding, with some receiving 80-90% of their revenue from USAID and State Department contracts and grants. The funding freeze and subsequent terminations forced plaintiffs to furlough thousands of employees, shut down overseas operations, and halt critical humanitarian programs worldwide. The plaintiffs argued that these actions caused irreparable harm not only to their organizations but also to the beneficiaries of foreign aid programs, including vulnerable populations receiving food assistance, medical care, and other essential services.",
    "46090": "On February 9, 2025, six plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging what they characterized as the Trump administration's effort to unilaterally eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The plaintiffs included the National Treasury Employees Union and CFPB Employee Association (representing agency employees), three consumer advocacy organizations (National Consumer Law Center, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and Virginia Poverty Law Center), and Rev. Eva Steege, an 83-year-old pastor seeking student loan assistance who later died and was replaced by her husband Ted Steege. They sued Russell Vought, the Acting Director of the CFPB, and the agency itself, represented by private counsel from Gupta Wessler LLP and Public Citizen Litigation Group.\n\nThe case arose from dramatic actions taken immediately after President Trump designated Russell Vought as Acting CFPB Director on February 7, 2025. That same day, Elon Musk posted \"CFPB RIP\" with a tombstone emoji, and the agency's website homepage was changed to display a \"404 - Site Not Found\" error message. On February 8, Vought issued an email directive instructing all staff to cease most activities unless \"required by law\" or expressly approved by him. This was followed by a more comprehensive \"stop work order\" on February 10 directing employees to \"not perform any work tasks\" without written approval from the Chief Legal Officer Mark Paoletta.\n\nThe shutdown efforts escalated rapidly throughout February. On February 11, approximately 85 probationary employees were terminated, followed by 130 term employees. The agency canceled over $100 million in contracts across five divisions, including contracts necessary for statutorily required functions. Officials prepared for a reduction-in-force that would eliminate approximately 1,200 employees (about 90% of the workforce), with only a skeleton crew remaining. The agency's headquarters building was closed, and employees were placed on administrative leave. President Trump publicly stated that his administration had \"totally eliminated\" the CFPB and called it \"a very important thing to get rid of.\"\n\nPlaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 13, 2025, asserting four counts: (1) that defendants' actions violated the constitutional separation of powers by usurping Congress's authority to create and eliminate federal agencies; (2) that Vought's appointment as Acting Director violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act; (3) that defendants' actions constituted final agency action in excess of statutory authority under APA § 706(2)(C); and (4) that defendants' actions were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law under APA § 706(2)(A). They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the dismantling of the CFPB and require performance of statutory duties.\n\nOn February 14, 2025, the parties agreed to a consent order that temporarily froze the situation, prohibiting further employee terminations, data destruction, or fund transfers pending resolution of the preliminary injunction motion. Judge Amy Berman Jackson held oral argument on March 3, 2025, followed by a two-day evidentiary hearing on March 10-11, 2025. The government's primary witness was CFPB Chief Operating Officer Adam Martinez, who initially denied the agency was being shut down but later conceded under cross-examination that he had told staff the agency was closing and that his earlier sworn statements were inaccurate.\n\nOn March 28, 2025, Judge Jackson granted plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, finding after detailed factual analysis that defendants were \"engaged in a concerted, expedited effort to shut the agency down entirely\" in violation of law. The injunction required defendants to maintain agency data, reinstate terminated employees, refrain from further terminations except for cause, lift the stop-work order, maintain consumer complaint systems, and provide employees with office space or remote work capabilities. The court found plaintiffs were likely to succeed on both their separation of powers and APA claims, concluding that only Congress could eliminate an agency it had created by statute.\n\nDefendants immediately appealed and sought an emergency stay. On April 11, 2025, the D.C. Circuit issued a partial stay allowing defendants to terminate employees they determined, after \"particularized assessment,\" were unnecessary for statutory duties. However, when defendants promptly moved to implement a reduction-in-force affecting over 80% of the workforce, the appeals court modified its stay order on April 28, 2025, restoring full protection against terminations, finding the disputes over the scope of permissible actions too complex for interim resolution.\n\nOn August 15, 2025, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction entirely in a 2-1 decision. The majority held that claims by employee organizations were barred by the specialized review scheme of the Civil Service Reform Act, and that the remaining plaintiffs' claims failed because they did not challenge discrete, final agency action reviewable under the APA. The court distinguished between individual agency actions (like contract cancellations or employee terminations) that could be challenged through appropriate forums, and the abstract \"decision to shut down the CFPB\" that plaintiffs sought to challenge, which the majority found was not the type of concrete agency action subject to APA review. The majority also rejected plaintiffs' constitutional claims, following Dalton v. Specter in holding that claims of executive action exceeding statutory authority are ultra vires claims rather than constitutional separation-of-powers claims subject to equitable review.\n\nJudge Pillard dissented, arguing that Congress created the CFPB with important statutory mandates and that courts have both statutory and equitable power to prevent the President from unilaterally abolishing agencies established by Congress. She contended that the majority's narrow view of reviewable agency action would leave courts powerless to address executive attempts to eliminate congressionally-created agencies, undermining both the separation of powers and the rule of law. The appeals court decision effectively ended the case, with defendants having successfully argued that the judicial system lacked authority to review their actions to eliminate the agency.",
    "PN-NY-0014": "On March 28, 2012, Jaenean Ligon and twelve other plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against the City of New York, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, and several individual NYPD officers under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The case was assigned to Judge Shira A. Scheindlin and later reassigned to Judge Analisa Torres.\n\nThe plaintiffs, represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union, The Bronx Defenders, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, and Shearman & Sterling LLP, challenged the NYPD's \"Operation Clean Halls\" program (also known as the Trespass Affidavit Program or TAP). This program allowed police officers to patrol inside and around thousands of private residential apartment buildings throughout New York City with the building owners' consent. The plaintiffs alleged that NYPD officers routinely conducted unconstitutional stops, searches, and arrests of building residents and their invited guests without reasonable suspicion, particularly targeting Black and Latino individuals.\n\nThe case was designated as related to Floyd v. City of New York (08 Civ. 1034) and Davis v. City of New York (10 Civ. 699), both of which also challenged NYPD stop-and-frisk practices. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to reform NYPD policies, training, supervision, and monitoring procedures.\n\nFollowing extensive discovery and motion practice, the court held a preliminary injunction hearing from October 15-23, 2012, and November 7, 2012. On January 8, 2013 (amended February 14, 2013), Judge Scheindlin granted the preliminary injunction, finding that plaintiffs had shown a clear likelihood of proving that the NYPD had a widespread practice of conducting unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx. On February 11, 2013, the court certified a preliminary injunction class. The court also issued a remedial order on August 12, 2013, requiring various reforms.\n\nThe City initially appealed these orders, but the case was eventually remanded for settlement discussions. Several police unions attempted to intervene to continue the appeals, but their motions were denied by both the district court and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nOn July 19, 2017, the parties reached a comprehensive settlement agreement that was approved by the court. The settlement included specific standards for NYPD enforcement activities in and around TAP buildings, requiring officers to have objective credible reasons for approaches and reasonable suspicion for stops. It also mandated revisions to NYPD patrol guides, training materials, and forms used to document trespass arrests. The settlement provided for continued court-ordered monitoring by Peter L. Zimroth to oversee implementation of the reforms, with the possibility of terminating court supervision after a period of substantial compliance.\n\nThe case was formally terminated on July 19, 2017, with the settlement incorporating detailed provisions for constitutional policing practices and ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with Fourth Amendment requirements in the NYPD's TAP enforcement activities.",
    "PB-CT-0007": "This case was filed on November 9, 2010, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, with thirteen individual plaintiffs challenging Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The plaintiffs were same-sex married couples and one widower from Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—all states that had legalized same-sex marriage. They were represented by private counsel from organizations including Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders and several law firms.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought their constitutional challenge under the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, using the Declaratory Judgment Act to seek both declaratory and injunctive relief. They argued that DOMA Section 3, which defines \"marriage\" for all federal purposes as only between one man and one woman, unconstitutionally denied them federal benefits available to opposite-sex married couples.\n\nThe specific federal programs at issue included the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB), the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Social Security survivor benefits, federal income tax filing status, and ERISA-governed pension benefits. Each plaintiff couple demonstrated concrete financial and personal harms from being treated as unmarried for federal purposes despite their valid state marriages.\n\nAfter the Department of Justice announced in February 2011 that it would no longer defend DOMA's constitutionality, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives successfully intervened in May 2011 to defend the statute. Judge Vanessa L. Bryant presided over the case.\n\nFollowing discovery, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment in July 2011, while BLAG moved to dismiss. The court denied BLAG's motion to stay proceedings in July 2012. On July 31, 2012, Judge Bryant issued a comprehensive 104-page decision granting the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denying BLAG's motion to dismiss.\n\nThe district court's decision included extensive analysis of whether sexual orientation classifications should receive heightened scrutiny under equal protection doctrine, examining factors such as history of discrimination, immutability, and political powerlessness. However, the court ultimately found it unnecessary to definitively resolve the standard of review because DOMA failed even rational basis review.\n\nThe court systematically rejected each rationale offered by Congress and BLAG for DOMA, including defending traditional marriage, promoting responsible procreation, preserving government resources, and maintaining administrative consistency. The court concluded that DOMA violated the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection and declared Section 3 unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiffs.\n\nBoth the federal defendants and BLAG appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on August 17, 2012, and multiple parties filed petitions for certiorari before judgment with the Supreme Court. The case was part of a broader wave of constitutional challenges to DOMA that ultimately led to the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Windsor in 2013.",
    "PC-AL-0034": "The United States filed this lawsuit on May 28, 2015, against the State of Alabama and Alabama Department of Corrections under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, seeking to stop constitutional violations at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women. The case arose from a Department of Justice investigation that began in February 2013 and concluded in January 2014 with findings that Alabama violated the Eighth Amendment by failing to protect women prisoners from sexual abuse and harassment by correctional staff.\n\nThe DOJ investigation revealed systemic and pervasive sexual abuse spanning nearly two decades at Tutwiler. Investigators found that staff members raped, sodomized, fondled, and sexually harassed women prisoners, with at least 36 of the facility's 99 employees identified as having engaged in sexual conduct with inmates. The facility operated with what the DOJ characterized as a \"toxic, sexualized environment\" where women prisoners were forced to submit to unlawful sexual advances to obtain basic necessities or avoid punishment. Prison officials failed to adequately investigate allegations, discouraged reporting through retaliation, and demonstrated deliberate indifference to known risks. The investigation also identified numerous systemic deficiencies including dangerously low staffing levels, architectural problems that compromised privacy, lack of gender-responsive policies, and an inadequate classification system.\n\nOn the same day the complaint was filed, the parties jointly moved for court approval of a comprehensive settlement agreement they had negotiated. Judge Myron H. Thompson approved the settlement on June 18, 2015, entering it as a consent decree while conditionally dismissing the complaint without prejudice and retaining jurisdiction for enforcement purposes.\n\nThe settlement agreement established extensive reform requirements across multiple areas including mandatory zero-tolerance policies for sexual abuse and harassment, comprehensive staff training programs, installation of a state-of-the-art camera surveillance system, adequate staffing requirements, inmate education programs, development of gender-responsive classification and programming systems, enhanced privacy protections, multiple reporting mechanisms for allegations, detailed investigation procedures, staff disciplinary protocols, and ongoing quality improvement and data collection systems.\n\nThe agreement provided for independent monitoring of compliance, with court-appointed monitor Jennie Lancaster initially overseeing implementation, later replaced by Kathleen Dennehy in August 2016. The monitors filed detailed compliance reports every six months documenting steady progress, from 12 provisions in substantial compliance in the first report to 41 provisions in substantial compliance by the eighth report in August 2019. Key areas of ongoing challenge included chronic staffing shortages and recruitment difficulties, particularly for female correctional officers.\n\nThe case demonstrates the federal government's use of CRIPA to address systemic constitutional violations in state correctional facilities, resulting in comprehensive court-supervised reform through a detailed consent decree with ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements lasting several years.",
    "ED-MI-0001": "On November 8, 2006, the day after Michigan voters approved Proposal 2 by a 58-42% margin, the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality by Any Means Necessary (BAMN) and other organizations and individuals filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan challenging the constitutional amendment. Proposal 2, which became Article I, Section 26 of the Michigan Constitution, prohibited the state's public universities and other governmental entities from granting \"preferential treatment\" based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public education, employment, and contracting. The plaintiffs named as defendants Governor Jennifer Granholm, the governing boards of the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University, along with university presidents.\n\nA separate but similar lawsuit was filed on December 19, 2006, by the Cantrell Plaintiffs, consisting of University of Michigan faculty members, students, and prospective students. District Judge David M. Lawson consolidated the cases on January 5, 2007. Michigan Attorney General Michael Cox intervened as a defendant, while Eric Russell, a law school applicant, and several other entities sought to intervene supporting Proposal 2.\n\nThe plaintiffs' legal challenge rested primarily on two constitutional theories. First, they argued that Proposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause under the \"political process\" doctrine established in Hunter v. Erickson and Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, claiming the amendment impermissibly restructured Michigan's political process by requiring constitutional amendment—rather than normal legislative or administrative processes—to restore race-conscious admissions policies. Second, they contended Proposal 2 constituted intentional discrimination against racial minorities. The Coalition Plaintiffs also raised claims under the First Amendment and federal civil rights statutes including Title VI, Title VII, and Title IX.\n\nBoth plaintiff groups sought class certification and filed motions for summary judgment. The defendants responded with their own summary judgment motions. Procedural complications arose when university defendants initially sought to be dismissed as unnecessary parties, and when Russell's status as an intervenor was challenged after his law school application was denied.\n\nOn December 19, 2006, the court issued a temporary injunction postponing Proposal 2's application to university admissions until July 1, 2007, based on a stipulation among the parties. However, the Sixth Circuit granted a stay of this injunction on December 29, 2006, allowing Proposal 2 to take immediate effect. The circuit court noted there was an \"absence of any likelihood of prevailing in invalidating [Proposal 2] on federal grounds\" and suggested Proposal 2 \"would seem to be an equal-protection virtue, not an equal-protection vice.\"\n\nOn March 18, 2008, District Judge Lawson granted summary judgment for the Attorney General and dismissed all claims, finding that Proposal 2 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court distinguished the case from Hunter and Seattle, reasoning that those precedents applied only when laws denied minorities \"equal protection\" rather than merely precluding \"preferential treatment.\" The court also dismissed Russell as an intervenor, finding he no longer had a distinct interest after his law school application was denied.\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed, and a Sixth Circuit panel reversed in a 2-1 decision in 2011, concluding that Proposal 2 violated the Hunter/Seattle doctrine by impermissibly restructuring the political process along racial lines. The panel majority found that race-conscious admissions policies \"inure primarily to the benefit of the minority\" and that Proposal 2 placed special burdens on racial minorities by moving decision-making authority over such policies from university governing boards to the state constitutional level.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit sitting en banc affirmed the panel decision in November 2012 by an 8-7 vote. The majority opinion, written by Judge Cole, applied the Hunter/Seattle two-prong test: finding that Proposal 2 had a \"racial focus\" because it targeted policies primarily benefiting minorities, and that it reordered the political process by requiring constitutional amendment to restore race-conscious policies while leaving other admissions criteria subject to normal administrative processes.\n\nThe case reached the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on October 15, 2013. On April 22, 2014, the Court reversed the Sixth Circuit in a 6-2 decision (with Justice Kagan recused), upholding Proposal 2's constitutionality. Justice Kennedy's plurality opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, distinguished Hunter and Seattle as cases involving \"demonstrated injuries on the basis of race that, by reasons of state encouragement or participation, became more aggravated.\" The plurality found that unlike those precedents, Proposal 2 did not inflict specific racial injuries but rather represented a democratic choice about whether to continue race-based preferences. Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concurred in the judgment but argued for overruling the Hunter/Seattle doctrine entirely. Justice Breyer also concurred separately. Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ginsburg, dissented, arguing that the majority failed to understand the continuing effects of racial inequality.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision definitively resolved the eight-year litigation, allowing Michigan's constitutional prohibition on affirmative action to stand and affecting similar laws in other states. The case represented a significant constitutional ruling on the intersection of democratic processes, equal protection, and affirmative action policies in public higher education.",
    "DR-CA-0033": "Maurizio Antoninetti, a paraplegic who uses a wheelchair for mobility, filed this Americans with Disabilities Act lawsuit on August 22, 2005, against Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., challenging the accessibility of two Chipotle restaurants in San Diego and Encinitas, California. The case was initially assigned to Judge Napoleon A. Jones Jr. and later transferred to Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz. Antoninetti was represented by private counsel Amy B. Vandeveld, while Chipotle was represented by attorneys from several firms including Greenberg Traurig.\n\nThe central issue involved Chipotle's restaurant design, where 44-inch high walls separated customers from food preparation counters containing displayed food ingredients. Standing customers could see over these walls to view food preparation and select ingredients as part of the \"Chipotle experience,\" but wheelchair users, with average eye levels between 43-51 inches, could not see over the walls. Antoninetti argued this violated the ADA by denying wheelchair users equal access to the visual and interactive elements of ordering food.\n\nChipotle defended by pointing to its accommodation policies. Initially, it had an unwritten policy allowing employees to show food samples to wheelchair users in spoons, tongs, or plastic cups, or to prepare food at the lower 34-inch transaction station. In February 2007, during the litigation, Chipotle implemented a written \"Customers With Disabilities Policy\" formalizing these accommodations and requiring managers to proactively offer assistance to customers with disabilities.\n\nThe case proceeded through cross-motions for summary judgment filed in April 2007. On June 14, 2007, the district court granted partial summary judgment to both parties, finding that Chipotle's food preparation counters were governed by ADA Accessibility Guidelines Section 7.2(2) rather than the sight-line requirements of Section 4.33.3 that Antoninetti had argued applied. The court ruled that a genuine factual dispute existed regarding whether Chipotle's accommodation policies constituted \"equivalent facilitation\" under the ADA.\n\nFollowing a four-day bench trial in November-December 2007, Judge Jones concluded that Chipotle's prior unwritten policy violated the ADA but that its current written policy provided equivalent facilitation and complied with the ADA. The court denied Antoninetti's request for injunctive relief to lower the restaurant walls and awarded him $5,000 in statutory damages under the California Disabled Persons Act for five \"bona fide\" customer visits made before the written policy was implemented. The court denied damages for three additional \"litigation-related\" visits.\n\nAntoninetti appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which issued its decision in Antoninetti v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 643 F.3d 1165 (9th Cir. 2010). The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's finding that Chipotle's written policy complied with the ADA, holding that both the written and unwritten policies violated federal disability law. The appellate court found that Chipotle's accommodation methods did not provide substantially equivalent access to the food preparation areas and remanded for entry of judgment that Chipotle violated the ADA and for determination of appropriate injunctive relief.\n\nHowever, the injunctive relief issue became moot when Antoninetti died on May 9, 2011. His widow, Livia Antoninetti, was substituted as plaintiff. On remand, the district court entered judgment against Chipotle for ADA violations but found that injunctive relief was no longer appropriate due to Antoninetti's death, as his estate lacked standing to pursue an injunction.\n\nThe case also involved extensive litigation over attorney's fees. The district court initially awarded Antoninetti's counsel $136,537.83 in fees, but after the Ninth Circuit's reversal on the merits, the fee award was reconsidered and ultimately increased to $545,079.05 for the district court proceedings, with additional fees awarded for the appellate work.\n\nA related class action case (06cv2671) was filed and consolidated with the individual case for discovery purposes, though the cases proceeded separately for most purposes. The litigation established important precedent regarding ADA compliance in restaurant design and the adequacy of service-based accommodations versus architectural accessibility in newly constructed facilities.",
    "CJ-FL-0009": "This consolidated civil rights litigation was filed beginning June 28, 2019, challenging Florida's implementation of Amendment 4, a constitutional amendment passed by Florida voters in November 2018 that restored voting rights to most people with felony convictions upon \"completion of all terms of sentence including parole or probation.\" The plaintiffs include 17 individuals with felony convictions who cannot afford to pay their outstanding legal financial obligations (LFOs), as well as three civil rights organizations: the Florida State Conference of the NAACP, the Orange County Branch of the NAACP, and the League of Women Voters of Florida. The defendants are Florida state officials including the Governor, the Secretary of State, and various county Supervisors of Elections, all sued in their official capacities.\n\nThe legal dispute centers on Florida's Senate Bill 7066, enacted in 2019, which interpreted Amendment 4's requirement of completing \"all terms of sentence\" to include payment of fines, fees, costs, and restitution imposed as part of criminal sentences. The plaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging this requirement violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses by discriminating based on wealth, violates the Twenty-Fourth Amendment by functioning as a poll tax, and violates the First Amendment by burdening political speech and association. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs are represented by a coalition of civil rights organizations including the ACLU, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Campaign Legal Center, and Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Chief Judge Mark E. Walker but was reassigned to Judge Robert L. Hinkle. Five separate cases filed between June and July 2019 were consolidated for case management purposes under lead case number 4:19-cv-00300. After an evidentiary hearing, Judge Hinkle granted a preliminary injunction in October 2019, ruling that Florida cannot prevent people genuinely unable to pay their LFOs from registering and voting. The court certified both a class of all persons denied voting rights due to unpaid LFOs and a subclass of those genuinely unable to pay.\n\nFollowing an 8-day trial in 2020, Judge Hinkle issued a permanent injunction and 125-page opinion, finding that conditioning voting rights on payment of amounts people cannot afford violates the Equal Protection Clause, and that requiring payment of fees and costs (as opposed to fines and restitution) violates the Twenty-Fourth Amendment as an unconstitutional tax on voting.\n\nThe case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which initially affirmed the preliminary injunction in a panel decision (Jones v. Governor of Florida, 950 F.3d 795). However, the Eleventh Circuit then granted en banc review and in September 2020 reversed the district court's decision by a 6-4 vote. The en banc court held that rational basis review, not heightened scrutiny, applied to Florida's reenfranchisement scheme, and that the requirement to complete all terms of sentence, including financial obligations, was rationally related to legitimate state interests in ensuring full rehabilitation and completion of punishment. The court also ruled that fees and costs imposed as part of criminal sentences are penalties, not taxes, and therefore do not violate the Twenty-Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe litigation involved complex constitutional questions about the scope of voting rights for people with felony convictions, the relationship between wealth and access to the franchise, and the interpretation of constitutional amendments addressing poll taxes. The case significantly impacted voting rights in Florida, where an estimated 1.4 million people with felony convictions were potentially affected by Amendment 4's passage.",
    "CW-CA-0005": "Katie A. v. Bonta was a federal class action lawsuit filed on July 18, 2002, challenging California's failure to provide adequate mental health services to foster children. The case was brought by five foster children using pseudonyms—Katie A., Mary B., Janet C., Henry D., and Gary E.—against state officials including the Directors of the California Department of Health Services and Department of Social Services, as well as Los Angeles County and its Department of Children and Family Services. The plaintiffs were represented by multiple public interest organizations including the ACLU of Southern California, Western Center on Law & Poverty, and the National Center for Youth Law.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged violations of the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions of the Medicaid Act, the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to require defendants to provide necessary mental health services in community-based, home-like settings rather than inappropriate institutional placements.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Ronald Lew but transferred to Judge A. Howard Matz in August 2002, and later to Judge John A. Kronstadt. On June 18, 2003, the court certified a statewide class of children in California who are in foster care or at imminent risk of foster care placement, have documented mental illness or conditions, and need individualized mental health services in home or home-like settings to treat their conditions. However, plaintiff Gary E. was excluded as a class representative due to his relocation to Idaho.\n\nThe case involved extensive settlement negotiations. Plaintiffs first reached a settlement with the Los Angeles County defendants, which was approved by the court on July 16, 2003, after a fairness hearing. This settlement established an advisory panel to monitor implementation and required the county to provide wraparound services and other community-based mental health services to foster children.\n\nRegarding the state defendants, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction in September 2005, which Judge Matz granted on March 14, 2006. The court ordered the state to provide wraparound services and therapeutic foster care to eligible foster children within 120 days. However, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded this decision in March 2007, finding that the district court had applied an erroneous legal standard in concluding that the EPSDT provisions required the state to provide these services in specific bundled forms rather than just the individual component services.\n\nFollowing the remand, the parties engaged in renewed litigation and settlement negotiations. The court eventually granted another preliminary injunction in September 2008. After extensive negotiations involving a special master and stakeholder workgroup, the parties reached a comprehensive settlement agreement that was approved by the court on December 1, 2011.\n\nThe final settlement established four key objectives: facilitating coordinated, comprehensive, community-based mental health services; supporting development of service structures and fiscal systems that support core practices; providing effective oversight and training; and ensuring that subclass members with intensive needs receive medically necessary mental health services in appropriate settings. The settlement required the state defendants to develop documentation manuals for Intensive Care Coordination (ICC) and Intensive Home Based Services (IHBS), submit amendments to California's Medicaid State Plan, establish shared management structures between state departments, and implement various training and quality assurance measures.\n\nThe factual basis for the case centered on California's foster care system, which served over 90,000 children, with most receiving health care through Medi-Cal (California's Medicaid program). The plaintiffs alleged that thousands of foster children with behavioral, emotional, and psychiatric impairments were not receiving necessary community-based mental health services such as wraparound services and therapeutic foster care. Instead, these children were often placed in inappropriate group homes or institutional settings, leading to multiple placement disruptions and deteriorating conditions. The named plaintiffs had experienced numerous placements—Katie A. had 37 placements in ten years, Mary B. had 28 placements in three years, and Janet C. had 25 placements in less than two and a half years—demonstrating the system's failure to provide stable, appropriate care.\n\nThe case remained under court supervision for implementation of the settlement terms, with ongoing monitoring through advisory panels and special masters to ensure compliance with the agreement's requirements for systemic reform of mental health services for foster children in California.",
    "PC-VA-0022": "Eric J. DePaola filed this federal civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on December 19, 2014, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, challenging his prolonged solitary confinement at Red Onion State Prison. DePaola was sentenced to 38 years in prison at age 16 in 2004 for crimes including malicious wounding, use of a firearm, burglary, and abduction. After stabbing a prison guard in 2009, he was placed in administrative segregation (solitary confinement) where he has remained for approximately eight years.\n\nThe case was originally filed by three plaintiffs but was severed into separate actions on April 8, 2015, with DePaola proceeding pro se. He filed an amended complaint on May 18, 2016, after the court denied defendants' motion to dismiss. DePaola's claims center on Virginia Department of Corrections Operating Procedure 830.A, which became effective February 18, 2013, and classifies segregated prisoners into two pathways: Intensive Management (IM) and Special Management (SM).\n\nDePaola alleges that prisoners classified as IM, like himself, are permanently barred from returning to the general population and cannot participate in the Step-Down Program available to SM prisoners. He describes harsh conditions including 24-hour cell confinement in an 8x10-foot cell, constant bright lighting, minimal human contact, cavity searches before leaving his cell, and exercise in what he characterizes as a \"dog-style cage.\" These conditions have allegedly caused him mental illness, physical deterioration, and other health problems.\n\nHis legal claims include violations of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment and the Fourteenth Amendment's procedural due process guarantees. DePaola argues that his permanent solitary confinement serves no valid penological purpose and that he lacks meaningful review opportunities to progress out of segregation.\n\nThe court initially denied DePaola's motions for class certification and appointed counsel. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on July 28, 2016, which Judge James P. Jones granted on September 28, 2016, dismissing all claims. The court found that DePaola's conditions, while restrictive, did not violate the Constitution and that the periodic Institutional Classification Authority reviews provided sufficient process.\n\nDePaola appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on October 6, 2016 (Case No. 16-7358), arguing that the district court erred in granting summary judgment without allowing discovery and that genuine disputes of material fact existed on both his procedural due process and Eighth Amendment claims. The appeal was ultimately unsuccessful, with the Fourth Circuit issuing an unpublished memorandum opinion on November 22, 2017, affirming the district court's judgment.",

Evans was represented by private counsel from Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, while the state defendants were represented by the Maryland Attorney General's office. Chief Judge Benson Everett Legg presided over the case.\n\nEvans had been sentenced to death in 1984 for two contract murders and was housed at the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center. His federal lawsuit was filed just weeks before his scheduled execution date, after a Baltimore County judge signed a warrant of execution on January 9, 2006. Evans did not challenge the fact of his death sentence or the constitutionality of lethal injection generally, but rather contested the specific practices and procedures used by the Maryland Department of Correction.\n\nThe case centered on Maryland's three-drug lethal injection protocol using sodium pentothal (an anesthetic), pancuronium bromide (a paralytic agent), and potassium chloride (which stops the heart). Evans alleged that these procedures violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by creating an unnecessary risk that he would experience excruciating pain during execution. His primary concerns included inadequate medical supervision, improperly trained personnel, his compromised veins due to prior intravenous drug use, and the risk that he would not be adequately anesthetized when the painful second and third drugs were administered.\n\nExpert testimony was provided by Dr. Mark Heath, a board-certified anesthesiologist, who testified about the medical risks of the protocol. Dr. Thomas Scalea, a trauma surgeon from the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, examined Evans and concluded that his veins were severely compromised and might not be suitable for peripheral IV access, potentially requiring more invasive procedures like central line placement or surgical cut-down.\n\nEvans sought both a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to halt his execution. After hearings on January 24, 27, and February 1, 2006, Judge Legg denied both motions on February 1, 2006, finding that Evans had not met the requirements for injunctive relief under the Blackwelder standard. Evans immediately appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and sought a stay pending appeal, which was also denied.\n\nParallel to the federal case, Evans and organizational plaintiffs including the NAACP, ACLU of Maryland, and Maryland Citizens Against State Executions filed suit in Baltimore City Circuit Court challenging the execution protocol on state law grounds, arguing that it violated Maryland's lethal injection statute and was improperly adopted without following the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe Maryland Court of Appeals ultimately consolidated four related appeals (Nos. 107, 122, 123, 124) involving various challenges to Evans's death sentence. In its December 19, 2006 decision, the court rejected Evans's constitutional claims but found merit in his Administrative Procedure Act challenge. The court ruled that portions of the execution protocol directing the manner of administering lethal injection were effectively regulations that had been adopted without compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and were therefore invalid until either properly adopted as regulations or exempted by the legislature.\n\nThis ruling effectively enjoined Maryland from using its current lethal injection protocol and prevented Evans's execution from proceeding. The federal district court case remained stayed pending resolution of these state law issues. The case illustrates the complex interplay between federal constitutional challenges and state administrative law requirements in death penalty litigation, with the successful state law challenge ultimately providing the relief that the federal constitutional claims could not secure.",
    "CW-DC-0001": "LaShawn A. v. Bowser is a class action filed on June 20, 1989, on behalf of children in the District of Columbia's foster care system and children who have been reported as abused or neglected but remain in private custody. The plaintiffs, represented by next friends and attorneys from the ACLU's Children's Rights Project, sued the Mayor of the District of Columbia and other DC officials responsible for the child welfare system under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of federal statutes, DC statutes, and the Fifth Amendment.\n\nAfter a two-week bench trial in 1991, Judge Thomas F. Hogan issued a comprehensive 102-page opinion finding defendants liable for systemic failures in DC's child welfare system. The court found that the District had failed to comply with the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, DC's Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act of 1977, and the Youth Residential Facilities Licensure Act. For children in foster care, the court also found Fifth Amendment due process violations. The evidence revealed severe deficiencies including excessive caseloads, untimely investigations, inappropriate placements, lack of case planning, and children remaining in foster care for an average of nearly five years.\n\nThe parties negotiated a comprehensive 84-page Remedial Order that the court entered on August 27, 1991, establishing detailed requirements for reforming the child welfare system. The District appealed the liability finding, and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed in 1993 but directed the district court to base its judgment on DC law rather than federal law. This led to a Modified Final Order in January 1994 that was substantially similar to the original order.\n\nWhen the District failed to comply with the remedial requirements, the court appointed limited receivers in November 1994 and then a general receiver in August 1995. The receivership lasted until 2001, during which significant improvements were made to the system. After the receivership ended, the court continued monitoring compliance through a series of implementation plans, including major plans adopted in 2003, 2007, and 2010.\n\nThroughout the case, the Center for the Study of Social Policy has served as court-appointed monitor, regularly reporting on the District's progress in meeting specific performance standards related to child safety, permanency, and well-being. The case has involved extensive requirements covering investigation of abuse and neglect reports, placement of children in appropriate foster homes, case planning, adoption services, worker training and caseloads, and system infrastructure.\n\nOver more than three decades of litigation, the District has gradually achieved compliance with most court-ordered requirements. As of 2019, the parties agreed to an Exit and Sustainability Plan that removed from court monitoring 56 standards the District had achieved and maintained, while continuing oversight of remaining areas needing improvement. The case represents one of the most comprehensive and long-running institutional reform efforts in child welfare, transforming a system that the court initially found \"in an ongoing state of crisis\" into one that meets most professional standards for child protection and foster care services."
