    "46496": "This case was filed on April 24, 2025, by three nonprofit organizations—Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, Southern Border Communities Coalition, and Urban Justice Center—against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Kristi Noem in her official capacity. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Public Citizen Litigation Group, Democracy Forward Foundation, and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights.\n\nThe case challenges DHS's March 21, 2025 decision to shut down three congressionally-mandated oversight offices: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO), and the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman Office. These offices were established by Congress through various statutes including 6 U.S.C. § 345 (CRCL), 6 U.S.C. § 272 (CIS Ombudsman), and 6 U.S.C. § 205 (OIDO), each with specific statutory functions including receiving complaints, conducting investigations, and reporting to Congress.\n\nCRCL was responsible for investigating civil rights and civil liberties complaints against DHS, conducting public outreach, and submitting annual reports to Congress. The CIS Ombudsman Office assisted individuals and employers with immigration services problems and made recommendations for improvements. OIDO operated as an independent office investigating misconduct at immigration detention facilities and conducting inspections.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, DHS placed nearly all employees of these offices on administrative leave and issued reduction-in-force notices with separation dates of May 23, 2025. DHS eliminated approximately 150 CRCL employees, 44 CIS Ombudsman Office employees, and 110 OIDO employees. The plaintiffs, who regularly filed complaints with and relied on services from these offices, allege this shutdown violates their statutory obligations and constitutional separation of powers principles.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under both non-statutory review for ultra vires action and the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging the shutdown was arbitrary, capricious, and exceeded statutory authority. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore the offices and their functions.\n\nJudge Ana C. Reyes presided over the case. The plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction on May 8, 2025, followed by a motion for temporary restraining order on May 23, 2025. The court held evidentiary hearings on May 19, 20, and 23, 2025, hearing testimony from DHS officials including Ronald Sartini, Nicole Barksdale-Perry, and others about efforts to restore office functions.\n\nThe court denied the temporary restraining order motion without prejudice on May 23, 2025. During the proceedings, there were ongoing disputes about whether DHS was genuinely working to restore the offices' statutory functions, with status reports filed on May 27, June 2, June 11, and July 2, 2025, detailing staffing efforts and operational concerns.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, the court granted a joint motion for scheduling order that established a timeline for summary judgment motions, with the administrative record due August 22, 2025, plaintiff's summary judgment motion due November 3, 2025, and related briefing extending through December 2025. As a result of granting this scheduling order, the court denied the preliminary injunction motion as moot. The case remains pending with argument scheduled for January 2026.",
    "46477": "On April 14, 2025, ten international students filed a lawsuit in the Western District of Michigan against federal immigration officials, including DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, and Detroit ICE Field Office Director Robert Lynch. The case was later amended to include thirty-one total plaintiffs—F-1 and M-1 nonimmigrant students and recent graduates attending universities in Michigan and other states. The students are represented by private counsel.\n\nThe lawsuit arose after the Department of Homeland Security's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) began unilaterally terminating the students' records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) starting around March 28, 2025. The SEVIS system tracks the legal status of international students in the United States. The termination reason recorded in SEVIS stated that individuals were \"identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked,\" but the students alleged they had not been convicted of any disqualifying crimes and had not violated immigration laws.\n\nThe students brought four claims: constitutional due process violations (Counts 1 and 4) and Administrative Procedure Act violations alleging the terminations were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law (Counts 2 and 3). They sought only declaratory and injunctive relief, not monetary damages. The students argued that the terminations had immediate harmful consequences, including loss of employment authorization, inability to complete their studies, and risk of arrest and deportation.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, the students filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. After oral argument on April 22, 2025, Judge Jane M. Beckering granted the temporary restraining order on April 23, 2025. The TRO required defendants to set aside the termination decisions, restore the students' SEVIS records retroactively to the date of termination, prohibit future terminations without valid regulatory grounds, prohibit revocation of Optional Practical Training employment authorizations, and prohibit arrests, detentions, or deportations based on the SEVIS terminations. The court waived the security requirement.\n\nFollowing additional briefing and a hearing on May 6, 2025, Judge Beckering granted a preliminary injunction on May 7, 2025, continuing the same protections. The court found the students had demonstrated a likelihood of success on their Administrative Procedure Act claim, concluding that the government lacked regulatory authority under 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d) to terminate the students' records. The court rejected the government's argument that general authority to collect student information under 8 U.S.C. § 1372 provided specific authority to terminate records.\n\nOn April 26, 2025, after the TRO was issued, ICE issued a new policy message to personnel listing circumstances under which SEVIS records could be terminated. However, the court found this did not moot the case, noting that the government's voluntary compliance was \"ad hoc, discretionary, and easily reversible\" and that there remained a reasonable expectation the wrongful conduct could recur.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal of the preliminary injunction order. The Sixth Circuit assigned the appeal case number 25-1611. The preliminary injunction remains in effect pending the appeal.",
    "46242": "On March 5, 2025, BlueRibbon Coalition, Inc., Sage Riders Motorcycle Club, and Paul Wells filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah against the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Department of the Interior, challenging BLM's December 31, 2024 San Rafael Swell Travel Management Plan. The case is before Judge David Nuffer. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel, with Isabella Eldridge representing BlueRibbon Coalition.\n\nThe challenged travel management plan governs approximately 1,149,016 acres of BLM-managed land in the San Rafael Swell Travel Management Area in Emery County, Utah. The plan closed 665 miles of previously available routes to motorized recreation while designating 1,496 miles for continued motorized use. The area is known for spectacular landscapes including canyons, arches, and mesas, and has been a popular destination for off-highway vehicle recreation for decades.\n\nThe current travel planning process originated from a 2017 settlement agreement in prior litigation led by the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance that required BLM to prepare new travel management plans for multiple areas in Utah, including the San Rafael Swell. That earlier litigation had challenged BLM's 2008 Resource Management Plans for the area.\n\nThe plaintiffs bring three main legal claims under federal law. First, they argue the route closures violate the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act (the Dingell Act) by creating impermissible buffer zones around wilderness areas and a de facto wild river designation along the Price River, which they claim exceeds BLM's authority and contradicts Congressional intent. Second, they contend BLM's actions were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, citing the agency's failure to adequately respond to public comments, inconsistent reasoning for route closures, and the unusual decision to have a high-level Interior Department official rather than the local district manager sign the decision, thereby eliminating the normal 30-day appeal period to the Interior Board of Land Appeals. Third, they claim BLM violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and instead issuing a Finding of No Significant Impact, despite the significant effects of closing 665 miles of routes.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that the travel management plan violates federal law, an order setting aside the plan, and a permanent injunction against its enforcement. They filed a motion for relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or alternatively for preliminary injunction on March 6, 2025.\n\nThe Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, a nonprofit conservation organization that had participated extensively in the travel planning process and the earlier litigation, moved to intervene as a defendant on March 10, 2025. SUWA argued it has protectable interests in preventing motorized vehicle damage to the San Rafael Swell area and that these interests may be impaired if the court invalidates the travel plan. On April 21, 2025, Judge Nuffer granted SUWA's motion to intervene as of right, finding the organization met all four requirements for intervention including timeliness, legally protectable environmental interests, potential impairment, and inadequate representation by the federal defendants.\n\nThe case is proceeding under an administrative appeal scheduling order, with the administrative record due October 31, 2025, plaintiffs' opening brief due February 23, 2026, defendants' responsive brief due April 24, 2026, intervenor-defendant's responsive brief due May 8, 2026, and plaintiffs' reply brief due June 5, 2026.",
    "46039": "This case was filed on February 4, 2025, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association and individual FBI agents proceeding under pseudonyms against the U.S. Department of Justice and the United States of America. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from the Law Office of Mark S. Zaid and State Democracy Defenders Fund, with the FBIAA represented by attorneys from Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder. Judge Jia M. Cobb presides over the consolidated proceedings, which include the related case John and Jane Does 1-9 v. Department of Justice, Case No. 25-cv-00325.\n\nThe case arises from the FBI's investigations following the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, where a mob supporting then-President Trump violently breached the building to prevent certification of the 2020 presidential election results. Federal law enforcement subsequently investigated and prosecuted nearly 1,600 individuals connected to the attack. The plaintiffs are FBI special agents, forensic examiners, a forensic chemist, and an intelligence analyst who participated in these investigations by executing lawful search and arrest warrants.\n\nAfter President Trump's January 20, 2025, inauguration, during which he pardoned or commuted sentences for all January 6 defendants, the Department of Justice issued a January 31, 2025, memorandum requesting lists of all current and former FBI personnel assigned to January 6 investigations. The memo directed the FBI to provide, by February 4, 2025, employee identification numbers, titles, office assignments, roles in investigations, and dates of last activity. The stated purpose was to \"commence a review process\" in conjunction with Executive Order 14,147, \"Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that pardoned January 6 defendants, including Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, have made threatening statements on social media targeting FBI agents involved in the investigations. They fear the government will publicly disclose their identities, exposing them to retaliation and potential violence from those they previously investigated. The plaintiffs assert claims under the Privacy Act (both disclosure and accuracy provisions), the First Amendment (retaliation based on perceived political affiliation), the Fifth Amendment (due process violations for both reputational harm and privacy interests), the Administrative Procedure Act, and seek mandamus relief.\n\nThe plaintiffs initially sought a temporary restraining order to prevent disclosure of their information. After a February 6, 2025, hearing, the parties reached a consent agreement whereby the government agreed not to disseminate the personnel list to the public before the court rules on anticipated preliminary injunction motions, with the ability to terminate this restriction upon two business days' notice. The court entered this consent order on February 7, 2025, and established a briefing schedule with preliminary injunction motions due February 24, 2025, opposition briefs due March 14, 2025, and replies due March 21, 2025. A preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled for March 27, 2025.",
    "46385": "On April 9, 2025, clinical law professors Sheila Bedi and Lynn Cohn filed suit in the Northern District of Illinois against the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce, Committee Chair Tim Walberg, and Subcommittee Chair Burgess Owens, with Northwestern University and its officials named as nominal defendants. The professors are represented by private counsel and the Center for Constitutional Rights.\n\nThe case arose from a March 27, 2025 letter the Committee sent to Northwestern University demanding extensive documents about the university's Bluhm Legal Clinic operations by April 10, 2025. The Committee specifically targeted Professor Bedi's Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic and her representation of pro-Palestinian protesters, describing her work as \"progressive-left political advocacy\" and part of Northwestern's \"institutionalization of left-wing political activism.\" The demanded documents included Professor Bedi's hiring materials and performance reviews, detailed budgets for all clinic programs, donor lists, and payment records spanning five years.\n\nThe factual context involves the Trump Administration's broader campaign against universities and law firms it considers ideologically opposed. The complaint details executive orders targeting major law firms like Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block for representing disfavored clients, as well as investigations of universities over campus protests related to Palestinian rights. Professor Bedi represents protesters who participated in Palestinian rights demonstrations and were sued in a civil case, which the Committee cited as supporting \"antisemitic conduct.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs brought constitutional claims alleging violations of their First Amendment rights (free speech, academic freedom, freedom of association, and retaliation for protected activity), Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection rights, and Sixth Amendment right to counsel. They sought declaratory relief finding the Committee's demands unconstitutional and injunctive relief preventing Northwestern from complying with the document requests.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent Northwestern from responding to the Committee's demands before the April 10 deadline. Judge Andrea R. Wood, sitting as emergency judge, held a hearing on April 10, 2025, and denied the motion as moot without prejudice. The case is assigned to Judge Elaine E. Bucklo with Magistrate Judge Jeffrey T. Gilbert designated.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, the parties filed a joint motion to stay proceedings, which Judge Bucklo granted on June 24, 2025. The case remains stayed with a status hearing set for September 22, 2025. The stay suggests the immediate crisis that prompted the emergency motion may have been resolved, allowing time for broader resolution of the underlying disputes.",
    "46104": "American Oversight filed this Freedom of Information Act case on February 11, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, U.S. DOGE Service, U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, U.S. Digital Service, and the Office of Management and Budget. The case is assigned to Judge Beryl A. Howell. American Oversight, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization committed to government transparency, is represented by private counsel Elizabeth Haddix and David Kronig.\n\nThe case arises from eight FOIA requests submitted by American Oversight starting January 30, 2025, seeking records involving Elon Musk and key staff of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Two requests sought expedited processing for records related to President Trump's January 24, 2025 removal of inspectors general from seventeen federal agencies. Additional requests sought pre-inauguration communications between the former U.S. Digital Service and the then-nascent DOGE, as well as post-inauguration records including Musk's calendars, employment records, external communications, and DOGE staffing information.\n\nThe central legal dispute concerns whether DOGE qualifies as an \"agency\" subject to FOIA disclosure requirements. DOGE was created by executive order on January 20, 2025, after President-elect Trump announced in November 2024 that Elon Musk would head the department. The executive order renamed the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. DOGE Service and created a temporary organization within it dedicated to advancing the \"18-month DOGE agenda.\" Trump issued subsequent executive orders in February 2025 expanding DOGE's authority over workforce optimization and cost efficiency initiatives across the federal government.\n\nAmerican Oversight's complaint alleges that DOGE exercises substantial independent authority beyond merely advising the President, including deploying staff to at least fifteen executive branch agencies, gaining access to sensitive computer systems containing classified and personal financial information, directing agency operations and personnel actions, halting agency payments despite contrary orders from Cabinet secretaries, and emailing 2.3 million federal employees with directives threatening termination for non-response. The complaint further alleges that DOGE operates independently of the President and senior White House officials, with the White House often unaware of DOGE's activities until publicly announced.\n\nIn March 2025, DOGE refused American Oversight's FOIA requests, claiming it operates within the Executive Office of the President and is subject to the Presidential Records Act rather than FOIA. American Oversight argues that DOGE's actual operations demonstrate it wields substantial independent authority sufficient to qualify as an agency under FOIA's functional test, despite its formal organizational structure.\n\nThe case has involved several procedural motions, including defendants' successful motion for extension of time and American Oversight's successful motion for a preservation order. On April 2, 2025, Judge Howell granted the preservation order requiring DOGE to preserve all records responsive to the FOIA requests during litigation. The court noted concerns about DOGE's record-keeping practices, including use of encrypted messaging apps with auto-delete functions and the fact that many DOGE staffers recently joined the federal government and may not understand document retention obligations.\n\nOn May 23, 2025, the court issued a scheduling order for briefing on American Oversight's motion for limited discovery to determine whether DOGE exercises independent authority sufficient to be subject to FOIA. American Oversight filed its discovery motion on June 2, 2025, seeking interrogatories, document requests, and admissions regarding DOGE's actual structure, authority, and operations, arguing that contradictions between DOGE's formal structure and public reporting about its activities necessitate factual inquiry into whether it qualifies as an agency under the D.C. Circuit's functional test.\n\nThe case seeks declaratory and injunctive relief requiring defendants to grant expedited processing for two requests, conduct adequate searches for responsive records, and produce all non-exempt records responsive to American Oversight's eight FOIA requests, along with attorney's fees and costs.",
    "46023": "This case was filed on February 3, 2025, by three membership organizations—Alliance for Retired Americans, American Federation of Government Employees AFL-CIO, and Service Employees International Union AFL-CIO—against Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the Department of the Treasury, and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. The organizations are represented by attorneys from Public Citizen Litigation Group and State Democracy Defenders Fund, and the case is assigned to Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges the Treasury Department's decision to grant members of the so-called \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) Team access to Bureau of Fiscal Service payment systems containing sensitive personal and financial information of millions of Americans, including Social Security recipients, federal workers, and taxpayers. The DOGE initiative was established by President Trump through Executive Order 14158 on January 20, 2025, purportedly to modernize federal technology and improve government efficiency.\n\nPlaintiffs' three causes of action are brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging that defendants acted contrary to law, arbitrarily and capriciously, and in excess of their statutory authority. The underlying legal violations alleged involve the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a) and the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. § 6103), both of which restrict agencies' ability to disclose personal information without following specific procedures. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the allegedly unlawful access to personal information.\n\nThe Treasury DOGE Team initially consisted of Thomas Krause and Marko Elez, who were given broad access to multiple Bureau systems containing personal data. Elez resigned on February 6, 2025, after disputes arose about the scope of access. The factual record shows that the Bureau recognized this access was \"broader in scope than what has occurred in the past\" and presented various risks, including \"insider threat risk.\"\n\nPlaintiffs initially moved for a temporary restraining order on February 5, 2025, which was converted to a motion for preliminary injunction. After a hearing on February 24, 2025, Judge Kollar-Kotelly denied the preliminary injunction motion on March 7, 2025, concluding that plaintiffs had not shown the likelihood of irreparable harm necessary under D.C. Circuit precedent, despite finding that plaintiffs had established standing. The court's decision is reported at 2025 WL 740401.\n\nThe case proceeded to dispositive motions, with defendants filing a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment on April 11, 2025, and plaintiffs filing a cross-motion for summary judgment on April 25, 2025. The parties completed briefing on May 23, 2025. The case is related to several other lawsuits challenging DOGE access to agency records in various federal district courts, with differing outcomes on similar privacy and procedural claims.",
    "46563": "**Martin Luther King, Jr. County v. Turner** was filed on May 2, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington before Judge Barbara J. Rothstein. The case began with eight cities and counties challenging new conditions imposed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Department of Transportation (DOT) on federal grants, but expanded significantly when an amended complaint filed May 21, 2025, added dozens of additional local government plaintiffs, ultimately including 31 cities, counties, and local housing and transportation agencies across multiple states.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenge approximately $4 billion in federal grants from HUD's Continuum of Care homelessness program and various DOT transportation programs administered through the Federal Transit Administration, Federal Highway Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, and Federal Railroad Administration. These grants support critical local services including homelessness assistance, public transit, airport operations, and transportation infrastructure.\n\nBeginning in March and April 2025, following President Trump's inauguration and issuance of several executive orders, the federal defendants began imposing new conditions on grant agreements that had been conditionally awarded in January 2025. The contested conditions require recipients to: certify they do not operate programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) that violate federal anti-discrimination laws; agree not to use funds to promote \"gender ideology\" or \"elective abortion\"; cooperate with federal immigration enforcement including ICE; verify immigration status using the SAVE system; and comply with \"all current Executive Orders.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs, represented by private counsel from Pacifica Law Group and various local government attorneys, assert these conditions violate the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine by allowing the Executive Branch to impose conditions not authorized by Congress, violate the Fifth Amendment's void-for-vagueness doctrine, violate the Tenth Amendment's anti-commandeering principle, and violate the Administrative Procedure Act as arbitrary and capricious agency action. They seek declaratory judgment that the conditions are unlawful and injunctive relief preventing their enforcement.\n\nDefendants, represented by attorneys from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, argued the case belongs in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act and that agency actions regarding grant conditions are committed to agency discretion under the APA.\n\nThe case proceeded on an emergency basis due to tight deadlines for signing grant agreements. On May 5, 2025, seven plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on May 7, 2025, Judge Rothstein granted the TRO, finding plaintiffs likely to succeed on their separation of powers and vagueness claims and would suffer irreparable harm without relief. The court extended preliminary relief through subsequent orders, granting a second TRO on May 23, 2025, for additional plaintiffs who had joined the case.\n\nFollowing briefing and a hearing on May 21, 2025, Judge Rothstein granted preliminary injunctions for all plaintiffs on June 3, 2025. The court found it had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act's sovereign immunity waiver, rejecting defendants' Tucker Act arguments, and concluded plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional and APA claims. The court found the new conditions exceeded statutory authority, violated separation of powers principles, and would cause irreparable harm to critical local services if enforced.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, defendants filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Case No. 25-3664), seeking to overturn the preliminary injunction. The case involves ongoing disputes over federal grant conditions affecting billions in funding for essential local government services nationwide.",
    "46028": "PFLAG, Inc., GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ+ Equality, and several individual transgender plaintiffs under age nineteen filed this lawsuit on February 4, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, challenging two Executive Orders issued by President Trump in January 2025. The case is assigned to Judge Brendan Abell Hurson.\n\nExecutive Order 14,168, titled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\" issued January 20, 2025, declared that federal funds \"shall not be used to promote gender ideology.\" Executive Order 14,187, titled \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" issued January 28, 2025, directed federal agencies to \"immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end\" gender-affirming medical care for people under nineteen years old.\n\nThe Executive Orders had immediate effects across the country. Hospitals that receive federal funding—including Children's National in Washington D.C., NYU Langone Health, Boston Children's Hospital, Denver Health, and others—abruptly ceased providing gender-affirming medical care to patients under nineteen to avoid losing federal funding. Federal agencies HRSA and CDC issued notices to grant recipients stating that grants conflicting with the Executive Orders were \"terminated in whole or in part.\" The White House celebrated these shutdowns as the \"intended effect\" of the Orders.\n\nThe individual plaintiffs include six transgender youth under nineteen and their parents who lost access to medically necessary care when hospitals stopped treatment in response to the Orders. PFLAG and GLMA brought associational claims on behalf of their members, including affected families and healthcare professionals whose institutions received federal funding.\n\nPlaintiffs brought three main claims: (1) the Executive Orders violate separation of powers by conditioning federal grants without congressional authorization, usurping Congress's power of the purse; (2) the Orders are ultra vires because they conflict with Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and Section 1908 of the Public Health Service Act, which prohibit sex discrimination by healthcare entities receiving federal funding; and (3) the Orders violate the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment by discriminating based on sex and transgender status.\n\nPlaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief and were represented by attorneys from the ACLU Foundation, Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the ACLU of Maryland, and Jenner & Block.\n\nOn February 5, 2025, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on February 13, 2025, Judge Hurson granted the TRO, finding plaintiffs likely to succeed on all three claims. In a February 14, 2025 memorandum opinion, the court held that the Constitution does not allow the President to \"enact, amend, or repeal statutes\" and that clearly established Fourth Circuit precedent in cases like Kadel v. Folwell compelled findings on the discrimination claims.\n\nOn February 18, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction. After briefing that included amicus support from eighteen states and opposition from twenty-three states, Judge Hurson granted a nationwide preliminary injunction on March 4, 2025. The court's March 4, 2025 memorandum opinion found plaintiffs likely to succeed on all claims, concluding the Orders violated separation of powers by placing \"significant conditions on federal funding that Congress did not prescribe\" and violated equal protection under binding Fourth Circuit precedent.\n\nThe preliminary injunction enjoined all agency defendants except President Trump from \"conditioning, withholding, or terminating federal funding under Section 3(g) of Executive Order 14,168 and Section 4 of Executive Order 14,187, based on the fact that a healthcare entity or health professional provides gender-affirming medical care to a patient under the age of nineteen.\" The order also prohibited defendants from taking \"any steps to implement, give effect to, or reinstate under a different name\" these directives.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to enforce the preliminary injunction, alleging defendants violated it by issuing new notices threatening to withhold funding. CMS issued a \"Quality and Safety Special Alert Memo\" titled \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" while HRSA and SAMHSA issued notices stating they would \"review policies, grants, and programs\" and \"may consider re-scoping, delaying, or potentially cancelling new grants.\" On March 28, 2025, Judge Hurson denied the enforcement motion without prejudice, finding plaintiffs had not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that defendants violated an unequivocal command.\n\nDefendants filed a notice of appeal on March 21, 2025, appealing the preliminary injunction to the Fourth Circuit. On April 9, 2025, the court granted a joint motion for a limited partial stay of case deadlines pending resolution of the appeal, while preserving plaintiffs' ability to seek additional relief or enforcement of the injunction during the appeal.\n\nThe case remains in preliminary stages with the preliminary injunction in effect nationwide, preventing federal agencies from conditioning funding based on the provision of gender-affirming medical care to patients under nineteen, while defendants' appeal proceeds in the Fourth Circuit.",
    "46306": "This case was filed on March 26, 2025, by eleven nonprofit legal service organizations that provide representation to unaccompanied immigrant children in immigration proceedings. The plaintiffs—Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, Social Justice Collaborative, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, Estrella del Paso, Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, National Immigrant Justice Center, Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, and Vermont Asylum Assistance Project—sued the United States Department of Health and Human Services, its Office of Refugee Resettlement, and the Department of the Interior. The organizations are represented by attorneys from Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, and Justice Action Center.\n\nThe case challenges the government's March 21, 2025 termination of funding for direct legal representation services for unaccompanied immigrant children. Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), HHS must \"ensure, to the greatest extent practicable,\" that unaccompanied children have counsel to protect them from \"mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.\" To implement this mandate, ORR's Foundational Rule requires the agency to \"fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation for certain unaccompanied children\" when appropriations are available. Congress has consistently appropriated funds for this purpose since 2012, including as recently as March 15, 2025, with funding available through September 2027.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, the Department of the Interior issued a \"Notice of Partial Termination for the Government's Convenience\" to Acacia Center for Justice, the prime contractor that distributed funding to legal service organizations. The notice terminated funding for direct representation services effective immediately and ordered providers to \"immediately stop work\" on active cases. This action affected approximately 26,000 unaccompanied children who were receiving legal representation through federally-funded programs.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging that the funding termination violates the TVPRA's statutory mandate and ORR's own regulations. They argued that despite available congressional appropriations, the government's action forces them to choose between providing unfunded representation (risking organizational survival) or abandoning vulnerable child clients in complex immigration proceedings.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. After a hearing on April 1, 2025, before Judge Araceli Martinez-Olguin, the court granted a temporary restraining order enjoining defendants from withdrawing funding for direct legal representation services. The government filed several motions in response, including a motion to dissolve the TRO (April 4, 2025) and a motion for recusal of the judge (April 9, 2025), both of which were denied. On April 10, 2025, the court extended the TRO until April 30, 2025.\n\nFollowing additional briefing, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction on April 29, 2025, continuing the prohibition on withdrawing funding for legal services. The court found that the TVPRA creates a statutory mandate for legal representation, that Congress has appropriated funds for this purpose, and that the government's termination of funding violates both the statute and ORR's implementing regulations.\n\nThe government appealed the preliminary injunction on April 30, 2025, to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Case No. 25-2808) and moved to stay the injunction pending appeal. On May 14, 2025, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit denied the government's motion for a stay, finding that the government had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm absent a stay. The court rejected the government's arguments that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act and that the funding decision was committed to unreviewable agency discretion. The preliminary injunction remains in effect while the appeal proceeds.",
    "45984": "This case was filed on January 28, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging President Donald Trump's Executive Order 14183, titled \"Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness,\" issued January 27, 2025. The plaintiffs are transgender active-duty service members and prospective enlistees who collectively have served over 130 years in the military with distinction, earning numerous commendations including Bronze Stars and other honors. The defendants include the United States, Secretary of Defense Peter Hegseth, and various military department officials and agencies. Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel working with civil rights organizations.\n\nThe case presents a constitutional challenge under the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection component. President Trump's Executive Order reversed the Biden administration's policy allowing transgender military service and directed implementation of policies declaring transgender status incompatible with military service standards. The Order incorporates definitions from Executive Order 14168 that define sex as fixed at birth, effectively excluding transgender recognition. On February 26, 2025, Secretary Hegseth issued implementing guidance that disqualifies individuals with current or historical gender dysphoria from military service, with extremely narrow waiver provisions that essentially exclude all transgender individuals.\n\nJudge Ana C. Reyes is presiding over the case. Plaintiffs filed motions for preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order in early February 2025. After extensive briefing and hearings on February 18-19 and March 12, 2025, Judge Reyes granted the preliminary injunction on March 18, 2025, finding plaintiffs likely to succeed on their equal protection claims. The court determined the military ban was based on conjecture rather than evidence, noting that defendants' own studies contradicted their conclusions about transgender service members' effectiveness. The injunction maintains the status quo that existed before the executive orders, allowing continued service by transgender military members.\n\nDefendants moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction on March 21, 2025, citing new guidance, but Judge Reyes denied this motion on March 26, 2025. The court stayed its injunction until March 28, 2025, to allow defendants time to file an emergency appeal. Defendants filed an emergency motion for stay pending appeal with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on March 27, 2025, which was denied the same day, allowing the preliminary injunction to take effect.\n\nThe factual basis involves extensive military service records of the plaintiffs, showing successful performance under existing transgender-inclusive policies implemented since 2021. The court found that defendants failed to provide evidence supporting their claims that transgender service members undermine military readiness, with their own studies showing comparable performance to other service members. The case involves significant procedural complexity with multiple amended complaints, numerous pro hac vice motions for out-of-state counsel, and ongoing compliance issues regarding implementation of court orders.",
    "46567": "On May 5, 2025, G.M.G., a Venezuelan asylum seeker, filed a petition for habeas corpus and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The case is before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose. G.M.G. is represented by ACLU attorneys and seeks to proceed under a pseudonym.\n\nThe case challenges President Trump's March 14, 2025 Proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 (AEA) to authorize the summary removal of Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a criminal gang. The Proclamation claims that TdA constitutes a \"foreign government\" engaged in an \"invasion\" of U.S. territory, thereby triggering the AEA's wartime authority. Under this authority, the government removed at least 137 Venezuelan men to a notorious prison in El Salvador on March 15, 2025, without judicial review or meaningful notice.\n\nG.M.G. is detained at the Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island and has pending asylum proceedings scheduled for May 15, 2025. He fled Venezuela due to persecution by state police based on his perceived political opposition. At a May 1, 2025 bond hearing, DHS argued he was associated with TdA and therefore ineligible for bond, despite G.M.G. having no criminal history. G.M.G. denies any gang association and fears persecution by TdA based on his Venezuelan experiences.\n\nThe petition raises multiple legal challenges under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the AEA itself, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Convention Against Torture. The petitioner argues the Proclamation exceeds presidential authority because: (1) TdA is not a \"foreign nation or government\" and its criminal activities do not constitute a military \"invasion\" or \"predatory incursion\" as required by the AEA; (2) the government provides inadequate notice (as little as 12 hours before removal) and no meaningful opportunity to challenge alien enemy designations; and (3) the process bypasses congressional immigration protections, including safeguards against torture.\n\nThis case is part of nationwide litigation challenging the Proclamation. A D.C. district court initially issued a nationwide temporary restraining order, which the D.C. Circuit upheld, but the Supreme Court vacated it 5-4 on April 7, 2025, in Trump v. J.G.G. However, the Supreme Court emphasized that individuals designated under the AEA are entitled to due process and notice \"within a reasonable time\" that allows them to \"actually seek habeas relief\" before removal. Multiple federal judges have subsequently found the Proclamation likely unlawful, including in J.A.V. v. Trump (S.D. Tex.), D.B.U. v. Trump (D. Colo.), and G.F.F. v. Trump (S.D.N.Y.).\n\nG.M.G. filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order on May 5, 2025, seeking to prevent his transfer outside Rhode Island and his removal under the Proclamation. On the same day, Judge DuBose entered an order requiring 48 hours' advance notice before moving the petitioner outside the district. Following a May 7, 2025 hearing, the court amended this to require 72 hours' advance notice on business days. The government has appeared through the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Rhode Island.\n\nThe petitioner seeks habeas corpus relief, declaratory judgment that the Proclamation is unlawful, and injunctive relief preventing his removal under the Proclamation. He does not contest his immigration detention or removal proceedings under standard immigration law, but argues the AEA process violates due process and exceeds statutory authority.",
    "46582": "Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian woman, filed this habeas corpus petition on April 30, 2025, in the Northern District of Texas challenging her immigration detention. The case is assigned to Judge Sam A. Lindsay, with Magistrate Judge Rebecca Rutherford handling preliminary matters. Kordia is represented by multiple legal organizations including Waters Kraus Paul & Siegel, Texas Civil Rights Project, Southern Poverty Law Center, CUNY School of Law, and Muslim Advocates. The respondents include DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, Acting ICE Dallas Field Office Director Josh Johnson, and Prairieland Detention Facility Warden Thomas Bergami.\n\nKordia lawfully entered the United States in March 2016 on a tourist visa and adjusted to F-1 student status in 2017, studying English for seven years. Her mother filed an approved family-based visa petition on her behalf in 2021. In 2022, acting on incorrect advice from a teacher, Kordia withdrew from her student program believing she had lawful status while awaiting adjustment to permanent residence. Since October 2023, she has lost over 100 family members in Gaza.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on the Trump administration's targeted enforcement against noncitizens engaged in Palestinian rights advocacy. In April 2024, while mourning her lost family members, Kordia attended a peaceful Palestinian rights demonstration near Columbia University. Police arrested her along with dozens of others, but prosecutors quickly dismissed the charges. Following President Trump's January 2025 executive orders targeting alleged \"antisemitic\" activity and \"Hamas sympathizers,\" federal agents began investigating noncitizens who had participated in Palestinian rights protests. The government's campaign resulted in arrests and deportations of several students and activists, including Mahmoud Khalil, Ranjani Srinivasan, Dr. Badar Khan Suri, and others.\n\nIn March 2025, HSI agents investigated Kordia, interviewing family members and neighbors, reviewing her financial records, and discovering only a single $1,000 wire transfer to a Palestinian family member in 2022. On March 13, 2025, Kordia voluntarily met with immigration officers accompanied by counsel. Despite a Risk Classification Assessment rating her as low risk across all factors, ICE detained her and immediately transferred her overnight to Prairieland Detention Facility in Alvarado, Texas, over 1,500 miles from her New Jersey home and family.\n\nOn April 3, 2025, an immigration judge granted Kordia a $20,000 bond, finding she was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community. DHS immediately filed an automatic stay appeal, preventing her release despite her family posting the bond. The stay provision allows DHS to keep individuals confined for up to 130 days without any procedural review of the confinement decision.\n\nKordia brings claims under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 for habeas corpus relief, alleging violations of the First Amendment (retaliation for protected speech and association), Fifth Amendment procedural due process (inadequate procedures for continued detention), and Fifth Amendment substantive due process (lack of justification for confinement). She also brings claims under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c)) against the warden and field office director for substantially burdening her religious exercise. Despite being a practicing Muslim who wears hijab, prays five times daily, and maintains a halal diet, the facility has provided only kosher meals while claiming they are halal, and has failed to provide proper prayer materials, appropriate clothing, or prayer times. As a result, she has lost approximately 30% of her body weight, dropping from 170 to 121 pounds, and has fainted from malnutrition.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Kordia filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking release pending final judgment. After a hearing on June 5, 2025, Magistrate Judge Rutherford issued findings and recommendations on June 27, 2025, recommending that the district court grant the motion and order Kordia's immediate release from detention. Both parties filed objections on July 7, 2025, and responses on July 10, 2025. On July 16, 2025, Judge Lindsay recommitted the matter to the magistrate judge to address new issues raised in the parties' objections, noting that developments in Kordia's immigration proceedings had occurred after the initial recommendation. The court also issued an order to show cause on June 27, 2025, requiring respondents to file an answer within sixty days, with reply briefs due thirty days thereafter.",
    "46432": "On April 18, 2025, Mohammed H., a 20-year-old Bangladeshi national studying at Minnesota State University, Mankato, filed a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. The student was represented by private counsel from Fredrikson & Byron, the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, The Advocates for Human Rights, and the University of Minnesota Detainee Rights Clinic. The respondents included President Donald J. Trump, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, various Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and local jail officials.\n\nThe petitioner alleged that federal agencies detained him in retaliation for his protected speech supporting Palestinian human rights, violating his First Amendment free speech rights and Fifth Amendment due process rights. He also claimed violations of the Administrative Procedure Act related to the improper termination of his student status record. The student had lawfully entered the United States in 2021 on an F-1 student visa and was in good academic standing until his arrest on March 28, 2025. Department of Homeland Security officers arrested him outside his home, purportedly based on a visa revocation, and terminated his record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System database.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, an Immigration Judge found that the petitioner posed no danger to the community and ordered his release on a $7,500 bond. However, DHS appealed and invoked an automatic stay under federal regulations, blocking his release. The petitioner claimed this was part of a broader federal campaign targeting international students who expressed pro-Palestinian views, pointing to executive orders and public statements from federal officials as evidence of retaliatory intent.\n\nJudge Jerry W. Blackwell granted the petitioner's motion for a temporary restraining order on April 22, 2025, preventing the government from removing or transferring the student from the District of Minnesota. The government filed its response on April 25, 2025, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction and that the petitioner's claims failed on the merits. After reviewing written submissions without an evidentiary hearing, the court granted the petitioner's request for release on bail pending adjudication on May 5, 2025, finding substantial constitutional claims and exceptional circumstances under the Martin v. Solem standard for interim release in habeas cases.\n\nThe court extended the temporary restraining order multiple times while the case remained under review. On June 17, 2025, Judge Blackwell granted the habeas petition in its entirety, finding that the petitioner's detention violated the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and Administrative Procedure Act. The court determined that the government had targeted the student for his protected political speech, that his continued detention lacked proper justification and violated due process, and that the termination of his student status was arbitrary and not in accordance with federal regulations. The court ordered that the petitioner remain released from custody subject to the Immigration Judge's bond conditions.\n\nThe government filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on July 29, 2025, and the case was assigned circuit case number 25-2516. The case is notable as one of several similar challenges in the district involving international students allegedly targeted for pro-Palestinian speech, with the court referencing related cases such as Ziliang J. v. Noem and Ratsantiboon v. Noem that received similar emergency relief.",
    "46230": "This case was filed on March 14, 2025, by twelve federal employees who worked in the Department of Veterans Affairs' Office of Equity Assurance (OEA). The plaintiffs, proceeding under pseudonyms Jane Doe 1-6 and John Doe 7-12, sued Douglas A. Collins, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, represented by private counsel David A. Branch. Judge Rudolph Contreras presided over the case after it was initially assigned to Judge Beryl A. Howell and then reassigned through the random assignment process.\n\nThe plaintiffs were nonpartisan career civil servants with six to twenty-four years of federal service, including disabled veterans, cancer survivors, and other employees facing personal hardships. The OEA, established in 2023, was tasked with identifying disparities in veterans' access to benefits and developing solutions to ensure equity. Their work included addressing challenges faced by rural veterans in accessing benefits due to geographic barriers, researching disparities in benefit granting based on race as identified in a Government Accountability Office report, conducting pulmonary function test studies to ensure medically sound results across veteran populations, and participating in the Toxic Exposure Working Group created under the PACT Act. One plaintiff worked on interagency projects with the Department of Defense and Department of Labor on toxic exposure issues affecting veterans.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14151, \"Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,\" which described DEI and DEIA programs as \"illegal and immoral.\" On January 22, 2025, Acting VA Secretary Todd B. Hunter sent an agency-wide email announcing the closure of all DEIA offices, stating that \"these programs divided Americans by race, wasted taxpayer dollars, and resulted in shameful discrimination.\" That same day, all twenty-seven OEA employees were placed on administrative leave and lost access to their government email accounts and computer networks.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management issued guidance on January 24, 2025, directing agencies to terminate all DEIA offices and positions within sixty days through reduction-in-force (RIF) procedures, with competitive areas limited to the specific DEIA offices where employees worked. On January 27, 2025, the VA issued a press release stating it had placed nearly sixty employees \"solely focused on diversity, equity and inclusion activities\" on administrative leave, with combined salaries totaling over $8 million.\n\nThe plaintiffs were initially terminated through a specific RIF notice on February 14, 2025, but this termination was rescinded on February 27, 2025, and they were returned to administrative leave status. However, they remained blocked from accessing VA systems and were unable to apply for internal positions or accept reassignments. VA management had initially developed plans to reassign the OEA employees to vacant positions within the agency, but OPM rejected these reassignment efforts and required terminations instead. On March 13, 2025, the plaintiffs received final RIF notices with termination effective May 10, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging the agency's designation of OEA as a DEIA office was arbitrary and capricious. They also asserted constitutional claims under the First Amendment, arguing they were targeted based on perceived political viewpoints and associational activities, and under the Fifth Amendment, claiming violations of due process and equal protection. They noted that the VA's companion Office of Health Equity was not designated as a DEIA office or subjected to closure. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, compensatory damages, and attorney's fees.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order, seeking to prevent their designation as DEIA employees and restore their access to agency systems and benefits. After briefing and a hearing on May 2, 2025, Judge Contreras denied the motion for reasons stated on the record. The court also rejected the plaintiffs' initial claim that the case was related to Perkins Coie LLP v. U.S. Department of Justice, finding the cases involved different executive orders and unrelated factual circumstances.\n\nOn July 17, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice, ending the case. The dismissal occurred before any ruling on the merits of the underlying constitutional and administrative law claims.",
    "46681": "Gary L. Barnes, a citizen from Green Bay, Wisconsin, filed this lawsuit pro se on February 3, 2025, in the U.S. Court of International Trade, challenging the constitutionality of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The case was assigned to Judge Jennifer Choe-Groves and proceeded under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i), which grants the court exclusive jurisdiction over tariff-related matters.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from President Trump's February 1, 2025 executive orders imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico (25%), Canada (25% on most products, 10% on energy), and China (10%). These tariffs were imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) following Trump's declaration of national emergencies related to the flow of illicit drugs and illegal immigration across U.S. borders. The tariff rates and coverage were subsequently modified multiple times through additional executive orders.\n\nBarnes argued that the tariffs violated the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine, specifically Article I, Sections 7 and 8, which grant Congress—not the President—the exclusive power to impose tariffs and raise revenue. He contended that various statutes purporting to delegate this authority to the President, including the Tariff Act of 1930, Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and Trade Act of 1974, were themselves unconstitutional. Barnes claimed the tariffs would harm him economically as a retiree living on a small pension and Social Security, as businesses would pass the costs onto consumers through higher prices. He sought declaratory relief finding the tariffs unconstitutional and both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to halt their collection.\n\nThe United States, represented by Department of Justice attorneys, filed a motion to dismiss on March 21, 2025, arguing that Barnes lacked both Article III standing and prudential standing to bring the lawsuit. The government contended that Barnes had not suffered a concrete, particularized injury traceable to the tariffs, and that importers who actually pay the tariffs would be better suited to challenge them.\n\nBarnes responded on April 22, 2025, arguing that his injury consisted of a \"breach of the Constitutional Contract\" and that latitude should be given in standing requirements for constitutional challenges. He explicitly stated that \"[t]he payment of additional duties is not relevant to this action.\" The government replied on May 9, 2025, noting that other importers had already filed similar constitutional challenges to the same tariffs, demonstrating that those directly affected could bring suit.\n\nOn May 23, 2025, Judge Choe-Groves granted the government's motion to dismiss in a published opinion (Slip Op. 25-65). The court found that Barnes lacked Article III standing because he failed to establish an injury-in-fact. The court determined that Barnes's claimed injury based on alleged violation of the \"Constitutional Contract\" was an abstract grievance shared by all citizens, which the Supreme Court has held cannot support standing. Additionally, his claimed economic injury as a consumer was too speculative and not sufficiently particularized, as he alleged the tariffs would harm \"all United States citizens.\" The court dismissed the case without prejudice and allowed Barnes until June 23, 2025, to file an amended complaint addressing the pleading deficiencies, with the case to be closed if no amended complaint was filed by that deadline. The docket indicates Barnes filed additional papers on June 19, 2025, and the case continued with further proceedings through August 2025.",
    "46758": "This case was filed on June 20, 2025, in the Central District of California as a habeas corpus petition and civil rights lawsuit challenging federal immigration enforcement practices. The petitioners and plaintiffs include five individual immigrants (Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Carlos Alexander Osorto, Isaac Antonio Villegas Molina, Jorge Luis Hernandez Viramontes, and Jason Brian Gavidia) along with four organizational plaintiffs: United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Los Angeles Worker Center Network, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center. The case is brought as a putative class action against twelve senior federal officials, including DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and various Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officials. The plaintiffs are represented by legal services organizations and civil rights attorneys.\n\nThe case challenges \"Operation At Large,\" a large-scale federal immigration enforcement operation that began on June 6, 2025, in Los Angeles. Federal agents deployed \"contact teams\" (described by plaintiffs as \"roving patrols\") consisting of three to five agents who conducted stops in public places such as streets, sidewalks, carwashes, and businesses. The plaintiffs allege these stops violated the Fourth Amendment by detaining individuals without reasonable suspicion, relying solely on factors such as apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at particular locations, and type of work performed.\n\nThe individual plaintiffs describe being stopped under circumstances they claim lacked reasonable suspicion. Jason Brian Gavidia, a U.S. citizen, was stopped outside a tow yard where he works on cars, physically restrained against a fence, and had his identification confiscated. Jorge Luis Hernandez Viramontes, a dual U.S.-Mexico citizen and carwash manager, was detained at his workplace and transported to a warehouse despite having identification. Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Carlos Osorto, and Isaac Villegas Molina were arrested while waiting for work at a Pasadena bus stop by masked agents with military-style weapons who emerged from unmarked vehicles. The agents never identified themselves as law enforcement or stated the basis for the arrests.\n\nPlaintiffs filed applications for temporary restraining orders on July 2 and July 3, 2025, seeking to enjoin the challenged practices. After expedited briefing and a hearing on July 10, 2025, District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong granted the TRO on July 11, 2025. The TRO prohibits defendants from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion and specifically bars reliance solely on the four enumerated factors (race/ethnicity, language, location, and type of work) to establish reasonable suspicion for stops in the Central District of California.\n\nDefendants immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (case no. 25-4312) and sought emergency stays. On August 1, 2025, a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel largely upheld the TRO after oral argument, finding that plaintiffs had standing and were likely to succeed on their Fourth Amendment claims. The court concluded that the four factors, even in combination, describe only a \"broad profile\" insufficient to support reasonable suspicion in an area where 47% of the population identifies as Hispanic or Latino. The Ninth Circuit granted defendants' stay motion only as to a single \"except as permitted by law\" clause that it found impermissibly vague.\n\nSeparately, on July 21, 2025, petitioner Carlos Osorto filed an ex parte application for release from immigration custody pending adjudication of his habeas petition. After briefing and a telephonic conference, Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym granted the application on July 30, 2025, ordering Osorto's release on $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, finding extraordinary circumstances warranted release due to the government's inconsistent positions on his bond eligibility and his serious health issues.\n\nThe case remains active with motions for preliminary injunction set for hearing on September 24, 2025, along with motions for class certification and additional claims regarding conditions of confinement and denial of counsel access at a federal detention facility in downtown Los Angeles. Various local government entities, including the City and County of Los Angeles, have intervened in support of the plaintiffs' position.",
    "46378": "On April 10, 2025, four international students filed suit against federal immigration officials after the Department of Homeland Security terminated their records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a database used to track F-1 student visa holders. The students—Chinmay Deore, Yogesh Joshi, Xiangyun Bu, and Qiuyi Yang—were enrolled at Wayne State University and the University of Michigan when DHS terminated their SEVIS records between April 4-8, 2025, citing boilerplate reasons about individuals being \"identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.\"\n\nThe students were represented by ACLU Fund of Michigan attorneys and cooperating counsel. They sued Kristi Noem (Secretary of DHS), Todd Lyons (Acting Director of ICE), and Robert Lynch (Detroit ICE Field Office Director) in their official capacities. The students immediately filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.\n\nThe legal claims were based on alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the Administrative Procedure Act. The students argued that DHS terminated their F-1 student status without providing notice, adequate explanation, or meaningful opportunity to respond. They claimed this was arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law under the APA, specifically arguing that 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d) limits DHS's authority to terminate F-1 status to specific circumstances not present in their cases.\n\nThe students sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring DHS to restore their F-1 student status in SEVIS, set aside the termination decisions, and prohibit arrests or removal proceedings based on the terminations. They also requested prohibition of any future terminations without proper procedural safeguards.\n\nThe case presented a novel legal question about the relationship between SEVIS database records and actual F-1 immigration status. According to government declarations, the students had various minor criminal or immigration encounters: Deore and Joshi had arrests for assault (with unknown dispositions), Bu had been found inadmissible at a port of entry in 2022, and Yang had been arrested for fourth-degree assault with domestic violence enhancement (case dismissed). Additionally, Yang and Joshi's visas were prudentially revoked by the State Department.\n\nHowever, the government argued that SEVIS termination does not automatically terminate F-1 status, stating through declaration of Andre Watson (Assistant Director of ICE's National Security Division) that \"terminating a record in SEVIS does not terminate an individual's nonimmigrant status\" and that SEVP \"has never claimed that it had terminated the nonimmigrant status\" of these students. The government represented it had no basis to initiate removal proceedings.\n\nJudge Stephen J. Murphy III denied the temporary restraining order on April 17, 2025, finding that the students had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. The court determined it could not ascertain from the limited record whether SEVIS record termination necessarily reflects F-1 status termination or carries independent legal consequences. The judge found the students had not shown irreparable harm, noting the government's representations that they could continue their studies and were not facing removal. The court scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing for May 19, 2025, with discovery and briefing deadlines.\n\nThe case was ultimately resolved when the parties filed a stipulated order of dismissal on May 29, 2025, before the preliminary injunction hearing could occur. The dismissal order provided no details about the terms of resolution. The case highlighted nationwide concerns about mass terminations of international student records, with similar lawsuits filed in multiple federal districts during the same time period.",
    "46337": "On April 3, 2025, nineteen states filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts challenging Executive Order 14248, \"Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,\" issued by President Donald J. Trump on March 25, 2025. The states, represented by their attorneys general, sued President Trump, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, and its commissioners in their official capacities. Judge Denise J. Casper was assigned to the case.\n\nThe states challenged the Executive Order as ultra vires and violating separation of powers principles under the Elections Clause (Article I, Section 4) and Electors Clause (Article II, Section 1) of the Constitution. They sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against specific provisions of the Executive Order. The factual basis centered on the President's attempt to unilaterally modify federal election procedures without congressional authorization.\n\nThe Executive Order directed the Election Assistance Commission to require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship for the federal voter registration form within 30 days, commanded voter registration agencies to assess citizenship before providing forms to public assistance enrollees, ordered the Secretary of Defense to update military/overseas voter registration to require citizenship documentation, directed the Attorney General to enforce federal Election Day statutes against states counting ballots received after Election Day, and threatened to withhold federal election funding from non-compliant states.\n\nThe states argued these provisions conflicted with existing federal statutes including the National Voter Registration Act, the Help America Vote Act, and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, which Congress had crafted to enhance voter participation through simplified registration procedures. Thirteen \"Ballot Receipt States\" (California, Nevada, Massachusetts, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Rhode Island) specifically challenged provisions targeting their laws allowing ballot counting after Election Day under certain circumstances.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, the states moved for preliminary injunction. After a hearing on June 6, 2025, Judge Casper granted the preliminary injunction on June 13, 2025, finding the states likely to succeed on their separation of powers claims. The court ruled that the President lacked constitutional authority to direct the independent Election Assistance Commission's actions, commandeer state election agencies, or condition federal funding on compliance with requirements not authorized by Congress. The court found the Executive Order's requirements would impose significant costs on states, potentially disenfranchise eligible voters, and disrupt established election procedures.\n\nThe preliminary injunction, amended on July 18, 2025, prohibited defendants from implementing the documentary proof of citizenship requirements, the citizenship assessment mandate for public assistance agencies, modifications to military voter registration, civil or criminal enforcement actions regarding ballot receipt deadlines against the Ballot Receipt States, and the conditioning of federal funds on Election Day ballot receipt requirements. No bond was required.\n\nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss on June 13, 2025, and noticed an appeal of the preliminary injunction to the First Circuit Court of Appeals on July 31, 2025 (Case No. 25-1726). The case involves related litigation in the D.C. District Court brought by private parties challenging overlapping provisions of the same Executive Order, though the D.C. court found those parties lacked standing to challenge the ballot receipt provisions that the state plaintiffs successfully challenged here.",
    "46095": "On February 7, 2025, the National Institutes of Health issued Supplemental Guidance (NOT-OD-25-068) drastically cutting indirect cost rates for biomedical research grants from individually negotiated rates (averaging 27-28%) to a uniform 15% cap, effective February 10, 2025. The guidance applied retroactively to all existing grants and prospectively to future grants, impacting thousands of grants totaling billions of dollars across all 50 states.\n\nOn February 10, 2025, three groups of plaintiffs filed emergency lawsuits in the District of Massachusetts seeking injunctive relief. The plaintiffs included 22 attorneys general representing their states, five medical associations led by the Association of American Medical Colleges, and 17 universities and educational associations including the Association of American Universities, American Council on Education, and individual institutions like MIT, Johns Hopkins, and Brown University. The defendants were the NIH, Department of Health and Human Services, and their acting directors. Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from Jenner & Block and Clement & Murphy, while defendants were represented by the Department of Justice.\n\nJudge Angel Kelley consolidated the three related cases and initially granted a nationwide temporary restraining order. The court rejected defendants' argument that the Tucker Act divested it of jurisdiction, finding that plaintiffs sought equitable rather than monetary relief and that their claims were based on federal statutes and regulations rather than contract terms.\n\nThe court found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on multiple claims. First, the Rate Change Notice violated 45 C.F.R. § 75.414, which requires agencies to implement publicly available policies and procedures before deviating from negotiated rates, and limits such deviations to \"a class of Federal awards\" rather than all awards. Second, the guidance violated Section 224 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024, an appropriations rider Congress enacted in 2018 specifically to prevent NIH from modifying its approach to indirect cost rates after a similar proposal in 2017. The rider prohibits spending appropriated funds to \"develop or implement a modified approach\" to indirect cost provisions. Third, the guidance was arbitrary and capricious under the APA because it provided only conclusory reasoning, failed to consider substantial reliance interests of institutions that had negotiated multi-year rate agreements, and ignored the impact on ongoing clinical trials and research. Fourth, the guidance was promulgated without required notice-and-comment rulemaking, as HHS had voluntarily waived the APA's grant exception in 1971. Fifth, the retroactive application to existing grants exceeded NIH's statutory authority.\n\nThe court found irreparable harm in the immediate suspension of clinical trials putting patients' lives at risk, the need to euthanize research animals, and the loss of research infrastructure and personnel that could not be easily replaced. After full briefing and a hearing on February 21, 2025, the court granted a nationwide preliminary injunction on March 5, 2025, finding all preliminary injunction factors satisfied.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, by joint motion of the parties, the court converted the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction and entered final judgment for plaintiffs, also vacating the Rate Change Notice in its entirety under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). Defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit on April 8, 2025 (Case No. 25-1345).",
    "46239": "Erie County, New York filed this lawsuit on March 17, 2025, against the Corporation for National and Community Service (AmeriCorps) and its interim agency head Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, represented by the private law firm Gerstein Harrow LLP. The case was assigned to Chief Judge James E. Boasberg in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nThe dispute arose from Erie County's participation in AmeriCorps' Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), which provides federal funding for senior volunteer services like Meals on Wheels. In October 2023, Erie County applied for a three-year RSVP grant totaling approximately $250,000 and was awarded the grant in January 2024. Erie County's application included language about promoting diversity and recruiting diverse advisory council members, which complied with longstanding AmeriCorps regulations requiring grantees to establish advisory councils \"of a diverse composition that reflects the demographics of the service area.\"\n\nFollowing President Trump's Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 in January 2025, which directed federal agencies to eliminate DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs, AmeriCorps conducted a compliance review of existing grants. On February 14, 2025, AmeriCorps notified Erie County that language in its grant application containing terms like \"diversity,\" \"equity,\" and \"DEI\" required clarification. AmeriCorps gave Erie County three options: certify that the program \"does not include any activities that promote DEI activities,\" amend the grant to remove non-compliant language, or relinquish the award.\n\nErie County filed two counts: a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act alleging AmeriCorps' actions were arbitrary and capricious because they contradicted the agency's own regulations requiring diversity efforts, and a violation of the Constitution's Spending Clause alleging the certification requirements were impermissibly vague. Erie County sought injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent AmeriCorps from imposing certification requirements beyond those authorized by existing regulations.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, Erie County filed a motion for preliminary injunction, arguing it faced irreparable harm because it could not honestly certify compliance with anti-DEI requirements while simultaneously complying with existing regulations mandating diversity efforts. The motion requested that AmeriCorps be ordered to determine Erie County was in compliance with existing grant requirements without requiring the disputed certification.\n\nThe government filed an opposition on April 4, 2025, arguing that Erie County had not demonstrated imminent irreparable harm, that the court lacked jurisdiction because this was essentially a contract dispute, that the claims were not ripe since no final adverse action had been taken, and that Erie County was unlikely to succeed on the merits.\n\nThe case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on April 14, 2025, when Erie County filed a notice stating that \"Defendant has changed its certification requirements since the filing of this suit.\" The preliminary injunction motion was withdrawn as moot. The case's connection to a related nationwide challenge to the executive orders in National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education v. Trump in the District of Maryland, which was preliminarily enjoined and then stayed by the Fourth Circuit, likely influenced the procedural developments that led to the voluntary dismissal.",
    "46353": "On April 7, 2025, a software engineer proceeding under the pseudonym John Doe filed suit in the Northern District of California against President Donald J. Trump, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons, and ICE San Francisco Acting Field Office Director Moises Becerra. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel from Van Der Hout LLP, challenged the unlawful termination of his record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). Judge Jeffrey S. White was assigned to the case.\n\nThe case arose from the government's abrupt termination of plaintiff's SEVIS record on March 28, 2025. Plaintiff, a national of a predominantly Muslim country, was working in California pursuant to post-graduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Optional Practical Training (OPT) employment authorization under his F-1 student status. ICE terminated his SEVIS record, marking him as \"Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status\" and citing that he had been \"identified in criminal records check,\" referencing Immigration and Nationality Act section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) for failure to maintain status.\n\nPlaintiff's only criminal history consisted of a minor misdemeanor conviction for which he received probation. This conviction was not for a crime of violence, did not carry a potential sentence of more than one year, and did not render him inadmissible or deportable. Importantly, DHS had known about this conviction for months and had twice approved immigration benefits applications for plaintiff after learning of it.\n\nThe SEVIS termination was part of what appeared to be a broader policy targeting hundreds, if not more, F-1 students nationwide, particularly those from African, Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim, and Asian backgrounds. Many affected students had their F-1 visas revoked by the State Department and received communications suggesting they should \"self-deport\" using the CBP Home app. Some students were arrested and transferred to detention facilities in Louisiana and Texas, often far from their homes and communities.\n\nPlaintiff brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act alleging the SEVIS termination was arbitrary, capricious, and exceeded statutory authority, as well as Fifth Amendment due process claims for lack of notice and opportunity to respond. He sought declaratory judgment that the termination was unlawful, restoration of his SEVIS record, and injunctive relief preventing enforcement action against him.\n\nOn April 16, 2025, plaintiff filed a motion for temporary restraining order. Judge White granted the TRO on April 17, 2025, and extended it on April 25, 2025, after a hearing where the government indicated it was beginning to reactivate SEVIS records. The court consolidated approximately eight or nine related cases involving similar challenges by other international students.\n\nFollowing the initial hearing, the government filed a statement on April 25, 2025, indicating that ICE was developing a new policy framework for SEVIS record terminations and that affected students' records would remain active or be reactivated until the new policy was implemented. The government stated it retained authority to terminate SEVIS records for other lawful reasons but would not act under the challenged policy.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, Judge White granted motions for preliminary injunction in the consolidated cases. The government appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on July 21, 2025 (Case No. 25-4514), and filed a motion to stay pending appeal. On August 22, 2025, Judge White granted the motion to stay in part and denied it in part, allowing some aspects of the preliminary injunction to remain in effect during the appeal.\n\nThe case highlighted tensions between immigration enforcement and due process rights for international students, particularly regarding the relationship between SEVIS database entries and actual F-1 immigration status, and whether administrative actions affecting student status require notice and opportunity to respond before implementation.",
    "46238": "On March 17, 2025, Master Sergeant Logan Ireland and Staff Sergeant Nicholas Bear Bade, two transgender men serving in the United States Air Force, filed suit in the District of New Jersey challenging President Trump's ban on transgender military service. The plaintiffs were represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and private counsel.\n\nThe case challenged two Executive Orders: Executive Order 14183 (\"Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness\") issued January 27, 2025, which banned transgender individuals from military service, and Executive Order 14168 (\"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism\") issued January 20, 2025, which defined sex as \"immutable biological classification\" and required all federal policies to use this definition. The orders were implemented through subsequent Department of Defense and Air Force memoranda issued between January and March 2025.\n\nBoth plaintiffs had exemplary military records. Master Sergeant Ireland served over fourteen years with multiple overseas deployments to Afghanistan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates, earning four Air Force Commendation Medals and other honors. Staff Sergeant Bade served six years including deployment to Kuwait, receiving various awards including the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal. Both had medically transitioned and were serving openly as transgender men when the policy changed.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection and Due Process clauses, arguing that the ban discriminated based on sex and transgender status without adequate justification and was motivated by animus. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the ban against them and more broadly.\n\nFollowing the policy change, both plaintiffs were immediately placed on administrative absence and removed from their assignments—Ireland from training at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst and Bade from deployment in Kuwait. They faced imminent involuntary administrative separation proceedings that could begin as early as March 26, 2025.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order. Judge Christine P. O'Hearn issued an Order to Show Cause, scheduling a hearing for March 24, 2025. The case proceeded alongside parallel litigation in Talbott v. United States in the D.C. District Court, which had resulted in a nationwide preliminary injunction against the same policies.\n\nAfter a hearing on March 24, 2025, Judge O'Hearn granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, finding that the plaintiffs demonstrated likelihood of success on their equal protection claims, irreparable harm from forced separation and reputational damage, and that the balance of equities favored relief. The court applied intermediate scrutiny, concluding the orders classified based on sex and transgender status, and found defendants failed to provide adequate justification for the differential treatment.\n\nThe defendants, led by the Department of Justice, opposed the motion arguing for military deference and that any separation proceedings provided adequate procedural protections. They also sought a brief stay of the TRO to coordinate with parallel cases, which Judge O'Hearn denied on March 26, 2025.\n\nThe case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on May 15, 2025, likely due to developments in the broader litigation challenging the transgender military service ban.",
    "46234": "On March 15, 2025, three plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York challenging two executive orders issued by President Trump. The plaintiffs were Momodou Taal, a non-citizen PhD student from the United Kingdom and Gambia studying at Cornell University; Mũkoma Wa Ngũgĩ, a U.S. citizen and Cornell professor; and Sriram Parasurama, a U.S. citizen and Cornell PhD student. The defendants included President Trump, the Department of Homeland Security, and Secretary Kristi Noem, with additional defendants added in an amended complaint filed March 27, 2025.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Elizabeth C. Coombe. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel and attorneys from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and other legal organizations.\n\nThe lawsuit challenged Executive Order 14161, \"Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,\" issued January 30, 2025, and Executive Order 14188, \"Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism,\" issued February 3, 2025. The plaintiffs alleged these orders violated their First Amendment rights to free speech, to receive information, and to free association, as well as Fifth Amendment due process rights.\n\nThe factual basis centered on the government's enforcement of these orders against non-citizens who engaged in pro-Palestinian advocacy or criticism of U.S. foreign policy. Mr. Taal had been an outspoken critic of U.S. support for Israel and had participated in campus protests supporting Palestinian rights. The State Department revoked his student visa on March 14, 2025, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement attempted to detain him for removal proceedings. The government acknowledged that Mr. Taal's \"involvement in certain protests at Cornell University\" aligned with the executive orders' focus on deporting individuals who perpetuate \"unlawful anti-Semitic harassment,\" even though he faced no criminal charges and Cornell found no evidence of violence or antisemitic behavior.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing the executive orders were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, constituted viewpoint-based discrimination, and chilled protected speech. They filed multiple emergency motions for temporary restraining orders to prevent Mr. Taal's detention and deportation while the case was pending.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, Judge Coombe issued a decision and order denying the plaintiffs' motions for temporary restraining orders. The court found that plaintiffs had not established subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Taal's claim to enjoin his removal proceedings, citing jurisdiction-stripping provisions in federal immigration law. The court also found that plaintiffs had not established standing for their claims challenging the executive orders, noting that the orders appeared to state policy intentions rather than create immediately enforceable regulatory action.\n\nFollowing the court's denial of emergency relief, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice on March 31, 2025, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(i). The court entered an order closing the case on April 2, 2025.\n\nThe case involved constitutional challenges to executive immigration enforcement policies and raised significant questions about the scope of First Amendment protections for non-citizens and the limits of executive authority over immigration matters involving protected speech.",
    "46216": "On March 12, 2025, Dr. Gordon Schiff and Dr. Celeste Royce, both physicians and Harvard Medical School professors, filed suit against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and its Acting Director Charles Ezell, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and its Acting Director Mamatha S. Pancholi. The plaintiffs were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation and the Media Freedom & Information Access Clinic at Yale Law School. The case is assigned to Judge Leo T. Sorokin.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges the removal of the plaintiffs' medical research articles from PSNet (Patient Safety Network), a government-operated website that serves as the leading patient safety resource in the United States. PSNet, managed by AHRQ within HHS, hosts expert commentaries on medical errors to help healthcare providers prevent similar mistakes in the future. Dr. Schiff had authored a commentary on suicide risk assessment that listed \"transgender\" and \"LGBTQ\" individuals among high-risk groups, supported by citations to peer-reviewed medical literature. Dr. Royce had authored a commentary on endometriosis diagnosis that noted the condition \"can occur in trans and non-gender-conforming people\" and that failure to understand this fact could make diagnosis more challenging.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14168, titled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.\" The order directed federal agencies to \"remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\" On January 29, 2025, OPM's Acting Director issued a memorandum instructing agencies to \"take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) that inculcate or promote gender ideology\" by January 31, 2025. HHS issued implementing guidance on January 31, 2025.\n\nIn response to these directives, AHRQ conducted word searches through PSNet's database and identified approximately 20 articles containing terminology potentially conflicting with the Executive Order, including the plaintiffs' commentaries. AHRQ removed these articles and offered to repost them only if the authors agreed to delete \"problematic words\" such as \"transgender\" and \"LGBTQ.\" Both plaintiffs refused, believing such changes would compromise the scientific accuracy and patient safety value of their work.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege violations of the First Amendment based on viewpoint discrimination in a limited public forum and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act on grounds that the agency actions were arbitrary and capricious and that OPM exceeded its statutory authority. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore their articles to PSNet and prevent future censorship.\n\nOn April 1, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing among other things that PSNet's technical support contract had expired on March 24, 2025, making the website static and unable to accept new content. After a hearing on May 21, 2025, Judge Sorokin granted the motion in part on May 23, 2025. The court found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their First Amendment claim because the defendants' actions constituted viewpoint discrimination, which is prohibited even in limited public forums. The court ordered the defendants to restore the plaintiffs' commentaries and all other content authored by private parties that was removed from PSNet pursuant to the Executive Order implementation within seven days.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing the claims are moot, the plaintiffs lack standing, and challenges to future implementation of the OPM memorandum are not ripe. The case mentions a related lawsuit, Doctors for America et al. v. OPM et al., pending in the D.C. District Court addressing similar implementation issues with the Executive Order.",
    "46478": "Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc., two family-owned educational toy companies based in Illinois, filed this lawsuit on April 22, 2025, against President Donald Trump and various federal officials and agencies, represented by private counsel from Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. The companies challenged President Trump's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs on imports, claiming the statute does not authorize tariffs and that such authority belongs exclusively to Congress under Article I of the Constitution.\n\nThe legal challenge arose from a series of executive orders issued beginning February 1, 2025, where President Trump used IEEPA to impose tariffs ranging from 10% to 145% on goods from China and other countries. The President declared national emergencies based on the fentanyl crisis and persistent U.S. trade deficits, then imposed these tariffs by modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. The plaintiffs, who import about 60% of their products from China and other affected countries, faced potential tariff costs exceeding $100 million annually—a 40-fold increase that threatened their business survival.\n\nThe defendants moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade, arguing that court had exclusive jurisdiction over tariff-related matters under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i). Simultaneously, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. Judge Rudolph Contreras heard both motions on May 27, 2025.\n\nOn May 29, 2025, Judge Contreras issued a memorandum opinion and order denying the motion to transfer and granting the preliminary injunction. The court determined it had jurisdiction because IEEPA is not a \"law providing for tariffs\" within the meaning of the jurisdictional statute, finding instead that IEEPA's grant of power to \"regulate importation\" does not encompass the authority to impose revenue-raising tariffs. The court concluded that the power to regulate and the power to tax are constitutionally distinct, that no president had previously used IEEPA to impose tariffs, and that Congress had created specific, limited statutory frameworks for presidential tariff authority that would be rendered meaningless if IEEPA provided unlimited tariffing power.\n\nThe court stayed its preliminary injunction for 14 days to allow appellate review. Defendants immediately appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on May 29, 2025, and moved for a stay pending appeal on June 2, 2025. Judge Contreras granted the stay motion on June 3, 2025, noting that the Court of International Trade had issued a broader injunction in a related case that was subsequently stayed by the Federal Circuit, and concluding that a stay was appropriate to protect presidential authority over national security and foreign policy during the pendency of the appeal. The case is currently stayed pending resolution of the D.C. Circuit appeal.\n\nMultiple amicus briefs were filed, including one supporting defendants' transfer motion from America First Legal Foundation, one supporting plaintiffs' preliminary injunction from prominent legal scholars and former government officials, and one from other small businesses opposing the transfer motion. The case involves claims that IEEPA does not authorize the challenged tariffs, that the agency implementation violates the Administrative Procedure Act, and that if IEEPA does authorize such broad tariff authority, it would violate the nondelegation doctrine.",
    "46499": "Chen v. Noem was filed on April 11, 2025, in the Northern District of California before Judge Jeffrey S. White. The case challenges the Department of Homeland Security's \"Student Criminal Alien Initiative,\" a policy implemented in early April 2025 where ICE ran nearly 1.3 million F-1 visa holders through the National Crime Information Center database and terminated the SEVIS records of thousands of international students based solely on any law enforcement contact, regardless of whether charges were filed or convictions obtained.\n\nThe plaintiffs are six Chinese nationals pursuing graduate degrees or post-graduation employment: Zhuoer Chen (UC Berkeley architecture student), Mengcheng Yu (Carnegie Mellon educational technology student), Jiarong Ouyang (University of Cincinnati statistics PhD candidate), Jing Tao (UT Dallas political science PhD student), Yifeng Wu (NYU undergraduate), and Wanrong Li (USC analytics graduate working under Optional Practical Training). None have criminal convictions, though some had minor law enforcement contact resulting in dismissed or expunged charges. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from Deheng Law Offices PC and the Chinese American Legal Defense Alliance.\n\nThe students challenge the mass SEVIS terminations under the Administrative Procedure Act as arbitrary and capricious agency action contrary to law, and under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection clauses. They argue that ICE terminated their student status without notice, individualized review, or legal justification, violating basic due process rights and discriminating based on national origin. The complaint also challenges the Department of State's subsequent mass revocation of F-1 visas based on the same database hits, arguing State lacks authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1201(i) to revoke visas of people already present in the United States.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, Judge Susan Illston granted an ex parte temporary restraining order protecting the named plaintiffs. The case was then reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White and consolidated with multiple related cases involving similarly situated students. On May 22, 2025, Judge White granted a nationwide preliminary injunction after ICE had already restored the plaintiffs' SEVIS records. The injunction prohibits defendants from arresting or detaining the plaintiffs and similarly situated students, imposing adverse effects from the terminated SEVIS records, and reversing the reinstatement of SEVIS records without following proper regulatory procedures under 8 C.F.R. § 214.1.\n\nThe defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025 (Case No. 25-4521), and moved to stay the nationwide scope of the preliminary injunction, arguing it exceeds the court's authority under the Supreme Court's decision in Trump v. CASA and improperly restricts law enforcement activities unrelated to the SEVIS terminations. The plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on July 29, 2025, adding the new plaintiffs and claims against the Secretary of State, and moved for an amended preliminary injunction to address the visa revocations that remain in effect despite the restoration of SEVIS records.",
    "46106": "On February 11, 2025, federal employee unions and current and former federal employees filed suit in the Southern District of New York against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and other defendants for alleged violations of privacy laws. The plaintiffs are represented by counsel from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Lex Lumina LLP, State Democracy Defenders Fund, and The Chandra Law Firm.\n\nThe case centers on events following President Trump's January 20, 2025 inauguration, when he signed Executive Order 14,158 establishing the \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) and renaming the U.S. Digital Service as the United States DOGE Service. According to the complaint, OPM immediately granted broad access to its personnel systems to individuals associated with DOGE, including systems containing sensitive personal information of tens of millions of current and former federal employees such as social security numbers, health records, financial information, and family member data.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought five claims for relief under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.), along with an ultra vires claim. They alleged that OPM disclosed records to DOGE agents who were not OPM employees or lacked the requisite need for access under Privacy Act exception (b)(1), and that OMP failed to establish appropriate safeguards to ensure security and confidentiality of records as required by the Privacy Act. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief but not monetary damages.\n\nOn February 14, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on March 14, 2025. Judge Denise L. Cote largely denied the motion to dismiss in an opinion issued April 3, 2025 (2025 WL 996542), finding that the complaint adequately alleged violations of the Privacy Act and APA based on disclosure of OPM records to individuals who were not OPM employees or did not have sufficient need for access.\n\nThe plaintiffs then filed a motion for preliminary injunction on April 25, 2025. After a hearing on May 29, 2025, Judge Cote granted the preliminary injunction in an opinion issued June 9, 2025. The court found that plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on their Privacy Act and APA claims, irreparable harm from the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information, and that the public interest favored enforcement of privacy protections. The preliminary injunction was issued June 20, 2025, with an administrative stay of fourteen days and requiring plaintiffs to post a $1,000 bond. The injunction requires OPM to file reports describing processes put in place since March 6, 2025 to ensure Privacy Act compliance for any new grants of access to systems containing personally identifiable information.\n\nSeveral related cases challenging similar DOGE activities at other federal agencies were filed in other federal districts, with mixed results on preliminary relief motions. The case remains in preliminary stages with no trial scheduled yet.",
    "46484": "The American Bar Association filed this lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice, Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on April 23, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia before Judge Christopher R. Cooper. The case was represented by private counsel from Democracy Forward Foundation.\n\nThe dispute arose after the ABA publicly criticized the Trump Administration in February and March 2025 for actions it viewed as undermining the judiciary and legal profession, and joined a lawsuit challenging the Administration's freeze on international development grants. In response, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued a memorandum on April 9, 2025, titled \"Engagement with the American Bar Association,\" which prohibited DOJ employees from participating in ABA events on official time and restricted policy employees from engaging with the ABA. The memo explicitly cited the ABA's litigation against the government as justification for these restrictions, stating that DOJ must be \"careful stewards of the public fisc\" and noting that the ABA was taking positions \"contrary to the federal government's policies.\"\n\nThe next day, April 10, 2025, DOJ terminated all of the ABA's Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) grants, totaling $3.2 million, which funded the ABA's Commission on Domestic and Sexual Violence (ABA CDSV). The grants supported training and technical assistance for legal practitioners working with domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking survivors. DOJ cited only that the grants \"no longer effectuate agency priorities\" under federal regulations, without providing further explanation. No other OVW grants to different organizations were cancelled.\n\nThe ABA brought six claims: First Amendment retaliation, First Amendment viewpoint discrimination, unconstitutional conditions on government grants, Fifth Amendment Equal Protection violations, Fifth Amendment Due Process violations, and Administrative Procedure Act violations. The ABA sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, specifically requesting a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of the grant terminations and require continued funding.\n\nOn April 24, 2025, the ABA filed a motion for temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. The government moved to dismiss on May 2, 2025, arguing primarily on jurisdictional grounds that the claims belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act rather than federal district court.\n\nFollowing a hearing on May 12, 2025, Judge Cooper issued a memorandum opinion on May 14, 2025, granting the preliminary injunction on the First Amendment retaliation claim. The court found that the ABA was likely to succeed on the merits of its retaliation claim, noting that the government did not meaningfully contest the merits and that the timing and circumstances strongly suggested retaliation for protected First Amendment activity. The court rejected the government's jurisdictional challenge, finding that the First Amendment retaliation claim had a constitutional rather than contractual source and therefore fell within the district court's jurisdiction rather than the Tucker Act's exclusive domain. The court reserved judgment on the ABA's other claims and granted preliminary relief to prevent DOJ from enforcing the grant terminations based on retaliatory motives.",
    "46207": "On March 7, 2025, three transgender inmates in federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) custody filed a class action lawsuit challenging Executive Order 14168, which President Donald Trump issued on January 20, 2025. The plaintiffs—Alishea Kingdom, Solo Nichols, and Jas Kapule—had all been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and were receiving gender-affirming care including hormone therapy and social accommodations like appropriate undergarments and commissary items.\n\nExecutive Order 14168, titled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\" prohibited the expenditure of federal funds for \"any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate's appearance to that of the opposite sex.\" BOP implemented this directive through two memoranda in February 2025, resulting in the discontinuation or threatened discontinuation of the plaintiffs' hormone therapy and elimination of their access to social accommodations.\n\nThe plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the ACLU Foundation, Transgender Law Center, and Morgan Lewis LLP, filed suit against President Trump, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, and several BOP officials in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. They alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore their access to gender-affirming care.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, the plaintiffs filed motions for preliminary injunction and class certification. The proposed class included all current and future BOP inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria who were receiving or would receive gender-affirming health care absent the executive order's prohibition. Judge Royce C. Lamberth conducted a hearing on May 22, 2025.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, Judge Lamberth issued a memorandum opinion granting both motions. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their APA claims, determining that BOP's implementing memoranda were arbitrary and capricious because they provided no reasoned explanation for denying gender-affirming care and failed to adequately consider the agency's sudden policy reversal. The court certified a class of all current and future BOP inmates with gender dysphoria diagnoses and appointed class counsel. The preliminary injunction ordered BOP to restore social accommodations to class members and continue providing hormone therapy to those previously prescribed such treatment.\n\nThe court found the plaintiffs faced irreparable harm, noting that gender dysphoria can cause severe symptoms including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation without treatment. While some plaintiffs had hormone therapy restored during litigation, the court determined this was done in response to the lawsuit rather than through genuine medical reassessment.\n\nTwenty-four states, led by Indiana and Idaho, filed an amicus brief supporting the defendants, arguing that the controversial treatments were within policymakers' authority to regulate and that prisoners do not have greater rights to such treatments than free citizens.\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for preliminary injunction, which Judge Lamberth granted on August 20, 2025, enjoining implementation of the executive order against class members from September 1 through November 30, 2025. The case remains pending, with defendants having filed their answer on June 24, 2025. A separate motion to intervene was filed by Carla Keys on July 14, 2025.",
    "46602": "On May 15, 2025, Oregon Council for the Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against the United States DOGE Service, its Acting Administrator Amy Gleason, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Council on the Humanities, and NEH Acting Chairman Michael McDonald. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from Tonkon Torp LLP, and the case was assigned to Judge Michael H. Simon.\n\nThe lawsuit challenged the defendants' actions in April 2025 when DOGE, working with NEH leadership, terminated nearly all grants to state and jurisdictional humanities councils under the Federal/State Partnership program. This program, established by Congress in the 1970s, provides federal funding to 56 state and jurisdictional humanities councils that distribute those funds for local humanities projects throughout the United States. The partnership has historically received stable bipartisan support and constituted the largest portion of NEH's budget, with Congress appropriating $65 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2025.\n\nOn April 2, 2025, NEH sent mass termination notices to the councils, stating that grants \"no longer effectuate[d] the agency's needs and priorities\" and were being terminated to further \"the President's agenda.\" The terminations were implemented without providing notice and opportunity for hearing as required by statute, and NEH explicitly stated it would provide no appeals process. Simultaneously, DOGE orchestrated the termination of more than 65 percent of NEH staff, effectively dismantling the agency's capacity to administer the Federal/State Partnership. After this lawsuit was filed, NEH partially rescinded some terminations in June 2025, restoring funding at a reduced 20 percent level while acknowledging this \"still represents an incredible hardship.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act alleging arbitrary and capricious agency action and action contrary to law, constitutional separation of powers violations based on the Take Care Clause and Appropriations Clause, and violations of the Impoundment Control Act. They argued that defendants violated the NEH governing statutes at 20 U.S.C. § 956, which establish specific procedures for grant terminations and mandatory funding formulas, and that the executive branch cannot unilaterally refuse to spend congressionally appropriated funds.\n\nOn June 25, 2025, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction and stay under section 705 of the APA. Sixteen states filed an amicus brief supporting the motion. After oral argument on August 4, 2025, Judge Simon granted the motion in part on August 6, 2025. The court found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their separation of powers and APA claims, concluding that defendants violated statutory requirements for grant terminations and improperly refused to spend appropriated funds as directed by Congress.\n\nThe court issued both a preliminary injunction and an APA stay prohibiting defendants from implementing the April 2025 grant terminations, preventing further terminations without statutory cause under 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7), and barring defendants from disposing of funds committed to the plaintiffs through grants approved as of April 2, 2025. The court found that plaintiffs faced irreparable harm through cancelled humanities programs nationwide and damage to their reputations, while the public interest favored ensuring government compliance with statutory obligations. The court denied defendants' requests for an administrative stay and bond requirement.",
    "46179": "This case was filed on February 24, 2025, by Travis LeBlanc and Edward Felten, two Senate-confirmed members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), against the PCLOB, Board member Beth Williams, Executive Director Jenny Fitzpatrick, Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel Trent Morse, and President Donald J. Trump. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP and sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and reinstatement based on claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, Due Process violations, and other theories. Judge Reggie B. Walton presided over the case.\n\nThe PCLOB was created in 2004 following the 9/11 Commission Report to oversee the executive branch's counterterrorism activities and ensure protection of privacy and civil liberties. Initially, Board members served \"at the pleasure of the President\" within the Executive Office of the President. However, after concerns arose about the Board's lack of independence, Congress restructured it in 2007 through the 9/11 Commission Act, removing it from the Executive Office, establishing it as an \"independent agency,\" requiring Senate confirmation for all members, deleting the \"serve at the pleasure\" language, and mandating fixed six-year terms with partisan balance requirements. The five-member Board requires a quorum of three to function and is tasked with reviewing government counterterrorism policies, advising Congress and the executive branch, and reporting on privacy and civil liberties protections.\n\nLeBlanc was nominated by President Trump in 2018, confirmed unanimously by the Senate in 2019, then renominated by President Biden in 2022 and reconfirmed for a second term expiring January 29, 2028. Felten was nominated by President Trump in 2018, confirmed in 2018, then renominated by Trump and reconfirmed in 2019 for a term that expired January 29, 2025, but he was eligible to continue serving until January 29, 2026, or until a successor was confirmed. Both are Democrats with expertise in civil liberties and privacy.\n\nOn January 21, 2025, both plaintiffs received identical emails from Morse requesting their resignation by January 23, 2025, threatening termination if they did not comply. No cause was given for the requested resignations. The plaintiffs did not resign. On January 27, 2025, they received emails confirming their termination effective January 23, 2025, at 5:01 PM. Again, no cause was provided. President Trump also terminated the third Democratic Board member, Sharon Bradford Franklin, but left Republican member Beth Williams in place, leaving the Board without the required three-member quorum.\n\nThe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, with the case turning on whether the PCLOB's organic statute restricts the President's power to remove Board members at will. Under the framework from Severino v. Biden, Congress can restrict presidential removal power either through express statutory text or through the \"statutory structure and function\" of an office. On May 21, 2025, Judge Walton issued a memorandum opinion at 2025 WL 1454010 granting the plaintiffs' motion and denying defendants' cross-motion.\n\nThe court found that while the statute contained no express textual removal restriction, the Board's structure and function clearly indicated Congressional intent to restrict removals. The court emphasized the Board's role in providing independent oversight of the executive branch, its composition as a nonpartisan expert body with partisan balance requirements, members' staggered six-year terms, and its quasi-legislative functions in advising Congress. The court distinguished the PCLOB from the Administrative Conference at issue in Severino, noting that oversight of the executive branch was the Board's primary function, not merely providing advice to the President. The court also concluded that such a removal restriction was constitutional under Humphrey's Executor v. United States, as the PCLOB is a multimember expert agency that does not wield substantial executive power.\n\nThe court granted declaratory judgment that the removals were unlawful and issued a permanent injunction on May 21, 2025, ordering defendants (except the President) to treat the plaintiffs as remaining Board members and not to interfere with their ability to perform their duties. The defendants appealed to the D.C. Circuit (No. 25-5197) and moved for a stay pending appeal, which the district court denied on May 29, 2025. However, on July 1, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal, concluding that the government was likely to succeed on the merits because the PCLOB is not an \"adjudicatory body\" and therefore does not qualify for implied removal protection under Supreme Court precedent, which limits such protection to bodies with quasi-judicial functions requiring \"absolute freedom from Executive interference.\"",
    "46186": "This class action lawsuit was filed on February 28, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, challenging the Trump administration's termination of several humanitarian parole programs and suspension of immigration benefit processing. The case is assigned to Judge Indira Talwani.\n\nThe plaintiffs include individual immigrants paroled through various programs (proceeding under pseudonyms like Svitlana Doe and Maksym Doe), U.S. citizen sponsors, and the Haitian Bridge Alliance nonprofit organization. They are represented by Justice Action Center, Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP, and Human Rights First. The defendants are federal officials sued in their official capacities: Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons, Acting CBP Commissioner Pete R. Flores, USCIS Senior Official Kika Scott, and President Donald J. Trump, represented by the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges actions taken by the administration beginning January 20, 2025, targeting several parole programs established under previous administrations. These programs include Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) for Ukrainian war refugees, parole processes for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV), Operation Allies Welcome (OAW) for Afghan evacuees, Family Reunification Parole (FRP), Military Parole-in-Place (MPIP), and Central American Minors (CAM) programs.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, Acting DHS Secretary Benjamine Huffman issued a memorandum declaring categorical parole programs \"blatantly inconsistent with the statute\" under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A). Acting USCIS Director Jennifer Higgins then issued an email directive suspending adjudications of parole applications, and Acting Deputy Director Andrew Davidson issued a February 14, 2025 memorandum suspending adjudications of immigration benefit applications filed by parolees from certain programs. On March 25, 2025, DHS published a Federal Register Notice terminating the CHNV programs and revoking existing parole grants, with termination effective April 24, 2025.\n\nPlaintiffs filed an emergency motion for preliminary injunction on March 17, 2025, and a motion for class certification on March 21, 2025. After DHS published the CHNV termination notice, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint and emergency motion for stay on March 27, 2025.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, Judge Talwani granted emergency relief, staying the termination of CHNV parole grants and work authorization pending case-by-case review, and certified a class of affected individuals. On May 28, 2025, the court granted additional preliminary relief, staying the suspension of re-parole adjudications and immigration benefit processing for parolees under various programs.\n\nThe plaintiffs bring claims under the Administrative Procedure Act alleging the agency actions were contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and procedurally improper, along with Fifth Amendment Due Process claims. They seek declaratory judgment that the parole processes are lawful, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and vacatur of the challenged agency actions.\n\nDefendants appealed the court's orders to the First Circuit Court of Appeals (Case No. 25-1384) on April 18, 2025. The First Circuit denied a stay pending appeal on May 5, 2025, but the Supreme Court granted the government's stay application on May 30, 2025 (Case No. 24A1079), allowing the CHNV parole terminations to proceed pending appeal. The case involves hundreds of thousands of individuals who received parole through these humanitarian programs and now face potential loss of legal status and work authorization.",
    "46119": "This constitutional challenge was filed on February 13, 2025, in the District of Maryland by current and former employees and contractors of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) against Elon Musk, DOGE entities, and various Trump administration officials. The plaintiffs, proceeding under pseudonyms and seeking class certification, allege that Musk violated both the Appointments Clause and separation of powers principles through his role in dismantling USAID.\n\nThe case centers on events beginning January 20, 2025, when President Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Musk allegedly assumed de facto control over it despite never being nominated by the President or confirmed by the Senate. According to the complaint, Musk and DOGE team members gained unprecedented access to USAID's computer systems, placed thousands of employees on administrative leave, terminated contracts worth billions of dollars, physically closed USAID headquarters, and effectively dismantled the agency that Congress had established and continuously funded.\n\nThe factual record describes a systematic pattern where DOGE members, many with prior employment at Musk's companies, infiltrated USAID beginning January 27, 2025. They demanded and received administrative access to financial and personnel systems, overrode security restrictions to access classified areas without proper clearances, and made personnel and contract decisions typically reserved for appointed agency officials. Musk publicly claimed responsibility for these actions, posting on social media that DOGE had \"spent the weekend feeding USAID to the wood chipper\" and calling USAID \"a criminal organization\" that needed to \"die.\"\n\nOn March 18, 2025, Judge Theodore D. Chuang granted plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, finding they demonstrated a likelihood of success on both constitutional claims. The court determined that Musk likely functioned as an improperly appointed \"Officer of the United States\" when he made decisions of \"great significance\" requiring \"substantial discretion,\" particularly regarding USAID's headquarters closure. The court also found that defendants' actions to dismantle a congressionally-created agency without congressional authorization likely violated separation of powers principles under the third category of the Youngstown framework, where executive power is at its \"lowest ebb.\"\n\nThe preliminary injunction enjoined defendants from taking further actions to shut down USAID, accessing plaintiffs' personal information, or acting regarding USAID without express authorization from properly appointed USAID officials. However, defendants successfully appealed to the Fourth Circuit, which stayed the injunction on March 28, 2025, finding that plaintiffs failed to sue the proper defendants and establish irreparable harm.\n\nFollowing the stay, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 17, 2025, adding USAID, the State Department, and various Trump administration officials as defendants while maintaining their two constitutional claims. The case has evolved into a proposed class action seeking only declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of all USAID personnel employed during the relevant period. Defendants have moved to dismiss on jurisdictional and other grounds, arguing that the Civil Service Reform Act precludes district court jurisdiction over these employment-related claims and that plaintiffs lack Article III standing. The motion for class certification and motion to dismiss remain pending, with the Fourth Circuit appeal stayed pending resolution of these threshold issues in the district court.",
    "46201": "On March 6, 2025, eight states—California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Wisconsin—filed suit against the U.S. Department of Education and its officials, challenging the agency's abrupt termination of federal teacher training grants. The case was initially assigned to Judge George A. O'Toole Jr., then reassigned to Judge Myong J. Joun. The states were represented by their respective attorneys general.\n\nThe dispute arose from the Department's February 2025 decision to terminate approximately 104 out of 109 grants totaling around $600 million under two Congressional programs: the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) and Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) programs. These programs, established by Congress in 2008 and 2015 respectively, were designed to address nationwide teacher shortages by recruiting, training, and placing teachers in underserved rural and urban communities and in hard-to-staff subjects like mathematics, science, and special education.\n\nThe terminations began on February 7, 2025, following a February 5 Department directive requiring review of grants to ensure they did not fund \"discriminatory practices—including in the form of [diversity, equity, and inclusion ('DEI')]\" contrary to the Department's policy objectives. Most grant recipients received identical form letters stating their programs promoted DEI initiatives or otherwise failed to serve U.S. interests, without specific factual justification for individual terminations.\n\nThe states filed claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging the terminations were arbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law. They also raised constitutional claims under the Spending Clause and Separation of Powers doctrine. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to vacate the terminations and restore the grants.\n\nOn the same day as filing, the states moved for a temporary restraining order. Judge Joun granted the TRO on March 10, 2025, finding the states likely to succeed on their APA claims and that they would suffer irreparable harm from the loss of teacher training programs. The court ordered the Department to restore the pre-termination status quo.\n\nThe Department immediately appealed and sought a stay. The First Circuit Court of Appeals denied the stay motion on March 21, 2025, finding the Department unlikely to succeed on the merits. However, on April 4, 2025, the Supreme Court granted the Department's emergency application to stay the district court's order in a 5-4 decision. The majority concluded the government was likely to succeed in showing the district court lacked jurisdiction under the APA, as the claims sounded in contract and should have been brought in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act rather than as APA claims in district court.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's stay, the states withdrew their motion for preliminary injunction on April 8, 2025, and the defendants moved to voluntarily dismiss their appeal. The case subsequently proceeded on the merits, with defendants filing a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the states filing a first amended complaint on June 2, 2025, followed by defendants' renewed motion to dismiss on June 30, 2025.\n\nThe case centers on whether federal agencies can terminate previously awarded grants based on policy disagreements with program content that Congress specifically authorized, and whether such challenges must proceed as contract disputes in the Court of Federal Claims or as administrative law challenges in district court under the APA.",
    "VR-LA-0120": "This consolidated voting rights case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Clark case was filed on May 19, 2020, and consolidated with the Power Coalition case filed May 7, 2020. The plaintiffs included individual Louisiana voters (Telisa Clark, Lakeshia Barnett, Martha Christian Green, Jane Chandler, Jennifer Harding, Edith Gee Jones, and Jasmine Pogue) and organizations (Crescent City Media Group, League of Women Voters Louisiana, Power Coalition for Equity and Justice, and Louisiana State Conference of the NAACP). The defendants were Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, and Attorney General Jeff Landry, all sued in their official capacities. Plaintiffs were represented by civil rights organizations including the Southern Poverty Law Center, Fair Elections Center, NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Arnold & Porter, and Covington & Burling.\n\nThe case was assigned to Chief Judge Shelly D. Dick. Plaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief challenging three aspects of Louisiana's election laws during the COVID-19 pandemic: the \"Excuse Requirement\" limiting absentee ballot eligibility to voters with specific excuses, the \"Witness Requirement\" mandating that absentee voters obtain witness signatures on their ballots, and the \"Cure Prohibition\" providing no notice or opportunity to cure defects in absentee ballots.\n\nPlaintiffs argued these requirements created an undue burden on voting during the pandemic by forcing voters to choose between protecting their health and exercising their right to vote. They contended the laws had a disparate impact on Black voters, older voters, and those with underlying health conditions who faced higher risks from COVID-19. Although Louisiana had implemented an Emergency Election Plan expanding absentee voting for July and August 2020 elections, plaintiffs argued this was insufficient and did not apply to the November and December 2020 elections.\n\nDefendants filed motions to dismiss, with the State of Louisiana successfully intervening in the case. The parish registrars also moved to dismiss, arguing they lacked authority over the challenged provisions and that necessary parties had not been joined. Plaintiffs filed motions for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin enforcement of the challenged provisions for all 2020 elections.\n\nThe case was dismissed with prejudice on June 22, 2020. Plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the judgment, seeking to have the dismissal changed from \"with prejudice\" to \"without prejudice,\" but the final outcome was termination with prejudice on June 30, 2020.",
    "JC-MD-0017": "Keith Seth and other detainees at the Prince George's County Jail filed this class action lawsuit on April 21, 2020, challenging the facility's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs, represented by Civil Rights Corps and WilmerHale, brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 for medically vulnerable detainees. The defendant, Mary Lou McDonough, Director of the Prince George's County Department of Corrections, is represented by the Prince George's County Office of Law.\n\nThe case centers on allegations that the jail failed to implement basic COVID-19 safety measures recommended by the CDC during an uncontrolled outbreak at the facility. Plaintiffs alleged that detainees lacked adequate access to soap (which the jail charged money for), hand sanitizer, and cleaning supplies. They claimed that symptomatic prisoners were repeatedly examined and sent back to general population rather than being properly isolated, and that medical isolation cells were unsanitary with feces, blood, and mucus on the walls. The complaint also challenged the jail's blanket 23-hour lockdown policy and alleged that some COVID-positive prisoners were illegally detained beyond their court-ordered release dates.\n\nOn the same day as filing, plaintiffs moved for emergency temporary restraining order and class certification. Judge Paula Xinis appointed Dr. Carlos Franco-Paredes as an independent expert to inspect the facility. Following the expert's inspection and report, the court granted a temporary restraining order on May 21, 2020, finding evidence of \"undertesting,\" \"inadequate treatment and isolation of COVID-19 symptomatic detainees,\" and \"no plan for those at high risk of COVID-19 complications.\" The court specifically ordered defendants to develop comprehensive written protocols for identifying, monitoring, treating, and housing high-risk detainees.\n\nDefendant answered the original complaint on May 13, 2020, rather than moving to dismiss. On July 3, 2020, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding new claims challenging the jail's lockdown conditions as violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The amended complaint alleged that confining detainees to their cells for 23 hours daily under restrictive conditions created unreasonable risks of serious physical and psychological harm and violated due process rights by being imposed indiscriminately without adequate procedural protections.\n\nDefendant subsequently moved to dismiss the amended complaint on July 17, 2020, arguing that released plaintiffs' claims were moot, that plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, and that various claims failed to state causes of action. The case proceeded to discovery, with both sides conducting written discovery and depositions. The court later allowed the temporary restraining order to expire, and the case remains in litigation with an ongoing discovery process.",
    "IM-FL-0029": "On April 13, 2020, fifty-eight immigration detainees filed a class action lawsuit challenging conditions at three South Florida immigration detention facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The named plaintiffs, representing approximately 1,400 detainees at Krome Service Processing Center in Miami, Broward Transitional Center in Pompano Beach, and Glades County Detention Center in Moore Haven, sued Michael W. Meade (ICE Miami Field Office Director) and U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr. The petitioners were represented by a coalition of legal services organizations including Americans for Immigrant Justice, Legal Aid Service of Broward County, University of Miami Immigration Clinic, Southern Poverty Law Center, and private firms including King & Spalding.\n\nThe petitioners alleged three causes of action under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause: violation of detention standards under the Accardi doctrine, violation of the right to reasonable safety, and state-created danger. They claimed they faced imminent risk of contracting COVID-19 due to overcrowded conditions, inadequate social distancing, insufficient hygiene supplies, improper \"cohorting\" of infected and uninfected individuals, and ICE's failure to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The plaintiffs initially sought habeas corpus relief (release from detention), declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief requiring compliance with CDC guidelines.\n\nJudge Marcia G. Cooke, with referrals to Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman, presided over the case. Following an emergency hearing on April 17, 2020, the court issued a temporary restraining order on April 30, 2020, finding that ICE had failed in its duty to protect detainees' safety and well-being, constituting deliberate indifference and cruel and unusual punishment. The court noted that social distancing was impossible at the facilities, with beds positioned as close as twelve inches apart at Glades and three to four feet apart at Krome. The TRO required ICE to evaluate detainees for release, reduce populations to 75% of capacity, provide adequate hygiene supplies and masks, and implement proper health protocols.\n\nOn June 6, 2020, Judge Cooke granted a preliminary injunction after finding continued violations. The court prohibited ICE from mixing confirmed COVID-19 cases with unconfirmed cases, required adequate supplies and education, and mandated proper screening procedures for transfers. When ICE continued to violate the court's orders, Judge Cooke appointed Matthew C. Dates as Special Master on July 17, 2020, to monitor compliance at the three facilities.\n\nThe court granted class certification in part on June 6, 2020, certifying a class of all civil immigration detainees held at the three facilities for conditions-of-confinement claims, while denying certification for habeas corpus claims seeking release. The class definition included individuals held at the facilities when the action was filed, since filing, or in the future.\n\nThe case was resolved through a comprehensive settlement agreement filed on June 28, 2021. The settlement required ICE to comply with all applicable CDC guidelines and detention standards, implement a COVID-19 vaccination program, maintain population density at 75% capacity or lower, provide proper educational materials in multiple languages, ensure appropriate cohorting procedures that separate confirmed cases from unconfirmed cases, and provide adequate hygiene supplies. The settlement also established ongoing reporting requirements and maintained the court's jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. Individual class members retained the right to pursue individual habeas petitions and motions for release.\n\nThroughout the litigation, the court received extensive evidence through declarations from detainees and expert testimony from medical professionals, including Dr. Joseph Shin and Dr. Pedro Greer, documenting dangerous conditions and ICE's inadequate response to the pandemic. The case highlighted systemic failures in immigration detention during a public health emergency and resulted in court-supervised reforms to protect detainees' health and safety.",
    "46390": "D.B.U. and R.M.M., two Venezuelan men detained at an ICE facility in Colorado, filed this class action habeas corpus petition and complaint on April 12, 2025, challenging President Donald Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act against alleged members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a Venezuelan criminal gang. The case was assigned to Judge Charlotte N. Sweeney in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado.\n\nOn March 14, 2025, President Trump signed a proclamation invoking the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, designating TdA as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organization\" and declaring that TdA was \"perpetuating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\" The proclamation authorized the summary removal of Venezuelan citizens alleged to be TdA members, bypassing normal immigration procedures. The Alien Enemies Act, a wartime authority, had only been used three times in U.S. history during actual wars: the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II.\n\nThe petitioners, represented by the ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, sought to represent a class defined as \"All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation.\" D.B.U. was arrested at what ICE characterized as a \"Tren de Aragua party,\" while R.M.M. was arrested during an ICE operation targeting an alleged TdA member. Both men deny TdA membership but faced the risk of designation and removal under the proclamation.\n\nThe petitioners argued that the proclamation violated the Alien Enemies Act because there was no actual \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by a \"foreign nation or government\" as required by the statute, and that TdA, as a criminal organization, did not qualify as a foreign government. They also claimed the proclamation violated due process by providing inadequate notice and no meaningful opportunity to contest the alien enemy designation before removal.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, the court issued an emergency order under the All Writs Act prohibiting the removal of petitioners from the district. Following a hearing on April 21, 2025, Judge Sweeney granted the temporary restraining order on April 22, 2025, finding that petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits. The court provisionally certified the class and ordered that the government provide 21 days' notice before any removal under the proclamation, written in a language the individual understands, including notice of the right to seek judicial review and consult an attorney.\n\nThe government appealed the TRO to the Tenth Circuit, which denied their emergency motion for a stay on April 29, 2025, finding the government failed to show irreparable harm. On May 6, 2025, Judge Sweeney granted both the motion for class certification and the motion for preliminary injunction. The court found that the proclamation likely exceeded the scope of the Alien Enemies Act because the statutory terms \"invasion\" and \"predatory incursion\" contemplated military action by foreign nations, not criminal activity by non-state actors. The court also found the government's notice procedures constitutionally deficient.\n\nThe preliminary injunction enjoined respondents from detaining, transferring, or removing petitioners and class members under the Alien Enemies Act based on the proclamation. The government filed a notice of appeal on July 7, 2025, appealing both the class certification and preliminary injunction orders to the Tenth Circuit (Case No. 25-1265).\n\nThis case was part of broader nationwide litigation challenging the AEA proclamation, with similar cases filed in multiple federal districts. The Supreme Court had previously ruled in Trump v. J.G.G. that individuals subject to detention under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to due process and must receive adequate notice to seek habeas relief before removal.",
    "46319": "On March 31, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging Executive Order 14,251, which President Donald J. Trump had issued four days earlier. The case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman. NTEU represents approximately 160,000 federal employees across thirty-seven agencies and departments.\n\nThe Executive Order invoked the national security exemption in 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute to exclude over thirty agencies and subdivisions from federal collective bargaining requirements. This unprecedented action stripped collective bargaining rights from approximately two-thirds of the federal workforce, including about 65% of NTEU-represented employees across twelve agencies where NTEU held collective bargaining agreements. The affected agencies included the Internal Revenue Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy, Federal Communications Commission, and components of the Departments of Treasury, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Interior.\n\nNTEU brought three claims: two ultra vires counts alleging the President exceeded his statutory authority under Section 7103(b)(1), and a First Amendment retaliation claim. The union argued that the excluded agencies do not have a \"primary function\" of \"intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work\" as required by the statute, and that the President's determinations were motivated by political retaliation against unions that had challenged his administration's policies rather than genuine national security concerns.\n\nKey evidence supporting NTEU's claims included a White House Fact Sheet issued with the Executive Order stating that \"certain Federal unions have declared war on President Trump's agenda\" and distinguishing between unions seeking \"constructive partnerships\" with the President versus those engaging in \"mass obstruction.\" The Order coincided with OPM guidance explaining that excluded agencies could now more easily terminate underperforming employees and conduct large-scale reductions in force without collective bargaining constraints.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, NTEU moved for a preliminary injunction. After oral argument on April 23, Judge Friedman granted the motion on April 25, finding that NTEU had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, and that the equities favored relief. The court concluded there was \"clear evidence\" that the President's use of the national security exemption was driven by retaliatory motives and policy objectives unrelated to national security, rebutting the presumption of regularity normally accorded to presidential actions.\n\nThe court found that the Executive Order would cause NTEU irreparable harm by eliminating its ability to represent over 104,000 employees, cutting off more than half its revenue from dues payments, and threatening its existence as an organization. The court determined the exclusions conflicted with Congress's intent in enacting the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute to promote collective bargaining and create a system that \"cannot be universally altered by any President.\"\n\nThe government immediately appealed and sought a stay. On May 16, 2025, a divided D.C. Circuit panel granted a stay pending appeal, finding that NTEU had not established irreparable harm because agencies had been directed not to terminate collective bargaining agreements during litigation. The appellate court noted that the preliminary injunction impeded the President's national security prerogatives and that preserving presidential autonomy under the statute served the public interest.\n\nFollowing the stay, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. NTEU continued to argue that the Executive Order was ultra vires and constituted First Amendment retaliation, supported by evidence that agencies were disregarding their collective bargaining obligations despite temporary guidance suggesting otherwise. The government defended the exclusions as within presidential authority and based on legitimate national security determinations, while also arguing the district court lacked jurisdiction because NTEU's claims should be channeled through the Federal Labor Relations Authority's administrative process.\n\nThe case represents an unprecedented challenge to presidential use of national security exemptions from federal labor law, with NTEU seeking to restore collective bargaining rights for approximately 104,000 federal employees across multiple agencies and preserve its role as their exclusive representative.",
    "46285": "On March 24, 2025, three nonprofit membership organizations—Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (\"CHIRLA\"), UndocuBlack Network (\"UndocuBlack\"), and CASA, Inc. (\"CASA\")—filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons, CBP Acting Commissioner Pete Flores, USCIS Acting Director Angelica Alfonso-Royals, and President Donald Trump, all in their official capacities. The organizations are represented by private counsel from the Justice Action Center and attorneys from the plaintiff organizations themselves.\n\nThe case challenges three Trump administration agency actions that expanded expedited removal to hundreds of thousands of people who had been lawfully paroled into the United States at ports of entry under various humanitarian programs. The challenged actions are: (1) a January 23, 2025 memorandum from Acting DHS Secretary Benjamine Huffman directing agency personnel to consider using expedited removal against parolees, including by terminating active parole status and ongoing removal proceedings; (2) a February 18, 2025 ICE directive stating there is \"no time limit\" on processing \"paroled arriving aliens\" for expedited removal; and (3) a March 25, 2025 Federal Register notice terminating parole programs for Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan nationals (CHNV programs) and subjecting those individuals to expedited removal.\n\nThe organizational plaintiffs' members include individuals who entered the United States through CBP One appointments and CHNV parole programs. Many members are experiencing expedited removal proceedings, including courthouse arrests where individuals attending routine immigration court hearings have been unexpectedly detained and placed in expedited removal after their proceedings were dismissed. The plaintiffs argue this subjects their members to summary deportation without adequate due process protections available in standard removal proceedings.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Immigration and Nationality Act section 1225(b)(1)(A), the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. They alleged the challenged actions exceeded DHS's statutory authority, were arbitrary and capricious, and violated due process. The case was assigned to Judge Jia M. Cobb. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied as moot when plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 11, 2025.\n\nOn June 11, 2025, plaintiffs moved for a stay of the challenged agency actions under 5 U.S.C. § 705. After briefing and oral argument on July 9, 2025, Judge Cobb granted the motion on August 1, 2025. The court found plaintiffs were substantially likely to succeed on the merits, concluding that neither the \"Arriving Aliens Provision\" nor the \"Designation Provision\" of the expedited removal statute authorized subjecting parolees to expedited removal. The court also found the challenged actions were arbitrary and capricious due to inconsistent legal explanations and lack of reasoned decision-making. The stay applies to all noncitizens who have been paroled into the United States at any point in time, not just the plaintiffs' members.\n\nDefendants filed a motion to stay the court's order on August 4, 2025, which Judge Cobb denied on August 13, 2025. On August 5, 2025, defendants appealed the stay order to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, where the case is docketed as No. 25-5289. The parties have agreed to suspend the deadline for defendants to answer the amended complaint pending resolution of the appeal, with the administrative record to be produced within specified timeframes depending on whether the stay remains in place.",
    "46279": "On March 23, 2025, four individuals using pseudonyms (D.V.D., M.M., E.F.D., and O.C.G.) filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, and Plymouth County Correctional Facility Superintendent Antone Moniz. The case is before Judge Brian E. Murphy and is represented by immigration rights organizations and legal services attorneys.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged DHS's policy and practice of removing noncitizens to \"third countries\"—countries other than those designated in their removal orders—without providing meaningful notice or an opportunity to seek protection from persecution or torture under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and related immigration laws. The legal claims were based on the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA), the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe factual basis centers on DHS's February 18, 2025 directive instructing officers to review cases of individuals previously released from immigration detention for re-detention and potential removal to third countries. Plaintiffs alleged that DHS was removing people without the required procedural protections. Notably, plaintiff O.C.G., a Guatemalan man who had been granted withholding of removal from Guatemala by an immigration judge, was deported to Mexico without notice or opportunity to present fear-based claims, despite having testified about being raped in Mexico during his immigration proceedings.\n\nOn March 28, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order requiring defendants to provide written notice and meaningful opportunity to seek CAT protection before third-country removals. On April 18, 2025, Judge Murphy certified a nationwide class of individuals with final removal orders issued under various immigration proceedings whom DHS has deported or will deport on or after February 18, 2025, to countries not previously designated in their removal orders. The court also granted a preliminary injunction requiring written notice in the person's native language and a meaningful opportunity to assert CAT claims, including at least 15 days to move to reopen immigration proceedings after adverse determinations.\n\nThe court found multiple violations of its orders, including attempted removals to Libya in May 2025 and to South Sudan in May 2025, where individuals received fewer than 24 hours' notice in English only, outside business hours. When defendants attempted to remove eight individuals to South Sudan, the court found this violated the preliminary injunction and ordered remedial measures, clarifying that a \"meaningful opportunity\" required a minimum of ten days.\n\nDefendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the First Circuit Court of Appeals (Cases 25-1311 and 25-1393), which denied their stay motion on May 16, 2025. However, on June 23, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court granted defendants' application and stayed the preliminary injunction pending disposition of the First Circuit appeal and any subsequent petition for certiorari (DHS v. D.V.D., 145 S. Ct. 2153). The Supreme Court clarified on July 3, 2025, that the stay also applied to the court's remedial orders.\n\nThe court ordered expedited discovery regarding the circumstances of O.C.G.'s removal, during which defendants acknowledged they had made misrepresentations about providing him notice and an opportunity to express fear. On May 23, 2025, the court ordered defendants to facilitate O.C.G.'s return to the United States. Defendants subsequently filed a motion to stay all proceedings pending appeal, and plaintiffs filed motions for partial summary judgment and an indicative ruling to dissolve the preliminary injunction given the Supreme Court's stay.\n\nThe case involves significant ongoing appellate proceedings and raises fundamental questions about due process protections for individuals facing deportation to countries where they may face persecution or torture, with the Supreme Court's stay effectively suspending the injunctive relief while appeals proceed.",
    "46099": "AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Journalism Development Network filed suit on February 10, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of State, USAID, Secretary Marco Rubio, OMB Director Russell Vought, and President Donald Trump. The Center for Victims of Torture later joined as a plaintiff through an amended complaint. The case was assigned to Judge Amir H. Ali and consolidated with a related case (Global Health Council v. Trump, No. 25-cv-402) involving additional organizational plaintiffs.\n\nThe litigation arose from President Trump's Executive Order 14169, \"Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid,\" issued on January 20, 2025, which immediately paused foreign development assistance pending a 90-day review. The State Department and USAID subsequently issued stop-work orders to foreign aid recipients, suspending thousands of grants and contracts. Plaintiffs, who were recipients of federal foreign assistance funding for HIV/AIDS prevention programs, journalism support, and torture victim assistance, alleged this freeze violated their existing agreements and threatened their organizational survival.\n\nPlaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act alleging the freeze was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, as well as constitutional claims alleging violations of the separation of powers and the Take Care Clause. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore their funding and halt the unlawful impoundment of congressionally appropriated funds. Plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from Public Citizen Litigation Group and Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer.\n\nOn February 13, 2025, after an emergency hearing, Judge Ali granted a temporary restraining order enjoining defendants from suspending or preventing the obligation or disbursement of foreign assistance funds for awards existing as of January 19, 2025. The court found plaintiffs had shown likelihood of success on their APA claims and irreparable harm from the funding freeze. When defendants failed to comply promptly, the court held additional enforcement hearings and issued orders requiring payment of outstanding invoices by specific deadlines.\n\nOn March 10, 2025, Judge Ali granted a preliminary injunction in part, finding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their separation of powers claim that the Executive had unlawfully impounded congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds in violation of the Impoundment Control Act. The court ordered defendants to make available for obligation the full amount of funds Congress appropriated for foreign assistance in fiscal year 2024, while setting feasibility benchmarks for processing payments. However, the court denied relief regarding the wholesale termination of awards, finding plaintiffs had not shown those decisions were insufficiently individualized.\n\nDefendants appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (Nos. 25-5046, 25-5047). On August 13, 2025, a divided panel reversed the district court's preliminary injunction regarding impoundment. The majority held that plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to bring their constitutional separation of powers claim, applying Dalton v. Specter to conclude that claims alleging the President exceeded statutory authority cannot be recast as constitutional violations. The court also found that the Impoundment Control Act precluded APA review by providing an exclusive enforcement mechanism through the Comptroller General. Judge Pan dissented, arguing the majority's ruling enabled Executive evasion of judicial review for constitutionally impermissible impoundment actions.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, defendants processed payments to plaintiffs for work completed before the funding freeze, as required by the district court's orders, while the broader impoundment issues remained subject to the appellate litigation. The case highlighted tensions between Executive foreign policy authority and Congressional appropriations power, ultimately resulting in a significant appellate ruling limiting private parties' ability to challenge presidential impoundment of appropriated funds.",
    "46093": "Pacito v. Trump was filed on February 10, 2025, in the Western District of Washington before Judge Jamal N. Whitehead. The case challenges President Trump's Executive Order 14163, \"Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program,\" issued on January 20, 2025, which indefinitely suspended refugee admissions and processing under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).\n\nThe plaintiffs include individual refugees using pseudonyms (such as Pacito, a Congolese refugee whose January 22 travel was canceled, leaving his family stranded at a transit center) and three resettlement organizations: HIAS Inc., Church World Service Inc., and Lutheran Community Services Northwest. The defendants are President Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (initially Dorothy A. Fink). Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from Perkins Coie LLP and other firms.\n\nThe legal challenge is brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and constitutional provisions including due process claims. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to restore refugee processing and funding for resettlement services. The case also involves a motion for class certification filed March 14, 2025.\n\nOn February 25, 2025, Judge Whitehead granted a preliminary injunction blocking implementation of the executive order's key provisions. The following day, the government terminated cooperative agreements with resettlement agencies, prompting plaintiffs to seek additional relief. On March 24, 2025, the court issued a second preliminary injunction ordering the government to reinstate the terminated agreements and resume refugee processing.\n\nThe government appealed both injunctions to the Ninth Circuit (case numbers 25-1313 and 25-1939). On March 25, 2025, the Ninth Circuit partially stayed the first injunction but preserved protection for refugees \"conditionally approved for refugee status by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services before January 20, 2025.\" On April 21, 2025, the Circuit further clarified that its limited exception applies only to individuals with \"a strong reliance interest arising prior to January 20, 2025, comparable to Plaintiff Pacito,\" requiring case-by-case determinations.\n\nThe court has issued multiple compliance and implementation orders addressing the scope of protected refugees and government obligations. On July 14, 2025, Judge Whitehead established an \"Injunction Implementation Framework\" and appointed Magistrate Judge Michelle L. Peterson to assist with case-by-case determinations of which refugees qualify for protection under the narrowed injunction.\n\nThe case remains ongoing with appeals pending in the Ninth Circuit and continued proceedings in the district court over compliance with the preliminary injunctions as modified by the appellate court's partial stay.",
    "46065": "On February 7, 2025, the States of Washington, Minnesota, and Oregon, along with three physicians, filed suit in the Western District of Washington challenging two executive orders issued by President Trump targeting gender-affirming medical care. The case was assigned to Judge Lauren King, with the State of Colorado later joining as an additional plaintiff. The states were represented by their attorneys general offices, while the physicians were represented by state attorneys.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges Executive Order 14,187, titled \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" and Executive Order 14,168, titled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.\" Section 4 of the first order directs federal agencies to immediately ensure that medical institutions receiving federal research or education grants cease providing gender-affirming care to individuals under 19 years old. Section 8(a) directs the Attorney General to prioritize enforcement of female genital mutilation laws against providers of gender-affirming care. The second order requires agencies to end federal funding of \"gender ideology\" and ensure grant funds do not promote such ideology.\n\nPlaintiffs brought constitutional claims under the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, alleging discrimination based on sex and transgender status, and separation of powers violations, arguing the President usurped Congress's exclusive spending authority by conditioning appropriated funds without congressional authorization. They also raised Tenth Amendment claims regarding the criminalization provisions, contending the President exceeded his authority by attempting to criminalize medical care that falls within states' police powers to regulate medicine. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the executive orders.\n\nThe case moved quickly through emergency proceedings. On the same day the complaint was filed, plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order. After briefing and a hearing on February 14, 2025, Judge King granted the TRO, enjoining all defendants except President Trump from enforcing Section 4 of the medical services order and the criminalization provisions within the plaintiff states. The court found plaintiffs likely to succeed on their separation of powers and equal protection claims.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding Colorado as a plaintiff and challenging additional sections of the gender ideology order. They simultaneously moved for a preliminary injunction. Following briefing and oral argument on February 28, 2025, Judge King granted the preliminary injunction in part. The court enjoined enforcement of Section 4 of the medical services order and Sections 3(e) and 3(g) of the gender ideology order within the plaintiff states, finding violations of separation of powers and equal protection. However, the court denied the preliminary injunction regarding Section 8(a)'s criminalization provisions, ruling plaintiffs lacked standing due to the absence of a credible prosecution threat.\n\nIn the court's detailed analysis, Judge King found the executive orders violated separation of powers by conditioning congressionally appropriated funds without authorization, usurping Congress's exclusive spending power. The court also found the orders discriminated based on sex and transgender status, requiring heightened scrutiny under equal protection doctrine, which the orders failed to satisfy due to their overbreadth and lack of substantial relationship to their stated purposes.\n\nEnforcement disputes arose almost immediately. On March 6, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt, alleging defendants violated the court's orders by terminating a gender-affirming care research grant to Seattle Children's Hospital. The National Institutes of Health had terminated the grant on February 28, 2025, citing that research based on \"gender identity\" was \"unscientific\" and inconsistent with \"biological realities.\" On March 17, 2025, Judge King denied the contempt motion, finding plaintiffs had not proven by clear and convincing evidence that the grant termination violated the court's orders, though the court criticized defendants' unreasonable interpretation of the injunction's scope. However, the court granted plaintiffs' alternative request for expedited discovery to investigate the circumstances of the grant termination.\n\nNotably, on March 28, 2025, defendants filed a notice of reinstatement, indicating NIH had reinstated the terminated Seattle Children's Hospital grant in full, suggesting the court's orders and threatened contempt proceedings influenced this reversal.\n\nDefendants have appealed the preliminary injunction order. On April 23, 2025, Judge King granted defendants' motion for a limited stay of proceedings pending the appeal, while preserving plaintiffs' ability to enforce the existing injunction and seek modifications if needed. The court noted that parallel litigation in the District of Maryland had been stayed on similar terms and that appellate resolution of the legal issues might simplify the case.\n\nThe case represents a significant constitutional challenge to executive power over federal spending and medical regulation, with substantial implications for transgender rights, federalism, and separation of powers doctrine. The court's preliminary injunction remains in effect, protecting gender-affirming care in the plaintiff states while the appeal proceeds.",
    "46057": "This case, filed on February 6, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington before Judge Benjamin H. Settle, challenges Executive Order 14183, \"Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness,\" issued by President Trump on January 27, 2025. The plaintiffs include seven transgender service members currently serving in the military with a collective 115+ years of service and over 70 medals, one transgender person seeking to enlist, and the Gender Justice League organization. They are represented by private counsel from Perkins Coie LLP, Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.\n\nThe case centers on the reversal of military policy regarding transgender service members. Historically, the military barred transgender individuals from serving openly until 2016, when then-Secretary Carter implemented a policy allowing open service after extensive study. This was followed by the more restrictive 2017 Mattis Policy, then the 2021 Austin Policy under President Biden that again permitted open transgender service. The 2025 executive order reversed the Austin Policy, establishing that individuals with gender dysphoria or a history of gender transition are presumptively disqualified from military service.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses and the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause, along with an equitable estoppel claim. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to block implementation of the ban. On February 19, 2025, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, Judge Settle granted the preliminary injunction and issued a universal nationwide injunction blocking implementation of the executive order and requiring maintenance of the Austin Policy. The court found plaintiffs likely to succeed on all claims, applying intermediate scrutiny to the equal protection claim and finding no substantial relationship between the ban and the government's stated interests in military readiness, unit cohesion, and cost management. The court also found likely First Amendment violations in restricting transgender expression and due process violations in retroactively punishing service members who had relied on the previous policy.\n\nThe government immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit (No. 25-2039), seeking both an administrative stay and a stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit denied both requests on March 31 and April 18, 2025, respectively. The government then applied to the Supreme Court for a stay, which the Court granted on May 6, 2025, effectively allowing the military ban to take effect while appeals continue.\n\nTwo related cases challenged the same policy: Talbott v. Trump in D.D.C., which resulted in a similar universal preliminary injunction, and Ireland v. Hegseth in D.N.J., which issued a temporary restraining order. The case remains on appeal with the preliminary injunction stayed by the Supreme Court.",
    "45965": "On January 21, 2025, CASA, Inc. and Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project—two immigrant rights organizations—along with five pregnant women proceeding under pseudonyms, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland challenging Executive Order 14,160. The Executive Order, signed by President Trump on January 20, 2025, purports to deny birthright citizenship to children born in the United States after February 19, 2025, if their mother was either unlawfully present or lawfully but temporarily present in the U.S. and their father was neither a U.S. citizen nor lawful permanent resident.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged the Executive Order violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause, which provides that \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States,\" as well as 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a), which codifies the same principle. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the order. The individual plaintiffs were pregnant women from various countries including Colombia, Venezuela, Russia, and others, who feared their children would be denied citizenship and potentially rendered stateless.\n\nOn February 5, 2025, Judge Deborah L. Boardman granted a nationwide preliminary injunction, finding the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed on the merits because the Executive Order contradicted binding Supreme Court precedent, particularly United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), which established that children born on U.S. soil are citizens regardless of their parents' immigration status, subject only to narrow historical exceptions. The court concluded the Executive Order would cause irreparable harm by denying constitutional rights to newborns.\n\nThe government appealed to the Fourth Circuit and sought to narrow the injunction's scope to apply only to the named plaintiffs. Both this court and the Fourth Circuit denied the government's stay requests. The government then petitioned the Supreme Court, which consolidated this case with similar challenges from Washington state and Massachusetts involving the same Executive Order.\n\nOn June 27, 2025, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision limiting federal courts' authority to issue universal injunctions. The Court held that such broad injunctions \"likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts\" under the Judiciary Act of 1789, because they lack historical precedent in English equity practice. However, the Court noted that Rule 23 class actions could provide an alternative avenue for broad relief, with Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence specifically noting that plaintiffs could \"seek to proceed by class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2)\" for potentially nationwide relief.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's guidance, the plaintiffs immediately filed an amended complaint seeking class certification. On July 29, 2025, the Fourth Circuit dismissed the government's appeal and remanded to allow the district court to address class certification. The court certified a nationwide class of all children born or to be born in the United States after February 19, 2025, who fall within the Executive Order's denial categories, with seven class representatives including both newborns (identified by initials like L.B., K.K., E.T.P., L.G.) and expected children.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Judge Boardman granted a classwide preliminary injunction, finding that Rule 23's requirements were satisfied and that the class faced the same likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm that supported the original injunction. The court noted that citizenship is \"a most precious right\" and that denying it to children born on U.S. soil would cause immediate and ongoing constitutional violations. The case represents both a constitutional challenge to presidential power over citizenship law and a significant development in federal court remedial authority following the Supreme Court's restrictions on universal injunctions.",
    "46180": "On February 25, 2025, the American Federation of Teachers, American Sociological Association, American Federation of Teachers-Maryland, and Eugene School District 4J filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against the Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon, and Acting Assistant Secretary Craig Trainor. The case, assigned to Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher, challenged two agency actions: a February 14, 2025 \"Dear Colleague Letter\" and an April 3, 2025 \"Certification Requirement.\"\n\nThe Dear Colleague Letter purported to \"clarify and reaffirm\" nondiscrimination obligations under Title VI following the Supreme Court's 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard. However, the Letter went beyond existing law by declaring that teaching about \"systemic and structural racism\" constituted \"toxic indoctrination\" and discriminatory conduct. It also characterized diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs as inherently discriminatory and threatened enforcement actions against educational institutions within 14 days. The Certification Requirement mandated that state and local education agencies certify compliance with the Department's interpretation of Title VI and SFFA within ten days, backed by threats of funding termination and False Claims Act liability.\n\nPlaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act alleging the actions were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and were issued without proper notice and comment procedures. They also raised First Amendment claims arguing the documents imposed viewpoint-based restrictions on educational speech, and Fifth Amendment claims asserting the requirements were unconstitutionally vague. The organizational plaintiffs sued on behalf of their educator members, while Eugene School District 4J sued directly as a federal funding recipient facing conflicting state and federal requirements.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, Judge Gallagher held an all-day motions hearing on plaintiffs' preliminary injunction requests. On April 24, 2025, she granted a preliminary injunction staying the Dear Colleague Letter under Section 705 of the APA, finding plaintiffs likely to succeed on multiple APA claims. However, she denied the separate motion regarding the Certification Requirement because it was not properly pleaded in the operative complaint. Similar cases in New Hampshire and the District of Columbia resulted in broader injunctions against both documents.\n\nAfter plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint incorporating the Certification Requirement, both parties moved for summary judgment. On August 14, 2025, Judge Gallagher granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on five of six counts, finding both agency actions violated the APA and constitutional provisions. The court held that both documents were legislative rules requiring notice and comment procedures, were arbitrary and capricious for failing to explain the agency's change in position or consider relevant factors, exceeded the Department's statutory authority by regulating curriculum content in violation of the Department of Education Organization Act, and violated the First and Fifth Amendments. The court vacated both the Dear Colleague Letter and Certification Requirement as unlawful agency actions, while noting the government remained free to pursue its policy priorities through proper legal procedures.",
    "45964": "On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 14160, titled \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\" which purported to deny U.S. citizenship to children born in the United States under two circumstances: (1) when the mother was unlawfully present and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, or (2) when the mother's presence was lawful but temporary and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. The Order directed federal agencies not to issue citizenship documents to such persons and not to accept state documents recognizing their citizenship, with implementation beginning 30 days after issuance.\n\nThe day after the Executive Order was signed, the States of Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Individual pregnant women also filed a putative class action, which was consolidated with the states' case. The plaintiffs challenged the Executive Order under the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause and Section 1401 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, both of which provide that persons \"born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" are U.S. citizens.\n\nU.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour granted a nationwide temporary restraining order on January 23, 2025, and a universal preliminary injunction on February 6, 2025. The court found that the states had standing based on concrete economic injuries, including loss of federal reimbursements for programs like Medicaid and CHIP when affected children would be deemed ineligible, and administrative costs to restructure eligibility systems. The court concluded the Executive Order likely violated both the Constitution and federal law, reasoning that the phrase \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means subject to U.S. authority and laws, with only narrow exceptions for diplomatic immunity and enemy occupation scenarios.\n\nSimilar lawsuits were filed nationwide, resulting in overlapping universal injunctions from district courts in Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. The government appealed and sought emergency stays, leading to Supreme Court review in Trump v. CASA, Inc., 606 U.S. ____ (2025). The Supreme Court held in June 2025 that universal injunctions likely exceed federal courts' equitable authority under the Judiciary Act of 1789, as they lack historical precedent in traditional equity practice. However, the Court left open whether universal relief might be justified to provide complete relief to state plaintiffs specifically.\n\nOn appeal to the Ninth Circuit (No. 25-807), the court affirmed the preliminary injunction in July 2025. The Ninth Circuit dismissed the individual plaintiffs' claims as covered by a certified nationwide class action in New Hampshire, but found the states had proper standing based on direct economic injuries. The court held the Executive Order violated the Fourteenth Amendment, concluding that the plain text, Supreme Court precedent in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), drafting history, and post-ratification understanding all supported interpreting \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" as referring to governmental authority rather than the narrower concept of political allegiance advanced by the government. The court also upheld the universal scope of the injunction as necessary to provide the states complete relief, given that residents may give birth across state lines and individuals may move between states.\n\nThe case represents a fundamental challenge to the Executive Branch's attempt to reinterpret the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship, with courts at both the district and appellate levels rejecting the government's constitutional interpretation while the Supreme Court has addressed the remedial scope of universal injunctions as a separate procedural issue.",
    "VR-SC-0078": "Mary T. Thomas and other individual plaintiffs, along with organizational plaintiffs The Family Unit, Inc. and the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP, filed this Section 1983 civil rights action on April 22, 2020, in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. The plaintiffs were represented by the ACLU, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and private counsel. Judge J. Michelle Childs presided over the case.\n\nThe lawsuit challenged two South Carolina absentee voting requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, plaintiffs attacked the \"Excuse Requirement\" under S.C. Code § 7-15-320, which limited absentee voting to specific categories of voters such as those over 65, physically disabled persons, students, and others in enumerated situations. Second, they challenged the \"Witness Requirement\" under S.C. Code § 7-15-220, which mandated that all absentee ballots be signed by a third-party witness in addition to the voter.\n\nPlaintiffs argued these requirements violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments' protection of the fundamental right to vote, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. They claimed the requirements forced voters to choose between protecting their health during the pandemic and exercising their voting rights, creating an unconstitutional burden. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment that the requirements were unconstitutional and injunctive relief preventing their enforcement.\n\nThe individual plaintiffs included Mary Thomas, an 86-year-old African-American retiree living alone in Charleston; Nea Richard, a 22-year-old African-American student and poll worker; and Jeremy Rutledge, a 49-year-old pastor with systemic scleroderma who was at high risk from COVID-19. The organizational plaintiffs represented members who faced similar challenges in accessing absentee voting during the pandemic.\n\nOn April 28, 2020, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. The South Carolina Republican Party successfully intervened on May 8, 2020, followed later by South Carolina legislative leaders Speaker Jay Lucas and Senate President Harvey Peeler.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, the court granted a preliminary injunction, but only as to the witness requirement and only for the June 2020 primaries. The court found that requiring voters to obtain witness signatures during the pandemic imposed a severe burden on the right to vote that was not justified by the state's interests.\n\nDuring the litigation, the South Carolina General Assembly addressed the excuse requirement by passing emergency legislation (S.635) that allowed all qualified voters to vote absentee for the June 9, 2020 primary and June 23, 2020 runoff elections. Governor McMaster signed this bill on May 13, 2020, but the law expired on July 1, 2020, leaving the original requirements in place for future elections.\n\nPlaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 13, 2020, continuing to challenge both requirements for the November 2020 general election and future elections. On August 10, 2020, defendants filed motions for summary judgment arguing that plaintiffs lacked standing and that the challenged requirements were constitutional.\n\nThe case was stayed on September 18, 2020, apparently in connection with a related case, Middleton v. Andino (3:20-cv-01730-JMC), which also challenged South Carolina's absentee voting requirements. The court noted that the Middleton case had resolved the issues to be tried in Thomas, effectively ending active proceedings in this case without a final resolution on the merits of the constitutional challenges to South Carolina's absentee voting laws."
