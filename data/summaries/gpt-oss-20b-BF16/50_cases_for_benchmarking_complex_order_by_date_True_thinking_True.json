    "46567": "A Venezuelan national, detained at the Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island on May 5, 2025. The petitioner, who has a pending asylum and withholding‑of‑removal application, alleges that the U.S. President, in his official capacity, issued a Presidential Proclamation on March 14, 2025 that invoked the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to remove all Venezuelan citizens over 14 who are members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The petitioner denies gang membership and claims that the Proclamation lacks the statutory predicates of the AEA, violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Convention Against Torture (CAT), and the Fifth Amendment’s due‑process clause. He seeks a declaratory judgment that the Proclamation is unlawful, injunctive relief to prevent his removal, and attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act.\n\nThe respondents include the President, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Department of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of ICE, ICE itself, the Secretary of State, the State Department, the Secretary of Defense, the Defense Department, the acting director of ICE’s Boston Field Office, and the warden of Wyatt Detention Facility. The case is brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Foundation, and the Union Foundation of Rhode Island, and is an individual action (not a class action).\n\nThe petition is based on federal habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and on statutory claims against the AEA (50 U.S.C. §§ 21‑24), the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.), CAT (8 U.S.C. § 1231 note), and due process under the Fifth Amendment. The petitioner requests a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary injunction to prevent his removal, a declaratory judgment that the Proclamation is unlawful, and attorneys’ fees.\n\nJudge Melissa R. DuBose presided over the case. On May 5, 2025 she issued an order requiring respondents to provide at least 48‑hour notice before moving the petitioner out of the district. On May 7, 2025 she amended the order to require 72‑hour notice. These orders are pending further proceedings.\n\nThe case is related to, but not consolidated with, a number of other federal actions involving the same Proclamation: J.G.G. v. Trump (2025 WL 914682, 2025 WL 890401), J.A.V. v. Trump (2025 WL 1257450), D.B.U. v. Trump (2025 WL 1163530), and G.F.F. v. Trump (2025 WL 1166480). The Supreme Court’s decision in J.G.G. v. Trump (145 S. Ct. 1003) vacated a TRO and clarified that individuals designated under the Proclamation are entitled to notice and a reasonable opportunity to seek habeas review before removal.\n\nNo settlement has been reached, and no monitor has been appointed. The petitioner’s factual basis is that he is a Venezuelan national who was arrested on March 26, 2025, denied bond on May 1, 2025, and faces imminent summary removal under the Proclamation to El Salvador, where he would likely be imprisoned incommunicado and exposed to torture. The petition asserts that such removal would violate the AEA’s statutory predicates, the INA’s exclusive removal procedures, CAT’s prohibition on return to a country of likely torture, and the Fifth Amendment’s due‑process guarantees. The case remains pending, with the court’s orders pending further adjudication.",
    "46582": "On April 30, 2025, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, received a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a request for an order to show cause from Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian‑born, U.S.‑resident who had been detained at the Prairieland Detention Facility in Alvarado, Texas, since March 14, 2025.  The petition was filed by private counsel from the Texas Civil Rights Project and other allied attorneys.  \n\nRespondents are the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the Attorney General of the United States, the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Acting Director of ICE Enforcement & Removal Operations for the Dallas Field Office, and the Warden of Prairieland Detention Facility.  The case is an individual action, not a class action.  \n\nKordia’s petition is grounded in a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and an order to show cause under 28 U.S.C. § 2243.  She also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (42 U.S.C. § 2000bb‑1(c)), alleging violations of the First Amendment, Fifth‑Amendment due‑process, and RFRA.  The petition contends that Kordia was detained on the basis of protected speech—her attendance at a peaceful protest in New York City in April 2024 to mourn Palestinians killed in Gaza—and protected association—her single money transfer to a relative in Palestine.  The government’s policy, pursuant to executive orders issued by the former administration, targets noncitizens for pro‑Palestinian advocacy, and Kordia’s detention is presented as punitive viewpoint discrimination.  \n\nThe petition details Kordia’s conditions of confinement: overcrowded housing, lack of halal meals, failure to provide a prayer mat or suitable clothing for prayer, and denial of food at the times she was permitted to fast during Ramadan.  She reports severe weight loss (≈30 % of her pre‑detention weight), frequent migraines, dizziness, and a rash from sleeping on the concrete floor.  The petition also notes that ICE transferred her from New Jersey to Texas without the required notice to her attorney or the presence of a bond hearing, in violation of ICE policy and the automatic‑stay rule that normally requires a decision on bond before a 90‑day stay can take effect.  \n\nOn June 5, 2025, Magistrate Judge Rebecca Rutherford held a hearing on Kordia’s motion for a preliminary injunction.  The magistrate judge recommended that Kordia be released from detention pending a final judgment on her habeas claims.  The court subsequently ordered the release of Kordia pending final judgment on June 27, 2025, and issued an order to show cause, directing respondents to explain why she should not be released within three days.  The petition has not been appealed, and no settlement has been reached.  The case remains pending final judgment.",
    "46496": "On April 24, 2025, a human‑rights nonprofit, a coalition of border communities, and a nonprofit legal‑services organization filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, alleging that the Department unlawfully closed three offices mandated by law—the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman—by placing employees on administrative leave, terminating contractors, and preventing the offices from performing their statutory duties. Plaintiffs claim the closures were ultra vires, violated the Administrative Procedure Act, and deprived them of essential channels for filing complaints and obtaining information, causing irreparable harm. They seek declaratory judgment that the Department’s actions are unlawful and injunctive relief ordering the Department to reverse the reductions in force, reinstate employees, and resume the offices’ statutory functions; they also seek costs and attorney fees. The case was assigned to Judge Ana C. Reyes on April 28, 2025 and is an individual action with counsel from public‑interest law firms and the plaintiffs’ own attorneys. Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on May 8 and a motion for a temporary restraining order on May 23; the court denied both motions, scheduled a hearing for arguments in January 2026, and required the parties to submit status reports. No settlement or decree has been issued, and no appellate action has been filed. The factual basis centers on the March 21, 2025 closure of the offices, the statutory mandates under 6 U.S.C. §§ 345, 272, 205, the APA, and the plaintiffs’ reliance on those offices for civil‑rights oversight.",
    "46432": "Mohammed H., a 20‑year‑old Bangladeshi student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota on April 18, 2025. He alleged that the U.S. government—represented by the President, Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary of State, and local officials who detained him—had unlawfully detained him on the basis of his protected speech supporting Palestinian human rights. The petitioner claimed violations of the First Amendment (free speech), the Fifth Amendment (due process), and the Administrative Procedure Act, and sought release from detention and a prohibition on transfer out of the district.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, Mohammed H. filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, and Judge Jerry W. Blackwell granted it on April 22, 2025. The order barred the respondents from removing or transferring him from the District of Minnesota and required the government to answer by April 25. The TRO was extended on May 5, May 20, and June 3, 2025, each time for an additional two weeks.\n\nThe court also ordered the respondents to release Mohammed H. on bail pending adjudication on May 5, 2025, and set the bail at $7,500. On June 17, 2025, Judge Blackwell granted the writ of habeas corpus, holding that the detention was unlawful and ordering Mohammed H. to be released from custody. The judgment, entered on June 18, 2025, confirmed the habeas ruling and finalized the release.\n\nThe respondents filed an appeal to the Eighth Circuit on July 29, 2025, which was transmitted to appellate review on July 30, 2025. No settlement or monitoring order was issued, and the case proceeded solely through the motions and orders described above. The factual basis for the claims centers on Mohammed H.’s arrest on March 28, 2025, his detention in the Freeborn County Jail, the subsequent automatic stay by DHS, and the alleged targeting of his protected political speech. The court’s rulings ultimately determined that the government’s detention violated constitutional and procedural protections, resulting in the petitioner's release and the prohibition of transfer.",
    "46477": "In April 2025, thirty‑one international students—F‑1 and M‑1 scholars attending universities in Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, and Wisconsin—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan (Case 1:25‑cv‑00419‑JMB‑PJG).  They sued Kristi Noem, then Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Todd Lyons, then Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Robert Lynch, then Field Office Director of Detroit‑ICE, alleging that the Department’s sudden termination of their SEVIS records violated the Due Process Clause of the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by acting arbitrarily and capriciously without lawful grounds.  The students claimed that the terminations were based on a vague “failure to maintain status” notification that did not reflect any criminal conviction or statutory violation; the actions caused them to lose employment authorizations and exposed them to removal proceedings.  The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief to restore their SEVIS records, preserve their optional practical training (OPT) authorizations, and prevent further removal actions.\n\nJudge Jane M. Beckering granted the plaintiffs an emergency temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 23 2025, ordering the defendants to set aside the terminations, restore the students’ records retroactively, prohibit further termination absent a valid statutory ground, preserve OPT authorizations, and forbid arrest, detention, transfer, or removal based on the terminated status.  The TRO was set to expire after 14 days unless extended.  After a hearing on May 6 2025, the court issued a preliminary injunction on May 7 2025, maintaining the TRO’s terms and extending them pending further proceedings.  No settlement was reached; the case remains pending with the defendants filing an interlocutory appeal on July 7 2025.  The court’s orders constitute the only decrees in the case, and no monitor or further compliance reports have been ordered.  The factual basis centers on the unilateral termination of the students’ SEVIS records by SEVP on or about March 28 2025, the lack of statutory justification for those terminations, and the consequential harms to the students’ legal status, employment, and academic progress.",
    "46239": "On March 17, 2025 Erie County, New York—represented by private counsel Gerstein Harrow LLP—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Corporation for National and Community Service (AmeriCorps) and Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, the agency’s interim head. Erie County sought injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that AmeriCorps’ new certification requirement—mandating that the county certify it does not promote “DEI” (diversity, equity, and inclusion) activities in response to President Trump’s Executive Orders 14151 and 14173—violated the Administrative Procedures Act and the Spending Clause of the Constitution. The complaint noted that AmeriCorps had approved a three‑year Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) grant in January 2024, but in February 2025 threatened to terminate the grant unless the county provided the required certification. Erie County filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on March 21, 2025, asking the court to enjoin AmeriCorps from imposing the certification and to disburse the grant funds without the county’s compliance statement. On April 4, 2025 the defendants filed an opposition memorandum. On April 14, 2025 Erie County voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice, citing that AmeriCorps had altered its certification requirements since the complaint was filed; the motion for preliminary injunction was withdrawn. Chief Judge James E. Boasberg presided over the case. No court orders, judgments, trials, appeals, settlements, or monitoring reports were issued, and the case was resolved by the plaintiff’s dismissal.",
    "46230": "On March 14, 2025 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia received a complaint filed by Jane Doe 1‑6 and John Doe 7‑12, career civil servants employed in the Veterans Benefits Administration’s Office of Equity Assurance (OEA), against Douglas A. Collins, Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The plaintiffs allege that the Department’s designation of the OEA as a “DEIA” office and its subsequent closure, the placement of the plaintiffs on administrative leave on January 22, 2025, and the application of a reduction‑in‑force (RIF) action violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) § 706 and the plaintiffs’ First and Fifth Amendment rights. They seek injunctive and declaratory relief, monetary damages, and attorney’s fees. Judge Rudolph Contreras, who was assigned to the case, denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order on May 2, 2025 after the defendant filed opposition and the parties presented oral arguments. No settlement or decree has been entered, and the case remains pending. The plaintiffs’ claims rest on the fact that the OEA, created in 2023 and staffed by career employees with no record of misconduct, was closed and its staff removed under Executive Order 14151, which ordered the termination of DEI, DEIA, and environmental‑justice offices. The plaintiffs assert that the Department’s actions were arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory, and that they deprived the plaintiffs of due process and equal protection.",
    "46242": "On March 5, 2025, BlueRibbon Coalition, Inc., Sage Riders Motorcycle Club, and individual plaintiff Paul Wells filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah (Southern Division) challenging the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) December 31, 2024 San Rafael Swell Travel Management Plan and its Decision Record. The plaintiffs allege that BLM’s closure of 665 miles of motorized‑vehicle routes within the San Rafael Swell Travel Management Area (TMA) violates the Dingell Act (16 U.S.C. § 1132), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. §§ 4321‑4332), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. §§ 701‑706). They argue that the closures create de‑facto wilderness and wild‑river boundaries, impose prohibited buffer zones, fail to follow NEPA’s “hard‑look” and EIS requirements, and are arbitrary and capricious. The relief sought is a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction to halt enforcement of the travel plan, and costs and attorney fees.\n\nOn March 6, 2025 the plaintiffs filed a Motion for Relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705 (preliminary injunction). The following day, on March 10, 2025, Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA) filed a motion to intervene as a defendant, arguing that its environmental interests in the TMA could be impaired by the court’s ruling. Judge David Nuffer granted SUWA’s motion to intervene on April 21, 2025, and granted the plaintiffs’ scheduling order on March 25, 2025, setting a date for briefing on the preliminary‑injunction motion. The BLM filed a memorandum in opposition on April 3, 2025, and no ruling on the injunction has yet been issued.\n\nThe case has not yet gone to trial or appeal. No settlement or decree has been entered, and no monitoring order is in place. The litigation centers on whether BLM’s travel‑management decisions, made under the auspices of the Dingell Act and NEPA, were lawful, and whether the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment and injunction to prevent further enforcement of the plan. The court is currently proceeding under Judge David Nuffer.",
    "46039": "On February 4 , 2025, the Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association (FBIAA) together with a group of FBI agents—John Doe 1‑4 and Jane Doe 1‑3 (“the Plaintiffs”)—filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (Case No. 1:25‑cv‑00328).  The Plaintiffs allege that the United States Department of Justice (“Defendant”) and the United States of America have retaliated against them for their lawful investigations of the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot by planning to disclose their employment information and by threatening to terminate them.  The complaint asserts violations of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the statutory right to mandamus under 28 U.S.C. § 1361, and constitutional claims under the First and Fifth Amendments.  The Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief—including a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction—declaratory judgment, and a mandamus directing the Defendants to cease the alleged retaliation.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Jia M. Cobb.  On February 4 , 2025 the Plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a motion to proceed under pseudonyms.  The Defendants filed an opposition to the TRO.  On February 7 , 2025 Judge Cobb issued an order granting an administrative stay that barred the DOJ from disclosing the requested FBI personnel list outside the Department of Justice until the court’s next hearing.  The order also set a schedule for a TRO hearing on February 8 (later moved to February 7) and for a preliminary injunction hearing on March 27 , 2025, with deadlines for filing motions and replies.  The court subsequently vacated the stay and directed the parties to appear for the preliminary injunction hearing on March 27 , 2025.  The case was consolidated with a related action (Case No. 25‑cv‑00325) on the same day.\n\nNo trial, appeal, or settlement has been reported.  The court has not issued any decree or monitoring order.  The factual record shows that the DOJ issued a memorandum on January 31 , 2025 requesting FBI agents to provide a list of personnel who worked on investigations related to the January 6 riot and a related terrorism case.  The DOJ also indicated it would review personnel actions, including possible terminations.  Plaintiffs argue that this information will be used to target them, expose them to threats, and retaliate for their investigative work.  The complaint contends that the DOJ’s actions violate the Privacy Act and constitutional rights, and that injunctive relief is necessary to prevent irreparable harm.",
    "46681": "On February 3 2025, a private citizen of the United States, representing himself, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade a complaint against the United States government—specifically the Office of the President—claiming that President Donald J. Trump had unconstitutionally imposed tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada, and China under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.  The plaintiff alleged that the President’s actions violated the Constitution’s grant of tariff‑setting power to Congress (Article I, §8), the separation‑of‑powers doctrine, and the President’s oath of office, and that the tariffs would raise prices and erode consumer purchasing power.  He sought declaratory judgment and both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to halt the tariff program.  \n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Jennifer Choe‑Groves.  The United States, through counsel from the Department of Justice, filed a motion to dismiss on March 21 2025, arguing that the plaintiff lacked Article III standing because he had not alleged a concrete, particularized injury and that the injury was not traceable to the challenged tariffs.  The plaintiff replied on April 22 2025, asserting that his constitutional injury was sufficient and pleading for injunctive relief.  The defendant filed a supporting reply on May 9 2025, reiterating the standing deficiencies and citing Supreme Court precedent to preclude the claim.  \n\nOn May 23 2025, Judge Choe‑Groves issued an opinion (slip opinion 25‑65) granting the motion to dismiss and dismissing the complaint without prejudice.  The court held that the plaintiff had not presented an injury in fact and that the alleged abstract constitutional claim was not redressable by a court decision.  The dismissal allowed the plaintiff to file an amended complaint on or before June 23 2025.  No trial, settlement, decree, or monitoring order has been entered.  The case remains on the docket, with subsequent procedural deadlines set for the defendant’s answer and any further motions.",
    "46758": "The case was filed on June 20 2025 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by individual plaintiffs Carlos Osorto, Pedro Vasquez‑Perdomo, and Isaac Villegas Molina, together with several labor‑union associations (United Farm Workers of America, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Los Angeles Worker Center Network, and others). The plaintiffs sued federal officials and agencies responsible for immigration enforcement—namely the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)—for violating the Fourth Amendment’s reasonable‑suspicion requirement and for unlawful detention under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.  Their primary remedy was an injunction: a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from conducting detentive stops in the Central District of California without reasonable suspicion.  \n\nOn July 11 2025 Judge Maame Ewusi‑Mensah granted the TRO and preliminary injunction, finding that the defendants’ “Operation At Large” involved detentive stops based on race, language, location, and type of work, which constituted unconstitutional seizures.  The defendants then filed an ex parte motion for a stay pending appeal on July 14 2025, but the Ninth Circuit denied the motion on July 16 2025 for failure to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(a)(2)(A).  The appellate court later denied the stay again on August 4 2025, except for a narrow exclusion of the “except as permitted by law” clause.  No appellate court has yet addressed the merits of the TRO.  \n\nSeparately, on July 21 2025, Osorto filed an ex parte application for release from ICE custody.  Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym granted the application on July 30 2025, ordering the plaintiff’s release upon posting a $5,000 bond and placement on ankle‑monitoring.  The order was a temporary release order, not a permanent judgment.  \n\nThe case remains pending on the merits of the TRO and the defendants’ appeal.  No settlement has been reached, and no reported opinions are available.  The factual basis centers on alleged unlawful detentions and arrests under “Operation At Large,” with the plaintiffs asserting that the stops were made without reasonable suspicion, violating their Fourth Amendment rights.",
    "46378": "On April 10, 2025, four international students—Chinmay Deore, Yogesh Joshi, Xiangyun Bu, and Qiuyi Yang—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, and the Field Office Director of ICE in Detroit. The students, all enrolled at Michigan universities, alleged that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had unilaterally terminated their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records on April 4–8, 2025, without providing notice, a reason, or an opportunity to respond. They claimed that these terminations violated their Fifth Amendment right to due process and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because the actions were arbitrary, capricious, and not grounded in the statutory or regulatory basis that permits termination of F‑1 status (8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d)). Their relief sought was a temporary restraining order followed by a preliminary injunction that would restore their F‑1 student status, prohibit further termination, and bar removal proceedings or detention. The plaintiffs were represented by the ACLU of Michigan, the American Civil Liberties Union, and private law firms.\n\nJudge Stephen J. Murphy III presided over the case. After the government’s response, the court denied the TRO on April 17, 2025, citing insufficient evidence that the SEVIS terminations constituted a final agency action that deprived the students of a protected interest. The court scheduled a preliminary‑injunction hearing for May 19, 2025, and issued a preliminary‑injunction scheduling order. Subsequent motions for discovery and supplemental statements were filed, but no trial or substantive ruling on the merits was issued. The case was ultimately dismissed on May 29, 2025, with no settlement or court‑imposed decree. No monitoring or post‑judgment enforcement actions were reported. The case centers on the legal question of whether a SEVIS record termination without notice is an actionable deprivation of F‑1 status under due‑process and APA doctrines.",
    "46385": "On April 9, 2025, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, received a complaint filed by Sheila Bedi and Lynn Cohn, two clinical professors at Northwestern University’s Pritzker School of Law. The complaint accuses the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce—along with its Chair, Tim Walberg, and Subcommittee Chair, Burgess Owens—of overstepping its authority by demanding, under threat of withholding federal funding, that Northwestern produce a wide range of documents about its law school’s clinics, budgets, donor lists, and the hiring and performance review records of Professor Bedi. The plaintiffs allege that the Committee’s letter constitutes viewpoint‑based retaliation and chilling of protected speech, association, and petition, and that it also violates their Fifth‑Amendment due‑process rights and the Sixth‑Amendment right to counsel. They seek declaratory relief that the Committee’s demands are unconstitutional and injunctive relief—both preliminary and permanent—to enjoin the Committee from obtaining the documents and to prevent Northwestern from complying with the demands. The case was assigned to Judge Elaine E. Bucklo. An emergency motion for a temporary restraining order was filed the same day; Judge Wood heard the motion and denied it without prejudice on April 10, 2025. No decree, settlement, or monitoring order has been issued, and the case remains pending in the district court.",
    "46353": "On April 7, 2025, John Doe, a software engineer in a lawful F‑1 student status who was employed under a post‑graduate STEM Optional Practical Training (OPT) authorization, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division. The complaint was brought by Doe’s attorneys from Van Der Hout LLP and alleges that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency unlawfully terminated Doe’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record on March 28, 2025, without any statutory basis or notice. The defendants named in the action are Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President; Moises Becerra, Acting Field Office Director of ICE in San Francisco; Todd M. Lyons, Acting Director of ICE; and Kristi Noem, Secretary of DHS.  \n\nDoe’s complaint asserts claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Declaratory Judgment Act, the Fifth Amendment’s due‑process clause, and the Accardi doctrine. The statutory foundation cited includes the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 237(a)(1)(C)(i) and 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i), along with regulatory guidance that permits ICE to terminate a SEVIS record only in limited circumstances. Doe seeks a declaratory judgment that the SEVIS termination was unlawful, an injunction preventing any enforcement action that flows from the termination, restoration of his SEVIS record, and attorneys’ fees.  \n\nOn April 16, 2025, Doe filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendants from arresting, detaining, transferring, or removing him while the litigation proceeds. The court granted the TRO on April 25, 2025, extending it for fourteen days, and set a preliminary‑injunction hearing for May 13, 2025. The court later granted a preliminary injunction on May 22, 2025, enjoining the defendants from taking enforcement action, restoring Doe’s SEVIS record, and prohibiting the defendants from imposing any legal effect of the termination.  \n\nThe case is part of a group of related actions involving other students who experienced similar SEVIS terminations, and the court has referred the case to determine relationship with those cases. No settlement has been reached, and the defendants have appealed the preliminary‑injunction order to the Ninth Circuit as of July 21, 2025. The factual basis of the complaint centers on the abrupt, apparently arbitrary termination of Doe’s SEVIS record, the lack of any violation of his F‑1 status, and the alleged policy of targeting students from certain nationalities. The court’s orders aim to preserve Doe’s status and prevent further enforcement actions pending a final determination of the claims.",
    "46337": "On April 3 2025, a collective complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts by the attorneys general of nineteen sovereign states—California, Nevada, Massachusetts, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin—against President Donald J. Trump (in his official capacity), Attorney General Pamela Bondi, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the United States Election Assistance Commission, and its commissioners Donald L. Palmer, Thomas Hicks, Christy McCormick, and Benjamin W. Hovland.  \n\nThe plaintiffs allege that Executive Order No. 14248, issued by the President on March 25 2025, unlawfully commandeers state election officials and the Election Assistance Commission to alter the federal voter‑registration form to require documentary proof of citizenship, mandates the Secretary of Defense to modify the federal post‑card application in a similar fashion, directs the Attorney General to enforce a narrow interpretation of federal election‑day statutes that would bar states from counting late‑received absentee ballots, and conditions federal election‑security funding on compliance with these provisions.  The complaint argues that the order violates the Constitution’s Elections Clause and Electors Clause, the statutory framework of the National Voter Registration Act, the Help America Vote Act, and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, and that it infringes on state sovereignty and congressional authority.  The remedy sought is a declaratory judgment that the challenged provisions of the order are void, together with preliminary and permanent injunctive relief preventing their enforcement by any defendant other than the President.  \n\nJudge Denise J. Casper granted a preliminary injunction on June 13 2025, enjoining the defendants from implementing sections 2(a), 2(d), 3(d), 7(a), and 7(b) of the executive order.  The injunction was amended on July 18 2025 to clarify its scope and to allow the defendants to take lawful action unrelated to the injunction.  The defendants’ motion to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia was denied, and they filed a motion to dismiss on June 13 2025, which has not yet been ruled upon.  On July 31 2025, the defendants appealed to the First Circuit.  No trial, settlement, or court‑appointed monitor has yet occurred.  The case is related to the League of United Latin American Citizens v. Executive Officer of the President (No. 25‑cv‑0946‑CKK) in the District of Columbia, which also challenged the same executive order.",
    "46238": "On March 17, 2025, two transgender Air Force service members—Master Sergeant Logan Ireland and Staff Sergeant Nicholas Bear Bade—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (Case No. 1:25‑cv‑01918) against the Secretary of Defense, Peter B. Hegseth; Acting Secretary of the Air Force, Gary Ashworth; the United States of America; and the Department of the Air Force.  The plaintiffs allege that President Trump’s Executive Order 14183, “Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness,” and the earlier Gender Ideology Order 14168, issued in January 2025, reverse the policy that allowed transgender individuals to serve in the armed forces and impose discriminatory requirements that force transgender service members to serve in their birth sex or face involuntary separation.  Under the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection and Due Process clauses, the plaintiffs seek declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to prevent the implementation of the orders and to stop the Department of Defense (DoD) from initiating administrative separation proceedings that would terminate their service.\n\nThe case is heard by Judge Christine P. O’Hearn.  The plaintiffs are represented by a private counsel team from GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Stapleton Segal Cochran LLC.\n\nAfter the complaint was filed, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on March 18, 2025.  Judge O’Hearn entered an order to show cause on the same day, directing the defendants to appear on March 24, 2025.  The defendants filed an opposition to the TRO on March 20, and the plaintiffs replied on March 21.  On March 24, Judge O’Hearn granted the TRO, prohibiting the DoD from initiating involuntary separation proceedings against the plaintiffs and requiring the department to keep the voluntary separation offer open pending the case.  The TRO was set for 14 days, effective immediately.\n\nOn March 25, the defendants requested a stay of the TRO but Judge O’Hearn denied the request on March 26, noting that the stay was not supported by the record.  The case was later voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs on May 15, 2025.\n\nThe action is consolidated with the nationwide injunction case Talbott v. United States (Case No. 1:25‑cv‑00240), which also challenges the same executive orders.  The filings reference related precedent, including Bostock v. Clayton County, Karnoski v. Trump, and other cases addressing transgender rights and military policy.  The factual basis for the plaintiffs’ claim is that the new orders require them to serve in their birth sex, have already placed them on administrative absence, and threaten involuntary separation as early as March 26, 2025; they argue that this constitutes unconstitutional discrimination and that the harm they face is irreparable.",
    "46234": "The United States District Court for the Northern District of New York entered the action on March 15, 2025, when the plaintiffs—Momodou Taal, a non‑citizen Ph.D. student at Cornell University; Mũkoma Wa Ngũgĩ, a U.S. citizen professor of English; and Sriram Parasurama, a U.S. citizen Ph.D. student in plant sciences—filed a complaint against Donald J. Trump in his official capacity as President, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security.  The plaintiffs alleged that Executive Orders 14161 and 14188, issued January 30 and February 3, 2025, respectively, unlawfully restricted protected speech and threatened deportation and criminal prosecution of non‑citizens and citizens who criticize the U.S. government or the State of Israel.  The causes of action were constitutional: violations of the First Amendment’s protections of speech, association, and receipt of information, and violations of the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of due process.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, specifically a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order to halt enforcement of the challenged provisions.\n\nU.S. District Judge Elizabeth C. Coombe handled the case.  On March 20, 2025 the court denied the plaintiffs’ ex‑parte motion for a temporary restraining order, finding that the plaintiffs had not met the statutory and evidentiary thresholds for such extraordinary relief.  The denial was reaffirmed in the court’s final order issued March 27, 2025, which also noted that the plaintiffs had filed an amended complaint and a petition for writ of habeas corpus but had not pursued any further motions.  No trial, appeal, or settlement occurred.  On March 31, 2025 the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i), and the court closed the case without prejudice on April 2, 2025.  No decrees, monitoring arrangements, or enforceable settlements were issued or entered.\n\nThe factual context is that Taal’s visa was revoked on March 14, 2025, and he was threatened with removal proceedings based on the executive orders’ definitions of “hostile attitude” and “anti‑Semitic” activity.  The plaintiffs asserted that these actions created a chilling effect on their First Amendment rights and violated the Fifth Amendment’s due‑process protections.  The case ended with a voluntary dismissal, leaving the constitutional claims unresolved.",
    "46216": "On March 12, 2025, Dr. Gordon Schiff, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Celeste Royce, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The plaintiffs alleged that the President’s Executive Order 14168 (“Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”) and a subsequent OPM memorandum directed federal agencies to remove from their websites any content that “promotes or inculcates gender ideology.” Following that guidance, AHRQ removed two commentaries authored by the plaintiffs from its Patient Safety Network (PSNet): a 2022 article on suicide risk assessment and a 2020 article on endometriosis. The plaintiffs contend the removal was viewpoint‑based, arbitrary, and a violation of the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act. They sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief—including restoration of the removed articles—and attorney’s fees.  \n\nJudge Leo T. Sorokin, who presided over the case, granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction on May 23, 2025. The injunction required AHRQ to restore the two commentaries and all other content removed under the same directive and to refrain from further removals. The court dismissed the defendants’ motion to dismiss and found that the plaintiffs had standing, that the removal was unconstitutional, and that irreparable harm would result without relief. No settlement has been reached, and the case remains pending. No monitor has been appointed, and the decree will remain in effect until the court’s final judgment.",
    "46207": "The case was filed on March 7, 2025, by transgender federal‑prison inmates Alishea Kingdom, Solo Nichols, and Jas Kapule, together with a class of similarly situated inmates.  The defendants are President Donald J. Trump in his official capacity, Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi, Acting Director of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) William W. Lothrop, and key BOP officials Christopher A. Bina, Dana R. Digiacomo, and Shane Salem.  The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, the Transgender Law Center, Morgan Lewis LLP, and the ACLU Foundation of the District of Columbia, allege that the BOP’s implementation of Executive Order 14168 (issued January 20, 2025) and two subsequent BOP memoranda (February 21 and 28, 2025) categorically deny gender‑affirming medical care and related accommodations to inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria.  The complaint claims violations of the Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual punishment), the Fifth Amendment equal‑protection clause, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Administrative Procedure Act.  The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to set aside the executive order and memoranda, restore hormone therapy and accommodations, and prevent future enforcement of the ban.  The case was assigned to Judge Royce C. Lamberth.  It is related to the parallel case Doe v. McHenry, No. 25‑cv‑286‑RCL.  After the complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification on March 17, 2025.  Judge Lamberth granted both motions on June 3, 2025, ordering the BOP to restore the denied care and prohibiting enforcement of the executive order and memoranda.  The injunction, initially temporary, was extended through November 30, 2025.  The factual basis is that the plaintiffs had been receiving medically necessary hormone therapy and gender‑affirming accommodations prior to the executive order; the BOP’s new policies abruptly halted this care, causing severe psychological harm.  The order requires the BOP to resume hormone therapy and accommodations for all class members and to cease enforcement of the executive order’s prohibition.",
    "46104": "American Oversight, a Washington, D.C.–based nonprofit that promotes government transparency, sued the federal government on February 11, 2025, alleging violations of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Declaratory Judgment Act.  The defendants are the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (the newly created “DOGE”), its subordinate agencies—the U.S. DOGE Service, the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, and the U.S. Digital Service—and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  The complaint accuses the defendants of failing to comply with FOIA’s time‑limits, refusing to expedite requests, conducting inadequate searches, and withholding non‑exempt records that matter to the public interest.  The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the defendants to process and produce the requested records, as well as attorneys’ fees and costs under FOIA.\n\nThe case is before U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell.  No other cases have been consolidated with it, and no related litigation is cited.\n\nAfter the complaint, American Oversight filed a series of FOIA requests on January 30, 2025, requesting internal communications about the removal of inspectors general and other matters.  The defendants failed to respond within the statutory 10‑day period for expedited requests, and they did not provide a final determination on the FOIA requests.  On April 2, 2025, Judge Howell granted a preservation order requiring the defendants to preserve all records responsive to the eight FOIA requests and to disclose whether those records have been preserved.  No trial, settlement, or further decree has been entered; the only court‑issued order is the preservation order, and no monitoring arrangement has been established.\n\nThe factual context centers on the creation of DOGE by President Trump in January 2025, with Elon Musk named its head.  DOGE allegedly deployed staff to agencies, gained access to sensitive systems, halted payments, and issued directives that the plaintiffs argue demonstrate that DOGE is a substantive agency subject to FOIA.  American Oversight claims the defendants’ failure to handle FOIA requests properly undermines public confidence in government operations.",
    "46602": "The United States District Court for the District of Oregon was sued on May 15, 2025, by the Oregon Council for the Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils (both nonprofit corporations) against the United States DOGE Service, its Acting Administrator Amy Gleason, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), its National Council on the Humanities, and the Acting Chairman Michael McDonald.  Plaintiffs are represented by the private law firm Tonkon Torp LLP.  The suit is not a class action; the two plaintiffs together bring the case as individual, though they represent a national network of state and jurisdictional humanities councils.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the Trump administration’s newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) directed the NEH, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), to terminate and cut funding for all NEH‑granted programs to state and jurisdictional humanities councils.  The alleged actions—including the mass termination of general‑operating‑support grants, the sudden layoff of the NEH’s Federal/State Partnership office, and the removal of existing grants—were carried out without the notice, hearing, or opportunity to cure required by NEH statutes (20 U.S.C. § 956) and without a lawful finding of non‑compliance.  Plaintiffs argue that the conduct violates the Constitution’s separation‑of‑powers and the Appropriations/Spending Clauses, and the Impoundment Control Act, because Congress had appropriated and directed the NEH to fund the federal‑state partnership.\n\nThe fundamental cause of action is the APA, specifically claims that the NEH’s actions were unlawful withholding or unreasonable delay of agency action (5 U.S.C. § 706(1)), were contrary to law (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)), and were arbitrary and capricious (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)).  Plaintiffs also invoke constitutional claims under the separation of powers, the Appropriations Clause, the Spending Clause, and the Take‑Care Clause.  The remedy sought is declaratory relief and injunctive relief to prevent further termination of NEH grants, to reinstate funding that has been cut, and to enforce the statutory formula for allocating NEH funds to the federal‑state partnership.\n\nJudge Michael H. Simon of the Portland Division granted plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction on August 6, 2025, ordering the defendants to cease the termination of NEH grants and to restore funding in accordance with congressional appropriations.  No trial, appeal, settlement, or monitor has been entered in the case to date.",
    "46478": "The United States District Court for the District of Columbia heard a suit filed on **April 22, 2025** by Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc. (“Plaintiffs”) against President Donald J. Trump and a slate of federal officers and agencies, including the Secretaries of Homeland Security, Treasury, and Commerce, U.S. Customs & Border Protection, the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Department of the Interior.  Plaintiff counsel was private counsel; the case involves individual plaintiffs, not a class action.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the President, in reliance on the **International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)**, issued a series of executive orders—most notably the February 1, 2025 “China” order, the March 3, 2025 amendment, and the April 2, 2025 “Universal and Reciprocal” order—that imposed unprecedented tariffs on imports from China and virtually all trading partners.  The orders were enacted under a declared national emergency and are alleged to be beyond the President’s statutory authority and unconstitutional, because tariff power is vested in Congress under Article I, § 8, clauses 1 and 3.\n\nThe complaint seeks **declaratory and injunctive relief** under 28 U.S.C. §§ 702, 705, 706 and the equitable powers of the court.  Plaintiffs contend that the tariffs are unlawful and that the agencies’ implementation of the orders violates the Administrative Procedure Act and the non‑delegation doctrine.\n\nOn **April 24, 2025**, the defendants filed a motion to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade, arguing that the orders create a “law providing for” tariffs and that the district court lacks jurisdiction.  Simultaneously, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction.  A hearing was held on **May 27, 2025**.  Amicus briefs were filed by the America First Legal Foundation, a coalition of former lawmakers and scholars, and by a group of affected small‑business owners.\n\nJudge Rudolph Contreras issued a **memorandum opinion on May 29, 2025** that **denied the motion to transfer** and **granted the preliminary injunction**.  The court held that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs, and therefore the orders are ultra‑vires.  The injunction enjoins the federal agencies from collecting or enforcing the challenged tariffs against the plaintiffs.  A bond of $500,000 was set per the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c).\n\nNo settlement was entered, no monitoring authority was appointed, and the case remains pending further appeal.  The factual basis centers on the fact that the plaintiffs import a large portion of their products from China and other countries; the new tariffs—ranging from 10 % on most goods to more than 145 % on Chinese imports—would force the companies to raise prices by 70 % or more or to halt sales, causing irreparable harm to their businesses.  The court’s ruling therefore protects the plaintiffs from the immediate economic damage while the broader legal question of the President’s tariff authority under IEEPA continues to be litigated.",
    "46390": "The lawsuit, docketed as 1:25‑cv‑01163‑CNS, was filed on April 12 2025 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado.  The petitioners are Venezuelan nationals D.B.U. and R.M.M., who are detained at the Denver Contract Detention Facility.  They are joined by other similarly situated detainees who are alleged members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang.  The respondents are the United States, represented by the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the individual agencies and officials—President Donald J. Trump, Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, ICE, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and other ICE personnel, including Director Robert Gaudian and Warden Dawn Ceja.\n\nThe petitioners claim that the President’s March 14, 2025 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. § 21) unlawfully designates Venezuelan nationals as alien enemies without the statutory prerequisites of a declared war, an invasion, or a predatory incursion, and without the required procedural safeguards.  The cause of action is grounded in the AEA and the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of due process, and the petitioners also invoke the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Convention Against Torture (CAT) to argue that the removals violate statutory and constitutional protections for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection from torture.\n\nJudge Charlotte N. Sweeney granted the petitioners’ emergency motion for a temporary restraining order on April 22 2025.  The TRO blocks the government from removing the petitioners or any member of the provisionally certified class from the District of Colorado or the United States, requires a 21‑day notice that explains the removal and the right to seek judicial review, and mandates that the notice be provided in a language the detainee understands.  The court also ordered the respondents to provide the notice within 21 days and to allow petitioners to seek habeas relief.\n\nThe petitioners filed a class petition for writ of habeas corpus and a class complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.  The court granted provisional class certification, allowing the petitioners to represent all non‑citizens in custody in Colorado who are subject to the March 14 proclamation.  On May 6 2025, the court issued a preliminary injunction that affirmed the TRO and reinforced the notice requirements.\n\nThe case is consolidated with the U.S. DC Circuit’s *J.G.G.* v. Trump and the Texas case *A.A.R.P.* v. Trump, both addressing the same AEA‑proposed removals.  No settlement has been reached, and no monitoring order has been issued.  The appellate docket shows that the government sought a stay pending appeal, but the Tenth Circuit denied the motion, allowing the TRO and preliminary injunction to stand.  The factual basis rests on the President’s proclamation designating Venezuelan nationals as alien enemies, the government’s summary removals to El Salvador, and the petitioners’ lack of notice and inability to challenge the designation.",
    "46499": "The United States District Court for the Northern District of California entered a complaint on April 11, 2025 (Case No. 3:25‑cv‑03292‑SI) by four international students—Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo—who were granted lawful F‑1 student status in the United States. The plaintiffs allege that, in early April 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) enacted a sweeping nationwide program that unilaterally terminated the students’ SEVIS records without notice, hearing, or any individualized review. The defendants named in the complaint are Secretary of DHS Kristi Noem and Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons. The complaint was later amended to add three additional plaintiffs—Jing Tao, Yifeng Wu, and Wanrong Li—and to name Secretary of State Marco Rubio as a defendant for the visa‑revocation component of the actions.\n\nThe plaintiffs invoke the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection clauses. They argue that the terminations were arbitrary, capricious, and outside the statutory authority of the 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(F)(i) and 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.1 and 214.2 governing F‑1 status. The complaint seeks declaratory judgment that the terminations were unlawful, injunctive relief restoring the plaintiffs’ SEVIS records, and a nationwide injunction preventing further arbitrary SEVIS terminations and related visa revocations. Plaintiffs also request reinstatement of any visas that were revoked as part of the same program.\n\nOn April 18 2025, Judge Susan Illston issued an ex‑parte temporary restraining order (TRO) that barred the defendants from enforcing SEVIS terminations against the named plaintiffs and from taking any adverse action—such as arrest, detention, or transfer—affecting them until the case was resolved. The TRO also required the defendants to reinstate the SEVIS records and to refrain from issuing new terminations without notice and individualized review.\n\nThe case was later reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White. On May 22 2025, Judge White granted the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction and set case‑management conferences. The injunction was broad, covering not only the named plaintiffs but also “similarly situated” F‑1 students nationwide, and it prohibited the defendants from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring those students, from imposing adverse legal effects due to SEVIS terminations, and from reversing any reinstated SEVIS records. The court did not require a bond for the injunction.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ complaint references related lawsuits in the same and other districts—such as 25‑cv‑03140‑JSW, 25‑cv‑03244‑JSW, 25‑cv‑04007‑EMC, and 25‑cv‑03244‑JWS—consolidated under a common nationwide pattern of SEVIS terminations. The defendants have filed a motion for stay pending appeal, arguing that the nationwide injunction exceeds the court’s authority, but the injunction remains in effect pending that motion.\n\nThe case is still pending; no trial, appeal, or final decree has been issued as of the latest docket entry (August 8, 2025). The plaintiffs continue to seek restoration of their SEVIS status and F‑1 visas and to enjoin further arbitrary terminations.",
    "46319": "On March 31 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the heads of the Treasury, Energy, Justice, Health and Human Services, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Communications Commission, and several other agencies. The complaint alleges that the President’s Executive Order No. 14,251, issued March 27 2025, unlawfully removed the agencies and their subdivisions from coverage under the Federal Service Labor‑Management Relations Statute (5 U.S.C. § 7101, et seq.) by invoking the narrow national‑security exemption in § 7103(b)(1). NTEU claims the order is ultra vires, constitutes First‑Amendment retaliation against the union’s litigation, and deprives its members of collective‑bargaining rights and union dues. The remedies sought are a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from implementing the executive order and the OPM memorandum that implements it.\n\nJudge Paul L. Friedman entered a preliminary injunction on April 25 2025, blocking the defendants from enforcing the order. An opinion issued April 28 2025 explained that the order exceeded the President’s statutory authority, was motivated in part by retaliation, and that NTEU suffered irreparable harm. Defendants filed a motion to stay pending appeal and an emergency motion for an immediate administrative stay on April 30 2025 and May 1 2025, respectively. The district court denied the stay on May 1 2025, holding that the injunction was supported by the court’s earlier findings and that the defendants were unlikely to prevail on appeal. On May 29 2025 the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a per‑curiam order granting a stay pending appeal, citing that the injunction would irreparably harm the President’s national‑security prerogatives and that the defendants likely would prevail on the merits. The parties subsequently filed motions for summary judgment (NTEU on June 9 2025; defendants on June 23 2025) and a joint status report on June 21 2025. No settlement has been reached, and no monitor has been appointed. The factual basis rests on the executive order’s sweeping exclusion of approximately two‑thirds of federal employees from the FSLMRS—most of whom are represented by NTEU—thereby terminating collective‑bargaining agreements and cutting off union dues collection.",
    "46285": "The United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered a complaint on **March 24 2025**. The plaintiffs were the nonprofit immigrant‑rights organizations **Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), UndocuBlack Network, and CASA, Inc.** The defendants were the Trump administration’s key immigration officials: **Kristi Noem (Secretary of Homeland Security), Todd M. Lyons (Acting Director of ICE), Pete R. Flores (Acting Commissioner of CBP), Kika Scott (Acting Director of USCIS), and President Donald J. Trump**.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the administration expanded the scope of the 1996‑enacted **expedited‑removal** system to include noncitizens who had already been “paroled” into the United States through humanitarian parole programs (the CHNV programs and the CBP One mobile‑application process). The challenge focuses on three agency actions:  \n1. The **January 23 2025 Huffman memorandum** that directed DHS components to “consider” applying expedited removal to paroled individuals and to terminate ongoing removal proceedings and active parole status.  \n2. The **February 18 2025 ICE directive** that instructed ICE enforcement personnel to “consider for expedited removal” a category of “paroled arriving aliens” with no time limit.  \n3. The **March 25 2025 CHNV termination notice** that ended the CHNV parole programs and stated that expedited removal is available only when a person has not been continuously present in the United States for two years, thereby exposing parolees to removal.\n\nThese policies, the plaintiffs argue, violate the **Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)**—specifically 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A) which bars expedited removal of those who have been admitted or paroled—and the **Administrative Procedure Act (APA)** (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and § 705) by being arbitrary, capricious, and lacking a reasoned basis. The plaintiffs also claim a denial of **fifth‑amendment due‑process** rights because paroled individuals are deprived of notice, an opportunity to be heard, and counsel before removal.\n\nThe complaint seeks a **declaratory judgment** that the agency actions are unlawful, an **injunction** barring DHS from applying expedited removal to the targeted individuals, and **vacatur** of the agency actions. The plaintiffs also request a **stay** of the three policies pending the outcome of the case.\n\nDefendants moved to dismiss, citing the jurisdictional bars of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) and § 1252(f)(1), lack of standing, and the claim that the policies are within the statutory scope. The court denied the motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiffs have standing under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3) and that the policies are ultra vires because they apply expedited removal to persons who have been paroled, a group excluded from the statutory definition of “arriving alien” and “designated alien.” The court also held that the policies are arbitrary and capricious, violate due process, and that the plaintiffs face irreparable harm (risk of removal, family separation, loss of asylum and other relief).\n\nAfter oral argument on July 9 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs’ **motion to stay agency action**. The order, issued on **August 1 2025**, stayed the effective dates of the January 23 Huffman memorandum, February 18 ICE directive, and March 25 CHNV termination notice as to all noncitizens who have been paroled into the United States at a port of entry. The court also issued a memorandum opinion explaining its analysis, concluding that the policies are unlawful, the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits, and the stay is justified by the balance of equities and public interest.\n\nThe case remains pending with the stay in effect, and the parties have continued to file subsequent motions and briefs. The court’s ruling restores the status quo for the targeted parolees and preserves their access to immigration relief pending a final decision on the merits of the challenge.",
    "46179": "Travis LeBlanc and Edward Felten, two Senate‑confirmed members of the U.S. Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), sued the Board and the President. On February 24 2025 they filed a complaint alleging that President Donald J. Trump, through Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel Trent Morse, removed both men from the Board without cause and without any due‑process hearing.  The plaintiffs claimed that the removals violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment, and that the PCLOB statute (42 U.S.C. § 2000ee) bars at‑will removal of its members.  The defendants – the PCLOB itself, its sole remaining member Beth A. Williams, Executive Director Jenny Fitzpatrick, Morse, and the President – countered that Congress did not provide a statutory removal restriction and that the President may remove any of his appointees.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Reggie B. Walton.  The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on March 12 2025; the defendants filed a cross‑motion on April 3; the plaintiffs opposed the cross‑motion and filed a reply on April 16.  At a hearing on April 30, 2025, the court found that the PCLOB statute, as amended in 2007, expressly bars at‑will removal of its members, that the President’s actions violated the APA and due process, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief.  On May 21, 2025, Judge Walton granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, declared the removals unlawful, restored both men to their positions, and enjoined all defendants except the President from treating the plaintiffs as removed or from taking any action that would impede their duties.  The case was closed.\n\nThe government appealed.  On July 1, 2025 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal, holding that the defendants satisfied the strict requirements of *Nken v. Holder* and that the injunction would unduly disrupt the executive branch.  The stay remained in effect through the end of the appellate period.  No settlement or monitoring was entered into during the proceedings.",

The complaint claims violations of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief: an order preventing OPM from providing OPM records to DOGE agents, requiring OPM to destroy any copies already obtained, and mandating OPM to establish proper security safeguards.  The plaintiffs’ counsel includes Lex Lumina LLP, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the State Democracy Defenders Fund, and the Chandra Law Firm.  Judge Denise L. Cote presided.  After a motion for a temporary restraining order and a motion for a preliminary injunction, the court granted the preliminary injunction on June 9, 2025, and issued an order on June 20, 2025 requiring OPM to report its new access‑control procedures and to post a $1,000 bond.

The plaintiffs sued the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Acting Secretary Dorothy A. Fink, and Acting Director Matthew J. Memoli, alleging that the NIH’s “Supplemental Guidance to the 2024 NIH Grants Policy Statement: Indirect Cost Rates” (Notice Number NOT‑OD‑25‑068) unlawfully imposed a 15 % cap on indirect‑cost reimbursement for all existing and future NIH grants, effective February 10, 2025.  The plaintiffs claimed that the guidance violated the Appropriations Clause and Section 224 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, which prohibit NIH from modifying indirect‑cost rates or using appropriated funds to develop a modified approach.  They also asserted that the guidance violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being arbitrary, capricious, lacking notice‑and‑comment, and being retroactive.\n\nThe complaint sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the guidance and to restore the negotiated indirect‑cost rates that had been agreed to under existing grant agreements.  The plaintiffs’ counsel was Jenner & Block LLP and Clement & Murphy, PLLC; the defendants were represented by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nOn the same day, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO).  The court granted the TRO on February 11, 2025, ordering the defendants not to implement the guidance or modify indirect‑cost rates in any form until further order.  After the parties filed additional briefs and the court heard oral arguments on February 21, the court issued a memorandum and order on March 5, 2025, granting a preliminary injunction and extending the TRO until a final judgment was entered.  The injunction barred the defendants from applying the 15 % cap nationwide and required them to comply with the previously negotiated indirect‑cost rates.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, the court entered a final judgment and permanent injunction, affirming the earlier rulings and enjoining the defendants from enforcing the guidance or any similar modification of indirect‑cost rates across the United States.  The permanent injunction also directed the defendants to cease any action that would implement the guidance and to maintain the status quo pending further court orders.\n\nThe defendants, represented by the DOJ, filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on April 8, 2025, challenging the injunction and the court’s interpretation of the appropriations rider and the APA.  No settlement has been reached, and no monitoring officer has been appointed.  The case remains pending on appeal.",
    "46023": "On February 3, 2025 the Alliance for Retired Americans, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that Secretary Scott Bessent, the Department of the Treasury, and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service had unlawfully granted the nascent “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) unrestricted access to Treasury payment and record‑keeping systems. The plaintiffs claim that this conduct violated the Privacy Act of 1974 and Internal Revenue Code § 6103, and that it was an arbitrary and capricious action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They seek declaratory relief and injunctive relief to stop further disclosure of personal and financial information and to recover any data already shared. The case was assigned to Judge Colleen Kollar‑Kotelly.  \n\nOn February 5, 2025 the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order; the court scheduled a hearing and, via a consent motion, converted the request into a motion for a preliminary injunction. At the February 24 hearing the court denied the preliminary injunction on March 7, 2025, finding the plaintiffs had not shown irreparable harm. The court therefore entered a temporary status‑quo order limiting Treasury’s access to the bureau’s records to a very narrow set of individuals (including the Treasury DOGE team lead, who was granted read‑only access) while the case proceeded. That status‑quo order was dissolved on March 7 after the injunction denial, but the court retained the authority to consider the preliminary‑injunction motion.  \n\nIn March, the Treasury filed its administrative record on March 10. Plaintiffs objected on March 11, and the court ordered the defendants to respond by March 12 and to supplement the record. The court granted the plaintiffs’ objections partially on March 13, requiring the Treasury to supplement the record with additional non‑privileged material. Protective orders to safeguard confidential information were issued on April 1.  \n\nOn April 11, 2025 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The court has not yet ruled on that motion. No settlement has been reached, and the case remains pending, with the next scheduled briefing for dispositive motions set for early May 2025.",

The plaintiffs argue that these conditions—prohibitions on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, requirements to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, bans on “gender ideology” and elective abortion, and mandates to use the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ SAVE system—were never authorized by Congress and violate the Constitution’s separation of powers, the Spending Clause, the Fifth Amendment’s void‑for‑vagueness doctrine, the Tenth Amendment’s anti‑commandeering principle, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The relief sought is a declaration that the new conditions are unlawful and an injunction preventing HUD and DOT from imposing or enforcing them and from withholding grant funds based on those conditions. \n\nOn May 5 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). Judge Barbara J. Rothstein granted the TRO on May 7, enjoining the defendants from imposing or enforcing the contested conditions and from withholding or rescinding CoC grant agreements. The plaintiffs then filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on May 21. The court granted the preliminary injunction and extended the TRO, ordering the defendants to comply with the injunction pending a final ruling. On May 21, additional plaintiffs—seventeen cities, counties, and transit authorities—joined the action and filed a second motion for a TRO and a preliminary injunction. The court granted the second TRO on May 23, enjoining the defendants from imposing or enforcing the same or materially similar conditions on any CoC or DOT grants. No trial, appeal, or settlement has yet occurred; the court’s orders remain in effect pending the outcome of the preliminary injunction proceedings.",
    "46484": "The American Bar Association (ABA) filed a complaint on April 23, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Attorney General, and the Deputy Attorney General unlawfully terminated five grants awarded to the ABA’s Commission on Domestic and Sexual Violence (ABA CDSV) in retaliation for the ABA’s First‑Amendment‑protected advocacy. The ABA claims retaliatory viewpoint discrimination, unconstitutional conditions on federal grants, and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to halt the termination of the grants, to reinstate the funds, and to compel the DOJ to disburse the remaining grant balances in the customary manner; they also seek monetary damages for the lost funding.  \n\nOn April 24, 2025, the ABA filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and, subsequently, a motion for a preliminary injunction. The DOJ filed a motion to dismiss on May 2, 2025, and a memorandum opposing the ABA’s motion. The court held a hearing on May 12, 2025, and issued a memorandum opinion on May 14, 2025, granting the ABA’s preliminary injunction and denying the motion to dismiss as to the First‑Amendment retaliation claim.

    "46279": "On March 23, 2025, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a complaint by four noncitizens—D.V.D., M.M., E.F.D., and O.C.G.—against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Secretary Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, and Plymouth County Correctional Facility Superintendent Antone Moniz. The plaintiffs allege that DHS has been removing individuals who already possess final removal orders to “third” countries without first providing written notice of the destination or a meaningful opportunity to file a claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). The cause of action is grounded in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief, injunctive relief to halt such removals, and, for plaintiff O.C.G., immediate return to the United States after he was removed to Mexico without notice and subsequently sent back to Guatemala where he remains in hiding.\n\nThe court granted a temporary restraining order on March 28, 2025, prohibiting DHS from removing the plaintiffs or other similarly situated individuals to a third country until DHS provides written notice and an opportunity to file CAT claims. On April 18, 2025, the court certified a class comprising all noncitizens with final removal orders who are at risk of being removed to a country not designated in their removal order and entered a preliminary injunction and class‑wide injunction, enjoining DHS from such removals without notice and an opportunity to file CAT claims. The defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the First Circuit, which denied a stay of the injunction on May 16, 2025. The Supreme Court granted a stay of the preliminary injunction on June 23, 2025, pending the outcome of the appeal. Accordingly, the injunction remains in effect only while the appellate proceedings are pending.\n\nFactual background includes the February 18, 2025 DHS directive to review cases for re‑detention and potential removal to third countries. Plaintiff O.C.G., a gay man from Guatemala who had been removed to Mexico without notice, was subsequently returned to Guatemala, where he remains in hiding. Other plaintiffs—D.V.D. (Cuban), M.M. (Honduran), and E.F.D. (Ecuadorian)—are similarly threatened with removal to countries where they fear persecution or torture. DHS’s March 30 guidance allows removal to a third country without notice if the United States has received credible diplomatic assurances that the country will not subject the individual to torture. The plaintiffs argue that such policy violates their statutory and constitutional rights.\n\nNo settlement has been reached, and no monitor has been appointed. The case remains active, with the court continuing to oversee discovery, enforce its preliminary injunction, and await the resolution of the appellate dispute.",
    "46186": "On February 28 2025, a class‑action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts by Svitlana Doe, Maksym Doe, Maria Doe, Alejandro Doe, Armando Doe, Ana Doe, Carlos Doe, Omar Doe, Sandra McAnany, Kyle Varner, Wilhen Pierre Victor, and the Haitian Bridge Alliance (hereafter “Plaintiffs”) against Secretary Kristi Noem, Acting Director Caleb Vitello, Acting Commissioner Pete R. Flores, Senior Official Kika Scott, and President Donald J. Trump (“Defendants”).  The complaint alleges that the Trump administration, on January 20 2025, issued Executive Orders 14165, 14159, and 14161 that directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to terminate all categorical parole programs—including the “CHNV” program for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela—and to exercise the parole authority only on a case‑by‑case basis.  Acting Secretary Benjamín Huffman subsequently issued a memorandum ordering DHS to pause and terminate the CHNV program, and Acting Deputy Director Andrew Davidson issued a February 14 memorandum suspending the adjudication of all immigration‑benefit requests for parolees under U4U, CHNV, and FRP.  A Federal Register notice published on March 25 2025 formally terminated the CHNV program and rescinded existing parole grants.  \n\nThe plaintiffs contend that these actions violate 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5) (the statutory parole authority) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being arbitrary, capricious, and lacking procedural safeguards.  They seek declaratory relief that the programs are lawful, injunctive relief that the termination and benefit suspension be halted, and a vacatur of the agency actions.  \n\nThe court entered an order on April 14 2025 granting class certification to all individuals who had received a grant of parole under the terminated programs and who had pending re‑parole or other benefit applications.  The same order issued a preliminary injunction and stayed the termination of the CHNV program and the suspension of benefit adjudications for the class.  Defendants appealed, and on May 8 2025 the Supreme Court granted a stay pending appeal of the district court’s stay, thereby maintaining the injunction until the appellate decision is rendered.  The case remains pending in the First Circuit and the Supreme Court, with the plaintiffs continuing to seek the full restoration of their parole status and the resumption of immigration‑benefit processing.",
    "46180": "On February 25, 2025 the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the American Sociological Association (ASA), the AFT‑Maryland affiliate (AFT‑MD), and the Eugene School District 4J filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Baltimore Division). The plaintiffs allege that, on February 14 2025, the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), through Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor, issued a “Dear Colleague Letter” that re‑interprets Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard* (SFFA). The letter, plaintiffs say, imposes new, over‑broad prohibitions on teaching about race, on student affinity groups, and on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programming, and threatens enforcement action—including the loss of federal funding—within 14 days.\n\nThe complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs claim the letter and an accompanying “Certification Requirement” (issued April 3 2025) violate the First Amendment (by chilling protected speech and association), the Fifth Amendment (by being unconstitutionally vague and over‑broad), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being a final agency action issued without notice‑and‑comment and without a proper administrative record. The remedies requested are a declaratory judgment that the letter and certification are unlawful, a preliminary injunction to bar enforcement of those documents, and a permanent injunction to prevent future enforcement or reliance on them.\n\nThe defendants are the DOE, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, and Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor. The case is not a class action; each plaintiff is a distinct entity (a national union, a professional association, a state affiliate, and a school district) suing the federal agency and its officials in their official capacities.\n\nProcedurally, the plaintiffs amended the complaint on March 5 to add the school district as a plaintiff. They filed motions for preliminary injunction on March 28 and April 9, 2025. The court granted the injunction on the letter (staying it under § 705 of the APA) but denied injunctive relief on the certification requirement because the complaint had not yet challenged it. On April 24, 2025 the court granted summary judgment on counts 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the amended complaint, and denied count 4. The memorandum opinion, issued August 14 2025, held that the letter and certification are unlawful under the APA, the First Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment, and vacated both documents. The court also entered a stay of the letter and issued an order requiring the DOE to cease enforcement actions tied to the letter and certification until the merits are decided.\n\nNo settlement has been reached. No monitoring parties were named. The case centers on the Department’s attempt to expand the scope of Title VI enforcement to include a wide range of DEI‑related educational practices, and the plaintiffs’ assertion that the agency overstepped its statutory authority, violated constitutional rights, and failed to follow proper administrative procedures.",
    "46119": "On February 13, 2025 the United States District Court for the District of Maryland received a complaint filed by a group of current and former employees and contractors of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), who use the pseudonym “J. Doe 1‑26.”  The plaintiffs allege that Elon Musk, acting “in his official capacity,” together with the United States DOGE Service (the Department of Government Efficiency) and the Department of Government Efficiency, directed the DOGE to infiltrate USAID, seize control of its computer systems, remove the agency’s website and headquarters, and put employees on administrative leave or terminate contracts, thereby violating the U.S. Constitution’s Appointments Clause and the separation‑of‑powers doctrine.  The plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and injunctive relief to prevent further unlawful actions and to restore access to email, systems, and employment status.\n\nThe complaint was served by private counsel (the plaintiffs’ attorneys were not named).  The case was brought under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201; venue was proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (e) because at least one plaintiff resides in the district.\n\nOn February 18, 2025 the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.  Judge Theodore D. Chuang granted the injunction on March 18, 2025, ordering the defendants to (1) restore access to USAID email and other systems for all affected employees and contractors; (2) refrain from disclosing any of the plaintiffs’ personal data; (3) refrain from taking any further actions that would shut down or dismantle USAID, including terminating contracts, employees, or office facilities; and (4) submit a written agreement indicating that USAID will be able to occupy its Washington, D.C., headquarters.  The district court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, would suffer irreparable harm, the balance of equities favored the plaintiffs, and the injunction was in the public interest.\n\nOn March 19, 2025 the defendants filed a motion for clarification of the injunction, arguing that the order also applied to Jeremy Lewin, the USAID Deputy Administrator, who was not a defendant.  Judge Chuang denied the motion on March 20, 2025.  The defendants then appealed the injunction.  On March 28, 2025 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted a stay of the district‑court injunction pending the appeal (Judge Quattlebaum, joined by Judge Niemeyer, with Judge Gregory concurring in the result).  \n\nThe plaintiffs have pursued the use of pseudonyms throughout the proceedings and have sought to proceed under Local Rule 102.2(a) waivers.

    "46099": "On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14169, “Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid,” directing the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to implement a 90‑day pause on all U.S. foreign development assistance. Four days later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a memorandum to U.S. diplomatic posts that suspended new foreign‑aid obligations and ordered the issuance of stop‑work orders for existing grants and contracts. U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) followed suit, instructing its grantees—among them AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) and Journalism Development Network (JDN)—to halt work and to minimise costs incurred under the affected awards.\n\nOn February 10, 2025, AVAC and JDN filed a complaint in the District Court for the District of Columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Their claims were based on the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and on constitutional grounds, alleging that the executive order and the Secretary’s memorandum violated the Take‑Care Clause, the separation of powers, and the APA’s prohibition of arbitrary and capricious agency action. The plaintiffs requested that the court enjoin the defendants from enforcing the freeze and stop‑work orders, and that the defendants be compelled to resume disbursement of appropriated funds.\n\nOn February 12, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and for a preliminary injunction. Judge Amir H. Ali granted the TRO on February 13, 2025, enjoining the Department of State, USAID, OMB, President Trump, Secretary Rubio, and Director Russell Vought from enforcing or giving effect to the executive order, the Secretary’s memorandum, and any related directives. The TRO required the defendants to take all steps necessary to comply with the order and to provide written notice to all foreign‑aid recipients.\n\nThe defendants filed status reports and motions, but on February 20, 2025, Judge Ali reaffirmed the TRO and ordered the defendants to resume funding for all awards existing as of January 19, 2025, and to pay all amounts due to the plaintiffs’ grants and contracts. On February 25, 2025, the court issued an order enforcing the TRO, directing the defendants to pay all invoices and letter‑of‑credit drawdowns for work completed before the TRO by 11:59 p.m. on February 26. The defendants’ attempts to stay the order were denied.\n\nOn March 4, 2025, the court held a hearing on the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction. The court granted the injunction in part, holding that the defendants’ blanket freeze was arbitrary and capricious under the APA, that plaintiffs had suffered irreparable injury, and that the public interest favored the injunction. The injunction required the defendants to stop enforcing the freeze, to resume disbursement of appropriated funds, and to cease issuing stop‑work orders.\n\nThe case remains pending. The defendants have filed appeals on the preliminary injunction, but the court has not yet ruled on those appeals. No settlement has been reached, and no monitor has been appointed. The factual basis of the case is the sudden halt of foreign‑aid funding that left AVAC, JDN, and other recipient organizations unable to pay staff, to continue programs, and to sustain international health and journalism initiatives. The plaintiffs’ litigation seeks to reverse the executive order’s effect and to restore the flow of appropriated funds.",
    "46093": "The case, docket 2:25‑cv‑00255, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on February 10 2025.  The plaintiffs are a group of refugees and their families—Pacito, Esther, Josephine, Sara, Alyas, Marcos, Ahmed, Rachel, and Ali—who are seeking admission to the United States, along with the nonprofit resettlement agencies HIAS, Church World Service, and Lutheran Community Services Northwest.  The defendants are federal officials sued in their official capacities: President Donald J. Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Acting Secretary of Health and Human Services Dorothy A. Fink (later substituted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.).\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that President Trump’s Executive Order 14163, “Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program,” and the agencies’ implementation of that order—including an immediate suspension of all refugee admissions, a halt to refugee‑processing decisions, and a stop‑to‑work order that cut federal funding to the resettlement agencies—ultra‑vires the Refugee Act of 1980 and violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Constitution’s due‑process clause.  The claims rest on the statutory framework that Congress created a permanent, systematic refugee‑admissions program and requires the President to act with appropriate consultation.  The plaintiffs seek declaratory relief affirming the illegality of the order and its implementation, and injunctive relief—both preliminary and permanent—to halt the enforcement of the order and restore the agencies’ funding and operations.\n\nJudge Jamal N. Whitehead issued a preliminary injunction on February 25 2025 that enjoined the defendants from implementing Executive Order 14163, from suspending refugee processing and admission, and from withholding funding to the resettlement agencies.  The injunction was partially stayed by the Ninth Circuit in Pacito v. Trump (No. 25‑1313) on March 25 2025, with the court holding that the injunction applies only to refugees who had been conditionally approved for admission before January 20 2025 and had arranged travel.  The district court, however, retained jurisdiction over the injunction’s enforcement and, on March 24 2025, issued a second preliminary injunction that broadened the scope of relief to cover the defendants’ termination of cooperative agreements that funded refugee processing and reception‑placement services.\n\nThe defendants moved to stay the injunction pending appeal, but Judge Whitehead denied the motion, finding that the defendants were unlikely to prevail on the merits and that the injunction was necessary to protect the refugees’ reliance interests.  The Court also issued a compliance‑framework order to clarify the defendants’ obligations, appointing a neutral to review individual reliance‑interest claims.  Subsequent orders revisited the framework in light of a further Ninth Circuit clarification that narrowed the class of protected refugees, and the court ultimately issued an implementation framework and appointed a magistrate judge to oversee the compliance process.\n\nThroughout the litigation, the plaintiffs continue to pursue both declaratory and injunctive relief, while the defendants seek to restore the suspension of refugee admissions and the termination of funding for resettlement agencies.  The case remains active, with the court maintaining the injunctions and overseeing the defendants’ compliance under the framework established by the district court and clarified by the Ninth Circuit.",
    "46065": "On February 7, 2025, the Attorney General of Washington, acting for the states of Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, and later Colorado, filed a complaint and declaratory‑injunctive action against President Donald J. Trump (in his official capacity) and a broad coalition of federal agencies: the Department of Justice (DOJ), Health and Human Services (HHS), Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Veterans Affairs, NASA, National Science Foundation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and others. The plaintiffs also named three physicians—faculty at the University of Washington—who provide gender‑affirming care to minors. The complaint alleges that President Trump’s Executive Order 14,187 (the “Medical Services EO”) and the related Executive Order 14,168 (the “Gender‑Ideology EO”) unlawfully condition federal research and education funds on the denial of gender‑affirming services to children and criminalize such care under 18 U.S.C. § 116, thereby violating the Constitution’s separation of powers, the Fifth Amendment’s equal‑protection clause, the Tenth Amendment’s protection of state police power, and the Fifth Amendment’s due‑process clause for vagueness. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the orders are unconstitutional and injunctive relief preventing the agencies from enforcing or implementing the orders.\n\nOn February 14, 2025, the district court granted a temporary restraining order, enjoining all defendants except the President from enforcing Section 4 of the Medical Services EO, which requires federally funded institutions to “immediately … end” the use of puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and other gender‑affirming treatments for patients under 19. A subsequent motion for a preliminary injunction was filed on February 19, 2025, and on February 28, 2025 the court granted a preliminary injunction that extended the TRO to also enjoin the agencies from enforcing Sections 3(e) and (g) of the Gender‑Ideology EO, which prohibit federal funding for programs that “promote gender ideology” and require agencies to “end the federal funding of gender ideology.” The court found the orders violated the Constitution’s separation of powers and equal‑protection guarantees, and that the plaintiffs had standing and likely success on the merits. The preliminary injunction made the TRO permanent pending further proceedings.\n\nOn March 6, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt, arguing that the National Institutes of Health had terminated a grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had issued a notice that conflicted with the TRO and preliminary injunction. The court denied the contempt motion and denied attorneys’ fees, but granted plaintiffs’ alternative request for expedited discovery to investigate the alleged violations. In April 2025, defendants filed a motion to stay the case pending appeal, and on April 23, 2025 the court granted a limited stay, allowing plaintiffs to enforce the injunction while the appeal proceeds.\n\nNo settlement has been reached.

The plaintiffs allege that President Donald J. Trump, through two executive orders (14‑168, “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” and 14‑187, “Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation”) unlawfully directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its components—Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and National Science Foundation (NSF)—to withhold or condition federal research and education grants on the basis that a recipient provides gender‑affirming medical care to a patient under nineteen.  The plaintiffs claim that the orders violate the separation of powers, the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause (as applied through the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause), and statutory nondiscrimination provisions of the Affordable Care Act (Section 1557) and the Public Health Service Act (Section 1908).  They seek declaratory relief and injunctive relief, including a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn February 5, 2025 the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a TRO.  The court granted the TRO on February 13, 2025, enjoining the agency defendants from enforcing or implementing the orders’ funding‑condition provisions.  A memorandum opinion justified the TRO on the grounds that the orders were ultra‑vires and that the injunction’s scope was appropriate.\n\nThe plaintiffs then moved for a preliminary injunction on February 18, 2025.  The court granted the injunction on March 4, 2025, issuing a nationwide order prohibiting all defendants—except the President—from conditioning, withholding, or terminating federal funding for gender‑affirming care of minors under the challenged executive orders.  The order required the defendants to file status reports and to comply with the injunction’s terms.\n\nOn March 7, 2025 the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to enforce the preliminary injunction.  The court denied that motion on March 28, 2025, holding that the defendants’ subsequent notices to grant recipients violated the injunction.  The defendants appealed the preliminary‑injunction ruling on April 21, 2025.  No appellate decision has yet been entered.\n\nThe TRO and preliminary‑injunction orders remain in effect.  The case has not yet produced a final judgment on the merits, but the court has affirmed its jurisdiction and the invalidity of the executive orders at the injunctive level.",
    "46306": "On March 26, 2025, a coalition of nonprofit legal‑service organizations—Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, Social Justice Collaborative, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, Estrella del Paso, Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, Galveston‑Houston Immigrant Representation Project, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, National Immigrant Justice Center, Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, and Vermont Asylum Assistance Project—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), its Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), and the Department of the Interior (DOI) had violated the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA) and the 2024 Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule (45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4)), and that the defendants’ “Cancellation Order” on March 20/21, 2025 had abruptly terminated all federal funding for direct legal representation of unaccompanied immigrant children.  The plaintiffs claimed that this action infringed the statutory duty to “ensure…that all unaccompanied alien children…have counsel to represent them…and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking,” and that the APA (5 U.S.C. § 702) provided a basis to challenge the order.  They sought declaratory relief and a nationwide injunction to enjoin the defendants from withdrawing the funding, and to restore the status quo.\n\nJudge Araceli Martinez‑Olguín granted the plaintiffs a temporary restraining order on April 1, 2025 and a preliminary injunction on April 29, 2025, ordering the defendants to continue providing the previously funded legal services.  The defendants appealed, arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the funding decision was discretionary and that the APA did not authorize judicial review of a payment‑related action.  The Ninth Circuit, in a 2025 ruling, held that the district court had jurisdiction under the APA, that the injunction was appropriate, and denied the defendants’ motion for a stay pending appeal.  The court also denied a motion to recuse the judge, finding no conflict of interest, and denied the defendants’ subsequent motion to stay the preliminary injunction.  An emergency motion to stay the injunction was likewise denied.  No settlement was reached; the plaintiffs continue to seek enforcement of the injunction and the restoration of federal funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children.",
    "46201": "On March 6 2025 the Attorneys General of California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Wisconsin—acting on behalf of their respective states—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Case No. 1:25‑cv‑10548‑MJJ) against the United States Department of Education, its former Acting Secretary of Education Denise Carter (in her official capacity), and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon (in her official capacity).  The states allege that on February 7 2025 the Department abruptly terminated all previously‑awarded Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) and Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) grants, which Congress authorized under 20 U.S.C. §§ 1022, 1022a, 6672.  The plaintiffs claim the terminations violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and seek declaratory relief and injunctive relief to vacate the terminations and prevent future cancellations.\n\nThe parties are not a class; the plaintiffs are eight sovereign states represented by their attorneys general.  The cause of action is the APA; the statutory basis is the federal grant statutes authorizing the TQP and SEED programs.  The remedy sought is declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nJurisdiction was established on the basis of federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 2201, 2202, and the APA (5 U.S.C. §§ 701‑706).  The district court, presided over by Judge Joun, D.J., entered a temporary restraining order (TRO) on March 10 2025, directing the Department to restore the pre‑termination status quo and to refrain from further terminating the grants.  The TRO was later extended to March 31 2025.  On April 8 2025 the Supreme Court, by a per curiam order, stayed the TRO pending the outcome of the pending appeal and the plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction.  The defendants subsequently filed a motion to dismiss or, alternatively, transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims on May 12 2025, and the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on June 2 2025.  No further orders or judgments have been entered as of the latest docket entry.",
    "46057": "On February 6, 2025, seven active‑duty U.S. military members—Commander Emily Shilling, Commander Blake Dremann, Lieutenant Commander Geirid Morgan, Sergeant First Class Cathrine Schmid, Sergeant First Class Jane Doe, Staff Sergeant Videl Leins, and Sergeant First Class Sierra Moran—together with a prospective service member, Matthew Medina, and the Gender Justice League, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.  The plaintiffs challenged the 2025 Military Ban (Executive Order 14183), which bars transgender persons from serving in the armed forces.  They allege that the ban violates the Fifth Amendment’s equal‑protection, due‑process, and First‑Amendment guarantees, and that the Department of Defense’s implementation of the ban is also subject to equitable estoppel.  The plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and a preliminary—and ultimately permanent—injunction to halt enforcement of the ban and the associated DoD guidance (“Hegseth policy”).\n\nJudge Benjamin H. Settle granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction on March 27, 2025, ordering the government to suspend implementation of the ban and the Hegseth policy nationwide.  The Department of Defense appealed, asking the Ninth Circuit to issue a stay of the injunction pending review.  On April 18, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the stay.  The government then filed an application for a stay of the injunction with the U.S. Supreme Court on April 18, 2025.  The Supreme Court issued an order on May 6, 2025, granting an immediate stay of the preliminary injunction pending further review.  The case remains pending before the Supreme Court.",
    "45984": "In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, a group of transgender active‑duty and prospective service members—identified by names in the complaint but described here generically—filed a complaint on January 28 2025.  The plaintiffs alleged that President Donald J. Trump’s Executive Order 14183 (signed January 27 2025), which revokes the 2021 policy permitting transgender individuals to serve openly and declares that transgender status is incompatible with “high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity,” violates the Equal‑Protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  The order also requires the Secretary of Defense to update medical standards, prohibit pronoun use inconsistent with birth sex, and prohibits transgender service members from serving at all.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief, specifically a preliminary injunction to bar the Department of Defense from implementing the order and any related guidance.  Judge Ana C. Reyes granted that preliminary injunction on March 18 2025, ordering the DoD to maintain the status quo of military policy regarding transgender service and to preserve the plaintiffs’ enlistment and service status.  The court stayed the effect of that injunction until March 21 2025 to give the parties time to discuss a potential appeal.\n\nOn March 21 2025 the defendants filed a motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction.  Judge Reyes denied that motion on March 26 2025, holding that the injunction remained appropriate.  The defendants also sought a stay pending appeal, but the court denied that request on March 27 2025 and issued a memorandum opinion explaining its decision.  The case has been appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (case 25‑5087).\n\nNo settlement has been reached, no monitoring arrangement has been established, and the case has not yet entered trial.  The factual basis of the claim is that the plaintiffs, who have served honorably in the armed forces for decades, were suddenly barred from continuing service and forced to resign or separate under the new executive order, which the plaintiffs argue amounts to unconstitutional discrimination.",
    "45964": "The United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, under Judge John C. Coughenour, heard a complaint filed on January 21, 2025 (Case 2:25‑cv‑00127) by the State of Washington, the State of Arizona, the State of Illinois, and the State of Oregon—collectively the “Plaintiff States”—along with two individual plaintiffs, Cherly Norales Castillo and Alicia Chavarria Lopez.  The defendants are President Donald J. Trump (in his official capacity), the United States Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Social Security Administration, the Department of State, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Department of Agriculture, and the United States.  The plaintiffs allege that President Trump’s Executive Order No. 14160, “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” issued January 20, 2025, unlawfully strips citizenship from children born in the United States to parents who are unlawfully present or temporarily present.  They claim the order violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause (Section 1) and the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1401(a)), and seek declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement and implementation of the order.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on the same day, the court granted it on January 23, 2025.  A preliminary injunction was issued on February 6, 2025, making the injunction nationwide.  The defendants filed a motion to stay the injunction pending appeal; the Ninth Circuit denied the stay on July 23, 2025.  The United States then filed an emergency application for partial stay, and on June 27, 2025, the Supreme Court granted a partial stay, limiting the injunction to the parties who had standing and removing its nationwide scope.  No settlement has been reached, and no monitoring order has been issued.  The case’s factual context is that the order would deprive tens of thousands of newborns and their families of citizenship‑related rights and federal benefits, and the plaintiff states argue that it would cause irreparable harm to their federal‑funded programs.  The case is ultimately an assertion of constitutional and statutory rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Immigration and Nationality Act, with the remedy sought being a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to stop the order’s enforcement.",
    "45965": "On January 21 2025, the nonprofit immigration‑rights organization CASA, Inc., the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, Inc., and eight pregnant plaintiffs—Maribel, Juana, Trinidad Garcia, Monica, Liza, Ashley, Andrea, and Niurka—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Greenbelt Division).  The plaintiffs allege that President Donald J. Trump’s Executive Order 14‑160, signed on January 20 2025, unlawfully denies birthright citizenship to children born in the United States to parents who are either undocumented or present on temporary visas and whose fathers are neither U.S. citizens nor lawful permanent residents.  The complaint claims the order violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause and 8 U.S.C. § 1401, and it seeks declaratory relief and both preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the enforcement of the order.\n\nThe court, Judge Deborah L. Boardman, granted a nationwide preliminary injunction on February 5 2025, barring all federal agencies and officials from applying the order to any child born in the United States after February 19 2025.  The defendants appealed the injunction and sought a stay.  The Fourth Circuit denied the stay, and the defendants then petitioned the Supreme Court.  On June 27 2025, the Supreme Court, in Trump v. CASA, Inc., 606 U.S. 2540 (2025), held that universal injunctions exceed the equitable authority granted by the Judiciary Act of 1789.  The Court granted the defendants’ partial stays, limiting the injunctions to the named plaintiffs and their identified associates, and directing that the orders not preclude agencies from drafting guidance on implementation.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s decision, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to bring a class action, seeking certification of a nationwide class of all children born in the United States after February 19 2025 to parents covered by the order.  A memorandum for class certification was filed; the court granted the motion, recognizing that the plaintiffs met the rule‑23 requirements for a class action.  The case remains pending on the merits, with the injunction continuing to apply to the plaintiffs’ names while the courts consider the constitutional and statutory claims.",
    "VR-LA-0120": "The United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana entered the civil‑rights action on May 19, 2020. The plaintiffs were a group of voters and civic organizations—Telisa Clark, Lakeshia Barnett, Martha Christian Green, Crescent City Media Group, League of Women Voters Louisiana, and the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice with the Louisiana NAACP, Jane Chandler, Jennifer Harding, Edith Gee Jones, and Jasmine Pogue—who alleged that Louisiana’s election laws violated their constitutional rights. The defendants were state officials: Governor John Bel Edwards, Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, Attorney General Jeff Landry, and parish registrars Charlene Meaux Menard and Rhonda R. Rogers. The plaintiffs’ counsel was private law practice, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Fair Elections Center, and other attorneys.  \n\nThe complaint asserted violations of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 (civil‑rights action), 52 U.S.C. § 10302, and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The statutory and constitutional basis cited were the First Amendment’s right to vote, the Fourteenth Amendment’s due‑process and equal‑protection clauses, and the Voting Rights Act’s prohibition of disparate impact. Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, specifically a preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of Louisiana’s “Excuse Requirement,” “Witness Requirement,” and “Cure Prohibition” in all 2020 elections.  \n\nThe case was consolidated with the earlier lawsuit “Power Coalition for Equity and Justice v. Edwards.” Judge Shelly D. Dick presided over the matter. After filing a motion for preliminary injunction on June 1, 2020, the plaintiffs’ motion to intervene was granted by the court on June 5, 2020. The state and the parish registrars filed motions to dismiss the complaint on June 8, 2020, and the attorney general filed a separate motion to dismiss on June 11, 2020. The court ultimately dismissed the complaint with prejudice on June 22, 2020, terminating the case. No trial, appeal, settlement, decree, or monitor was recorded. The factual basis for the claim was the plaintiffs’ risk of COVID‑19 exposure, the state’s emergency election plan that limited absentee voting, and the contested election provisions that plaintiffs argued imposed unconstitutional burdens on voters.",
    "VR-SC-0078": "On April 22, 2020, a group of individual voters—Mary T. Thomas, Nea Richard, Jeremy Rutledge, Trena Walker, Dr. Brenda Williams, and the Family Unit, Inc.—filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina (Case No. 3:20‑cv‑01552‑JMC) against the South Carolina State Election Commission and the Governor, Marci Andino, John Wells, Clifford J. Edler, Scott Moseley, and Henry D. McMaster.  The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, NAACP, and other private counsel, alleged that the state’s absentee‑voting statutes—the “Excuse Requirement” (S.C. Code § 7‑15‑320) and the “Witness Requirement” (S.C. Code § 7‑15‑220)—unconstitutionally burden the right to vote under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, violate the Voting Rights Act (Section 2), and infringe the Americans with Disabilities Act.  They argued that, amid the COVID‑19 pandemic, these requirements force voters to choose between risking exposure to the virus or forgoing their vote, and that the law disproportionately harms African‑American voters.  The remedy sought was declaratory and injunctive relief, including an injunction that would enjoin enforcement of the challenged provisions for the 2020 election calendar.\n\nJudge J. Michelle Childs oversaw the case.  On April 28, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.  On May 8, 2020 the court granted a preliminary injunction that enjoined the Witness Requirement but did not enjoin the Excuse Requirement.  The injunction applied to the June 9, 2020 primary and the November 3, 2020 general election.  The court stayed the case pending further proceedings.  On August 10, 2020 the defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to meet the burden of proof for a constitutional violation.  The court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, finding no genuine dispute of material fact.  The plaintiffs’ amended complaint (July 13, 2020) added the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP as an additional plaintiff; a related case, “Middleton v. Andino,” was filed concurrently to address the Witness Requirement.  \n\nThe South Carolina Republican Party, citing Rule 24, moved to intervene as a matter of right or, alternatively, permissively.  The court granted the party’s motion to intervene on May 8, 2020, allowing the party to participate in all subsequent proceedings.  No settlement has been reached, and the case remains pending.  No trial has yet been conducted, nor has the court issued a final judgment beyond the preliminary injunction and the defendants’ summary‑judgment ruling.",
    "JC-MD-0017": "The action was filed on April 21, 2020 by a group of pre‑trial and post‑conviction detainees—Keith Seth, David Smith, Mario Burch, and John Doe 1–5—who represent a class of similarly situated persons at Prince George’s County Jail (PGCDOC).  Their counsel, a civil‑rights firm, sued the jail’s director, Mary Lou McDonough, alleging that the facility’s response to the COVID‑19 pandemic violated the detainees’ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights through deficient conditions of confinement, unlawful over‑detention of COVID‑positive inmates, and failure to release medically vulnerable prisoners.  The plaintiffs also petitioned for writs of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  Judge Paula Xinis presided over the case.\n\nOn May 21, 2020 the court entered a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction requiring the jail to provide basic hygiene supplies, adequate medical care, and to release COVID‑positive inmates who were no longer contagious.  In a letter order dated June 3, 2020 the court denied the defendant’s motion to stay the injunction pending appeal, finding that the TRO was not appealable and that McDonough had failed to meet the criteria for a stay.  The defendant complied with the court’s 14‑day reporting requirement and filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ amended complaint (filed July 7, 2020) on July 17, 2020, but the court denied that motion, leaving the amended claims and the injunction in place.\n\nNo trial, settlement, or appellate decision has yet been entered.  The case remains pending, with the plaintiffs continuing litigation to enforce the court’s injunctive orders and to challenge the jail’s ongoing COVID‑19 policies.",
    "IM-FL-0029": "On April 13 2020, civil immigration detainees held in the Krome Service Processing Center in Miami, the Broward Transitional Center in Pompano Beach, and the Glades County Detention Center in Moore Haven filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a complaint in the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division. The petitioners, represented by private attorneys and legal‑aid groups, alleged that the Miami Field Office of ICE (Field Office Director Michael W. Meade) and the U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr had violated the detainees’ Fifth‑Amendment right to due process by maintaining detention conditions that, amid the COVID‑19 pandemic, failed to meet CDC guidelines and thereby exposed the detainees to serious health risk. The action is a class action covering all current and future detainees at the three facilities. The cause of action is grounded in the Fifth Amendment and the Accardi doctrine; no monetary damages are sought. The requested relief is declaratory and injunctive, including release of detainees and enforcement of health and safety measures. Judge Marcia G. Cooke presided over the case. The petitioners filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and a motion for preliminary injunction on the filing date; a motion for class certification was filed on May 5 2020; a motion to compel compliance with the court’s orders was filed on May 20 2020. The court granted a temporary restraining order on April 30 2020 and a preliminary injunction on June 6 2020, ordering ICE to cease cohorting unconfirmed COVID‑19 cases, provide masks, cleaning supplies, and reduce the population to 75 % capacity. The court partially denied the class certification for the release claim but granted it for conditions‑of‑confinement claims on June 2 2020. On July 5 2020 the court granted the motion to compel compliance and appointed Special Master Matthew C. Stearns Weaver Miller to oversee compliance. No opinions, trials, or appeals are reported. A settlement agreement entered on June 28 2021 required ICE to continue complying with CDC guidelines, implement a vaccination plan, and maintain the conditions set forth in the final order; the settlement is court‑enforced. The special master continues to monitor compliance. The factual basis of the case centers on the COVID‑19 pandemic, CDC’s interim guidance on disease management in detention facilities, and the detainees’ inability to practice social distancing or obtain adequate hygiene supplies in the three facilities."
