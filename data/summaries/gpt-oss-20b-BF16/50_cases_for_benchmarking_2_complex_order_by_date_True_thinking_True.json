    "46290": "On March 5, 2025 the Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council (QEC), a student organization at Texas A&M University, filed a civil‑rights complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The complaint alleges that, in official capacities, members of the Board of Regents of the Texas A&M University System, the university’s Chancellor and President, violated the First Amendment by adopting and enforcing a “drag‑ban” resolution on February 28, 2025.  The resolution prohibited all drag shows on campus, citing concerns that such events “promote gender ideology” and “demean women,” and invoked a federal executive order on gender ideology.  The QEC had already reserved the Rudder Theatre for its annual Draggieland drag show, scheduled for March 27, 2025, and had sold tickets when the ban was enacted.  \n\nThe QEC’s suit is grounded in 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 and the Declaratory Judgment Act, alleging viewpoint discrimination, prior restraint, and violation of the Texas Education Code’s free‑speech provisions.  The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, a permanent injunction preventing enforcement of the ban, and injunctive relief allowing Draggieland to proceed.  The suit also alleges a violation of the Texas Open Meetings Act because the Board failed to provide 72 hours’ notice before the special meeting that adopted the resolution.  \n\nJudge Lee H. Rosenthal granted the QEC’s motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction on March 24, 2025.  The order enjoins the Board, Chancellor, and President from enforcing the drag‑ban resolution, requires the QEC to hold the Draggieland event on March 27, 2025 in the Rudder Theatre, and voids the resolution under the Texas Open Meetings Act.  The injunction remains in effect until further order.  \n\nOn March 28, 2025 the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, challenging the preliminary injunction.  The appeal is pending. No settlement or monitoring agreement has been entered into. The court’s orders affirm that the ban was unconstitutional, constituting viewpoint discrimination and a prior restraint that infringes the QEC’s First‑Amendment rights.",
    "46324": "On March 31 2025, Inclusiv, Inc., a nonprofit community‑development organization, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Acting Deputy Administrator W.C. McIntosh, and Citibank, N.A. The suit alleges that EPA, acting in its official capacity, unlawfully froze the Greenhouse‑Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) grant funds that EPA was required to allocate under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and that it subsequently attempted to terminate Inclusiv’s Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) award.  \n\nInclusiv received a $1.87 billion CCIA award on August 8 2024 and had been planning to distribute the funds to 108 credit‑union subrecipients. On February 11 2025 EPA issued a notice of freeze, preventing Citibank (the designated financial agent) from disbursing the grant funds. On March 11 2025 EPA sent a termination letter, which would have revoked Inclusiv’s award and returned the entire balance to the Treasury. Citibank has refused to open subrecipient accounts or disburse funds, citing EPA’s instructions, and has not complied with Inclusiv’s lawful requests.  \n\nThe complaint is grounded in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701‑706, asserting that EPA’s actions are “arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law.” The plaintiff also alleges violations of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, the Anti‑Deficiency Act, EPA regulations, and several constitutional provisions (separation of powers, due process, and the Take‑Care and Spending Clauses).  \n\nInclusiv seeks declaratory relief that EPA’s freeze and termination are unlawful, injunctive relief to restore the frozen funds and prevent further EPA or Citibank interference, and enforcement of the Account Control Agreement that obligates Citibank to disburse the funds per Inclusiv’s instructions. No monetary damages are requested.  \n\nOn April 1 2025, Inclusiv filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). The court granted the TRO, ordering EPA and Citibank to restore the frozen funds to Inclusiv’s Citibank account. The preliminary‑injunction motion was denied on April 16 2025. On April 15 2025 the court consolidated this case with case 25‑cv‑698, citing common questions of law and fact, and all pleadings thereafter are to be filed in the lead case. The proceedings are overseen by Judge Tanya S. Chutkan.  \n\nNo settlements, monitoring arrangements, or later court opinions have been reported to date. The case remains pending, with the court’s TRO in effect and the preliminary‑injunction denial noted.",
    "46391": "On April 11 2025 the five plaintiffs—four current F‑1 international students and one former student now working under post‑graduate Optional Practical Training—filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (San Jose Division). They allege that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) terminated their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records on April 4–8 2025 without lawful authority, relying on a generic \"Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status\" code that cited a criminal‑records check, although none of the plaintiffs had any criminal conduct that would constitute a failure to maintain F‑1 status. The plaintiffs contend that the terminations were arbitrary, capricious, and violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Declaratory Judgment Act, and that they also deprived the plaintiffs of their Fifth‑Amendment right to due process. They seek a declaration that the terminations were unlawful, a vacatur of the SEVIS terminations and restoration of their F‑1 status, injunctive relief preventing arrest, detention, transfer, or removal, and reasonable costs and attorney fees.\n\nThe defendants sued in their official capacities are Secretary of DHS Kristi Noem, Acting Director of ICE Todd M. Lyons, Acting Field Office Director of ICE Moises Becerra, and President Donald J. Trump. Plaintiffs’ counsel is private attorney Zachary Nightingale; defendants’ counsel is private attorney Elizabeth D. Kurlan.\n\nBecause the plaintiffs feared retaliation, they filed a motion to proceed pseudonymously, which the court granted on April 17 2025. That same day Judge Noel Wise granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and set a briefing schedule, ordering the defendants not to arrest, detain, transfer, or remove the plaintiffs for 14 days. The TRO also required the defendants to redact plaintiffs’ identifying information and prohibited the disclosure of any personal data beyond what is necessary for the litigation.\n\nThe case was later assigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White. Judge White scheduled a preliminary‑injunction hearing for May 13 2025 and, on May 22 2025, granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, which imposes similar prohibitions on enforcement actions and protects the plaintiffs’ status pending the final decision. The defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21 2025, challenging the court’s orders.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ complaint is not a class action; it involves individual claims. The case is related to the earlier action 25‑cv‑03140‑JSW (Doe v. Trump) but has not been consolidated. No settlement has been reached, and no court‑enforced monitoring order exists. The factual basis of the case centers on the abrupt, unwarranted termination of SEVIS records that deprived the plaintiffs of lawful F‑1 status and exposed them to potential arrest, detention, transfer, and removal.",
    "46509": "The United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered a complaint on April 29, 2025 in case No. 1:25‑cv‑01305, filed by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), its Board of Directors, and three board members—Laura G. Ross, Thomas E. Rothman, and Diane Kaplan.  The defendants are Donald J. Trump in his official capacity as President of the United States, Trent Morse, the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel, the United States Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, the Director of OMB, the White House Presidential Personnel Office, and Sergio Gor, the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office.  The plaintiffs are private counsel from Saul Ewing LLP.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that on April 28, 2025 an email purporting to terminate the three board members’ positions was sent by Trent Morse on behalf of the President.  They contend that the President has no statutory authority to remove CPB board members, citing the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which establishes CPB as a private nonprofit corporation insulated from federal interference, and the Administrative Procedure Act.  The plaintiffs also invoke constitutional provisions—separation of powers, the Presentment Clause, the Appropriations Clause, and the Take‑Care Clause—to argue that the President’s action is ultra‑vires.  The requested relief is a declaratory judgment that the email has no legal effect and a preliminary injunction (later a temporary restraining order) preventing the defendants from giving effect to the purported removal or otherwise interfering with CPB’s governance.\n\nThe motion for a temporary restraining order was filed on the same day as the complaint.  A hearing on the motion occurred on May 14, 2025.  Judge Randolph D. Moss, in a memorandum opinion and order dated June 8, 2025, denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, holding that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits and a likelihood of irreparable harm.  The court granted pro‑hac‑vice admission to two counsel on April 30, 2025 and set a briefing schedule for summary judgment.  Subsequent docket entries show voluntary dismissals of the individual claims of Laura Ross and Thomas Rothman, but no settlement, decree, or monitoring order has been entered.  The case remains pending for further post‑motion proceedings.",
    "46590": "In the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, Charleston Division, plaintiff Harry Wiley, a coal‑mining electrician with a diagnosis of black lung, sued the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) on April 7, 2025. Wiley filed a class‑action complaint on behalf of all miners in the district who have evidence of pneumoconiosis and who are eligible for the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) and the Part 90 job‑transfer program. The complaint, supported by a private law firm, alleges that DHS’s abrupt termination of the Respiratory Health Division (RHD) at NIOSH on April 1, 2025—via a reduction‑in‑force notice issued March 27, 2025—violated the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 (30 U.S.C. § 843) and its anti‑backsliding provision (30 U.S.C. § 811(a)(9)), the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706), and the Fifth Amendment’s due‑process clause. Wiley seeks declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to restore the RHD, resume the CWHSP and Part 90 program, and compel DHS to provide the statutory medical screenings and job‑transfer rights that miners have earned.\n\nAfter filing the amended complaint on April 21, 2025, Wiley moved for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the RHD closure caused irreparable injury by denying miners timely medical examinations and the right to transfer to low‑dust jobs. DHS answered on June 16, 2025, and on May 1, 2025, filed motions to dismiss and to seal confidential attachments. The court denied the dismissal motions and, after a hearing on May 7, 2025, issued a memorandum opinion and order on May 13, 2025 granting the preliminary injunction. The injunction enjoins the RIFs in the RHD, requires full restoration of the division, mandates continued CWHSP and Part 90 operations, and directs the Secretary to certify compliance within twenty days. The court set the security requirement at zero.\n\nSubsequent to the injunction, Wiley filed a second amended complaint on July 9, 2025. The court granted leave to file the second amended complaint on August 14, 2025, and issued a related order, terminating all moot motions and sealing attachments. No settlement has been reached; the case remains pending, with the parties preparing for further discovery and potential trial. The judge presiding over the matter is Judge Irene C. Berger.",
    "46605": "On May 17, 2025, Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan, a Venezuelan citizen detained by ICE at the Desert View Annex, filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and a class‑action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The petition alleges that the President of the United States, together with the Attorney General, the Secretaries of Homeland Security, Defense, and State, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and other government officials, unlawfully removed Arevalo and other Venezuelan nationals pursuant to Executive Order Proclamation No. 10903, which invokes the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). Arevalo seeks a preliminary injunction and a declaratory judgment to prevent the removal of himself and a putative class of Venezuelan detainees. The cause of action is a claim that the removal violates the Fifth‑Amendment right to due process. The plaintiff’s counsel is private law firm SchroederLaw, represented by Joshua Jonathan Schroeder; the defendants are represented by government counsel. The case is a class action.\n\nJudge John W. Holcomb granted the petitioner’s application for a temporary restraining order and motion for class certification in part on May 19, 2025. The order temporarily enjoined the government from removing Arevalo or any class member under the proclamation, required the government to provide at least thirty days’ notice before removal, and directed preservation of evidence. A hearing was set for May 30, 2025, and the TRO was extended to June 2, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, 2025, the judge issued an amended order granting a preliminary injunction and class certification in part. The injunction further enjoined the government from transferring detainees out of the district for any purpose other than lawful removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act, directed the petitioner to post a nominal bond of $1, and clarified that the injunction does not prevent the government from releasing detainees or removing them under the INA. The class was certified for the limited purpose of adjudicating the amount of notice due before removal under the AEA or proclamation.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, Judge Holcomb denied an ex‑parte application for a writ of habeas corpus, directing the government to file periodic status reports on its appeal in Arevalo’s removal and asylum proceedings. The defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit on August 1, 2025. No settlement has been reached, and the case remains pending. Related cases, including Trump v. J.G.G. and A.A.R.P. v. Trump, provide precedent on the enforceability of the proclamation and notice requirements for alien enemies. No court‑appointed monitor has been named, and no settlement disputes have been reported.",
    "46635": "On May 22 2025, Shira Perlmutter, the Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She alleged that President Donald J. Trump had unlawfully removed her from office by appointing Todd Blanche, the Deputy Attorney General, as acting Librarian of Congress and Paul Perkins as acting Register of Copyrights. The complaint contends that the President’s actions violated the constitutional Appointments Clause and the statutory authority vested in the Librarian of Congress under 17 U.S.C. § 701(a) and 2 U.S.C. § 136. Perlmutter seeks declaratory relief and an injunction to prevent her removal and to restore her position.\n\nPerlmutter’s counsel, a private law firm, filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and, later, a motion for a preliminary injunction. The court denied both motions. The denial of the temporary restraining order was issued on May 28 2025; the denial of the preliminary injunction, along with a memorandum opinion, was issued on July 30 2025. The court held that Perlmutter had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief. Judge Timothy J. Kelly presided over the case.\n\nFollowing the denial, Perlmutter filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 31 2025. While the appeal is pending, she also filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal on August 4 2025, which the court denied on August 20 2025. No settlement has been reached, no injunctions or decrees have been issued, and no monitoring arrangements are in place. The case remains active in federal court, with the appellate panel yet to render a decision.",
    "45143": "The United States District Court for the District of Wyoming entered the action on April 20 2023 when Ashley and Sean Willey, parents and a teacher, filed a complaint against Sweetwater County School District No. 1 Board of Trustees, Superintendent Kelly McGovern, Assistant Superintendent Nicole Bolton, Director of Student Services Kayci Arnoldi, and Principal Bryant Blake.  The suit is an individual civil action, not a class action.  Plaintiffs are represented by a private law firm (Bailey Stock Harmon Cottam Lopez LLP) with attorneys Henry F. Bailey Jr., Ernest G. Trakas, Mary E. McAlister, and Vernadette R. Broyles, while defendants are represented by attorneys L. Kathleen Chaney and Eric Hevenor.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the school district’s “Preferred Names and Parent‑Concealment Policy” required staff to use children’s chosen names and pronouns and to conceal from parents any student’s request to be treated as a different gender unless the child consented.  They claim the policy violates their fundamental parental rights to direct their children’s upbringing, medical and mental‑health decisions, and religious freedom, as well as the teacher’s First‑Amendment free‑speech rights.  The cause of action is based on 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (civil‑rights violations) with the constitutional basis in the Fourteenth Amendment’s due‑process clause, the free‑exercise clause, and the free‑speech clause.  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, monetary damages, and attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.\n\nOn April 21 2023, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.  Judge Scott W. Skavdahl issued an order on June 30 2023 granting the injunction in part: the district was enjoined from requiring staff to lie about a child’s gender identity or from precluding staff from responding to parents’ inquiries about the child’s name or pronoun.  The injunction was denied in all other respects, leaving the policy largely intact.\n\nDefendants moved to dismiss the complaint on June 29 2023 under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (6).  Because plaintiffs filed an amendment on July 20 2023, the court held the amendment superseded the original complaint and denied the motion to dismiss as moot without prejudice (July 20 2023).  Plaintiffs’ amended complaint, filed July 20 2023, reiterated the factual allegations and expanded on the policy’s content, including its impact on the Willeys’ daughter, A.S., who has a history of trauma and a private treatment plan.\n\nOn August 17 2023, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.  The court partially denied that motion on December 18 2023, allowing plaintiffs to proceed on nominal and compensatory‑damages claims for certain allegations while dismissing others.  The case then advanced to the merits stage.\n\nDefendants filed a motion for summary judgment on March 24 2025.  Judge Scott W. Skavdahl granted the motion on April 28 2025, dismissing plaintiffs on all remaining claims (Counts I, II, and III) and concluding the case in favor of the defendants.  No settlement or monitor was obtained; the only decree issued was the partial preliminary injunction.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed the summary‑judgment order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on May 23 2025, filing a notice of appeal and preliminary record.  The appellate case is pending.\n\nIn sum, the action began with plaintiffs’ allegations that the school district’s gender‑affirmation policy violated constitutional rights.  After a preliminary injunction was granted in part, the defendants successfully moved for summary judgment, and the court dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims.  The plaintiffs have appealed that decision.",
    "PH-IL-0002": "On May 10, 2016, a class‑action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois (East St. Louis Division) by current and former residents of the Alexander County Housing Authority’s (ACHA) McBride and Elmwood public‑housing developments—most of whom are African American—against ACHA and its former executive directors James Wilson, Thomas Upchurch, Joanne Pink, and Martha Franklin. The plaintiffs alleged that ACHA discriminated on the basis of race and familial status, maintained its McBride and Elmwood units in a state of disrepair, and overcharged residents in violation of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3604), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 2000d), the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003, and the Brooke Amendment to the U.S. Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 1437a). They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, damages for rent overcharges, and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel, including Christopher J. Wilmes, while defendants were represented by Stephen J. Moore and counsel from Galloway, Johnson, etc. The case was initially assigned to Chief Judge Michael J. Reagan and later to Magistrate Judge Reona J. Daly. After filing amended complaints, engaging in discovery and settlement conferences, many plaintiffs withdrew or otherwise failed to prosecute their claims, and the court dismissed the action with prejudice on September 12, 2017, directing each party to bear its own attorneys’ fees and closing the case. No trial, settlement, or decree resulted.",
    "16518": "On April 14, 2022 the United States of America filed a federal civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina against the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ).  The suit, brought under the pattern‑or‑practice provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (34 U.S.C. § 12601) and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, alleged that DJJ’s Broad River Road Complex (BRRC) violated the constitutional rights of juveniles by failing to keep them safely away from peer violence and by subjecting them to punitive, prolonged isolation.  The DOJ’s 2017–2020 investigation, conducted under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (42 U.S.C. § 1997), documented routine assaults, inadequate staffing, insufficient surveillance, and a policy of using isolation for minor infractions.  \n\nThe complaint sought injunctive relief, including a permanent injunction to compel DJJ to correct the unconstitutional conditions and to implement remedial measures.  On April 13, 2022 the United States and DJJ entered into a settlement agreement that incorporated the DOJ’s remedial recommendations.  The agreement required DJJ to (1) conduct a staffing study and adjust staff‑to‑youth ratios, (2) improve physical surveillance and video retention, (3) revise use‑of‑force and isolation policies to limit punitive use, (4) provide comprehensive staff training in de‑escalation and positive behavior management, (5) establish a multidisciplinary review of isolation placements, and (6) collect and report safety and use‑of‑force data.  DJJ must implement these measures within four years, with the agreement terminating after five years if DJJ attains substantial compliance for one year.  A court‑appointed subject‑matter expert will monitor compliance and produce biannual reports, and the United States may seek court enforcement if DJJ materially breaches the settlement.  \n\nThe United States filed a joint motion for conditional dismissal on April 14, 2022, and the court dismissed the action without prejudice on April 20, 2022, retaining jurisdiction to enforce the settlement.  The case was heard by Judge Mary Geiger Lewis, after earlier assignment to Judges Joseph F. Anderson, Jr. and Sherri A. Lydon.  No trial or appeal has occurred.  The factual basis of the case rests on the DOJ’s investigative findings of unsafe conditions, excessive staff use of force, inadequate training, and punitive isolation practices at BRRC that violated juveniles’ Fourteenth‑Amendment rights.",
    "46815": "The United States filed an indictment on **May 21, 2025** against a defendant of El Salvadorian origin, alleging he conspired to transport illegal aliens for financial gain and that he personally transported undocumented individuals for profit—charges under 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v) and (ii) (conspiracy and actual smuggling). The indictment was sealed at the government’s request and was unsealed on **June 6, 2025** after the defendant was arrested in Nashville following his return from El Salvador.  \n\nAt the initial appearance on June 6, the defendant was appointed federal public defenders and arraigned. The United States, seeking pre‑trial detention, filed a motion on the same day. A magistrate judge ordered the government to comply with Brady discovery requirements on June 6 and, on **June 12**, directed the government to provide all discovery materials relevant to the detention hearing by that day.  \n\nThe detention hearing was held on **June 13, 2025**. The judge ruled that the government had not met its burden under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f) to justify a detention hearing—specifically, the government failed to show that the defendant’s alleged crimes involved a minor victim or posed a serious risk of flight or obstruction. Consequently, the judge **denied the motion for detention** and ordered the defendant’s release pending trial, subject to conditions to be set at a later hearing.  \n\nA release‑conditions hearing was scheduled for **June 25, 2025**. The defendant remained in U.S. Marshals custody until that hearing, where the magistrate again ordered the defendant to remain in custody pending the issuance of a release order, and set a hearing on **July 16, 2025** to consider a motion the government filed to revoke the release order.  \n\nOn **July 23, 2025**, the district judge denied the government’s motion to revoke the release order, affirming the magistrate’s denial of detention and confirming that the defendant should be released on conditions. The judge also scheduled a trial for **January 27, 2026**.  \n\nThe defendant subsequently moved to modify the conditions of release. An order on **August 22, 2025** released the defendant, incorporating the conditions outlined in the magistrate’s earlier orders (e.g., restrictions on contact with witnesses and monitoring). No settlement or court‑enforced monitoring beyond these conditions was entered.  \n\nThroughout the pre‑trial period, the court issued orders requiring the government to provide evidence in accordance with the Due Process Protections Act and to disclose materials under the Brady rule. No criminal trial has yet taken place; the case is scheduled to proceed to trial in early 2026.",
    "46755": "On July 1, 2025, the City of Columbus, Ohio; the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland; the City of Chicago, Illinois; Doctors for America; and the Main Street Alliance filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Case 1:25‑cv‑02114‑BAH) against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in his official capacity as Secretary of HHS.  The plaintiffs allege that CMS’s final rule, titled “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability” (the “2025 Rule”), violates the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and is contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, specifically a stay of the rule’s effective date under 5 U.S.C. § 705 while the merits are decided.\n\nThe plaintiffs are individual plaintiffs; no class certification was pursued.  Their cause of action is based on the APA’s “unlawful and set‑aside” standard and the ACA’s statutory provisions governing guaranteed issue, renewability, and premium subsidies.  The remedy sought is a judicial declaration that the rule is unlawful, a preliminary injunction, and a stay of the rule’s implementation.\n\nJudge Brendan A. Hurson presided over the case.  No related or consolidated cases were reported.  After the complaint, the parties filed motions for a stay, responses, and a hearing was held on August 14, 2025.  The court’s memorandum opinion (dated August 22, 2025) held that the plaintiffs had standing, that they likely would succeed on the merits for certain challenged provisions, and that they would suffer irreparable harm if the rule took effect.  The court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a stay in part.  The August 25, 2025 order clarified the stay: the effective dates of seven provisions of the 2025 Rule were stayed pending a final ruling on the merits—including the $5 premium penalty on automatic re‑enrollees, the revocation of guaranteed coverage for individuals with past‑due premiums, the failure‑to‑reconcile policy, special enrollment period verification, income‑inconsistency verification, changes to actuarial value ranges, and self‑attestation of projected income.  The stay did not apply to the rule’s change to the premium‑adjustment‑percentage methodology or to the elimination of the 60‑day extension for income‑verification.\n\nNo trial, settlement, or final decree has yet been entered.  The case remains pending on the court’s determination of the merits of the plaintiffs’ challenges.",
    "46576": "In a complaint filed on April 10, 2025, the State of New York, the State of Arizona, the State of California, the State of Delaware, the District of Columbia, the State of Hawai‘i, the State of Illinois, the State of Maine, the State of Maryland, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the People of the State of Michigan, the State of Minnesota, the State of Nevada, the State of New Jersey, the State of New Mexico, the State of Oregon, and Josh Shapiro in his official capacity as Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) sued the United States Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon on the grounds that the Department’s March 28, 2025 rescission letter, which abruptly terminated all previously granted extensions of time to liquidate Education Stabilization Fund (ESF) awards, was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  The plaintiffs, represented by the attorneys general of the states and the governor’s counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief: a declaration that the rescission letter violated the APA, a permanent injunction preventing the Department from enforcing or modifying the liquidation periods without notice, and the reinstatement of the extensions that had been granted through March 28, 2026.  \n\nThe U.S. Department of Education and Secretary McMahon, acting in their official capacities, were the defendants.  The case was heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, where Judge Edgardo Ramos held the proceedings.  On May 6, 2025, Judge Ramos entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the Department from enforcing the March 28 rescission letter and from altering the liquidation periods without at least fourteen days’ notice, directing the Department to process pending and future liquidation requests without delay and to file status reports.  A second preliminary injunction was issued on June 3, 2025, extending the injunction’s scope to the May 11 “Dear‑Colleague” letter that further revised the liquidation periods and requiring the Department to continue processing requests in a timely manner.  \n\nThe plaintiffs’ claims were brought under the APA; the statutory basis is the APA’s requirement that agency actions be made with a reasoned explanation and that reliance interests be considered.  The remedy sought is injunctive relief to prevent the Department from nullifying the extensions and to require prompt processing of payments.  No trial has yet occurred, and the case remains pending on the merits.  \n\nOn June 10, 2025, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the Department’s emergency motion for a stay pending appeal and rejected an application for an administrative stay of the district court’s injunction.  The appellate order referred the motion for a stay pending appeal to a three‑judge panel; the case is therefore still pending before the district court, with the appellate panel to review the motion for a stay at a later date.  No settlement or court‑appointed monitor has been entered.  \n\nThe factual basis of the case is that the Department had granted the states extensions to liquidate hundreds of millions of dollars in COVID‑19 relief awards, and that the March 28 rescission letter, issued without notice and without a reasoned explanation, abruptly ended those extensions, causing the states to face potential funding gaps, program disruptions, and contractual obligations to vendors and staff.  The plaintiffs argue that the rescission letter was arbitrary and capricious, violated the APA, and would inflict irreparable harm on the states’ education systems.  The district court’s injunction aims to preserve the status quo and prevent further harm while the case proceeds.",
    "46637": "On May 27, 2025, National Public Radio, Inc. and its local member stations—Roaring Fork Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio, and KSUT—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump (in his official capacity), the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of the Treasury, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The plaintiffs allege that on May 1, 2025 the President issued Executive Order 14290, “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,” which directed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and all federal agencies to cease direct and indirect funding to NPR and PBS and to prohibit local public‑radio stations from using federal funds to acquire NPR programming. The plaintiffs claim the order violates the First Amendment—by imposing viewpoint‑based discrimination and retaliation—and the Fifth Amendment’s due‑process clause, as well as the statutory framework of the Public Broadcasting Act (47 U.S.C. §§ 396, 398) and the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act (20 U.S.C. § 954). They seek declaratory and injunctive relief to block enforcement of the order and to preserve federal funding for NPR and its member stations. Plaintiffs are represented by Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, while the defendants are represented by attorneys from the Department of Justice. Judge Randolph D. Moss presides over the case. The complaint was joined by a related action, *Corporation for Public Broadcasting v. Trump* (No. 25‑cv‑1305). The plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment (filed June 13, 2025) was accompanied by a petition for expedited briefing on June 10, 2025, and the defendants submitted a memorandum of law on July 12, 2025, arguing that the claims are not ripe and that the order is within the executive branch’s discretion. The plaintiffs responded with a combined opposition (July 25, 2025). The court has granted motions for leave to appear pro hac vice, an expedited briefing schedule, and extensions of time, but no substantive ruling on the merits has yet been issued. No settlement, decree, or monitoring order appears in the record.",
    "46340": "On April 3, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United (NNOC/NNU), the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the National Association of Government Employees (NAGE), and the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Oakland Division. These unions sued President Donald J. Trump in his official capacity as President, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and dozens of federal agencies and their heads—most notably the Departments of State, Defense, Treasury, Veterans Affairs, Justice, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Interior, Energy, Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, International Trade Commission, General Services Administration, Social Security Administration, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education, along with their senior officials. The complaint alleges that Executive Order 14,251, issued by Trump on March 27, 2025, unlawfully excluded a broad array of agencies from the FSLMRS under 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) and that the order was motivated by retaliation against the plaintiffs’ First‑Amendment‑protected speech and petitioning. The plaintiffs argue that the order was ultra‑vires, violated the Fifth‑Amendment procedural due process, abrogated property rights in collective‑bargaining agreements, and constituted unlawful equal‑protection discrimination. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief to restore union recognition, collective‑bargaining rights, dues deductions, and grievance procedures, as well as attorneys’ fees and costs.  \n\nJudge James Donato, after reviewing the complaint and the plaintiffs’ ex‑parte motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction filed on April 7, 2025, issued a preliminary injunction on June 24, 2025. The injunction enjoins all named agencies and agency heads from implementing or enforcing Section 2 of Executive Order 14,251, requires them to maintain existing collective‑bargaining agreements, preserve dues deductions, and continue to provide official time and office space to unions. The order remains in effect pending further court action.  \n\nOn June 26, 2025, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals granted an administrative stay of the injunction on July 10, 2025, pending a ruling on the appeal. The preliminary injunction’s terms, including the prohibition against terminating CBAs and the requirement to maintain union dues, remain in effect until the appellate court issues a final decision. No settlement or monitoring order has been entered. The case centers on the constitutionality of a broad executive action that the plaintiffs contend was a retaliatory, overbroad use of national‑security authority that stripped federal workers of their collective‑bargaining rights.",
    "46805": "The case was filed on July 21, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The plaintiffs are a coalition of nonprofit organizations that provide services to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and homelessness, including the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the California Partnership to End Domestic Violence, the Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault, the District of Columbia Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the End Abuse Wisconsin coalition, the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence, the Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Jane Doe Inc., the Massachusetts Coalition Against Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence, the Kansas Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence, the Montana Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, the North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the Oregon Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, ValorUS, Violence Free Minnesota, the Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance, the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault, House of Hope Community Development Corporation, the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness, Community Care Alliance, Foster Forward, and Haus of Codec.  \n\nThe defendants are federal officials and agencies: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in his official capacity as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services; the Department of Health and Human Services; Andrew Gradison, Acting Assistant Secretary of the Administration for Children and Families; the Administration for Children and Families; Susan Monarez, Acting Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Thomas J. Engels, Administrator of the Health Resources & Services Administration; the Health Resources & Services Administration; Scott Turner, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development; and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that, following a series of executive orders issued by the President, HUD and HHS have imposed new funding conditions on federal grant programs—including Continuum of Care, Community Development Block Grant, Emergency Solutions Grant, and various HHS programs such as the Family Violence Prevention Services Act and the Violence Prevention Program—that require grantees to certify they do not promote “gender ideology,” to certify that they do not operate programs that advance diversity, equity, inclusion, or “discriminatory equity ideology,” and to certify that they will not use grant funds to promote elective abortion. The plaintiffs argue these conditions are not authorized by Congress, are vague, and chill protected speech and other constitutional rights. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief to set aside the new conditions and prevent their enforcement.\n\nThe action is brought under the Administrative Procedure Act for exceeding statutory authority, acting contrary to law, arbitrarily and capriciously, and for violating the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment due process clause, as well as for infringing the separation of powers and the Spending Clause. Plaintiffs also seek attorneys’ fees and other relief.\n\nThe case is pending before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose.  On July 28, 2025, Judge DuBose granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), ordering HUD and HHS not to enforce the new funding conditions on the plaintiffs’ grant programs and requiring compliance within 24 hours.  The TRO was amended on August 7, 2025, expanding the list of plaintiffs covered and clarifying the scope of the injunction.  Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705 on August 4, 2025, and have submitted subsequent amending motions and requests for further orders.  No trial, settlement, or monitoring has occurred as of the latest docket entry.",
    "46375": "On April 9, 2025, the Southern Education Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that has promoted school desegregation since 1867, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the United States Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon, and President Donald J. Trump.  The Foundation alleged that the Department’s abrupt termination of its 2022 grant to operate the Equity Assistance Center for the southern region (EAC‑South) violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Fifth Amendment’s due‑process clause, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and the statutory authority granted by Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Represented by private counsel, the Foundation sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, including immediate reinstatement of the grant, an order preventing further termination, and reimbursement of unpaid and incurred expenses.  Judge Paul L. Friedman, hearing a motion for a preliminary injunction filed on April 23, 2025, granted the injunction on May 21, 2025.  In his opinion, the court found the Department’s termination arbitrary and capricious under the APA and ordered the Department to restore the grant, pay the $293,681.78 owed, and enjoin any further termination.  The Department and its officials appealed the injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 18, 2025.  No settlement has been reached and no monitor has been appointed.  The case centers on the fact that the Department’s February 13, 2025 termination—prompted by Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 that sought to eliminate “diversity, equity, and inclusion” programs—was issued without a reasoned decision, notice, or opportunity to be heard, thereby depriving the Foundation of its sole source of funding for a program that serves 130 of 132 open federal desegregation cases in the South.",
    "46284": "The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 24, 2025. The plaintiff is a 21‑year‑old lawful permanent resident and junior at Columbia University who has participated in student protests supporting Palestinian rights. The defendants are federal officials acting in their official capacities: the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Acting Field Office Director of ICE in New York. The plaintiff’s counsel includes a private law firm and several public‑interest organizations.\n\nThe complaint alleges that, following the plaintiff’s arrest on March 5 2025 outside a Barnard College building during a protest, federal officials used the foreign‑policy ground of U.S. immigration law (8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(4)(C) and 1182(a)(3)(C)(iii)) to target her for removal. The government’s “Policy”—publicly announced on March 6, 2025—authorizes the Secretary of State to identify noncitizens “whose presence or activities would have potentially serious adverse foreign‑policy consequences” and to shift ICE to detain or deport them. The plaintiff contends that the policy is premised on her protected First‑Amendment speech and that it violates the First Amendment, the Fifth‑Amendment due‑process clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the statutory requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nOn March 24, 2025 the plaintiff filed a complaint and petition for writ of habeas corpus. She also filed a proposed temporary restraining order and a motion to show cause for a preliminary injunction. On March 25, 2025 Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald granted a temporary restraining order, enjoining the defendants from detaining, transferring, or deporting the plaintiff pending further orders and requiring 72‑hour notice for any other detention. The order also waived the bond requirement under Rule 65(c). A subsequent order to show cause was set for May 20, 2025.\n\nOn June 5, 2025 Judge Buchwald issued a preliminary injunction that reiterated the restraining order’s terms and added that the defendants must provide advance notice if they seek to detain the plaintiff on any basis other than the foreign‑policy ground. The injunction also enjoined the defendants from transferring the plaintiff out of the district and from removing her from the United States. The injunction remains in effect pending further proceedings.\n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss on April 11, 2025, arguing lack of jurisdiction and other defenses. The motion was partially denied on June 5, 2025. On July 3, 2025 the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the Second Circuit, contending that the district court lacked subject‑matter jurisdiction. The appeal record was transmitted to the appellate court on July 7, 2025; the appellate decision has not yet been issued.\n\nThe factual record shows that the plaintiff was arrested during a protest, received a desk‑appearance ticket, and was later targeted by ICE with an administrative arrest warrant and search warrants on March 13, 2025. The government’s actions were tied to the plaintiff’s participation in pro‑Palestinian demonstrations and to a broader federal policy of targeting noncitizens for such speech. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, including a declaration that the defendants’ actions violate the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and immigration law, as well as attorney’s fees and any other relief the court deems appropriate.",
    "46735": "On June 20, 2025, the Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools—an independent school district in New Mexico—filed a verified complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico (Case No. 1:25‑cv‑00586) against the Secretary of Education (Linda McMahon), the U.S. Department of Education, and President Donald J. Trump.  The district’s counsel is the private law firm Himes, Petrarca & Fester, Chtd.  No class action was asserted; the plaintiffs are the district itself.  \n\nThe complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2201, alleging that the Department’s termination of a $6 million mental‑health grant—awarded under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (Pub. L. 117‑159, 163 Stat. 1313) and the federal statute 42 U.S.C. § 254c–19—violates statutory authority (5 U.S.C. § 702; 28 U.S.C. § 1331), the Spending Clause, and constitutional protections under the First and Fifth Amendments.  The complaint also challenges a Dear Colleague Letter issued February 14, 2025 and an “End DEI” portal, claiming they unlawfully threaten to withhold federal funding for schools that provide diversity, equity, and inclusion programming.  The remedy sought is a declaratory judgment that the termination and the DCL are unlawful, a permanent injunction preventing further enforcement of the termination and the DCL, reinstatement of the grant, and reimbursement for expenses incurred under the terminated award.  \n\nThe case was assigned to U.S. District Judge William P. Johnson.  After the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on June 23, 2025, the court held a hearing on July 16, 2025.  On July 18, 2025, Judge Johnson issued an opinion and order dismissing the complaint without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction, holding that the claims essentially seek payment of money under a federal contract and should be brought in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.  The court also denied the motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.  \n\nThe factual basis of the dispute is that the Silver Consolidated Schools had received a $6 million grant to expand school‑based mental‑health services, including the hiring of seven new professionals and the creation of wellness rooms and a mobile app.  On April 29, 2025 the Department terminated the grant, citing a shift in administrative priorities, thereby depriving the district of essential mental‑health resources.  The plaintiffs argue that the termination is arbitrary, capricious, and unconstitutional, and that the Department’s DCL and “End DEI” portal constitute unlawful threats of funding withdrawal.  The court found no jurisdiction to entertain the claims and dismissed the case.",

The plaintiffs allege that the Secretary and the Department, in February 2025, terminated the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) by canceling a wide range of contracts, eliminating about 90 % of IES staff, and discontinuing the remote‑access program for restricted‑use data.  The plaintiffs claim that those actions are ultra‑vires, violate the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (ESRA) and other federal statutes, and undermine the IES’s statutory mission to conduct research, collect data, and disseminate information to educators, researchers, and the public.  They seek declaratory and injunctive relief to restore the IES’s functions, reinstate staff, and prevent further termination of IES programs.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ counsel is the Public Citizen Litigation Group.  The case is an individual action, not a class action.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting that the court restrain the Secretary and the Department from further terminating IES programs, reinstate canceled contracts and staff, and resume the remote‑access data program.  Judge Trevor N. McFadden denied the motion on June 3, 2025, holding that the plaintiffs had not presented a clear showing that they would succeed on the merits and that the claims were too broad and programmatic to be actionable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss on July 2, 2025.  Judge McFadden denied that motion on July 16, 2025, finding that the plaintiffs’ claims were not preempted by federal law.  The plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint on July 16, 2025, asserting additional claims but without materially changing the core allegations.\n\nThe case was dismissed on August 19, 2025.  No settlement was reached, no trial took place, and no appellate action was filed.  No decree or monitor was issued.  The case was not consolidated with the related action (No. 25‑1266) involving the National Academy of Education and the National Council on Measurement in Education, although the parties noted the related filing.",
    "46322": "On March 31, 2025, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Secure Families Initiative, and the Arizona Students’ Association filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia asserting that President Donald J. Trump’s Executive Order 14,248 unlawfully interfered with the federal election process.  The plaintiffs allege that the order directs the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to add a documentary‑proof‑of‑citizenship requirement to the National Mail Voter Registration Form, compels the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to provide access to voter‑registration data, requires federal agencies to verify citizenship before issuing the form, and conditions federal funding on compliance with an election‑day‑receipt deadline.  The complaint bases its claim on the Constitution’s Elections Clause and separation‑of‑powers provisions, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA).  Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction to halt implementation of the contested provisions.  \n\nDefendants—including the Executive Office of the President, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of the Interior, and the Small Business Administration—filed an opposition on April 14, 2025, arguing that the plaintiffs lack standing, the challenges are premature, and the order is consistent with applicable law.  \n\nThe case was consolidated with two other suits brought by the Democratic National Committee and the League of Women Voters, making the docket 1:25‑cv‑00946‑CKK.  The court set deadlines for motions and orders, and on April 24, 2025, Judge Colleen Kollar‑Kotelly issued a memorandum opinion and order.  The court granted the joint motion of the non‑partisan plaintiffs and the League plaintiffs to enjoin the EAC and its commissioners from implementing Section 2(a) of the order—that is, from adding the documentary‑proof‑of‑citizenship requirement to the federal voter‑registration form.  The court also granted, in part, the Democratic Party plaintiffs’ motion for Section 2(a) and, more narrowly, for Section 2(d), which requires federal agencies to assess citizenship before providing the form.  The court denied the plaintiffs’ request to enjoin Section 2(b) (the directive to DHS and the State Department to share voter‑registration data) as the request was deemed unripe.  No settlement was reached, and no monitoring order was issued.  The order effectively blocks the President’s attempt to alter the federal registration process and preserves the statutory framework established by Congress.",

The plaintiffs allege that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through its Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Acting Assistant Secretary Andrew Gradison, the Office of Head Start, and Acting Director Tala Hooban, have unlawfully dismantled the federally funded Head Start program.  Allegations include mass layoffs and the closure of half of the Office of Head Start’s regional offices, a freeze of federal funding that has left agencies unable to pay staff or sustain operations, and the issuance of a “March 14 DEI Letter” and an “April 16 DEIA Certification” that prohibit any activities that promote diversity, equity, inclusion, or accessibility.  Plaintiffs contend that these actions violate the Head Start Act’s mandates to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services to diverse children and families, the constitutional separation‑of‑powers and spending clauses, the First Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Rehabilitation Act.  They seek declaratory relief confirming the illegality of the defendants’ conduct and injunctive relief requiring the defendants to cease the unlawful actions and restore funding and staffing to Head Start agencies.  The complaint was amended on May 13, 2025, and on May 16, 2025 the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.

The plaintiffs—members of the clergy who, under their diocesan policies, are required to report suspected child abuse but have an exemption for information learned in confession—allege that Senate Bill 5375 (signed by Governor Robert Ferguson on May 2, 2025 and effective July 27, 2025) unlawfully forces them to break the sacramental seal and removes that exemption while leaving it for other professionals.  They bring nine causes of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming violations of the First Amendment’s Free‑Exercise and Establishment Clauses, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal‑Protection Clause, and Washington’s Constitution (Article I, § 11).

The court enjoined enforcement of SB 5375 as it applies to the sacrament of confession for the plaintiffs and for all Roman Catholic priests in Washington who are under the administration of the plaintiffs’ dioceses.  The injunction does not address the plaintiffs’ other constitutional claims but preserves the status quo pending a final judgment.  \n\nOn June 23, 2025 the United States intervened under 42 U.S.C. § 2000h‑2, filing a motion for preliminary injunction and a proposed complaint in intervention.

The suit alleges that the defendants unlawfully federalized 4,000 California National Guard soldiers and deployed them to Los Angeles to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations.  Plaintiffs contend that the federalization violated 10 U.S.C. § 12406, because the statutory predicates—“a rebellion or danger of rebellion” and “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws”—were not present, and that the orders were not issued “through the governor” as required.  They also claim a Tenth‑Amendment violation, asserting that the federal use of the Guard usurped the state’s police powers, and a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, arguing that the troops were engaged in civilian law‑enforcement duties.  The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order preventing further deployment of the Guard and restoring control to the Governor.\n\nWithin 24 hours the defendants filed an opposition to the complaint and a motion for a hearing.  The court held an ex‑parte hearing on June 12, 2025, and granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) that enjoined the defendants from deploying California National Guard troops in Los Angeles and directed them to return control of the Guard to Governor Newsom.  Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on June 16, 2025, seeking to extend the TRO into a preliminary injunction and to bar the use of federal troops in future ICE operations.  The defendants appealed the TRO and filed a motion for a stay pending appeal; the Ninth Circuit granted an administrative stay on June 19, 2025, while the preliminary‑injunction hearing remains scheduled for June 20, 2025.

The complaint alleges that executive actions taken in March 2025 threatened to withhold about $400 million in federal research funding from Columbia University unless the university complied with a set of conditions that the plaintiffs say would suppress academic freedom and violate the First Amendment.  The plaintiffs also claim that the agencies failed to follow the procedural requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) when terminating funding and imposing the conditions.  Their requested remedy is a preliminary injunction that would restore the terminated funds and prohibit the defendants from denying or suspending future federal assistance to Columbia on the same basis.

    "46259": "In March 2025 the plaintiffs—eight students who studied at Columbia University and Barnard College—filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Columbia University, Barnard, the Trustees of Columbia, the university’s interim president, the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce, and its chairman, Tim Walberg.  The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, allege that the Committee’s February 13, 2025 letter demanded that Columbia produce all disciplinary records relating to eleven student‑protest incidents and threatened to cut the university’s federal funding.  The plaintiffs contend that this “jaw‑boning” coerces Columbia into suppressing protected speech and that the university’s compliance infringes the First Amendment.  They seek declaratory and injunctive relief to bar the Committee and the university from further disclosure of student records.\n\nA motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction was filed in mid‑March, but the court denied the TRO and vacated the temporary injunction, ordering that Columbia be enjoined from providing records only after a hearing on March 25.  The court granted the plaintiffs leave to file a second amended complaint on April 18.  The second complaint added federal defendants—Pam Bondi, Linda McMahon, Leo Terrell, Sean Keveney, and Josh Gruenbaum—arguing that the federal agencies’ March 13 letter demands (mask bans, policy receivership, and other administrative changes) also violate the First Amendment.\n\nOn May 23 the Congressional and federal defendants filed motions to dismiss.  The court dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims against the Committee and its chairman on the basis of the Speech‑or‑Debate Clause and, on June 18, dismissed the individual federal defendants in their official capacities.  Protective‑order proceedings were held in April, requiring all parties to keep confidential any identifying information about the plaintiffs.\n\nThe case remains pending on the plaintiffs’ remaining claims against Columbia University and Barnard, which allege that the university’s cooperation with the Committee and the federal agencies unlawfully coerced the institution into actions that chill protected speech.  No settlement has been reached, and the court has yet to rule on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction that seeks to prevent further disclosure of student records.",
    "46557": "In the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, a coalition of state governments—New York, Washington, Rhode Island, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, and Wisconsin—filed a complaint on May 5, 2025 against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its senior officials. The plaintiffs allege that HHS, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., unlawfully dismantled the agency by issuing a “March 27 Directive” that terminated 10,000 employees, reorganized HHS’s 28 divisions into 15, closed half of its regional offices, and created a new “Administration for a Healthy America.”  \n\nThe plaintiffs claim that the directive violates the constitutional separation of powers (by allowing the executive to override Congress’s authority to create and fund HHS), the Appropriations Clause (by refusing to spend appropriated funds for Congress‑mandated programs), and is ultra vires (beyond the statutory powers granted to the Secretary). They also allege that the action is arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The stated relief is declaratory and injunctive: the injunction seeks to halt the March 27 Directive, reinstate terminated employees, and restore the statutory functions of the affected agencies (CDC, FDA, SAMHSA, ACF, ACL, and other HHS sub‑agencies).  \n\nThe complaint was filed by the attorneys general of the plaintiff states, and the defendants were represented by the Secretary of HHS and the heads of the relevant agencies. The case is an individual action (the plaintiffs are the states themselves), not a class action.  \n\nThe motion for a preliminary injunction was filed on May 9, 2025. Judge Melissa R. DuBose granted the injunction on July 1, 2025, enjoining HHS and the named officials from further implementing the March 27 Directive until the court’s order is modified. The injunction covers specific agencies and programs, including the CDC’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention; the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health; the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products; the Office of Head Start and its regional staff; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.  \n\nDefendants filed a motion to vacate the injunction and a motion for a stay pending appeal, both of which were denied on July 18, 2025. The court also denied a motion for an expedited briefing schedule. Subsequent status‑report deadlines were set, and the court has imposed a monitoring framework to ensure compliance with the injunction. No settlement has been reached, and no appeals have yet been filed.  \n\nThe litigation centers on the constitutionality and legality of the Secretary’s large‑scale workforce reductions and reorganization of HHS, and the court’s intervention seeks to preserve the statutory functions of the agency that the states rely upon for public health, safety, and welfare programs.",
    "46511": "On April 29, 2025 the United States District Court for the District of Maryland received a complaint filed by the State of Maryland, the State of Delaware, the State of California, the State of Colorado, the State of Arizona, the State of Connecticut, the District of Columbia, the State of Hawai‘i, the State of Illinois, the Office of the Governor of Kentucky (ex rel. Andy Beshear), the State of Maine, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the People of the State of Michigan, the State of Minnesota, the State of Nevada, the State of New Jersey, the State of New Mexico, the State of New York, the State of North Carolina, the State of Oregon, the State of Rhode Island, the State of Vermont, the State of Washington, and the State of Wisconsin.  The plaintiffs are the 24 states and the District of Columbia; the defendants are the Corporation for National and Community Service (“AmeriCorps”) and Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, AmeriCorps’ interim head.  The suit is an individual action, not a class action.  The plaintiffs are represented by their state attorneys general and the offices of the governors who filed the complaint in their official capacities.\n\nThe complaint alleges that, under a series of executive orders issued during the Trump administration, AmeriCorps was directed to cut its workforce, terminate volunteers and grants, and close more than 1,000 AmeriCorps programs across the United States.  On April 15, 2025 AmeriCorps notified all National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) members that they would be released from service effective April 30.  On April 16, AmeriCorps placed approximately 85 % of its staff on administrative leave, and on April 24 it issued reduction‑in‑force notices that cut nearly 50 % of its remaining workforce.  On April 25, AmeriCorps terminated about $400 million of federal grants, ordered grantees to cease all award activities, and required the exit of all AmeriCorps and Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) members.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that AmeriCorps’ actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because the agency failed to conduct the notice‑and‑comment rulemaking required by the 2024 and 2025 Appropriations Acts for any “significant changes” to its program requirements, service delivery, or policy.  They also claim that the actions were arbitrary and capricious, deprived the states of statutory grant funding, and violated the separation of powers by usurping Congress’s congressional budget authority.  The relief sought includes declaratory relief, an injunction preventing further dismantling, and the restoration of the terminated programs, grants, and members.\n\nJudge Deborah L. Boardman, hearing the case, granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction on June 5, 2025.  The injunction enjoined AmeriCorps and its interim head from executing the April 25 grant terminations, from terminating NCCC members, and required the parties to comply with the notice‑and‑comment requirement before making any further significant changes that harm the plaintiff states.  The court also ordered AmeriCorps to restore the affected programs and return the displaced volunteers.\n\nOn July 7, 2025 the defendants filed a motion to modify the injunction, citing the Supreme Court decision in *Trump v. CASA, Inc.* (2025) that federal courts cannot issue universal injunctions.  The court granted the motion and modified the injunction on July 10, 2025, limiting the notice‑and‑comment requirement to actions that affect the plaintiff states.  The injunction remains in effect, requiring AmeriCorps to restore the terminated grants and programs and to obtain proper notice and comment before any future significant changes.\n\nThe case remains pending; no settlement has been reached.  The court continues to monitor compliance with the injunction, and AmeriCorps must report its status to the court in accordance with the order.  The states’ claim is grounded in statutory and constitutional provisions that require notice‑and‑comment rulemaking for significant changes to federally funded programs and in the separation of powers doctrine, and the court has determined that the defendants’ conduct was unlawful and irreparably harmed the states’ interests.",
    "46350": "The lawsuit was filed on **April 7 2025** by the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), AFL‑CIO, against a group of federal defendants that includes former President Donald Trump, Acting Director Keith Sonderling of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the IMLS agency itself, the U.S. Department of Education’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) and its temporary organization, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and its director Russell Vought, and Acting Administrator Amy GLEASON of the U.S. DOGE Service.  The plaintiffs seek to halt and reverse the executive‑order‑driven dismantling of IMLS, restore staff and grant funding, and compel the defendants to comply with the statutory mandates of the Museum and Library Services Act (MLS Act), the 2024–2025 Appropriations Acts, and other relevant federal statutes.  The cause of action is based on alleged violations of the separation of powers, the Take‑Care Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the doctrine of ultra‑vires, and the First Amendment.  The plaintiffs’ counsel is a private firm affiliated with the Democracy Forward Foundation.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that President Trump’s Executive Order 14238 (“Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy”) unlawfully directed the elimination of IMLS, and that the DOJ’s DOGE unit and OMB failed to uphold the statutes that create, fund, and govern IMLS.  They claim that the defendants’ actions—firing the 75‑person IMLS workforce, terminating state, tribal, and museum grants, and firing the National Museum and Library Services Board—violate Congress’s exclusive authority to establish and regulate federal agencies, and that such conduct deprives libraries, librarians, and the public of essential services and data.  The plaintiffs seek a **preliminary injunction** and, alternatively, a **temporary restraining order** to prevent further staff terminations, grant cancellations, and operational shutdowns, and to require the defendants to restore the agency’s staffing, grant funding, and data‑collection functions.\n\nJudge **Richard J. Leon** of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia presided over the case.  The court entered a **temporary restraining order** on May 1 2025, which was extended to May 29 2025 pending further briefing.  A motion for a preliminary injunction was denied on June 6 2025, and the court also denied a motion for a temporary restraining order that the plaintiffs filed on June 2 2025.  The court’s memorandum opinion on June 6 2025 emphasized that the plaintiffs had not established a likelihood of success on the merits and that the injunction would be an extraordinary relief.  The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss, and the parties are preparing joint status reports and briefing schedules for summary judgment proceedings.\n\nNo settlement has been reached, and no court‑appointed monitor has been named.  The factual basis centers on the President’s executive order, the DOGE’s rapid staffing cuts and grant terminations, the resulting financial and operational harm to libraries nationwide, and the statutory requirement that IMLS award and manage federal grants and conduct data collection under the MLS Act.  The case remains pending, with the court scheduled to consider the defendants’ motion to dismiss and the parties’ subsequent briefing on summary judgment.",
    "46746": "On June 27, 2025, the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and the conservation nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity sued the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM), the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Miami‑Dade County. The plaintiffs allege that FDEM, with federal support, converted the Dade‑Collier Training and Transition Airport into a temporary detention center—called “Alligator Alcatraz”—for up to 5,000 non‑citizen detainees without conducting the required environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and without proper procedural steps under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The site lies within the Big Cypress National Preserve, an area home to endangered species such as the Florida panther and Florida bonneted bat; the plaintiffs argue that the project will cause irreparable environmental harm and deprive their members of recreational use.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory relief affirming that the defendants’ actions violate NEPA and APA, and injunctive relief to halt all construction, operation, and further use of the facility until a full NEPA review is completed. The case is brought in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, with Judge Kathleen M. Williams presiding after reassignment. \n\nAfter a brief motion to expedite a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction, the court granted the TRO on August 6, 2025, and issued a preliminary injunction requiring the defendants to stop new construction, remove new detainees, and dismantle new lighting and fencing within 60 days. The order also ordered a stay of the injunction pending appeal. \n\nThe defendants argue that NEPA applies only to federal actions and that the detention center is a state‑run project, thereby challenging the injunction. The plaintiffs counter that the federal funding and use of federal immigration enforcement make the project a major federal action subject to NEPA. The appellate case, filed on August 26, 2025, is pending review by the Eleventh Circuit, which will consider whether the preliminary injunction was proper and whether NEPA applies to the state‑federal partnership in building and operating the detention center. The appellate court has issued a time‑sensitive motion to stay the injunction, and the parties are awaiting the court’s decision.",
    "46388": "The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered the complaint on April 11, 2025, against a slate of federal agencies—most notably the Department of Justice, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services (including the National Institutes of Health), and the General Services Administration—representing the Trump administration’s enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The plaintiffs are the American Association of University Professors–Harvard Faculty Chapter, the national American Association of University Professors, and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, all represented by private counsel (Selendy Gay PLLC and Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC). The case is not a class action; it is brought by these associations on behalf of their members.\n\nIn late March 2025 the administration announced a “task force to combat antisemitism” and, on March 31, issued a public “review” notice that Harvard’s federal contracts and grants—worth more than $255 million and $8.7 billion—were under investigation for alleged failures to address antisemitism. On April 3 the DOJ, HHS, and GSA sent a letter to Harvard’s president demanding nine sweeping reforms (including a “mask ban,” the removal of DEI programs, and a re‑to‑shrink governance structure) as conditions for continued funding. Harvard’s April 14 response rejected the demands. Hours later, on April 14, the agencies froze roughly $2.2 billion in federal funding to Harvard, and on May 6 the National Institutes of Health terminated more than $2 billion in grants. Subsequent letters from the Department of Education on May 5 and from other agencies (DOO, DOD, NSF, HUD, etc.) extended the freeze and terminated additional awards. Harvard sued on April 21, and the plaintiffs amended the complaint on May 5 and May 20 to add new defendants and further allegations.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the agencies violated Title VI’s procedural safeguards—notice, opportunity for hearing, an express finding of non‑compliance, a determination that voluntary compliance was impossible, and a congressional report—none of which were made before the funding was curtailed. They also claim that the agencies’ actions constituted coercive enforcement that breaches the Administrative Procedure Act’s prohibition on arbitrary or capricious rulemaking, and that the demands and funding cuts infringe the First Amendment by threatening the university’s academic freedom and free‑speech rights. The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to halt further funding withdrawals and demands, and to restore the status of their members.\n\nJudge Allison D. Burroughs presides over the case. The docket shows a series of motions for leave to file and to appear, a motion for a temporary restraining order (filed April 11 and withdrawn April 15), and a motion for summary judgment (filed June 2). No final ruling on the merits has yet been issued. The case references the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision in *National Rifle Ass’n of America v. Vullo*, which held that Title VI may not be used to coerce institutions into political compliance, underscoring the plaintiffs’ constitutional argument. No settlement has been reached, and no monitoring or decree has been issued. The case remains pending, with the plaintiffs awaiting a decision on their summary‑judgment motion.",

The plaintiffs allege that the DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP) abruptly terminated more than 370 federal grants and cooperative agreements, totaling over $820 million, without notice and citing only a vague statement that the awards “no longer effectuate program goals or agency priorities” (2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4)).  The plaintiffs contend that the termination was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law; that it deprived them of a protected property interest and violated the Fifth Amendment’s due‑process clause; and that the executive branch’s refusal to expend congressionally appropriated funds violated the Separation of Powers, Spending, Appropriations, and Take‑Care Clauses.\n\nThe complaint seeks declaratory relief confirming the unlawful nature of the terminations and permanent injunctive relief to reinstate the grants and prevent further terminations.  Plaintiffs also request class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) for all entities nationwide that received OJP grants terminated under the same statutory authority.\n\nThe district court, in a decision issued July 7, 2025, denied the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction and dismissed the case for lack of subject‑matter jurisdiction, holding that the claims were essentially contractual and therefore fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to the Tucker Act.  The court also denied the plaintiffs’ emergency motion for injunction pending appeal under Rule 62(d).\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (case 25‑5248).

    "46387": "On April 11, 2025 Susman Godfrey LLP, a Texas‑based limited‑liability partnership and one of America’s largest trial‑law firms, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff sued the United States and a host of federal agencies—most notably the Executive Office of the President, the Department of Justice, the Office of Management and Budget, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the International Trade Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Patent and Trademark Office, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Treasury, the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, the Department of Energy, the Department of Labor, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Small Business Administration, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Transportation.\n\nThe complaint alleges that President Donald J. Trump’s April 9, 2025 Executive Order “Addressing Risks from Susman Godfrey” retaliates against the firm for representing clients such as Dominion Voting Systems and state election officials.  The order’s provisions—suspending security clearances, restricting federal‑building access, and requiring contractors to disclose or terminate business with the firm—are claimed to violate the First Amendment’s protection of speech, the Fifth Amendment’s due‑process guarantees, and the separation of powers under Article II.  The plaintiff seeks declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to enjoin the enforcement of the order.\n\nJudge Loren L. AliKhan assigned the case.  After a brief hearing on April 15, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order that enjoined the defendants from implementing Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the executive order and required status reports on compliance.  The plaintiff subsequently amended the complaint, filed a motion for summary judgment, and the court, after briefing, granted the motion on June 27, 2025, holding that the order was unconstitutional and permanently enjoining its enforcement.  No settlement was reached, and the case has not proceeded to trial or appeal.\n\nThe action is brought by a single plaintiff (the law firm), not a class action.  The court’s opinion cites related suits against similar executive orders that targeted Perkins Coie LLP, Jenner & Block LLP, and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr LLP.

    "46245": "On March 18 2025 the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) and its six former board members—Ambassadors John J. Sullivan, Judy Ansley, Joseph L. Falk, Kerry Kennedy, Mary Swig, and former acting president George E. Moose—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  The complaint alleges that, pursuant to an Executive Order issued by President Donald J. Trump on February 19 2025 (Executive Order 14,217), the White House forcibly removed all of USIP’s board members and its acting president without complying with the statutory removal procedures set out in the United States Institute of Peace Act, 22 U.S.C. §§ 4601‑4611.  The defendants include Kenneth Jackson (Assistant to the Administrator for Management and Resources for USAID and the defendant’s purported acting president of USIP), the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its temporary organization, Amy Gleason, James Burnham, Jacob Altik, Nate Cavanaugh, as well as the ex‑officio board members Marco Rubio, Pete Hegseth, and Vice Admiral Peter A. Garvin, and President Trump.  \n\nThe plaintiffs claim that the defendants unlawfully removed them from office, that DOGE and associated law‑enforcement officers unlawfully entered and took control of USIP’s headquarters building at 2301 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C., and that the defendants subsequently fired most of USIP’s staff, transferred the institute’s property and endowment assets to the General Services Administration, and otherwise dismantled the institute.  The complaint seeks declaratory relief declaring the removals void, injunctive relief to reinstate the plaintiffs as board members and the former president, to prevent any further trespass or acquisition of USIP property, and to require the defendants to return all assets and property to USIP.  The statutory basis for the claims is the USIP Act, specifically 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f) (the for‑cause removal provisions for the board) and 22 U.S.C. § 4606(a) (the appointment and removal of the institute’s president).  The constitutional basis is Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which vest the President’s removal power in the executive branch, and the non‑exemption of USIP’s board members from that power, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in cases such as *Seila Law LLC v. CFPB* and *Humphrey’s Executor*.\n\nOn March 19 2025 the court denied the plaintiffs’ emergency motion for a temporary restraining order, finding that the plaintiffs had not yet established a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm.  The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint on March 24, 2025, adding the former acting president Moose and the ex‑officio board members as plaintiffs, and the defendants added additional claims under the Administrative Procedure Act.  On April 11, 2025 the defendants filed a cross‑motion for summary judgment; on May 19, 2025 Judge Beryl A. Howell granted the plaintiffs’ summary‑judgment motion.  The court declared that the removal of the board members and the acting president was unlawful, reinstated the plaintiffs and Moose, declared all subsequent actions taken by the defendants null and void, and enjoined the defendants from further trespass or control of USIP property.  The court also issued a permanent injunction preventing the transfer of USIP’s headquarters building or any other assets to the General Services Administration.\n\nOn May 23, 2025 the defendants appealed the order and moved for a stay of the district‑court judgment.  On June 27, 2025 the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in a panel opinion, denied the defendants’ motion to stay, holding that the defendants had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits, that they would not be irreparably injured, and that a stay would not substantially harm other parties or the public interest.  The court therefore affirmed the district court’s judgment and the injunctions.\n\nThe case has been heard by the court without a trial; all relief was granted by summary judgment and the injunctions remain in effect.  No settlement or monitoring has been reported.  The factual background revolves around the President’s effort to dismantle USIP as part of a broader “bureaucracy‑reduction” agenda, the unlawful removal of its board members, the violent forcible occupation of its headquarters by DOGE and federal law‑enforcement officers, and the resulting transfer of the institute’s assets to the General Services Administration.  The legal dispute centers on whether the statutory removal restrictions apply to a congressionally created, independent nonprofit corporation, and whether the President may remove its officers at will.  The court concluded that the statutory restrictions were valid, that the removals were void, and that the defendants’ subsequent actions were unlawful, thereby upholding the plaintiffs’ declaratory and injunctive relief.",
    "46274": "On March 8, 2025 the Climate United Fund, a Delaware nonprofit that had been awarded a $6.97 billion National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) grant under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Citibank, N.A.; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin; and other EPA officials.  The plaintiffs and two other NCIF recipients—Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities—consolidated their cases.  The complaint alleges that Citibank, acting as the federal financial agent under a Financial Agency Agreement and an Account Control Agreement, failed to disburse grant funds that the plaintiffs had legally earned, and that EPA, citing alleged fraud and waste, suspended and then terminated the grants on March 11, 2025 without following proper administrative procedures.  The causes of action are breach of contract, conversion, replevin, and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the U.S. Constitution’s Due Process Clause, as well as the Appropriations Clause of Article I.  The plaintiffs seek declaratory relief, injunctive relief to compel Citibank to release the funds and to enjoin EPA from terminating the grants, and damages for the losses caused by the withholding.\n\nOn March 10, 2025 the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO).  EPA and Citibank opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue for contractual relief and that the court lacked jurisdiction over the APA claim.  On March 18, 2025 Judge Tanya S. Chutkan granted the TRO in part and denied it in part, ordering that EPA and Citibank refrain from effecting the March 11 termination notices and that Citibank disburse the plaintiffs’ requested funds.  The court also required EPA to comply with the terms of the Account Control Agreement and the grant agreement.\n\nSubsequently, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (filed March 21, 2025).  In her memorandum opinion dated March 28, 2025, Judge Chutkan found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their breach‑of‑contract and APA claims, that they would suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief, and that the injunction was in the public interest.  The court granted the preliminary injunction, directing EPA and Citibank to restore the plaintiffs’ access to the NCIF funds and to refrain from terminating the grants.\n\nThe court’s orders (28 and 29) collectively enjoin EPA from enacting the termination notices and compel Citibank to release the agreed funds.  No settlement has been reached, and the case remains pending for further briefing and hearing on the preliminary injunction and related appeals.",
    "46142": "In February 2025, the National Urban League, the National Fair Housing Alliance, and the AIDS Foundation of Chicago sued the President of the United States and 27 federal agencies, alleging that three executive orders issued on January 20–21 2025 were unconstitutional.

The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including a preliminary injunction to stop enforcement of the orders.  \n\nThe complaint was filed on February 19, 2025. A motion for preliminary injunction was filed on February 28, 2025, and a hearing was set for March 19. On March 5 the plaintiffs’ nonprofit Do No Harm filed a motion to intervene; the court denied that motion on March 12 but allowed Do No Harm to participate as an amicus. The court, sitting with Judge Timothy J. Kelly, reviewed the merits and found that the plaintiffs had not established standing or a likelihood of success, that many of the challenged provisions were either not actionable or constitutionally defective, and that the orders did not produce a concrete injury.

The plaintiffs are not a class; they are a coalition of nonprofit and business organizations that receive federal foreign‑aid grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that President Trump’s Executive Order 14169, issued on January 20, 2025, “paused” all congressionally appropriated foreign‑aid funding, and that the implementing directives from the State Department, USAID, and OMB re‑issued a blanket freeze and stop‑work orders that violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Impoundment Control Act, and the Constitution’s separation‑of‑powers and “take‑care” clauses. They claim that the freeze caused irreparable harm—business shutdowns, layoffs, and threatened the survival of their programs—and seek declaratory relief to declare the order unlawful, injunctive relief to halt the freeze and require payment of funds already earned, and specific performance of the underlying awards.\n\nJudge Amir H. Ali granted the plaintiffs a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 13, 2025, enjoining all defendants except the President from enforcing the unlawful directives and from suspending or terminating foreign‑aid awards in existence as of January 19, 2025. He also ordered the defendants to make the full amount of appropriated funds available for obligation. The court later granted a preliminary injunction on March 6, 2025, extending the relief and requiring defendants to pay all outstanding invoices for work performed before the freeze and to resume disbursements. The defendants appealed; the case is now consolidated with the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. U.S. Department of State and pending review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. No settlement has been reached, and no monitoring agency has been appointed.",
    "46090": "The case was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on February 9, 2025, by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) together with the National Consumer Law Center, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Virginia Poverty Law Center, Rev. Eva Steege, and the CFPB Employee Association.  The defendants are Russell Vought in his official capacity as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the CFPB itself.  The plaintiffs are not a class; they are individual organizations and an individual representing a CFPB employee.  Private counsel represents the plaintiffs, while the federal government is represented by its legal counsel.  \n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the Trump administration, by appointing Vought as acting director and by issuing a series of directives that halted CFPB work, fired employees, cancelled contracts, and moved the agency’s headquarters, was acting ultra‑vires, violating the CFPB’s statutory duties under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and violating the constitutional separation‑of‑powers doctrine.  The statutory basis is the CFPB’s founding statute, 12 U.S.C. §§ 5491‑5535, and the constitutional basis is the separation‑of‑powers principle of Article II.  The plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and injunctive relief, specifically a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from deleting data, terminating employees (except for cause), cancelling contracts, and enforcing a stop‑work order.  \n\nJudge Amy Berman Jackson granted a preliminary injunction on March 28, 2025.  The injunction directed the defendants to preserve all CFPB data, to reinstate all employees terminated since February 10, 2025, to refrain from firing employees except for cause, to refrain from issuing a reduction‑in‑force notice, and to continue to maintain the CFPB’s consumer‑complaint system and the Private Student Loan Ombudsman office.  The injunction remained in effect pending the outcome of the case.  \n\nOn April 11, 2025 the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a stay of the injunction in part and denied the defendants’ motion to stay the injunction in full, allowing the defendants to conduct a reduction‑in‑force of employees that would eliminate approximately 80 % of the agency’s workforce.  On August 15, 2025 the appellate court vacated the preliminary injunction, holding that the plaintiffs’ claims were subject to the exclusive review scheme of the Civil Service Reform Act and therefore lacked jurisdiction before the district court.  The appellate court clarified that the “particularized assessment” required to justify a reduction‑in‑force had been performed by the CFPB’s chief legal officer.  \n\nNo settlement has been reached, and the case remains pending.  No monitor has been appointed.  The factual context is that the CFPB was created by the Dodd‑Frank Act to protect consumers and that the plaintiffs allege the defendants attempted to eliminate the agency through executive orders and staff directives, thereby infringing on the CFPB’s statutory mission and the constitutional separation of powers.",
    "PN-NY-0014": "The action was filed on **March 28, 2012** by a group of tenants in Bronx apartment buildings—named plaintiffs **Jaenean Ligon, Fawn Bracy, Jacqueline Yates, Letitia Ledan, Roshea Johnson, A.O. (parent Dinah Adames), Abdullah Turner, Fernando Moronta, Charles Bradley, Jovan Jefferson**—and a class of other residents and guests who have been stopped, searched, or arrested by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) under the city’s **Trespass Affidavit Program (TAP)**, also known as **Operation Clean Halls**.  The defendants are the **City of New York**, the **NYPD**, its **Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly**, several named officers, and a group of unnamed officers (John Does 1‑12).  Plaintiffs, represented by civil‑rights and public‑interest groups (NYC Civil Liberties Union, Bronx Defenders, etc.), sued under **42 U.S.C. § 1983** for violations of the **Fourth Amendment** (unreasonable search and seizure), the **Fourteenth Amendment** (equal protection), the **Fair Housing Act**, and New York state law (trespass).  They sought a **preliminary injunction** to halt unlawful stops, require NYPD policy and training changes, and, ultimately, to compel the department to implement the remedial measures ordered by the court.  \n\nThe case was a **class action**.  Plaintiffs requested certification of a class consisting of all individuals who have been or are at risk of being stopped outdoors near Bronx buildings enrolled in TAP without legal justification.  The court granted a preliminary injunction on **January 8, 2013** and, in a subsequent order, issued a comprehensive remedial order requiring NYPD to revise its stop‑and‑frisk policies, adopt new training, implement supervision and auditing procedures, and launch a body‑worn‑camera pilot.  The preliminary injunction was amended on **February 14, 2013** to clarify the scope of the relief.  \n\nThe action was originally overseen by **Judge Shira A. Scheindlin**.  In October 2013, the Second Circuit reassigned the case to **Judge Analisa Torres** to preserve the appearance of impartiality.  The litigation was consolidated with **Floyd v. City of New York (08‑Civ 1034)**, a related class action challenging NYPD’s broader stop‑and‑frisk practices.  \n\nAfter years of discovery, trial, and remedial proceedings, the parties reached a settlement on **July 19, 2017**.  The settlement—recorded as a **Stipulation of Settlement and Order (Document 296)**—defines the settlement class, denies liability, requires the city to implement the remedial order, provides for attorneys’ fees and costs, and dismisses the case with prejudice.  The settlement is a **court‑enforced** order; the defendants must comply with the remedial measures, and the plaintiffs are entitled to the agreed‑upon fees.  \n\nAn independent monitor, **Peter L. Zimroth**, was appointed to oversee the implementation of the remedial order.  The monitor’s reports (first report, July 2015; second report, February 2016; eighth report, July 2018; tenth report, January 2020) document NYPD’s progress in revising policies, training, supervision, auditing, and body‑worn‑camera deployment, and assess compliance with the court’s requirements.  \n\nIn sum, the case arose from NYPD’s Operation Clean Halls, alleging unconstitutional and racially discriminatory stops, led to a preliminary injunction and a sweeping remedial order, and concluded with a court‑enforced settlement that requires the city to implement the court’s reforms and compensates plaintiffs for legal fees.",
    "PB-CT-0007": "On 9 November 2010 the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut received a complaint alleging that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) violates the equal‑protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  The plaintiffs are thirteen same‑sex couples who are legally married in Connecticut, Vermont, or New Hampshire: Joanne Pedersen & Ann Meitzen; Gerald V. Passaro II & Thomas Buckholz; Lynda DeForge & Raquel Ardin; Janet Geller & Joanne Marquis; Suzanne & Geraldine Artis; Bradley Kleinerman & James Gehre; and Damon Savoy & John Weiss.  The defendants are the Office of Personnel Management, Secretary of the Treasury (Timothy F. Geithner), Secretary of Labor (Hilda L. Solis), Commissioner of Social Security (Michael J. Astrue), United States Postal Service (Postmaster General John E. Potter), Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Douglas H. Shulman), Attorney General (Eric H. Holder Jr.), Comptroller of the Currency (John Walsh), and the United States.  The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives intervened as a defendant seeking to defend DOMA.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that DOMA’s definition of “marriage” as a union between one man and one woman and its definition of “spouse” as an opposite‑sex husband or wife deprived them of federal benefits that are routinely available to opposite‑sex couples.  The benefits at issue included federal employee health insurance (FEHB), Social Security death benefits, employer‑sponsored retirement benefits that require a spousal designation, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave for caring for a spouse, and the ability to file joint federal income‑tax returns.  The remedy sought was declaratory relief that DOMA is unconstitutional and injunctive relief ordering the federal government to cease enforcing DOMA’s definitions.\n\nJudge Vanessa L. Bryant heard the case.  On 31 July 2012 she granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and denied the intervenor’s motion to dismiss, holding that DOMA violates the Equal Protection Clause.  The court applied heightened scrutiny to the classification of sexual orientation and found DOMA to fail both the strict scrutiny test and the rational‑basis test.  The decision declared DOMA unconstitutional and void, and enjoined the federal government from enforcing its provisions.\n\nThe defendants appealed the judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (case 12‑3273).  The plaintiffs also filed a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment (case 12‑231) with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking an earlier resolution of the constitutional question.  No settlement has been reached, and no monitoring mechanism has been imposed.  The case remains pending, with the Second Circuit scheduled to decide the appeal and the Supreme Court still considering the certiorari petition.",
    "PC-AL-0034": "The United States of America, represented by the Department of Justice’s Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division, sued the State of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) on May 28 2015 to remedy the pervasive sexual abuse and sexual harassment occurring at the Tutwiler Prison for Women. The complaint was based on the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA), and alleged that the defendants violated the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by failing to protect inmates from sexual violence. The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the defendants to implement policies, procedures, and training that would eliminate such abuse.  \n\nThe case was assigned to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, Northern Division, and Judge Myron H. Thompson entered a consent decree on June 18 2015. The decree incorporated a settlement agreement reached on May 28 2015 and made the defendants, including ADOC and the State, liable to enact a comprehensive remedial program. The decree required the creation of gender‑responsive policies, staff training on the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), a robust camera system, staffing and recruitment reforms, and the establishment of a grievance system. It also mandated that the court appoint an independent monitor to oversee compliance.  \n\nNo consolidated cases or related litigation were identified in the filings. The complaint and settlement were the primary documents; the only court opinion was the consent decree itself. The case was closed on June 18 2015, with the consent decree remaining in force until all settlement provisions were satisfied. The decree is court‑enforced and the parties must comply, with the court retaining jurisdiction to enforce the terms.  \n\nOn August 26 2016, the court appointed Kathleen Dennehy as the independent monitor. Dennehy has filed eight compliance reports (Feb 28 2016, Aug 25 2016, Mar 28 2017, Aug 28 2017, Feb 28 2018, Aug 28 2018, Feb 28 2019, and Aug 28 2019), each covering a six‑month reporting period. The reports show that ADOC and Tutwiler have achieved “substantial compliance” for forty‑to‑forty‑one of the settlement’s 44 provisions and “partial compliance” for two to three provisions, primarily related to staffing, recruitment, and training. No non‑compliance or disputes over enforcement have been reported. The monitor’s findings confirm that the consent decree’s remedial program is being implemented, albeit with ongoing challenges in staff recruitment and training.  \n\nIn summary, the United States sued the State of Alabama and ADOC in 2015 over sexual abuse at Tutwiler Prison for Women, obtained a consent decree that mandates comprehensive reforms, and continues to monitor the defendants’ compliance through a series of regularly filed reports. The decree remains in effect and is court‑enforced, with the monitor reporting steady progress and ongoing partial compliance in specific areas.",
    "ED-MI-0001": "Coalition to Defend Aff. Action, a coalition of civil‑rights groups, students, and community members, sued the state of Michigan and its public universities on November 8, 2006, the day after Michigan voters approved “Proposal 2,” a constitutional amendment that prohibits the use of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in university admissions and other public programs.  The complaint alleged that Proposal 2 violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal‑protection clause, the First Amendment’s protection of academic freedom, and federal civil‑rights statutes (Title VI, Title VII, and Title IX) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The plaintiffs were represented by Scheff & Washington, P.C., the ACLU, and other counsel; the defendants—Governor Jennifer Granholm, the Regents of the University of Michigan, the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University, and the Board of Governors of Wayne State University—were represented by the Michigan Attorney General’s office and university counsel.  The action was joined with a separate complaint filed in early 2007 by a group of University of Michigan students (the “Cantrell” plaintiffs) and the two cases were consolidated by the court.\n\nShortly after the complaint, the universities filed a cross‑claim seeking a declaratory judgment and a preliminary injunction.  On December 19, 2006, the district court granted a temporary injunction, suspending enforcement of Proposal 2 against the universities’ admissions and financial‑aid policies until July 1, 2007 (the end of the current admissions cycle).  In December 2006 the Sixth Circuit stayed the injunction pending appeal.  In March 2008 the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Michigan Attorney General, dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims that Proposal 2 violated equal protection and other statutes.  The Cantrell plaintiffs received summary judgment in their favor in the same month, but the case was later appealed.\n\nIn 2011 the Sixth Circuit reversed the district court’s summary judgment, holding that Proposal 2 constituted an unconstitutional restructuring of Michigan’s political process that burdened racial minorities and violated the Equal Protection Clause, citing Washington v. Seattle School District and Hunter v. Erickson.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed the temporary injunction but left the amendment in place.  The decision was upheld en banc in 2012.\n\nIn 2014 the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and affirmed the Sixth Circuit’s decision that the amendment was constitutional.  The Court held that the amendment did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, that it was a legitimate exercise of the electorate’s power, and that it did not impose an unconstitutional burden on minority students.  The Supreme Court’s ruling nullified the injunction and allowed Proposal 2 to remain in effect.  No settlement was reached; the matter was resolved by appellate courts.  The case remains a landmark in the jurisprudence on voter‑initiated restrictions on affirmative‑action policies.",
    "DR-CA-0033": "On August 22, 2005, a paraplegic individual—hereafter referred to as the plaintiff—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. and the owners of two Chipotle restaurants in San Diego and Encinitas (the defendants).  The plaintiff alleged that a 44‑inch wall in front of the food‑preparation counter at each restaurant prevented him from viewing the food and customizing his order, thereby denying full and equal access under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the California Disabled Persons Act (CDPA).  The complaint sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief to lower the wall, statutory damages, and attorneys’ fees.  \n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Napoleon A. Jones, Jr.  After a bench trial on November 27–30 and December 3, 2007, the court granted partial summary judgment, denied the plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief, awarded $5,000 in statutory damages for five “bona fide” visits, and granted a partial attorneys’‑fees award.  The plaintiff appealed.  The Ninth Circuit, in a series of opinions (Nos. 08‑55867, 08‑55946, 09‑55327, 09‑55425), held that the wall violated the ADA and that Chipotle’s written accommodation policy did not satisfy the ADA.  The court vacated the district court’s damages award, remanded the case for injunctive relief and a new determination of damages, and remanded the attorneys’ fees award for reconsideration.  The case was consolidated for discovery with a related class action (06‑CV‑2671) but remained an individual action.  No settlement was reached and no court‑appointed monitor was involved.",
    "CJ-FL-0009": "On 28 June 2019, a group of felons—Kelvin Jones, Bonnie Raysor, Diane Sherrill, Jeff Gruver, Emory Marquis, and several others—filed a consolidated 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida.  The plaintiffs alleged that Florida’s voter‑restoration scheme, enacted by the 2018 voter‑initiated Amendment 4 and implemented by Senate Bill 7066, unlawfully requires plaintiffs to pay all fines, fees, restitution, and other legal‑financial‑obligations (LFOs) before their voting rights can be restored.  Because the plaintiffs have completed all non‑financial terms of their sentences but are genuinely unable to pay the LFOs, they argue the law discriminates on the basis of wealth and violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the poll‑tax prohibition of the Twenty‑Fourth Amendment.  The plaintiffs also claim the law is void for vagueness and denies procedural due process.\n\nThe defendants are the state of Florida in its official capacities: Governor Ron DeSantis, Secretary of State Laurel Lee, and the supervisors of elections of the counties where each plaintiff resides (including Craig Latimer, Mike Hogan, and others).  Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel (e.g., Michael Steinberg) and by the ACLU, the NAACP, and the League of Women Voters, while the defendants are represented by Florida state counsel.\n\nThe district court held an evidentiary hearing on 7–8 October 2019 and, on 18 October, entered a preliminary injunction preventing the state from denying any plaintiff’s right to register or vote solely on the basis of unpaid LFOs.  The injunction was later affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit on 28 January 2020.  In a May 2020 opinion, the Eleventh Circuit held that the law indeed violates the Equal Protection Clause for indigent felons who have completed all non‑financial terms of their sentences.  The court found no violation of the Twenty‑Fourth Amendment, concluded the statute was not void for vagueness, and affirmed the preliminary injunction.  The court remanded for trial on the merits, leaving the final determination of the law’s constitutionality to the district court.\n\nNo settlement has been reached, and no court decree has issued beyond the injunction.  The case remains pending trial on the merits in the Northern District of Florida, with the Eleventh Circuit’s opinion guiding the district court’s proceedings.",

The suit alleged violations of the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions of the federal Medicaid Act, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, specifically a mandatory preliminary injunction ordering the defendants to provide wrap‑around services and therapeutic foster care to children in foster care or at imminent risk of placement who have mental‑health needs.\n\nJudge A. Howard Matz issued a preliminary injunction on March 14 2006, directing the state to provide the required services on a consistent statewide basis within 120 days. In March 2007 the Ninth Circuit reversed that order and remanded the case. The district court re‑issued a preliminary injunction in 2008. In 2003 the plaintiffs and Los Angeles County entered into a settlement agreement that the court approved on July 16 2003.

DePaola was the sole plaintiff; the case was pro‑se.  The defendants were the VDOC, the Office of the Attorney General of Virginia (represented by counsel from that office), and other correctional officials and teams.\n\nDePaola had been convicted of multiple violent offenses and sentenced to 38 years in prison.  In 2009, following a stabbing incident, he was transferred to solitary confinement (administrative segregation) at Red Onion.  For the past eight years he has remained in the most restrictive “Intensive Management” (IM) level, a category that, under VDOC’s Operating Procedure 830.A, is essentially permanent and does not allow progression to less restrictive housing.  The conditions of his confinement—24‑hour isolation in an 8 × 10‑foot cell, bright lighting, no contact with other inmates, limited recreation, and frequent invasive searches—were described as harsh and detrimental to his mental and physical health.\n\nThe district court, Judge James P. Jones, granted summary judgment to the defendants on September 28, 2016, dismissing all of DePaola’s claims.  DePaola appealed the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on October 6, 2016.

    "CJ-MD-0001": "The United States District Court for the District of Maryland heard a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action filed on **January 19, 2006** by death‑sentenced inmate **Vernon Evans, Jr.** and civil‑rights organizations—the NAACP, ACLU, and Maryland Citizens Against State Executions—against **Mary Ann Saar** (Secretary, Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services), **Frank C. Sizer Jr.** (Commissioner, Maryland Division of Correction), **Lehrman Dotson** (Warden, Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center), **Gary Hornbaker** (Warden, Metropolitan Transition Center), and unnamed Department of Correction staff (“John Does”).  The complaint was an individual action, not a class, and was supported by private counsel (Stephen Hut, Todd Zubler, Kalea Seitz Clark, Anne Harden Tindall, and others) and the public‑interest groups’ attorneys.\n\nEvans alleged that the Maryland Department of Correction’s lethal‑injection protocol violated his rights under the **Eighth Amendment** (cruel and unusual punishment) and the **Fourteenth Amendment** (equal protection and due process).  The complaint relied on the *Maryland Code, Corr. Servs.* §§ 3‑905 (the death‑penalty statute) and the DOC’s Execution Operations Manual, claiming that the protocol added a third drug (potassium chloride) and a second paralytic agent, used an improper dosing schedule, and was adopted without compliance with the state’s Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  Evans sought **declaratory and injunctive relief** to stop his execution until the procedures complied with constitutional and statutory requirements.\n\nThe case was assigned to **Chief Judge Benson Everett Legg** of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.  On **January 20, 2006** Evans filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, arguing that his execution was scheduled for the week of **February 6, 2006** and that the DOC’s protocol posed a substantial risk of cruel and unusual punishment.  The court ordered the DOC to provide documents and imposed protective orders, but denied the injunction.\n\nThe matter was consolidated with several appeals in the Maryland Court of Appeals (Nos. 107, 122, 123, 124).  The appellate court reviewed Evans’ claims that he was entitled to a new sentencing hearing because counsel failed to investigate mitigating evidence (the *Wiggins/Romilla* claim), that he was entitled to a new trial due to racially discriminatory peremptory strikes (the *Batson* claim), and that he was entitled to injunctive relief over lethal‑injection protocols.  The Court held that none of those claims had merit: the *Wiggins* claim was dismissed because Evans was not entitled to a new sentencing proceeding; the *Batson* claim had been finally litigated and found lacking; and the appellate court found no constitutional violation in the DOC’s protocol as alleged.  The Court also held that the post‑conviction court had not abused its discretion in denying Evans’ motion to reopen.\n\nThe district court denied Evans’ injunctive relief, and the appellate court affirmed the denial.  The case was **terminated on August 17, 2012** with no decree, settlement, or injunction granted.  Evans was executed on **February 6, 2006**, before the final decision.\n\n**Factual Context**  \nEvans was convicted of two first‑degree murders in 1984 and sentenced to death.  He was re‑sentenced in 1992 and faced execution in 2006.  His complaint focused on the DOC’s lethal‑injection protocol, which used **sodium pentothal** (an ultrashort‑acting barbiturate), **pancuronium bromide** (a paralytic agent), and **potassium chloride** (the killing agent).  He argued that the protocol’s added third drug, the use of two paralytic agents, and the lack of qualified personnel to monitor anesthesia created a **risk of cruel and unusual punishment**.  He also contended that the protocol was adopted without following the state’s APA.  The DOC’s responses and the court’s orders to provide documents were part of the discovery process, but the court ultimately found no basis for injunctive relief.\n\nIn sum, the case illustrates the procedural trajectory of a capital‑penalty challenge on constitutional grounds, the interaction between district‑court and state‑court decisions, and the ultimate denial of injunctive relief, resulting in the execution of the defendant.",
    "CW-DC-0001": "The lawsuit was filed on June 20, 1989, by plaintiffs who were children in foster care under the Washington, D.C. Department of Human Services (DHS) and by other children who were known to the agency to be in danger of abuse or neglect.  The plaintiffs were named as LaShawn A., Demerick B., Gary C., Leo C., Robert D., Kevin E., and Tyrone F.; each was represented by a next‑friend attorney.  The defendants were the city officials who ran DHS: Mayor Marion Barry Jr., Director Peter G. Parham, Commissioner Barbara Burke‑Tatum, Acting Administrator Jean R. Hunter, and Acting Chief Evelyn P. Andrews.  \n\nThe complaint was a class action on behalf of the approximately 2,500 children in foster care and of other children the city knew to be at risk.  Plaintiffs alleged that the agency had violated the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, the District’s Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act of 1977, the Youth Residential Facilities Licensure Act of 1986, and the Child and Family Services Division’s Manual of Operations.  In addition, they claimed that the agency’s practices deprived children in its custody of Fifth‑Amendment due‑process rights.  The remedy sought was injunctive relief—an enforceable consent decree that required DHS to overhaul its child‑welfare system.\n\nJudge Thomas F. Hogan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered judgment on April 18, 1991 (762 F.Supp. 959), finding that the agency had violated federal and local law and the Constitution and ordering a comprehensive remedial decree.  The remedy was a 84‑page Modified Final Order (MFO) that imposed strict procedural and substantive requirements on DHS: investigations must begin within 48 hours of a report, be completed within 30 days, and be documented in a case‑record system; case managers must develop permanency plans; foster placements must be the least restrictive appropriate to the child’s needs; and training, licensing, and oversight standards must be met.  The court also appointed the Center for the Study of Social Policy as a court‑appointed monitor.\n\nThe defendants appealed.  The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the district court’s findings in 1993 (990 F.2d 1319) and again in 1996 (87 F.3d 1389) and in 1998 (144 F.3d 847), remanding the case for the district court to enter the remedial order.  Subsequent orders directed the city to appoint receivers, to comply with the MFO, and to submit periodic monitoring reports to the court and the monitor.  Over the next decade the city underwent receiverships, a series of remedial plans, and repeated court‑ordered audits of performance.\n\nIn 2007 the court approved an Amended Implementation Plan (AIP) that updated the remedial order’s timelines.  In 2010 the court entered an Implementation and Exit Plan (IEP) that set specific performance standards and exit dates for the remaining remedial requirements.  In 2019 the parties agreed to an Exit and Sustainability Plan (ESP) that replaced the IEP; the ESP removed standards that the city had already met and outlined a strategy for the remaining standards.\n\nThroughout the case the court relied on the monitor’s reports, the city’s compliance data, and the parties’ negotiations to adjust the remedial framework.  The case never settled; instead it evolved into a long‑running judicial supervision that culminated in the ESP, which the court approved in August 2019 as the final instrument governing the city’s child‑welfare system."
