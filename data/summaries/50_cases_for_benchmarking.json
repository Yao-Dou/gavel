    "summary/long": "This case challenges the Trump administration’s immigration detention policies as unconstitutional retaliation against protected speech. On April 30, 2025, Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian woman detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), filed a habeas corpus petition and motion for injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Represented by private counsel and the Southern Poverty Law Center, Kordia sought both immediate release and protection against re-detention.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Sam A. Lindsay.\n\nThe habeas petitioner alleged that her arrest and confinement were part of a broader administration policy—driven by Executive Order 14188 and public statements by President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio—to target noncitizens perceived as supporting Palestinian causes. She claimed that DHS confined her in retaliation for protected First Amendment activity, denied her procedural and substantive due process, and violated her religious freedom while detaining her in harsh conditions at Prairieland Detention Facility. She further argued that her long-distance transfer from New Jersey to Texas was in violation of ICE’s own detainee transfer policies and intended to punish and silence her.\n\nAlthough an immigration judge had granted her bond, ICE invoked an automatic administrative stay and refused to release her. On May 5, 2025, the habeas petitioner moved for a preliminary injunction (PI) ordering her release pending final judgment.\n\nThe government opposed, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction and that her detention was lawful under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nThe habeas petitioner replied on May 27, arguing that the court retained habeas jurisdiction to hear constitutional claims, citing recent parallel rulings from other district courts involving protest-related detentions.\n\nOn June 2, 2025, the court scheduled a hearing on the preliminary injunction for June 5 and authorized public livestreaming and remote attendance by the habeas petitioner, but denied her request to appear physically in court.\n\nOn June 27, the magistrate judge issued Findings and Recommendation, concluding that the court had jurisdiction over the petitioner’s procedural due process challenge to ICE’s use of an automatic stay, and recommending that the court grant the motion for PI. The judge found that the petitioner had shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm from continued detention, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored release. The judge recommended that the court order the petitioner’s immediate release pending final judgment.\n\nThat same day, the court issued a show-cause order requiring the government to file its merits response to the habeas petition within 60 days.\n\nOn July 1, the magistrate judge granted the petitioner’s unopposed motion to extend the expedited objection, citing the need to allow habeas counsel to coordinate with the petitioner’s immigration attorney regarding removal proceedings. Objections to the recommendation are now due by July 7, and responses are due by July 10. No party may file a reply. As of July 1, 2025, the district judge has not yet ruled on whether to adopt the recommendation.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "On April 24, 2025, three nonprofit organizations filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary. They challenged Defendants' shuttering of three offices within DHS: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman Office (CIS-Omb), and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO). CRCL is charged by statute with receiving and adjudicating complaints of civil rights abuses by DHS. CIS-Omb is charged by statute with assisting individuals and employers who are having problems with visas, work permits, and other immigration issues. OIDO is charged by statute with receiving complaints and reporting to Congress about violations of law, professional standards, and contract terms by operators of public or private detention facilities. The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants' actions to eliminate these offices exceeded Defendants' authority and violated Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Ana C. Reyes.\n\nOn May 8, plaintiffs filed a motion for a Preliminary Injunction (PI). Following a hearing, the court took the matter under advisement. On May 23, plaintiffs filed a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). That same day, the court denied the TRO motion without prejudice, noting that the motion for a PI remained under consideration. They ordered that the parties provide confirmation by May 27 that the job vacancies can be posted, and submit a joint status report by June 2.\n\nOn May 27, the parties submitted a joint status report addressing the current job vacancy status. Defendants asserted that the offices were permitted to create new positions and seek applicants, while plaintiffs contended that they lacked sufficient information to verify that claim. On June 2, the court ordered defendants to file another status report providing further updates on or before July 2, 2025.\n\nThat same day, plaintiffs submitted a status report outlining the perceived deficiencies in defendants' efforts to resume the statutory functions of the offices. The court scheduled a status conference for June 12, 2025. In advance of the hearing, plaintiffs filed an additional status report describing the ongoing harms to both plaintiffs and the public.\n\nFollowing the hearing, the court ordered defendants to inform the court by June 16 whether DHS had communicated with the Executive regarding the language in the Fiscal Year 2026 budget stating that OIDO had been \"eliminated in its entirety,\" and, if so, to describe the nature of those communications. On June 16, defendants submitted a declaration detailing DHS's budget process and the funding status of OIDO. Defendants filed a response two days later, reiterating their request for the court to issue an injunction or, in the alternative, to permit discovery into defendants' actions concerning the offices since January 20, 2025.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case is one of numerous lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s abrupt termination of immigration visas—mostly student or work visas—with no notice to the visa-holders and with dubious or no legal basis. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nThe petitioner, Mohammed Hoque, is a 20-year-old Bangladeshi national who entered the United States on an F-1 student visa. In March, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers detained Hoque outside his home based on a visa revocation and termination of his Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record. Petitioner was then put into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody in a Minnesota jail. On April 9, 2025, an Immigration Court ordered the petitioner released on a $7,500 bond. DHS appealed the decision and invoked an automatic stay under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(i)(2) citing the petitioner’s misdemeanor disorderly conduct conviction in 2023. Hoque argues that this misdemeanor had already been disclosed to U.S. officials and is thus not a recognized grounds for SEVIS termination under 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d).\n\nOn April 18, 2025, the petitioner filed a writ of habeas corpus seeking release on bond. In the writ, the petitioner primarily claimed the DHS violated his First Amendment rights and detained him due to statements he made expressing support with Palestine. He further claimed that the visa revocation and SEVIS termination were pretextual, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and that his continued detention, despite the immigration judge’s bond order, violated his procedural due process rights. The case was originally assigned to Judge Jerry W. Blackwell.\n\nThe petitioner moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) preventing his removal or his transfer out of the district on April 22, 2025. At a status conference, the government contended the Court lacked jurisdiction to prevent his transfer. Nonetheless, Judge Blackwell granted the TRO on April 23, finding that a transfer would undermine the court’s ability to adjudicate the habeas petition. The court also found that Hoque was suffering irreparable harm, including worsening of a hernia condition, infringement of his free speech rights, disruption to his education, financial losses, and the risk of rendering his habeas petition unreviewable if transferred. The following day, DHS withdrew its initial charge of removability and proceeded solely on the basis of visa revocation.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, the court granted Hoque interim release pending final adjudication. Judge Blackwell held that there was sufficient evidence to infer that DHS had targeted Hoque in retaliation for his pro-Palestinian views. The government argued that the retaliation claim was barred by the existence of probable cause under Nieves v. Bartlett (holding that a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim fails as a matter of law where there was probably cause for the arrest).\n\nJudge Blackwell rejected this argument. The Nieves Court held that to successfully make a retaliatory arrest claim a plaintiff must show that, \"he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.\" In the case at hand, Hoque provided evidence that other international students whose SEVIS records had been terminated were not detained. Therefore, the court concluded it could appropriately consider retaliatory motives. Judge Blackwell also concluded that the automatic stay by DHS, in the absence of individualized justification, was arbitrary. Returning to the irreparable harm the petitioner faced in detention, the court found that it would be in the interest of justice to release the petitioner pending the final adjudication of the habeas petition.\n\nAs of June 3rd, 2025, the Court has ordered the temporary restraining order extended three times.

The plaintiffs in this case and as many as a hundred others alleged that the administration's actions were unlawful and designed to coerce them and other international students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting. The lawsuits alleged that Defendants’ actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment.  On April 25, 2025, the administration reversed course; more details to follow.\n\nThis case in particular was filed on April 14, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, by international students attending school on F-1 visas. They sued the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Detroit field director of ICE, all in their official capacities. The case was assigned to District Judge Jane Beckering.\n\nOn April 24, 2025, Judge Beckering granted a temporary restraining order, holding that the legality of the government's conduct was questionable under the Administrative Procedure Act, because the steps taken seemed not to reflect the relevant regulations. Accordingly, the court ordered DHS to \"set aside the F-1 student record termination decisions as to Plaintiffs\" and \"restore each Plaintiff’s F-1 student record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), retroactive to the date of termination,\" and the court barred related continuing adverse conduct, including:\n\n• re-terminating the SEVIS record,   • revoking Optional Practical Training employment authorizations;   • \"arresting, detaining, or transferring Plaintiffs out of the current jurisdiction in which they are located, or ordering the arrest, detention, or transfer of Plaintiffs out of the jurisdiction where they are currently located, without first providing adequate notice to both this Court and Plaintiffs’ counsel as well as time to contest any such action\", or   • \"initiating removal proceedings against or deporting any Plaintiff on the basis of the termination of their F-1 student record in SEVIS.\"\n\nOn April 25, 2025, ICE announced it would reactivate the records of terminated students, and develop a policy addressing SEVIS termination.\n\nPlaintiffs argued that the imminent prospect of a new SEVIS termination policy justified a preliminary injunction. On May 7, 2025, Judge Beckering granted plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction, finding that plaintiffs were at substantial risk of harm from defendants' deletion and possible re-termination of their SEVIS records and that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims given the torrent of rulings in other district courts nationwide against defendants' attempts to wipe immigration records.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged Trump’s Executive Orders 14151 and 14173, which cut government funding for “equity-related” programs. On March 17, 2025, Erie County, New York, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Corporation for National and Community Service (commonly known as AmeriCorps) and its interim agency head. The case was assigned to Judge James Emanuel Boasberg. Erie County sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that AmeriCorps’ actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe dispute arose after Erie County applied for and was awarded a three-year Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) grant from AmeriCorps in October 2023. The grant, which supports volunteer services such as the Meals on Wheels program, was approved in January 2024. However, after the issuance of Executive Order 14151 on January 20, 2025—titled “Ending Radical Government DEI Programs and Preferencing”—AmeriCorps began reviewing grant recipients for compliance with the order’s mandate to eliminate “equity-related” programs. The following day, President Trump issued Executive Order 14173, requiring federal grant recipients to certify that they did not operate programs promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) that violated federal antidiscrimination laws. AmeriCorps subsequently demanded that Erie County either amend its grant application, certify its compliance with all administration executive orders, or relinquish the award.\n\nIn February 2025, Erie County received multiple communications from AmeriCorps stating that noncompliance with the executive orders could result in grant termination. In response, the county pointed to a temporary injunction against Executive Order 14151 issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. See National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education v. Trump [../../../../case/46024/]. AmeriCorps initially paused enforcement but continued to impose additional conditions on grant applications.\n\nIn its complaint, Erie County claimed that AmeriCorps’ enforcement of the executive orders was arbitrary, capricious, and exceeded its lawful authority under the Administrative Procedure Act. The county also alleged that the vague and undefined requirements of the orders violated the Spending Clause by coercing local governments into compliance with federal conditions that lacked a clear legal basis. Erie County argued that AmeriCorps’ demands were unlawful, as its regulations had long required applicants to promote community diversity in their programs. The county refused to certify that its RSVP program did not promote DEI, noting that it had operated in full compliance with AmeriCorps regulations. The lawsuit sought a court order enjoining AmeriCorps from imposing additional grant requirements beyond those established by law and from enforcing Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 against the county.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. They asked the Court to require the \"Defendants to determine Plaintiff is in compliance with all relevant grant requirements for existing RSVP grants, and to disburse immediately any funds to which it is entitled, without Plaintiff needing to certify that “RSVP of Erie County, 24SR260017 complies with all administration Executive Orders and does not include any activities that promote DEI activities,” or make any other substantially similar certification referencing compliance with executive orders and promotion of DEI activities.\" The defendants filed their motion in opposition to the preliminary injunction on April 4, 2025, arguing the \"Plaintiff ha[d] not demonstrated that it is at imminent risk of irreparable harm, that it is likely to succeed on the merits, or that the balance of the equities is in its favor.\"\n\nOn April 14, plaintiffs filed a voluntary motion to dismiss the case without prejudice, which the judge granted. They decided to do so after the defendants changed their certification requirement.  According to the Erie County website, AmeriCorps withdrew its requirement that the county must certify compliance with Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 or certify that its grants did not \"include any activities that promote DEI activities” (See Erie County Dismisses Lawsuit against Americorps [https://www4.erie.gov/exec/press/erie-county-dismisses-lawsuit-against-americorps-after-agency-agrees-erie-county-can-conduct]). AmeriCorps agreed to issue a grant to Plaintiff using the pre-Trump administration certification.\n\nThis case is closed.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) termination of 12 civil servants at the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) Office of Equity Assurance (OEA) based on the VA's designation of OEA as a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) office and the 12 civil servants as DEIA employees. These designations and firings resulted directly from—and were carried out in purported compliance with—President Trump’s Executive Order 14151 (EO 14151) that directed the elimination of all DEIA-related offices and positions in the federal government. None of the 12 terminated employees were probationary employees, and none had been subject to complaints of poor performance or misconduct.

The plaintiffs sued the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Represented by the Law Office of David A.

    "summary/long": "This case challenged President Trump's imposition of tariffs on various countries. On February 3, 2025, Gary Barnes, a pro se plaintiff, sued President Trump and the United States in the Court of International Trade, alleging that the tariffs imposed by President Trump violated the Constitution's separation of powers by performing duties delegated to the legislative branch. The plaintiff requested preliminary and permanent injunctive relief banning President Trump from imposing any tariffs or collecting duties on those already imposed.

The court agreed on May 23, 2025, ordering the case to be dismissed without prejudice but allowing the plaintiff until June 23 to remedy the pleading deficiencies found by the court. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiff had failed to allege an injury in fact, since his claim that President Trump had violated the Constitution was based on an alleged violation of “the right, possessed by every citizen, to require that the Government be administered according to law,\" which is \"abstract and cannot support Article III standing.\" The court also rejected the plaintiff's alleged economic injury from the tariffs as sufficient to confer standing, since the alleged injury would not be particularized but would \"adversely affect the household income of [the plaintiff] and all United States citizens.\" Therefore, the court found that the plaintiff's injury was speculative and not particularized, which failed to meet the requirements for Article III standing. 2025 WL 1483384.\n\nOn June 19, the plaintiff filed a motion asking the judge \"to reverse her decision to dismiss this suit and issue an injunction against President Trump’s issuing any more unconstitutional Executive Orders involving tariffs that put in place duties.\" The defendants filed an answer to the motion on July 21, arguing that the filing was not an amended complaint that remedied the defects found by the court but actually a motion to reconsider the court's decision to dismiss the plaintiff's first complaint.

    "summary/long": "On June 6, 2025, federal law enforcement arrived in Los Angeles to launch what Trump Administration officials described as “the largest Mass Deportation Operation in History.” This case challenges the enforcement practices used during that operation, focusing specifically on the use of roving patrols. Petitioners alleged that federal agents conducted indiscriminate roundups without reasonable suspicion, often appearing masked, without visible badges or identification, and without identifying their agency. These patrols were further alleged to have based detentive stops not on individualized suspicion but on factors such as race, ethnicity, accent, or presence at day laborer sites, bus stops, car washes, or agricultural locations. Certain case documents, including the original petition, have not been made publicly available.\n\nOn June 18, 2025, in Pasadena, California, several individuals were arrested while waiting for a job and subsequently detained in the basement of the Los Angeles federal building (B-18), where they reported experiencing dungeon-like conditions, crowded, unsanitary conditions with limited access to basic necessities and medical care, and were denied phone calls.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, these individuals, along with Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, and organizations such as the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center, filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The petitioners sued the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of a regional ICE field office, the U.S. Attorney General, and various other federal officials from agencies including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The case was assigned to District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong and referred to Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym.\n\nRepresented by attorneys and legal representatives from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) and Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), the petitioners sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. They argued that the defendants’ operation involved two unconstitutional features: “roving patrols” indiscriminately rounding up numerous individuals without reasonable suspicion and denying these individuals access to lawyers, which they contended violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, respectively.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the petitioners filed a first amended complaint and an application for a temporary restraining order concerning access to counsel. The next day, on July 3, 2025, they filed a second application for a temporary restraining order focusing on unlawful stops.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Frimpong granted a temporary restraining order and order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1915964. The court concluded that the petitioners were likely to succeed in showing that the defendants had conducted roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and had denied access to lawyers, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively. The court also highlighted restricted access to counsel for individuals detained at B-18, noting that attorneys and legal representatives were often denied entry or permitted only brief, limited visits. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to cease these practices, specifically prohibiting federal agents from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation and forbidding reliance solely on four factors (alone or in combination): the district court temporarily enjoined the government from stopping people based only on four factors, alone or in combination:  race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence in certain kinds of locations frequented by the public, like bus stops, car washes, and parking lots; and type of occupation.  The order further required immigration agencies to provide detainees with access to attorneys or legal representatives seven days a week, including confidential, unmonitored telephone calls at no charge.\n\nOn July 13, 2025, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 14, 2025, they filed a motion to stay the district court’s TRO pending appeal. On July 16, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants’ motions to stay the district court’s injunction pending appeal, without prejudice. The court found that DHS and other defendants failed to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8 because they neither sought a stay pending appeal from the district court nor showed that doing so was impracticable.\n\nBack in the district court, petitioner Carlos Osorto filed an application for release from immigration custody on July 21, 2025. Petitioner Osorto argued his case was extraordinary because he withdrew his TRO request and delayed briefing based on DHS’s promise of a bond hearing, only for DHS to later deny the immigration court’s jurisdiction. After reversing course again, DHS requested a hearing, which was denied for lack of new facts or jurisdictional basis. Osorto also cited serious, persistent health issues, including dizziness, confusion, and a blood pressure reading of 190. The court granted Osorto’s application for release from immigration custody on July 30, 2025. The court found \"special and unusual circumstances,\" citing DHS’s shifting positions, Osorto’s serious health issues, and the immigration court’s repeated refusal to hear the case. The court held it had habeas authority to grant bail, found Osorto neither a danger nor flight risk, and ordered his immediate release on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, declining to stay the order due to his condition.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants’ motion to stay the TRO, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits. However, the court agreed with the defendants that the TRO’s clause “except as permitted by law” was impermissibly vague and that they were likely to succeed on the merits of that specific challenge.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief due to a \"realistic threat\" of being stopped again without reasonable suspicion, as the harm resulted from a \"pattern of officially sanctioned behavior.\" The court noted that in the Central District of California, where the stops occurred and approximately 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, factors such as apparent race, ethnicity, language, or accent had \"limited probative value\" in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court also concluded that a person’s presence at places like car washes or bus stops, or the type of work they do, did little to arouse reasonable suspicion. Finally, the court rejected the defendants’ argument that the TRO would have a \"chilling effect\" on enforcement, finding that defendants \"cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the district court's TRO decision. The Administration argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not shown a sufficient risk of future unlawful encounters with law enforcement, and that past incidents did not establish such a risk. They claimed the district court order imposed a “straitjacket” on enforcement that was “inimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry” required by the Fourth Amendment, and that the lower court erred in holding that the four prohibited factors—again, apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, presence at locations where undocumented immigrants gather, and certain jobs like landscaping or construction—could never contribute to reasonable suspicion. They argued that actually race, ethnicity, language, etc. were appropriate factors for reasonable suspicion, but complained that under the order:\n\nThe only safe harbor for an immigration agent in the Central District of California would be to ignore the apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, and occupation of a suspected illegal alien—and thus to ignore factors that may often support reasonable suspicion in context.\n\nThey further argued that the district-wide injunction violated Trump v. CASA, Inc. (24A884), which barred such sweeping relief, noting that the August 1 order applied to all 20 million residents of the Central District rather than just the named respondents, and that it inflicted “manifest irreparable harm” by hindering enforcement and making every stop a potential “contempt trap.”\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed an amicus brief supporting the stay, arguing that the injunction misapplied the Fourth Amendment’s reasonable suspicion standard. FAIR emphasized that temporary investigative stops required only reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause, as established in Terry v. Ohio and reinforced in Kansas v. Glover.\n\nOn the same day, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and 20 other cities in the Central District of California filed an amicus brief opposing the stay. They contested the applicants’ claim that “apparent ethnicity” and language could justify stops and detentions, noting that applying this standard would have subjected over half of the Central District’s population, including millions of U.S. citizens, to detention. They further argued that the applicants’ unconstitutional actions had harmed communities by diverting local law enforcement resources, reducing public cooperation, and deterring victims and witnesses from participating in the justice system.\n\nThis case remains active at all three levels of federal court: In the Central District of California, briefing proceeds on a preliminary injunction (with a hearing scheduled for September 24, 2025), and class certification.  In the Ninth Circuit, the TRO appeal is pending. And in the Supreme Court, stay briefing concluded on August 13.",

They named the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE), and the ICE Field Office Director of Detroit as Defendants. They alleged that Defendants' actions violated the Fifth Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case challenges the federal government’s April 2025 policy action in which DHS began unilaterally terminating SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System) records of foreign students across the country. The plaintiffs alleged that this effectively revoked their immigration status without explanation, notice, or a meaningful opportunity to respond. They claimed that DHS acted without statutory authority and in violation of both federal regulation (8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d)) and constitutional due process protections. Plaintiffs were never charged with any crimes, and their schools were unable to explain the terminations beyond vague references to “criminal records checks” or visa revocations. Plaintiffs asserted that these grounds were unlawful and unsupported by individualized findings.\n\nOn the same day the complaint was filed, plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to reinstate their SEVIS records and halt removals. Judge Stephen J. Murphy III heard the motion on April 15, 2025. The government opposed, arguing that SEVIS termination does not automatically end F-1 status or trigger removal proceedings. On April 17, 2025, Judge Murphy denied the TRO in part, finding that plaintiffs had not yet established a likelihood of success on the merits or shown irreparable harm. The court emphasized that the record was insufficient to determine whether SEVIS termination alone constitutes a revocation of lawful status or a final agency action reviewable under the APA (2025 WL 1009445).\n\nThe plaintiffs’ educational paths and employment were severely disrupted, with immediate implications for work authorizations, academic progress, and legal presence in the U.S. The court’s ruling deferred further injunctive relief to later proceedings, with briefing and a preliminary injunction hearing scheduled for May 2025.\n\nThis case remains ongoing, with the next motion hearing set for May 19, 2025, before Judge Murphy.",

    "summary/long": "This lawsuit challenges congressional action taken against Northwestern University.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, the plaintiffs – two clinical professors of law at Northwestern University – filed suit against three government defendants – the  U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce, and two U.S. House Member in their capacity as Committee Chair and Subcommittee Chair respectively – and three nominal defendants – Northwestern University, the President of Northwestern University, and the Chair of the Board of Trustees of Northwestern University.\n\nThe Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law runs the Bluhm Legal Clinic, a legal services organization which houses twenty different clinical programs and provide pro bono legal services to clients on a range of matters, from appellate advocacy, housing and tenant issues, and environmental advocacy. Plaintiffs set forth the following facts in their complaint: Plaintiffs are clinical professors of law at the Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic and the Center on Negotiation, Mediation, and Restorative Justice, respectively.\n\nPlaintiffs noted that in 2024, amidst student protests over the war in Gaza, Northwestern University reached an agreement with student protestors, wherein students agreed to remove their protest encampment in exchange for the promise of the continuation of peaceful protests. In the same year, the Committee on Education and Workforce, a standing committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, made multiple requests for information from Northwestern relating to the protests.\n\nPlaintiffs’ complaint further alleged that after the Trump administration took office in January 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14188 on January 29, which directed executive agencies to identify authorities under their jurisdictions to combat antisemitism. Consistent with that Executive Order, the Department of Justice established a joint task force to combat “antisemitic acts of terrorism and civil rights violations,” and opened investigations into Northwestern and four other universities. The House Committee demanded more information from Northwestern in March 2025: Noting that Northwestern had provided free legal representation to the organizers of an anti-Israeli highway blockage protest, the Committee demanded several categories of documents relating to clinical work done at Northwestern Law, including all written policies and guidance relating to legal clinics; a detailed budget for the Bluhm Legal Clinic; and all hiring and performance reviews for one of the plaintiffs.\n\nPlaintiffs challenged the demands, by making the following claims: (1) Defendants’ actions violated plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights to advocate on behalf of clients, and constituted viewpoint-based discrimination with no legitimate legislative purpose. (2) Defendants violated plaintiffs’ due process rights under the Fifth Amendment, by failing to provide adequate process before interfering with plaintiffs’ right to represent their clients. (3) Defendants interfered with the Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel requirement, a constitutional claim which plaintiffs had prudential, third-party standing to bring on behalf of their clients. (4) Defendants violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as the investigation reflected a “bare desire to harm Plaintiffs” for their political affiliations.\n\nPlaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief, to declare the demand for information unconstitutional and enjoin the nominal defendants from producing any documents responsive to the Committee request.\n\nThe case was assigned to the Honorable Elaine E. Bucklo.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for an emergency temporary restraining order. As the Committee on Education and Workforce had issued a demand for information from Northwestern University, plaintiffs requested that the court issue an order to stay the Committee’s demand and prevent the university from complying by April 10. Plaintiffs argued that the investigation was part of an ideological campaign by the White House to target non-ideologically aligned universities and institutions, and that the stated goal of combating antisemitism was merely pretextual for this politically-motivated attack. Plaintiffs further alleged that the clinical programs at Northwestern University would be harmed as a result of the Committee’s inquiry. Plaintiffs therefore urged the court to issue a temporary restraining order.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, plaintiff’s counsel submitted a declaration, noting that the plaintiffs’ motion for an emergency temporary restraining order had asked the court to act by April 10, but that did not allow time to provide notice to the Committee. Plaintiff’s counsel submitted in their declaration that they provided notice to counsel for the Committee and to Northwestern University.\n\nThe committee then withdrew its request.  After the hearing on the request for a temporary restraining order, on April 10, 2025, the court ruled that there was no longer a need for emergency relief, and denied the motion without prejudice.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nThis case challenged termination of an international student's status. The case was filed on April 7, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\nThe pseudonymous plaintiff, John Doe, was represented by attorneys from Van Der Hout LLP. The defendants were President Donald J. Trump, Moises Becerra, in his official capacity as Acting Field Office Director of the San Francisco Office of Detention and Removal, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement; and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe plaintiff brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act. The complaint detailed that the plaintiff was an F-1 status student with Optional Practical Training (OPT) employment authorization. The plaintiff's SEVIS record was terminated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on March 28, 2025, with the reason cited as \"Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\n\nThe plaintiff contended that the termination of their SEVIS record was unlawful and that ICE was not authorized to terminate their student status. The complaint also expressed fear of retaliatory arrest and detention. , and sought a declaration that the termination of their SEVIS record was unlawful, an order to restore their SEVIS record and status, and an injunction to prevent enforcement actions, detention, transfer, or removal.\n\nOn April 16, 2025, the plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, asking the court to enjoin defendants from arresting, transferring, or otherwise incarcerating plaintiff pending resolution of these proceedings. He also asked that his SEVIS record be declared without legal force for the duration of this litigation, which was necessary so that he could continue to work.\n\nThis case was assigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White, and was set as the lead case for numerous other cases raising the same issues, each of which was marked related to this one.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the court held a hearing on the TRO filings in all the related cases, and granted or extended TROs in all of them, and set a time for a Preliminary Injunction hearing. The preliminary injunction hearing was held May 14.\n\nFaced by this and other similar litigation around the country, ICE announced that day that it was restoring SEVIS records for all the petitioners and others similarly situated, while it \"develop[ed] a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations.\"  It stated that \"[u]ntil such a policy is issued, the SEVIS records for the plaintiffs in these above-captioned cases (and other similarly situated plaintiffs) will remain Active or shall be re-activated if not currently active.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged Executive Order 14248, which imposed various requirements on federal elections. On April 3, 2025, nineteen states filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming President Donald Trump, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and its director and commissioners, and the Secretary of Defense as Defendants. They challenged multiple sections of Executive Order 14248, titled \"Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,\" signed on March 25, 2025. These sections:\n\n• Require the EAC to demand documentary proof of citizenship and to record such information,   • Require the heads of federal voter registration agencies to assess citizenship prior to providing registration forms,   • Order the Secretary of Defense to require proof of citizenship in the Federal Post Card Application,   • Command the Attorney General to take action against states that count absentee ballots received after Election Day, and   • Condition federal funding upon compliance with the EO.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that by purporting to impose election rules on the states, the President exceeded his constitutional powers and unlawfully infringed on congressional and state authority, thereby violating the Separation of Powers, the Administrative Procedure Act, the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). Represented by their respective attorneys general, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorney fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Denise J. Casper.\n\nOn April 23, the defendants moved to transfer and consolidate this case with a case in the District Court for the District of Columbia, League of United Latin American Citizens v. Executive Office of the President [../../../../case/46322/], which also challenged the EO. Judge Casper denied the motion on May 9, finding that transfer was not in the interests of justice in this case, given that the plaintiffs here were states, not private parties, and this case challenged different sections of the EO from those challenged in the D.D.C. case.\n\nOn May 5, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. The court granted the motion on June 13, finding that the challenged sections were ripe for review since they either imposed deadlines or clearly laid out actions that the defendants were required to take. Turning to the merits, the court found that the President lacked the authority to take the actions challenged, since in federal statutes such as the NVRA, the HAVA, and the UOCAVA, Congress set requirements for federal elections that did not include those required by the EO. Finally, the court found that Congress had never endorsed the EO's interpretation regarding absentee and mail-in ballots in its various Election Day statutes and that the EO could not impose conditions on formula grants since the Constitution \"vests exclusive power in Congress to impose conditions on federal grants.\" Therefore, the court enjoined the defendants from implementing any of the challenged sections of the EO. 2025 WL 1667949.\n\nAlso on June 13, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs either lacked standing (since they were challenging actions that allegedly did not affect them) or were bringing claims that were not ripe (since they were bringing claims challenging actions that had not yet occurred, and which still need to go through additional legal and policy processes). The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim on the merits because, since the Elections Assistance Commission is an Executive Agency, \"the Constitution grants the President supervisory authority over members of the Executive Branch, [so] he may lawfully direct how they carry out their statutory duties.\"\n\nOn July 3, the defendants filed a motion to modify the preliminary injunction. Pointing to the Supreme Court's recent decision in Casa Inc. v. Trump [../../../../case/45965/], in which the Supreme Court held that federal courts lacked power to issue injunctions that provide relief to individuals who are not parties to a case, the defendants argued that because \"this Court’s preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from implementing Executive Order 14248’s section 2(d) is broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the Plaintiffs in this case, the Court should grant this motion and modify its injunction concerning section 2(d) to the Plaintiffs.\" The court granted the request on July 18, modifying its preliminary injunction concerning Section 2(d) to only apply to the plaintiff states.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged Trump’s Executive Orders 14183 and 14168 preventing transgender individuals from serving in the military, as well as the Department of Defense and U.S. Air Force memoranda implementing the orders. On March 17, 2025, two active-duty Air Force service members filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Judge Christine P. O’Hearn was appointed to the case. The plaintiffs sued Secretary of Defense, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force, and the United States Department of the Air Force. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming the EOs violated the Fifth Amendments and contract law.\n\nAt issue in this case was Executive Order 14183, signed January 27, 2025, titled \"U.S. Military Excellence and Readiness\"; and Executive Order 14168, signed January 20, 2025, titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” Together, these EOs reinstated a ban on transgender military service that was initially passed by the first Trump Administration. The first transgender ban was overturned by the Biden Administration’s EO 14004, named the Austin Policy, which allowed transgender individuals to serve openly. EO 14183 and 14168 then overturned that Biden policy, mandating that service members could only serve according to their birth sex and prohibiting the use of pronouns inconsistent with that classification. Subsequent memorandums were issued by the Secretary of Defense, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, and the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, instructing implementation of the EOs.\n\nIn their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged the EOs violated the Equal Protection Clause under the Fifth Amendment by banning transgender people from serving in the military on the basis of their sex and transgender status without lawful justification, requiring transgender people to serve only in accordance with their sex assigned at birth, and enforcing a discriminatory definition of the term “sex.” The plaintiffs also alleged the EOs violated their Procedural Due Process rights as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment because they reasonably relied on the Austin Policy’s standards for military fitness, and the defendants failed to provide adequate procedural protections to prevent the deprivation of the plaintiffs’ career and future benefits earned in the course of their military service. Plaintiffs also assert an estoppel claim, arguing they reasonably relied on the Austin Policy regarding military fitness standards, and the EOs deprived them of property and liberty interests by eliminating the stability and certainty they previously had in their careers and benefits.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent the defendants from (1) initiating administrative separation proceedings for the plaintiffs, and (2) implementing the voluntary separation offer outlined in the Implementing Guidance for EO 14183. They argued the new policy caused immediate and irreparable harm, stripping them of their careers and exposing them to forced separation under discriminatory conditions. Defendants filed a motion in opposition to the TRO request on March 20, arguing the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their Equal Protection claim because (1) military judgment receives significant deference, (2) the policy did not classify based on sex, and if it did heightened scrutiny would not apply, (3) and the alleged animus was not a sufficient reason to grant the TRO.\n\nThe Court granted the TRO on March 24, enjoining the defendants from \"initiating administrative separation proceedings against Plaintiffs based on their transgender status\" and \"from enforcing or implementing any aspect of the Orders as to Plaintiffs\" for fourteen days. On March 25, the defendants filed a letter with the court requesting a stay of the TRO. The court denied this request on March 26.\n\nBecause of the nationwide preliminary injunction issued in Shilling v. Trump [../../../../case/46057/], Plaintiffs did not seek to extend the TRO on April 4 since a \"nationwide preliminary injunction is currently in place that prohibits the Government from enforcing the Trump Administration’s transgender military ban as to any transgender  service members.\"\n\nOn May 15, 2025, the plaintiffs moved to dismiss the case without prejudice. The court dismissed the case the next day.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This is a case about alleged retaliation and censorship arising from immigration enforcement linked to political advocacy for Palestine. On March 15, 2025, three individuals filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. They sued President Donald Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and other federal officials under the First Amendment and Fifth Amendment. Judge Elizabeth C. Coombe was assigned to the case.\n\nRepresented by individual attorneys and attorneys from Davis, Ndanusa, Ikhlas & Saleem LLP, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, and Project TAHA, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, along with attorneys’ fees. They claimed that two executive orders—Executive Order 14161 and Executive Order 14188—unconstitutionally chilled protected speech by threatening criminal prosecution or deportation for individuals who expressed viewpoints critical of the U.S. or Israeli governments. The plaintiffs alleged that these executive orders were being used to surveil, silence, and threaten activists with detention or deportation solely based on their political beliefs and associations.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the Executive Orders violated the First Amendment’s protections of free speech and free association by imposing severe penalties and enforcement threats against individuals for expressing or supporting particular political viewpoints. They further claimed violations of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, asserting that the Orders authorized detention and deportation without adequate procedural safeguards and that enforcement was arbitrary and retaliatory. The plaintiffs contended that these constitutional violations caused irreparable harm by chilling their political expression and advocacy.\n\nOn the same day the complaint was filed, the plaintiffs submitted a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent enforcement of the challenged executive orders. The TRO motion sought to immediately enjoin the defendants from enforcing Executive Orders 14161 and 14188 against the plaintiffs, specifically prohibiting any detention, deportation, or other punitive actions related to their speech or political activities during the pendency of the case. On March 19, 2025, the Court received an ex parte version of the TRO motion. On March 20, 2025, the Court denied the ex parte request and ordered the plaintiffs to show cause by 5:00 p.m. that same day why the motion should not be placed on the public docket. The plaintiffs did not respond to the order to show cause.\n\nA hearing on the TRO was held on March 25, 2025, and on March 27, 2025, the Court again denied the TRO. 2025 WL 926207. The Court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits or demonstrate irreparable harm. It also noted that plaintiff Momodou Taal’s visa had already been revoked, which, in the Court’s view, undermined the urgency and necessity of immediate relief. The Court's opinion emphasized that while the plaintiffs raised serious constitutional concerns, they had not met the high threshold required for emergency injunctive relief.\n\nAlso on March 27, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding as defendants the acting directors of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Buffalo Field Office of ICE. The amended filing included a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of plaintiff Momodou Taal, seeking to prevent his detention or removal while the case was pending. They also filed a renewed TRO motion, this time seeking to enjoin federal officials from detaining or removing Taal from the Court’s jurisdiction during the litigation. The plaintiffs alleged that Taal had significantly curtailed his speech and public advocacy out of fear of government reprisal under the executive orders. They also cited heightened enforcement activity, including surveillance outside Taal’s residence and direct instructions from ICE agents to report for detention.\n\nOn March 31, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice, and on April 2, 2025, the Court formally closed the case. According to the plaintiffs, they withdrew the lawsuit in light of escalating enforcement threats, including revocation of immigration status, visible surveillance, and the threat of imminent detention. No injunctive relief was granted, and the case was dismissed without any ruling on the merits.",

They named the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and their corresponding agency heads as Defendants.\n\nThe Plaintiffs published peer-reviewed articles on a government-run patient safety website (PSNet), and they alleged that the government removed their articles on how to better diagnose patients solely because the articles contained the terms \"LGBTQ\" and \"transgender.\" Their articles were removed pursuant to Executive Order 14168 and subsequent OPM guidance directing all departments to “[t]ake down all outward facing media . . . that inculcate or promote gender ideology.” The Plaintiffs challenged the OPM guidance and the removal of their articles, alleging that such actions violated the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act. Specifically, the Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants' actions (1) viewpoint-based and unreasonable discrimination in violation of the First Amendment; and (2) arbitrary and capricious, in excess of OPM’s statutory authority, and contravene a constitutional right in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe Plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Massachusetts, ACLU National, and Yale Law School's Media Freedom clinic, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore their papers to PSNet.\n\nThe Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction on April 1, 2025.

As such, Plaintiffs requested that the court enjoin Defendants' ongoing restrictions to Plaintiffs' speech.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Leo T. Sorokin. On May 23, he granted the Plaintiffs their requested preliminary injunction. He wrote:\n\nThe plaintiffs are likely to succeed in proving that the removal of their articles was a textbook example of viewpoint discrimination by the defendants in violation of the First Amendment.  Because irreparable harm necessarily flows from such a violation, and the balance of harms and the public interest favor the plaintiffs, the motion for a preliminary injunction is ALLOWED in part.  As explained below, the defendants must restore the patient-safety articles they removed from the online resource at issue.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "President Trump issued Executive Order 14168 on January 20, 2025, just hours after taking office. Titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” the order mandated a categorical prohibition on federal funding for gender-affirming care and required the BOP to end all such medical treatments and accommodations for incarcerated individuals. Section 4(c) of the executive order explicitly barred any medical procedures, treatments, or drugs aimed at conforming an inmate’s appearance to a gender different from their sex assigned at birth.\n\nIn subsequent weeks, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) implemented the order through two memoranda: the first, titled “Compliance with Executive Order ‘Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’” was issued on February 21, 2025, and prohibited the purchase of gender-affirming items such as chest binders and hair removal devices while also requiring prison staff to refer to inmates by pronouns corresponding to their assigned sex at birth. The second, titled “Executive Order 14168 Compliance,” was issued on February 28, 2025, and enforced a total ban on federal funding for gender-affirming medical care, including hormone therapy and surgical interventions. Together, these documents were understood as the “Implementing Memoranda.” This putative class action challenges the executive order and its implementing memoranda,\n\nOn March 7, 2025, three incarcerated transgender individuals filed a class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, sued President Trump and high-ranking officials from the Department of Justice and the BOP to challenge EO 14168 and its implementing memoranda. They defined the class as, “[a]ll persons who are or will be incarcerated in the custody of BOP who are or will be diagnosed with gender dysphoria or meet the criteria for a gender dysphoria diagnosis and who are receiving, or would receive, gender-affirming health care absent such care being proscribed by EO 14168 and the Implementing Memoranda.” They brought claims under the Fifth and Eighth Amendments, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act by denying them medically necessary treatment. Judge Royce C. Lamberth was assigned to the case.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU and the Transgender Law Center, plaintiffs sought preliminary and permanent injunctions blocking enforcement of the policy in BOP facilities, a declaration that applying the executive order to medical care was unconstitutional, and an award of attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that the abrupt termination of their hormone therapy and accommodations caused severe psychological harm, including anxiety, mood swings, and suicidal thoughts. They claimed the ban violated the Eighth Amendment by denying care through a blanket policy without individualized assessments, and the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee by targeting transgender individuals. They also asserted violations of the Rehabilitation Act’s ban on disability-based discrimination and argued that the BOP’s implementation of the policy violated the Administrative Procedure Act as arbitrary, capricious, and unconstitutional.\n\nThe same day of the filing, plaintiffs informed the judge of a related case, Doe v. McHenry [Doe%20v.%20McHenry], because the cases grew out of the same event with common issues of fact.\n\nOn March 17, plaintiffs filed motions for a preliminary injunction and for both provisional and official class certification. The preliminary injunction sought to bar enforcement of Executive Order 14168 and related BOP memoranda as applied to medical care and accommodations, and to require the BOP to restore gender-affirming care consistent with policies in place before January 20, 2025. In the motion for class certification, plaintiffs proposed a class consisting of all current and future BOP inmates diagnosed with or meeting criteria for gender dysphoria who are receiving, or would receive, gender-affirming care but for EO 14168 and its implementation.\n\nOn March 28, the defendants filed a motion in opposition to class certification and a preliminary injunction. They argued the plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies and that they did not meet the requirements of Rule 23 for class certification. On April 1, 2025, an amicus brief in support of the Executive Order was filed in support of the defendants by the states of Indiana, Idaho, and 22 other states, who argued that policymakers have the authority to regulate medicine, particularly controversial practices like cross-sex hormones and sex-change surgeries, and that the Eighth Amendment does not grant prisoners greater rights to these treatments than free citizens.\n\nJudge Lamberth granted the preliminary injunction on June 3, 2025, requiring the BOP to continue providing gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy and related accommodations, to all current and future inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. 2025 WL 1568238. The court also certified the case as a class action, extending protections to more than 2,000 transgender individuals in federal custody. However, the order did not require the BOP to provide surgical interventions.\n\nIn his opinion, Judge Lamberth criticized the Trump administration for adopting the policy without adequately considering its impact on transgender inmates, describing it as likely unconstitutional and arbitrary. He stated that denying medically approved treatment could violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment and concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Administrative Procedure Act claims due to the arbitrary nature of the policy reversal.\n\nOn July 14, 2025, a transgender inmate named Clay \"Carla\" Keys filed a motion to intervene in the case, alleging that the BOP was not complying with the court's order. The motion sought a civil contempt finding against the BOP. Keys also sought a preliminary injunction to require the BOP to provide daily electronic access to the PACER system and to restore legal research access on housing unit computers. Additionally, the motion sought an order compelling the BOP to publish the preliminary injunction and memorandum opinion on the electronic bulletin board and in hard copies for all federal prisoners.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This is a Freedom of Information Act case against the \"Department of Government Efficiency\" and the Office of Management and Budget seeking communications involving Elon Musk and his key staff.\n\nThis case concerns a legal battle over government transparency and access to public records. On February 11, 2025, American Oversight, a nonpartisan nonprofit committed to promoting transparency in government, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, the U.S. DOGE Service, the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, the U.S. Digital Service, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The lawsuit, brought under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, seeks to compel the defendants to produce records related to communications involving Elon Musk and his key staff. American Oversight is represented by in-house counsel, including Elizabeth Haddix and David Kronig.\n\nIn November 2024, following the U.S. presidential election, then-President-elect Donald Trump announced that Elon Musk would lead a newly formed entity, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The purpose of this department was initially unclear, with concerns about whether it functioned as a government agency or a private advisory group. On January 20, 2025, Trump issued Executive Order No. 14158, which formally established DOGE and restructured the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) into the U.S. DOGE Service. This order also created a temporary organization within USDS tasked with implementing the administration’s technology and efficiency agenda over the next 18 months. Despite being classified as a government agency under 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1), DOGE’s operations were allegedly shrouded in secrecy. Reports surfaced that DOGE officials, including Musk, had gained access to sensitive government systems, engaged in policy decision-making, and issued direct orders to federal employees, raising concerns about executive overreach and unauthorized influence.\n\nOn January 30, 2025, American Oversight submitted two FOIA requests to the U.S. DOGE Service and OMB: IG Key Terms Request (Tracking No. OMB-25-0252) – Seeking internal communications related to the sudden removal of inspectors general from 17 federal agencies. IG Communications Request (Tracking No. OMB-25-0253) – Requesting records of communications between DOGE officials and members of Congress regarding these firings.\n\nAmerican Oversight’s complaint alleged that the abrupt terminations of inspectors general across multiple federal agencies raised serious concerns about government integrity and potential misconduct. In response, the organization submitted FOIA requests seeking records related to these dismissals and requested expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E)(i). Despite the statutory requirement for a prompt response, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) acknowledged receipt of the requests on January 31, 2025, but failed to issue a determination within the required timeframe. Meanwhile, between January and early February 2025, officials from the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) were reported to have gained unauthorized access to at least 15 federal agencies, including USAID and the Treasury Department. DOGE personnel allegedly froze funding and reduced staffing at USAID, prompting Judge Carl Nichols to issue a temporary injunction on February 7, 2025 (Am. Foreign Service Assoc. v. Trump, 25-cv-352, ECF No. 15). The group also reportedly accessed the Treasury Department’s financial systems, leading to an emergency injunction by Judge Paul Engelmayer, and took control of human resources and financial operations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), raising concerns that it was systematically dismantling regulatory agencies. Further compounding transparency concerns, DOGE officials allegedly used encrypted and ephemeral messaging platforms like Signal and Slack, potentially in violation of federal record-keeping laws. In response to these developments, on January 22, 2025, American Oversight sent a formal preservation letter to Elon Musk, reminding him of DOGE’s legal obligations under the Federal Records Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants’ failure to process the FOIA requests in a timely manner violated FOIA regulations.\n\nThrough this complaint, American Oversight sought a court order compelling the defendants to expedite processing, a declaratory judgment affirming that the requested records must be disclosed, and injunctive relief to ensure FOIA compliance. Additionally, the plaintiff requests attorneys’ fees and litigation costs under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E).\n\nOn March 5, 2025, plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint adding three FOIA requests from February 2025 concerning DOGE deployments, messaging apps, and command structure. It also updated the factual background to include subsequent agency actions, thereby expanding the alleged FOIA violations and clarifying the requested relief.\n\nThat same day, Judge Beryl A. Howell issued a Standing Order in American Oversight v. U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, et al., Civil Action No. 25-409 (BAH), pending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The order outlines procedural requirements for case management, including deadlines for filings, discovery procedures, and motion practices. It mandates the submission of a Joint Meet and Confer Report within 14 days of the defendants’ answer and sets specific rules for handling FOIA cases, emphasizing judicial efficiency and compliance with procedural obligations. This order signals that the case is actively progressing through its pretrial stages.\n\nOn April 2, 2025, the court granted American Oversight’s Motion for a Preservation Order, compelling DOGE, its sub-entities, and OMB to preserve all records responsive to the FOIA requests and disclose whether such records had been preserved to date. The court cited concerns that DOGE operated with unusual secrecy, may not have issued adequate litigation holds, and that many DOGE staff were unfamiliar with federal records retention obligations. The court found that a preservation order was necessary to ensure compliance with both the FOIA and the Presidential Records Act, especially given DOGE’s use of ephemeral communications systems and its refusal to stipulate to record preservation obligations.\n\nDefendants responded to the amended complaint on April 21, 2025, and subsequently filed an amended answer on April 24. On June 2, plaintiffs moved for limited discovery to assess whether DOGE wielded independent authority sufficient to quality as an \"agency\" under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\nThe case remains ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenges the alleged illegal termination of grant money for state and jurisdictional humanities councils by the United States DOGE Service.\n\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) was established by Congress in 1965 with the declaration that \"The arts and the humanities belong to all the people of the United States\". The goal was to provide funding for research, publication of scholarly works, and the promotion of the humanities. Congress also created a statutory framework to protect the agency from political influence. In 1972, Congress amended the NEH statutes to create grants-in-aid programs for each state and territory, which led to the funding of state and jurisdictional humanities councils. The Federation of State Humanities Councils, founded in 1977, is a non-profit organization that includes almost all of the 56 state and jurisdictional humanities councils as members. The Federation's mission is to advocate for increased investment in and engagement with this national network, and to support and amplify the work of its members. An example is the Oregon Council for the Humanities (Oregon Humanities), a non-profit corporation created in 1971 to distribute NEH funds for public humanities projects throughout Oregon.\n\nExecutive Order 14158, signed on January 20, 2025, by President Trump, created the \"United States DOGE Service\" (DOGE) as part of the Executive Office of the President. Following the order, the chair of the NEH was directed to resign in March 2025, and the NEH was allegedly instructed to review grants issued since 2021 for potential violations of new executive orders. This review allegedly resulted in the termination of nearly all grants to state and jurisdictional councils in March and April 2025, halting their operations and prompting the filing of this lawsuit.\n\nOn May 15, 2025, the Oregon Council for the Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against DOGE and its Acting Administrator, the NEH and its Acting Chairman, and the National Council on the Humanities. They argued that the termination of the grants violated the National Council on the Humanities' grant statute, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Separation of Powers, and exceeded DOGE's legal authority. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought an order directing the NEH to follow proper procedures for grant applications and funding, to continue providing funds appropriated by Congress to the Federation's members, and to set aside the unlawful termination of grants. The case was assigned to Judge Michael Howard Simon.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that DOGE illegally “gutted the NEH and terminated almost all grants issued to the state and jurisdictional councils” without reasoned analysis or proper notice and opportunity to appeal as required by law. They argued that these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Separation of Powers, as Congress, not the President, has the power to create agencies and direct how federal funds are spent. The plaintiffs claimed that the NEH could not refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress and that the delays and grant terminations caused “irreparable harm” to the Federation and its members, including councils terminating staff, canceling events, and risking permanent closure due to the loss of millions of dollars in already-awarded funding.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 11, 2025, underscoring the central role of federal grants in their work and including a table of congressional appropriations through 2024 to demonstrate Congress’s ongoing support for the program. The amended complaint also added a new section addressing NEH’s purported “rescission” on June 2 of the 2025 grant terminations, contending that the rescission letters were largely boilerplate, lacked individualized analysis, and still resulted in significant funding cuts while maintaining the rescission of other types of grants. Finally, the amended complaint introduced a new claim for relief under the Impoundment Control Act and the Appropriations Clause, asserting that the grant terminations were ultra vires.\n\nOn June 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that they were likely to succeed on the merits. They also claimed that they would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction, citing the need for councils to terminate staff, cancel events, and face potential permanent closure. They also argued that the balance of equities and public interest favored the injunction, as it would prevent unlawful agency action and protect the humanities.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, the states of Oregon, Maryland, Washington, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Vermont, and the District of Columbia filed a brief supporting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, citing unlawful termination of NEH grants to their humanities councils. The brief emphasized the cultural and legal interests at stake, the councils’ close ties to state governments, and argued the court had jurisdiction because the claims rested on statutory and constitutional grounds, not contract law, making the Tucker Act inapplicable. It supported the plaintiffs’ showing of likely success, irreparable harm, and a public interest in preserving funding, noting specific harms such as program pauses and potential cancellation of the nation’s 250th anniversary celebrations.\n\nOn August 6, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, specifically citing violations of the Separation of Powers doctrine, the Impoundment Control Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. 2025 WL 2237478. The court rejected the defendants' argument that they had the discretion to terminate grants, emphasizing that the Executive Branch cannot refuse to spend congressionally appropriated funds. Furthermore, the court agreed that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction and that the public interest favored the injunction to prevent unlawful agency action and to protect the humanities.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenges President Trump’s imposition of tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). On April 22, 2025, two educational toy manufacturers—Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc.—filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Trump and key federal government officials from various departments. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose import tariffs, and that doing so violates the constitutional principle of separation of powers.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Rudolph Contreras.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged multiple executive orders issued under IEEPA, which imposed tariffs on a wide range of imports, including products from China. They argued the President lacked statutory authority and that the implementing agencies violated the APA. On April 24, the defendants moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), arguing it had exclusive jurisdiction over tariff-related challenges. The plaintiffs opposed this transfer, arguing that IEEPA itself does not explicitly provide for tariffs, and thus the case belongs in federal district court under general federal question jurisdiction. Plaintiffs simultaneously moved for a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn May 29, 2025, Judge Contreras denied the motion to transfer and granted the preliminary injunction, ruling that IEEPA does not authorize the President to unilaterally impose tariffs.  2025 WL 1525376. The government appealed, and sought a stay pending that appeal from both the district court and the court of appeals. It also sought expedited briefing in the court of appeals.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, the district court granted the government’s motion to further stay the injunction pending resolution of the appeal. The government then withdrew its parallel request for a stay from the D.C. Circuit as moot.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari before judgment in the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking direct review of the constitutional question. The petition argued that the case presented an issue of exceptional national importance and requested expedited briefing. On June 20, the Court denied the request for expedited treatment but did not rule on the petition itself, giving the government until July 22 to file a response.\n\nMeanwhile, the D.C. Circuit granted the government’s motion to expedite the appeal on June 18. The government filed its opening brief on July 2, 2025, defending the President’s inherent authority to act in international economic matters during a national emergency. It argued that IEEPA’s broad language permitted the imposition of restrictions on imports, including tariffs, and that Congress had historically acquiesced to such uses. Plaintiffs filed their response on July 17, maintaining that tariffs were not “regulations” or “transactions” within IEEPA’s meaning and that tariff authority was exclusively reserved to Congress under Article I, Section 8. They also emphasized that the Supreme Court had narrowly construed IEEPA in past cases and that Trump’s actions marked an unprecedented expansion of executive power. A reply brief was scheduled for late July, with oral argument anticipated in fall 2025.\n\nAs of July 2025, both the D.C. Circuit appeal and the Supreme Court certiorari petition remained pending.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This is one of several class action challenges to the Trump Administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (\"AEA\") to circumvent removal procedures and deport Venezuelan nationals without due process. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 12, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), the Department of State, and the Denver Contract Detention Facility, the Colorado ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the ACLU of Colorado, and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, the petitioners challenged the Administration’s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was “under invasion” by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Charlotte Sweeney.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. On April 14, the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the District of Colorado while the case proceeded. The court also set a briefing schedule for the TRO motion and scheduled a hearing for April 21.\n\nJudge Sweeney issued another 14-day TRO following the April 21 hearing, prohibiting the respondents from removing petitioners and class members from the District of Colorado and requiring respondents to give petitioners and class members a 21-day notice if the government sought to detain them pursuant to the AEA. The order also directed petitioner to file any motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) within three days. The court also ordered respondents to respond to the motion for class certification by April 28, with petitioner's reply due by May 2.\n\nRespondents appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on April 23 (USCA case no. 25-1164). In the district court, respondents filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, which Judge Sweeney denied on April 24. The same day, the respondent-appellants also filed an emergency stay motion pending appeal in the Tenth Circuit, which ordered petitioner-appellee to respond by April 26, with any reply due by April 27. The Court of Appeals denied the emergency stay motion on April 29, finding that the government had not made the required irreparable-injury showing.\n\nThe petitioner filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) on April 25. The respondents filed their response five days later, and petitioner filed his response on May 2.\n\nBriefing on the class certification motion took place according to the court's schedule included in its order granting the TRO, concluding on May 2.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Sweeney certified a class of \"All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.\"\n\nJudge Sweeney examined closely each of the requirements for certifying a class, holding most importantly that the class members' risk of deportation under the Proclamation provided the required commonality. She rejected arguments that differences in other parts of class members' cases should prevent certification. She also certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2) finding that the proposed class was “sufficiently cohesive,” and that the injunctive relief the petitioners sought “would benefit them as well as all members of the proposed class in the same fashion.”\n\nJudge Sweeney also entered a preliminary injunction ordering the government not to detain, transfer, or remove petitioners and members of the certified class from the District of Colorado.\n\nJudge Sweeney found that petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits because a “invasion” under the AEA demands military action by a foreign nation government.  She held that the Proclamation fails to adequately find or assert TdA was a foreign nation or government. Judge Sweeney accepted the petitioners' allegations that they faced the risk of irreparable harm in part because of the detention conditions in El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).  In balancing the equities and public interest, Judge Sweeney found that the public interest in preventing wrongful removals—particularly where those removals exposed Petitioners and class members to harmful conditions—outweighed any harm to the government, partly because any such harm was mitigated by the government's availability to prosecute and remove noncitizens under Title 8,\n\nIn reaching this decision, Judge Sweeney rejected the government's argument that the petitioners lack standing because they were not at the time of the hearing designated as falling under the Proclamation. Judge Sweeney concluded “there is a  substantial risk that the harm of being subject to the Proclamation will arise—despite [Petitioners’] current designation as individuals who do not fall under it.”\n\nJudge Sweeney also rejected respondents' broad challenges to jurisdiction on the basis that the petition constituted an unconstitutional challenge to presidential power, the political question doctrine, and several other broad attacks on the court's jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 7, the government appealed the injunction and class certification to the U.S. Circuit Court for the Tenth Circuit (Case No. 25-1265).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case is one of numerous lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s abrupt termination of immigration visas—mostly student or work visas—with no notice to the visa-holders and with dubious or no legal basis. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 11, 2025, four international students holding F-1 visas filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Acting Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs claimed that the termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the terminations, restore their legal status, and prevent further irreparable harm. Judge Steven White presides over the case.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order. They argued that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious because the government failed to provide individualized notice, consider relevant facts, or justify its decisions, and improperly relied on visa revocation, which was not a permissible basis under agency regulations and guidance. Second, they asserted a due process violation, claiming a protected interest in their F-1 status and SEVIS records that was taken away without notice, explanation, or an opportunity to respond. Third, they alleged an equal protection violation, contending that the terminations unlawfully discriminated against Chinese students, who were disproportionately targeted without evidence of security threats or regulatory violations, and were treated differently from similarly situated students of other national origins.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order for 14 days. 2025 WL 1150697. During that period, the defendants were barred from arresting or incarcerating the four plaintiffs, transferring them outside the Northern District of California, or imposing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS status or the potential unlawful revocation of their visas. The court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Administrative Procedure Act claim, finding that the defendants had not demonstrated compliance with regulatory requirements for SEVIS termination and that visa revocation alone did not justify such action. The court emphasized that although three plaintiffs had been arrested, none had been convicted of a crime. The court further held that the plaintiffs faced a strong likelihood of irreparable harm because their studies and work were threatened and they risked immediate arrest and deportation. The  court declined to reach the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, finding the APA claim sufficient to warrant relief, and limited the order to the four named plaintiffs rather than granting nationwide relief.\n\nThe court later extended the temporary restraining order until May 15, 2025.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction and expanded the earlier TROs into a nationwide injunction. 2025 WL 1467543. The court held that termination of a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status, rejecting the defendants’ argument that it served only as a “red flag.” The court pointed to DHS’s own materials and guidance from SEVP-approved institutions showing that terminated records invalidated both student status and work authorization. The order barred the government from arresting, detaining, or transferring the plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals outside their jurisdictions of residence, from imposing legal consequences based on terminated SEVIS records, and from reversing reinstated records of those maintaining status.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 29, 2025, the plaintiffs added three new plaintiffs to the lawsuit and named the Director of the U.S. Department of State Visa Services Office, as a new defendant. The amended filing expanded the claims to directly challenge the Department of State’s role in the SEVIS terminations by targeting the underlying visa revocations. The plaintiffs also sought new relief, asking the court to order the Secretary of State to restore their revoked F-1 visas as well as those of similarly situated individuals.\n\nOn July 30, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for an amended preliminary injunction that shifted the focus of the case to the Department of State’s role in visa revocations. They argued that the Department unlawfully relied on 8 U.S.C. § 1201(i) to revoke thousands of F-1 visas, contending that the statute was intended only for visas of individuals who had not yet entered the United States. Although the court’s earlier injunction restored SEVIS status, the plaintiffs emphasized that the revoked visas continued to cause harm by preventing international travel and risking re-entry denial. The motion included new declarations from three recently added plaintiffs describing these harms. The plaintiffs requested that the injunction be expanded to block any legal effect from the visa revocations and to require restoration of the revoked visas.\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the defendants moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. They argued that they were likely to succeed on appeal because the injunction was flawed, particularly in its nationwide scope, which they claimed conflicted with the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc. They further contended that the plaintiffs had not shown irreparable harm since ICE had already reinstated their SEVIS records, and that the injunction was vague and overbroad by restricting arrests and transfers for any reason, including unrelated criminal violations. Finally, they asserted that a stay served the public interest by preserving law enforcement authority and protecting public safety. The defendants asked the court to stay three parts of the injunction: its nationwide scope, the prohibition on arresting or transferring the plaintiffs for reasons beyond SEVIS terminations, and the restriction on terminating SEVIS records for reasons unrelated to the Student Criminal Alien Initiative.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "Executive Order 14251, issued by President Trump on March 27, 2025, revoked collective bargaining rights for the majority of federal workers under the pretext of “national security.” The same day, the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum to the heads of departments and agencies providing guidance on implementing the Executive Order, including specific determinations of which agencies and subdivisions were to be excluded from the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), also known as Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. This case challenges Executive Order 14251.\n\nOn March 31, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), a labor union representing federal government employees, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. NTEU sued President Trump and several other federal officials in their official capacities, claiming violations of the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief as well as injunctive relief to prohibit the defendants from implementing the Executive Order and the OPM Guidance. The case was assigned to District Judge Paul L. Friedman.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the Executive Order’s claim that the excluded agencies primarily performed intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security functions, making collective bargaining incompatible with national security, was unfounded because those agencies’ core functions did not involve such work. The plaintiffs emphasized that many of these agencies had engaged in collective bargaining for decades without harming national security and asserted that the Executive Order exceeded the President’s authority and undermined Congress’s intent in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to strengthen collective bargaining through a framework beyond presidential control. The plaintiffs also claimed that the true purpose of the Executive Order was to make federal employees easier to dismiss and to retaliate against federal sector unions for opposing the Trump administration’s policies and engaging in protected First Amendment activities such as filing lawsuits.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, arguing that without emergency relief, they would suffer irreparable harm, including the imminent loss of more than half of their revenue stream and a substantial reduction in their bargaining power.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, Judge Friedman granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining operation of the Executive Order. 2025 WL 1218044. The court concluded that the President had relied on an overly broad interpretation of “primary function” and “national security work,” citing Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536 (1956), to emphasize that such a reading risked allowing the exception to swallow the rule. The court also determined that NTEU would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction, noting that the Executive Order threatened to significantly reduce the union’s bargaining power and diminish its ability to advocate for employees, while causing severe financial harm from the loss of dues, estimated at half its annual revenue. The court rejected the government’s argument that the harm was speculative, observing that agencies had already begun to disregard collective bargaining agreements.\n\nOn April 30, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit. Subsequently, they moved to stay the preliinary injunction pending appeal in the district court and the D.C. Circuit. The defendants argued that they were likely to succeed because the district court lacked jurisdiction, as the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) was the proper forum to review NTEU’s claims, and because the court had erred in finding the Executive Order ultra vires. They contended that the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute granted the President discretion to make national security exclusions, which were not subject to judicial review.\n\nThe defendants further asserted that without a stay, the injunction would impede their ability to redirect employees to mission-critical work and irreparably undermine the President’s authority. They maintained that the public interest favored a stay, framing the injunction as an extraordinary intrusion into presidential authority. Finally, they claimed that the NTEU would not be harmed because any alleged injuries were speculative or remediable, noting that agencies had been advised not to terminate collective bargaining agreements and that any lost dues could later be recovered through the FLRA.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, the district court denied the defendants’ motion for a stay. On May 6, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted the defendants’ motion for a stay, concluding that NTEU had not demonstrated irreparable harm and that its claims of lost bargaining power, reputational injury, and financial losses were speculative or remediable. 2025 WL 1441563. The court also held that the injunction itself caused irreparable harm to the President by limiting his national-security authority. Circuit Judge Childs dissented, arguing that the government had not justified a stay, noting that its claims of harm were vague and undercut by its own directive to pause the Executive Order, and that maintaining the status quo could not cause irreparable injury.\n\nOn May 23, 2025, the plaintiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc, arguing that the decision would \"kill federal-sector unions,\" the very harm the district court sought to prevent with the injunction. The plaintiffs argued that the majority ignored the district court's findings that federal agencies were in the process of implementing the Executive Order when it found that the plaintiffs would not be irreparably harmed, and did not require the government to show that it would suffer irreparable harm by leaving the injunction in place, instead allowing it to simply \"invoke the words 'national security.'\" On July 16, the D.C. Circuit denied rehearing en banc.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Executive Order should be permanently enjoined. On June 23, 2025, the defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the federal government’s alleged sudden shift in immigration policy, threatening to subject thousands of legally paroled immigrants, including families fleeing violence and persecution, to fast-track deportation without basic due process. On March 24, 2025, three immigrant advocacy organizations, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), UndocuBlack Network, and CASA, Inc., filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs named President Donald Trump, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the agency heads of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) as defendants. Plaintiffs challenged various policies under the Trump administration of expanding expedited removal of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who entered the country legally through humanitarian parole processes. Represented by nonprofit counsel, Plaintiffs alleged that these policies violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Fifth Amendment guarantee to due process. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the administration from unlawfully applying expedited removal procedures to individuals who had previously been granted lawful entry into the United States under humanitarian parole programs. This case was assigned to District Judge Jia M. Cobb.\n\nPlaintiffs argued that the government’s actions violated statutory limits on expedited removal by targeting noncitizens who had been lawfully paroled into the United States—individuals whom the INA expressly excludes from expedited removal. Plaintiffs also claimed the policy was arbitrary and capricious under the APA and deprived their members of constitutional due process protections. Plaintiffs requested a preliminary and permanent injunction against the enforcement of the new policies, as well as vacatur of agency memoranda and orders, and attorneys’ fees.\n\nThe events giving rise to the lawsuit began shortly after President Trump returned to office in January 2025. On January 20, he issued Executive Order 14165, “Securing Our Borders,” directing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to terminate categorical humanitarian parole programs, such as those for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) and for Afghan and Ukrainian evacuees. In the days following the order, Acting DHS Secretary Benjamine C. Huffman issued several internal memoranda to ICE, USCIS, and U.S. Customs & Border Patrol implementing a drastic reinterpretation of the INA’s parole authority and expanding the scope of expedited removal. On January 21, Huffman issued a Federal Register notice (90 Fed. Reg. 8139) that expanded expedited removal nationwide to noncitizens unable to prove two years of continuous presence. On January 23, Huffman instructed personnel to consider using expedited removal against any eligible noncitizen, even those already paroled and residing in the U.S. On February 18, ICE issued a further directive, leaked to the press, stating that there was “no time limit” on applying expedited removal to “paroled arriving aliens,” a stance in direct contradiction with previous federal guidance limiting expedited removal to recent entrants without lawful status.\n\nOn March 21, DHS posted a notice for publication in the Federal Register that officially terminated the CHNV parole processes and declared that all CHNV parolees would lose their status en masse after 30 days. The notice acknowledged that many parolees would no longer be eligible for expedited removal after reaching two years of continuous presence, and thus justified the early termination as a means to enable their rapid deportation. This notice conflicted with the earlier February directive, sowing confusion about the applicable rules and timelines. Plaintiffs’ complaint emphasized the harm to their members, many of whom had entered through legal pathways like CBP One or were sponsored under parole programs and had applied for work permits, Temporary Protected Status (\"TPS\"), or asylum. The organizations detailed several members’ stories, including an Afghan man fearing execution if returned, a Haitian mother trying to care for her sick son, and families from Venezuela and Guatemala escaping political violence and persecution. All faced an imminent risk of sudden removal without a hearing.\n\nThe lawsuit asserted three main legal claims: (1) the unlawful application of expedited removal to paroled individuals under the INA; (2) violations of the APA for arbitrary and inconsistent agency action; and (3) deprivation of constitutional due process under the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs requested that the court declare the challenged policies unlawful, vacate them, enjoin their enforcement, and award attorneys’ fees.\n\nOn May 30, 2025, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On June 11, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting two additional claims: (1) violation of the APA under the Accardi doctrine and (2) violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act; APA 5 U.S.C. §706(2); and 8 U.S.C. §1252(e)(3). That same day, Plaintiffs filed a motion to stay the effective dates of the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, February 18 ICE Directive, and March 25 CHNV Parole Termination Notice, to the extent they subject paroled individuals to expedited removal.\n\nOn June 12, the court denied Defendants' motion to dismiss as moot in light of Plaintiffs' amended complaint, and on June 17, the court set a briefing schedule on the pending motion to stay the effective dates.\n\nOn August 1, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion to stay agency action, enjoining the enforcement of the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, the February 18 ICE Directive, and the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice to the extent that these actions subject paroled individuals to expedited removal. The Court held that neither jurisdictional nor other procedural bars preclude the requested relief, and further found that the challenged actions exceed the statutory authority of DHS and are arbitrary and capricious.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the second Trump administration’s firings of two civil servants from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB). (To see the Clearinghouse's collection of civil-service-related legal challenges to actions by the second Trump administration, click here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38759&issue_presidential_gubernatorial_authority=38822&ordering=-summary_approved_date].)\n\nTrump nominated both plaintiffs to the PCLOB in 2018 during his first term as president, and the Senate confirmed their membership. On January 21, 2025, the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel sent the plaintiffs emails informing them that they must resign within two days or be terminated. Neither plaintiff resigned, and therefore, both were terminated.\n\nOn February 24, 2025, the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against the defendants—PCLOB and its Executive Director and Board Member, the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel, and President Trump—in United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), claiming that the defendants’ removal of the plaintiffs without cause and on the basis of their political affiliation violated the APA and constitutional Due Process, and exceeded the defendants’ authority. The plaintiffs additionally claimed that they were entitled to a writ of mandamus under 28 U.S.C. § 1361. Their complaint alleged that:\n\n[T]he sole purpose and sole result of the terminations will be to deny the Board a quorum, prevent Congress and the public from learning about how this Administration respects privacy and civil liberties, and starve Congress of the information it needs to legislate and to oversee the executive branch.\n\nRepresented by law firm Arnold & Porter, the plaintiffs sought the following: declaratory relief that the defendants lacked authority to remove the plaintiffs from the PCLOB based on their political affiliations and without good cause and that the removals of the plaintiffs were unlawful; enjoinment of the PCLOB and the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel from removing the plaintiffs from the Board; reinstatement of the plaintiffs to the PCLOB; backpay up to $10,000; a writ of mandamus requiring the PCLOB and the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel to treat the removals of the plaintiffs from the Board as legally ineffective and to stay out of the plaintiffs’ fulfillment of their positions; attorneys' fees and costs; and any other appropriate relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Reggie B. Walton on February 25, 2025. On March 12, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in which they no longer sought backpay.\n\nOn March 12, 2025, the parties filed a joint motion to expedite consideration of their cross-motions for summary judgment. The same day, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. The court granted the parties' motion for expedited consideration on March 13. On April 3, the defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment and opposition to the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, to which the plaintiffs filed an opposing response and a reply on April 16.\n\nOn May 21, Judge Walton granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied that of the defendants. The court held that the PCLOB was validly created as an independent body with implied tenure protections and that the removal of the plaintiffs violated the statute. The court ordered that both plaintiffs be restored to their positions and the PLCOB be ordered to treat them as though never removed. 2025 WL 1454010.\n\nThe defendants filed a motion to stay the district court's order on May 28, which Judge Walton denied on May 29. Meanwhile, the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on May 29, seeking a stay of the district court's decision pending appeal. The court of appeals instructed briefing on the stay to be completed by June 11.\n\nOn July 1, the Court of Appeals granted a stay pending appeal. In a per curiam order, the court found that the government had met its burden for a stay pending appeal. First, the court found that the government was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim. PCLOB members are principal officers of the United States, and generally, such officers \"must serve at the President's pleasure,\" unless the statute clearly limits the President's removal power. The statute here does not do so, and the statute does not support inferring in such a limitation. Second the court found that \"[i]njunctions that require the President to work with removed principal officers interfere with his constitutional power to supervise the Executive Branch\" and cause irreparable harm. Therefore, the court granted a stay pending the result of the government's appeal.\n\nOn July 18, the court of appeals denied rehearing en banc. Briefing on the appeal is still ongoing.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case, brought by current and former federal employees, challenges the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) access to sensitive data.\n\nOn February 11, 2025, current and former federal employees and unions acting on their behalf filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against DOGE and its Acting Administrator; the Director of the DOGE Temporary Service, Elon Musk; and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and its Secretary (collectively the \"OPM Defendants\"). Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants had willfully and intentionally permitted their sensitive and protected data to be accessed by DOGE-affiliated individuals outside of the U.S. government without legal justification and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Privacy Act.\n\nOn Count I, Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants violated the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b), by disclosing Plaintiffs’ and their members’ records to DOGE employees who had no need for the records without consent from Plaintiffs or their members. On Count II, Plaintiffs alleged Defendants violated the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(10), by failing to establish safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of the records they gave to DOGE. On Count III, Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants' actions were \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\" in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). On Count IV, Plaintiffs alleged that the OPM Defendants \"failed to engage in reasoned decision-making\" when they allowed DOGE to access records for purposes other than those allowed by the Privacy Act, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Last, on Count V, Plaintiffs alleged that DOGE had no authority to take any action other than to advise and assist the President; as such, its direction and control over OPM constituted ultra vires actions that violated federal laws.\n\nPlaintiffs sought (1) declaratory relief; (2) injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from permitting such access or obtaining such personal information or to make any use of the information already obtained; (3) the impoundment and destruction of all copies of individuals’ personal information that had been disclosed; and (4) attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Victor Marrero and Magistrate Judge Gary Stein. The case was reassigned to Judge Denise L. Cote shortly after.\n\nOn February 14, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order (TRO). Plaintiffs sought an order enjoining Defendants: (1) from disclosing to DOGE-affiliated agents any OPM records or access to such records, and from allowing DOGE agents to obtain personal information about individuals contained in the records; (2) to ensure future disclosure of individual records would occur only in accordance with federal law; (3) to impound and destroy all copies of the personal information unlawfully disclosed to DOGE; (4) to file a status report within 48 hours of the grant of the TRO indicating whether the records were destroyed and whether DOGE-affiliated agents continued to have access to the OPM records.\n\nThe following month, on March 14, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. Defendants argued that Plaintiffs failed to establish standing, as they failed to establish an injury-in-fact. Further, Defendants argued that Plaintiffs' claims were not reviewable under the APA, as they did not identify the requisite final agency action and they have an adequate remedy under the Privacy Act. Defendants also alleged that Plaintiffs did not plausibly allege a violation of the Privacy Act because they did not plausibly prove that the DOGE employees were not OPM employees.\n\nThe court ordered a protective motion on March 19 to govern the disclosure, use, and handling, of information contained in the administrative records to be produced by Defendants. The court sought to protect confidential information that may be produced as part of OPM’s administrative record.\n\nOn April 3, the court granted the motion to dismiss as to Counts I and II (the Privacy Act Counts). The court denied the motion to dismiss as to all other counts (the APA and ultra vires counts). On April 25, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, Judge Cote granted Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that OPM had disclosed private records to DOGE-affiliated individuals without legal justification or safeguards and in violation of both the APA and the Privacy Act. The court concluded that plaintiffs had standing and had shown a likelihood of success on their APA claims, irreparable harm, and that the public interest favored relief. The court held that OPM's actions represented unlawful disclosures to individuals who lacked a need to know and who were not properly vetted or trained. The court also found that the agency failed to establish proper safeguards, disregarding its own cybersecurity standards and practices. Although the ultra vires claim against DOGE Defendants was not sustained as an independent basis for relief, the APA violations alone justified the injunction.\n\nThe court granted injunctive relief prohibiting further disclosure of OPM records to DOGE-affiliated individuals, requiring destruction of unlawfully obtained records, and mandating a status report on remaining access. The court indicated it would address the scope of the injunction in a separate order.\n\nOn June 13, the court ordered the parties to meet and confer about the scope of the injunction and scheduled a follow-up telephone conference for June 20, 2025, to address implementation and compliance issues.\n\nThis case remains ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenges the Trump Administration's policy change slashing indirect cost reimbursements for projects funded by the National Institutes of Health. On February 10, 2025, the Association of American Universities (AAU), American Council on Education (ACE), Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU), and thirteen universities (listed at the end of this summary) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming that NIH violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, the Public Health Service Act, the Appropriations Clause, and Congressional appropriation restrictions when it cut funding for research institutions.\n\nThe dispute arose from an NIH policy issued on February 7, 2025, under Notice Number NOT-OD-25-068, “Supplemental Guidance to the 2024 NIH Grant Policy Statement: Indirect Cost Rates,” which capped indirect cost rates for NIH research grants at 15%.  Historically, indirect costs—covering essential research expenses such as laboratory maintenance, research compliance, and IT infrastructure—were negotiated individually between institutions and the federal government. The lawsuit contended that this policy shift would have catastrophic financial consequences for universities. Institutions like MIT, Johns Hopkins, the University of Chicago, and the University of California system—which receive billions in NIH funding—argued they would lose hundreds of millions in reimbursements annually. Smaller institutions warned that the change could force them to halt research programs entirely, eliminating jobs and cutting off funding for critical medical advancements.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that NIH’s unilateral decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it was contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, in excess of statutory authority due to its retroactive effect, and noncompliant with required procedures. They also argued the decision violated the Appropriations Clause, the Public Health Service Act, and long-standing congressional appropriations restrictions, which had explicitly prohibited NIH from modifying indirect cost structures since 2018. They sought a declaratory judgment invalidating the Guidance, as well as a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting the implementation or enforcement of the Guidance.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Angel Kelley, who also presided over two similar cases challenging the Rate Change Notice: Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. National Institutes of Health and Association of American Medical Colleges v. National Institutes of Health. On Feb. 10, the Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order, which Judge Angel Kelley denied as Moot on February 11 due to the TRO orders granted in the other cases having the same effect. The other TROs granted enjoined the Defendants from taking any steps to implement, apply, or enforce the Rate Change Notice until the Court issued a further order. After a hearing on February 21, 2025, the court extended the TRO pending a further ruling.\n\nThat ruling came on March 6, 2025, when Judge Kelly granted a preliminary injunction. Judge Kelly found that the policy change was illegal in multiple ways. First, Judge Kelly found that the Rate Change Notice violated the plain language of the regulations regarding the administration of indirect costs by failing to provide a \"documented justification\" for the change and by failing to comply with the step-by-step process mandated by the regulations. Second, Judge Kelly found that the Rate Change Notice violated the Section 224 Rider adopted by Congress in 2018. \"Congress intended the rider to prevent the Administration from implementing the proposed 10% cap as violative of the provisions of the [regulations].\" Third, the court found the Rate Change Notice was arbitrary and capricious under the APA, since its reasons were \"both conclusory and fail[ed] to grapple with the necessary factors, facts, and pertinent aspects of the problem demanded by the change from the existing ICR negotiation process.\" Finally, the court found that the notice failed to follow notice-and-comment rulemaking as required by the APA and was impermissibly retroactive. For these reasons, the court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the Rate Change Notice was unlawful.\n\nOn April 4, the defendants filed an assented-to motion to convert the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction and file a final judgment. They argued there were no additional facts or legal questions to consider. The Court granted the motion on the same day.\n\nOn April 8, the defendants filed a notice of appeal in the First Circuit.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "On February 3, 2025, federal employee unions brought this case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of the Treasury, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Represented by the Public Citizen Litigation Group and the State Democracy Defenders Fund, plaintiffs alleged that the Treasury's Bureau of Fiscal Service collected and maintained sensitive personal and financial information about millions of people--including names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, birth places, home addresses and telephone numbers, email addresses, and bank account information–which they then gave to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Plaintiffs brought three claims under the APA: 1) Defendants’ actions violated the Privacy Act and thus were contrary to law; 2) Defendants failed to engage in reasoned decision and thus their actions were arbitrary and capricious; and 3) Defendants’ continuous action in permitting DOGE to access personal information exceeded their statutory authority.\n\nPlaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from permitting such access or obtaining such personal information; requiring future disclosure of individual records to occur only in accordance with the law; and requiring protection of individuals whose personal information was contained in the records of the defendants. The plaintiffs also sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 5, arguing that allowing the defendants to continue giving DOGE access to confidential information would cause the plaintiffs irreparable injury.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Collen Kollar-Kotelly, who held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion on February 5. After initial discussions, the parties agreed to convert the plaintiffs' request for a TRO into a request for a preliminary injunction, and the defendants agreed to maintain the status quo by not providing access to confidential records except to Department of the Treasury employees for the performance of their duties and two named DOGE employees, whose access would be \"read only.\" 2025 WL 410262.\n\nOn February 11, the court allowed the plaintiffs to file supplemental declarations from individual members of the unions to support their claim of associational standing. The court found that the plaintiffs had good cause to supplement their original petition, since the court had converted the plaintiffs' motion for a TRO into a motion for a preliminary injunction, and because the declarations would not unduly prejudice the defendants.\n\nOn February 24, the court held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. After the hearing, the court issued an order stating that, since it believed it had subject matter jurisdiction, the defendants were to produce the administrative record for the court by March 10.  After reviewing the entire record, the court denied preliminary relief on March 7. The court found that the plaintiffs had associational standing since individual union members had suffered concrete harm, and sovereign immunity did not bar the suit under § 702 of the APA.\n\nHowever, the court denied the preliminary injunction. In order to be entitled to a preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs must show an asserted injury \"both certain and great.\" The court found that the plaintiffs' asserted injury, allowing the DOGE team to access their information, was not irreparable, since the disclosure was to a small number of people \"obligated to keep the information confidential,\" so their asserted injury, while sufficient to support subject-matter jurisdiction, was insufficient to require a preliminary injunction. 770 F.Supp.3d 79.\n\nOn March 14, 2025, the court granted in part and denied in part the Plaintiffs' request for an order directing the defendants to supplement the administrative record. The court also granted in part the plaintiffs' motion to expedite discovery on March 20. 2025 WL 1114350. On April 1, in response to a joint motion from the parties, the court issued a protective order \"to govern the disclosure, use, and handling by the parties of certain information and items produced and received in discovery.\"\n\nOn April 11, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss or, alternatively, for summary judgment. The defendants renewed their argument that the plaintiffs lacked standing and also alleged that the plaintiffs failed to establish a final agency action as required for review under the APA. Furthermore, the defendants claimed that the plaintiffs could bring their claims under the remedial schemes of the Privacy Act and the Internal Revenue Code, foreclosing review under the APA, since the APA provides \"a vehicle for review only in circumstances where there is no other adequate remedy.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on April 25. The plaintiffs argued that they had standing, that they challenged only the discrete, final agency action \"taken to effectuate the mission of the DOGE Executive Order,\" and that only the APA would provide them with adequate relief, since neither the Privacy Act nor the Internal Revenue Code offer injunctive relief of the type that the plaintiffs sought. Finally, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants' actions were arbitrary and capricious and in excess of their statutory authority.\n\nAs of July 1, 2025, the court had not ruled on the motions for summary judgment.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

They challenged defendants' conditioning of Congressionally-appropriated grants—including funds meant to serve unhoused people and provide critical transit services—on Plaintiffs' compliance with executive orders pertaining to immigration, transgender rights, and diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.  The case was assigned to District Judge Babara Rothstein.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) preventing the government from imposing the challenged grant conditions; delaying, withholding, or canceling funds based on the challenged grant conditions, or requiring any kind of certification related to compliance with the challenged grant conditions. The court granted the requested TRO on May 7, setting it to last for 14 days, while preliminary injunction (PI) briefing proceeded.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding several cities, transportation agencies, and housing organizations as parties. They subsequently filed a second motion for a TRO and PI. On May 23, the court granted the TRO, effective through June 4, 2025.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, the court granted plaintiffs' first and second motions for a PI. Judge  Rothstein wrote that the balance of equities weighed in plaintiffs' favor as plaintiffs would otherwise be forced to choose between two untenable options, and as defendants were unable to convince the court that they would suffer material harm from the injunction. The court's order enjoined defendants from enforcing the challenged CoC grant conditions, withholding or delaying funds based on those conditions, requiring related certifications, or retaliating against plaintiffs for participating in the lawsuit.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, defendants filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenges a grant termination that allegedly threatens the independence of a professional association; it tests the limits of executive authority in awarding and withdrawing federal funds. On April 23, 2025, the American Bar Association (ABA) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The ABA alleged that the DOJ unlawfully terminated $3.2 million in grants that supported training for lawyers assisting victims of domestic and sexual violence. The DOJ revoked the funding on April 10, 2025, just one day after Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued a memorandum prohibiting DOJ attorneys from attending or participating in ABA-sponsored events. That memorandum accused the ABA of promoting “activist causes” that were allegedly inconsistent with the department’s mission. The ABA claimed that the DOJ’s action was retaliatory, in response to the ABA’s public criticism of the Trump administration, thereby violating the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper.\n\nRepresented by public interest attorneys at Democracy Forward, The ABA sought both declaratory and injunctive relief, requesting both an interim and permanent orders blocking the DOJ’s cancellation of the grants, reinstating the funding, and preventing the DOJ from taking similar actions in the future. The ABA emphasized that the loss of funding had already caused significant harm, including staff layoffs and reduced capacity to serve survivors of gender-based violence.\n\nOn May 2, 2025, the defendants moved to dismiss the case.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, he granted a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the DOJ from canceling the grants, stating that the ABA's First Amendment injury was \"concrete and ongoing.\" 2025 WL 1388891.\n\nOn July 17, 2025, the case was administratively closed and the defendant's motion to dismiss was stricken. The parties were directed to file another status report by October 1, 2027, unless earlier developments required a new filing.",

    "summary/long": "This class action challenges Department of Homeland Security (DHS) deportations of noncitizens to countries that are not their designated country of removal, without first providing an opportunity for the noncitizen to demonstrate fear of persecution, torture, and even death in the chosen third country.\n\nFour anonymous class plaintiffs, all noncitizens from Central America currently residing in Massachusetts, filed this lawsuit on March 23, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. They named the DHS and its Secretary, the U.S. Attorney General, and the Superintendent of Plymouth County Correctional Facility. They alleged that the Trump Administration's new third-country deportation practices violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the Fifth Amendment, and the Immigration and Nationality Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Brian E. Murphy.\n\nSimultaneously with their complaint, Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunctive relief, seeking to enjoin third-country removals unless the individual receives written notice of the third country and opportunity to present their fear-based claim, and to stay the re-detention directive. And they filed another simultaneous motion to certify class. Specifically, Plaintiffs moved to certify the following class:\n\n\"all individuals who have a final removal order issued in proceedings under Section 240, 241(a)(5), or 238(b) of the INA (including withholding-only proceedings) whom DHS has deported or will deport on or after February 18, 2025, to a country (a) not previously designated as the country or alternative country of removal, and (b) not identified in writing in the prior proceedings as a country to which the individual would be removed.\"\n\nAfter hearing oral argument, on March 28, the court granted the temporary restraining order covering noncitizens with a final order of removal. 2025 WL 942948. The order barred deportation of any such person to a third country (that is, a country other than the country designated in immigration proceedings), \"UNLESS and UNTIL Defendants provide that individual, and their respective immigration counsel, if any, with written notice of the third country to where they may be removed, and UNTIL Defendants provide a meaningful opportunity for that individual to submit an application for CAT [Convention Against Torture] protection to the immigration court, and if any such application is filed, UNTIL that individual receives a final agency decision on any such application.\" The order was set to remain in place until resolution of Plaintiffs' requested preliminary injunction.\n\nThe government immediately appealed to the Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit (docket no. 25-1311), and requested a stay; that court denied a stay on April 7, 2025, because of its concern that temporary restraining orders are not appealable. 2025 WL 1029774.\n\nIn the weeks following the TRO, the government admitted to deporting several noncitizens to third countries almost immediately after the court's ruling. On March 31—just two days after the TRO was issued—at least four Venezuelan men with final removal orders to Venezuela were removed to El Salvador with little or no warning. The government asserted that these removals were lawful because the Department of Defense, not DHS, conducted the flights from Guantanamo Bay, where the individuals had been transferred by DHS. The Justice Department argued that because the Defense Department was not a party to the case, it was not bound by Judge Murphy’s orders. Judge Murphy expressed skepticism of the government's position, questioning how the Defense Department would undertake such deportations independently or how DHS could have transferred detainees to Guantanamo without Defense Department coordination.\n\nBack in the district court, on April 18, 2025, Judge Murphy granted a preliminary injunction, requiring that all third-country removals be preceded by written notice to both the non-citizen and the non-citizens’ counsel in a language the non-citizen can understand as well as a meaningful opportunity for the non-citizen to raise a fear-based claim for CAT protection. 2025 WL 1142968. It also specified that the Department of Homeland Security may not evade the injunction by ceding control over non-citizens or the enforcement of its immigration responsibilities to any other agency, including but not limited to the Department of Defense.\n\nThe government filed another immediate appeal (docket no. 25-1393) and again requested a stay, which was denied May 26, 2025. 2025 WL 1495517.\n\nIn the district court, after widespread reports that the U.S. was looking to remove individuals to Libya and elsewhere, on May 7, Plaintiffs sought an emergency district court order preventing such removals, absent compliance with the preliminary injunction. Judge Murphy issued an order that same day:\n\nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that this motion should not be required, as the relief sought is already provided by the Preliminary Injunction entered in this case, Dkts. 64, 86.  Accordingly, the Court construes Plaintiffs’ motion as one for clarification. . . .  If there is any doubt—the Court sees none—the allegedly imminent removals, as reported by news agencies and as Plaintiffs seek to corroborate with class-member accounts and public information, would clearly violate this Court’s Order. 2025 WL 1323697.\n\nAttempted deportations to Libya followed shortly thereafter. Reports indicated that DHS planned to transfer noncitizens to Libya, a country known for widespread human rights abuses [https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/03/1135052] against migrants, including torture and enslavement as documented by the United Nations. This time, the government handed class members over to the Defense Department on the U.S. mainland (from the South Texas ICE Processing Center in San Antonio to Lackland Air Force Base) for planned deportations to Libya. Counsel for the affected individuals revealed that on May 5, their clients were informed via an English-only document that they would be removed to Libya–and were not told they had an opportunity to express fear of torture. They were transported by bus to Lackland but never boarded a plane; the trip was aborted, and the individuals were returned to the ICE facility several hours later.\n\nJudge Murphy quickly issued an order reiterating that any imminent removals to third countries without notice and opportunity to claim CAT protections would violate the court’s injunction. He also ordered briefing on whether the Defense Department should be joined as a party to the case. Meanwhile, it remained unclear whether the Trump administration had coordinated with any Libyan authority regarding these planned deportations, with Libyan officials denying any agreement.\n\nSubsequent litigation concerned three issues: (1) whether the Department of Defense should be joined as a defendant, (2) the situation of one plaintiff in particular, O.C.G., and (3) the government's plan to remove class members to South Sudan.\n\n(1) Department of Defense joinder issue: plaintiffs argued in favor of joinder; the government argued against.\n\nPlaintiffs moved to join the Department of Defense, arguing that DHS was using military resources and custody arrangements to effectuate unlawful removals and avoid compliance with court orders. The government opposed the motion. The court has not yet ruled on the joinder issue.\n\n(2) O.C.G.'s situation:\n\nThe government took the position that O.C.G. had told a DHS officer that he did not have any fear of removal to Mexico -- but after the court ordered discovery on the issue, the government (on May 15) cancelled a May 16 deposition, and filed a \"Notice of Errata\" that stated,\n\n“[u]pon further investigation, Defendants cannot identify any officer who asked O.C.G. whether he had a fear of return to Mexico. Nor can Defendants identify the officer who O.C.G. states ‘told [him] that he was being deported to Mexico.’” Dkt. 103 at 1.\n\nDefendants also filed other amended discovery responses, correcting prior misstatements.\n\nPlaintiffs then moved for emergency relief. They pointed out that given O.C.G.'s fear of persecution, his deportation to a third country without process violated the law, and that the Notice of Errata originally filed  (though subsequently redacted) included O.C.G.'s full name, augmenting his risk. They included a declaration from O.C.G., where he set out his acute fear of persecution after the mistaken deportation, and they sought immediate facilitation by the government of his return to the U.S.\n\nOn May 23, Judge Murphy agreed and granted a preliminary injunction with respect to O.C.G.'s situation. 2025 WL 1487238. The court found that Plaintiffs were likely to demonstrate that O.C.G.'s due process rights had been violated, and ordered the government to \"take all immediate steps, including coordinating with Plaintiffs’ counsel, to facilitate the return of O.C.G. to the United States.\" It directed defendants to file a status report within five days.\n\nOn May 28, the government said that ICE was \"currently working with ICE Air to bring O.C.G. back to the United States on an Air Charter Operations (ACO) flight return leg.\"   On June 4, news reports [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/guatemalan-deported-mexico-trump.html] said he'd arrived back in the U.S.\n\n(3) South Sudan:\n\nThe government soon attempted to remove class members to South Sudan, echoing the Libya incident. On May 20, 2025, class members were abruptly moved from immigration detention to a military base with little warning. Initially, ICE informed class member N.M. and his attorney that he would be removed to South Africa, then attempted to recall that message and later stated he would be removed to South Sudan—a country engulfed in civil war and subject to U.S. State Department travel warnings. Plaintiffs filed papers seeking an emergency order enjoining the government from effectuating the removal of N.M., T.T.P., and any other class member to South Sudan without first complying with the court’s preliminary injunction. The motion emphasized that removals to South Sudan could not proceed unless the affected individuals were given a meaningful opportunity to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Plaintiffs submitted evidence suggesting that a plane was en route to South Sudan with about a dozen class members aboard.\n\nJudge Murphy held an emergency hearing on May 20 and ordered defendants “to maintain custody and control of class members currently being removed to South Sudan or to any other third country, to ensure the practical feasibility of return if the Court finds that such removals were unlawful.” 2025 WL 1449032. The court set another hearing for the following day and directed defendants to bring the names of all affected class members, along with information on “(1) the time and manner of notice each individual received as to their third-country removal; and (2) what opportunity each individual had to raise a fear-based claim.”\n\nOn May 21, the court held that the removal process violated its injunction because class members were not given adequate time to assert CAT-based claims. 2025 WL 1453604. The court clarified its injunction, declaring that a “meaningful opportunity” to express a fear of removal required “a minimum of ten days.” As for the class members already en route—who were being held at a military base in Djibouti—the court ordered the government to retain custody and control over them and imposed a series of remedial measures. These included requirements that the government provide each detainee a reasonable fear interview “in private,” give at least 72 hours’ notice before the interview, and ensure access to resources “commensurate” with what would have been provided in the United States.\n\nOn May 27, the government requested the Supreme Court to stay the order immediately, arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction and erred on the merits. Plaintiffs filed their opposition on June 4.\n\nBack in the district court, the government submitted a June 2 status report stating that all eight class members remained in DHS custody in Djibouti and that DHS had established procedures allowing them to speak privately with counsel.\n\nIn the Supreme Court\n\nOn June 23, 2025, the Supreme Court granted the government’s emergency application to stay the preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1732103. The ruling–which was an order only, without any opinion–allows DHS to resume third-country removals while the First Circuit appeal proceeds. In dissent, Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, criticized the Court for enabling ongoing due process violations, calling the Court’s decision a “gross abuse” of equitable discretion.\n\nOn June 24, Judge Murphy stated that his May 21 remedial order—designed as a remedy for prior violations—remains fully in effect despite the Supreme Court’s action. Later that day, U.S. Solicitor General John C. Sauer filed a follow-up request asserting that the Supreme Court’s stay also “effectively stayed” Murphy’s May 21 order.  He urged the Court to clarify that the government could immediately resume third‑country removals from Djibouti, arguing that Judge Murphy’s actions reflected “defiance” of the Supreme Court’s authority. Counsel for the class members argued that the May 21 order remained valid because it addressed the government’s prior violation of the April 18 preliminary injunction.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, the Supreme Court issued a brief, unsigned opinion clarifying that its June 23 stay of the preliminary injunction also applied to Judge Murphy’s May 21 remedial order concerning the eight class members held in Djibouti. 2025 WL 1832186. The majority wrote that the May 21 order “cannot now be used to enforce an injunction that our stay rendered unenforceable.” Justice Kagan concurred in the judgment, stating that although she disagreed with the Court’s decision to grant the stay, the district court could not enforce an order that the Supreme Court had paused. Justice Sotomayor dissented, joined by Justice Jackson, expressing concern that the ruling would allow removals without the procedural protections required by the Convention Against Torture. The decision permits the government to proceed with third-country removals from Djibouti while appeals are ongoing.\n\nIn the District Court\n\nBack in the district court, on July 15, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for an indicative ruling, asking the court to state its intention to dissolve the April 18 preliminary injunction if the case were remanded by the First Circuit. Plaintiffs argued that although the Supreme Court’s stay had rendered the injunction effectively inoperative, it remained formally in place. They contended that the injunction no longer provided any active protection and should be formally dissolved once the case returned to the district court, allowing the litigation to proceed on the underlying legality of DHS’s actions rather than a now-suspended injunction.\n\nAt the same time, Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment, seeking to declare unlawful and set aside DHS’s practice of removing individuals to third countries. For Count I, alleging violations of statutory removal provisions, Plaintiffs argued that DHS violated 8 U.S.C. § 1231 by failing to prioritize removal to a noncitizen’s designated country or country of origin, instead pursuing third-country removals even when primary options were available. They claimed this practice occurred without proper notice or meaningful opportunity to seek protection from persecution or torture, violating both U.S. law and Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture.\n\nFor Count III, alleging Fifth Amendment due process violations, Plaintiffs contended that DHS failed to provide adequate notice of third-country removals, denying individuals the chance to consult counsel, research country conditions, and present fear-based claims before an Immigration Judge.\n\nFinally, on Count IV, brought under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Plaintiffs sought declarations affirming class members’ rights and invalidating DHS’s third-country removal practices. They requested specific declarations requiring DHS to prioritize removal to designated countries and recognize individuals’ rights to meaningful notice and an opportunity to raise protection claims before any third-country removal.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the defendants moved to stay proceedings pending appeal of the April 18 preliminary injunction. They argued that a stay was required by the Supreme Court’s decision in Coinbase, Inc. v. Bielski, 599 U.S. 736 (2023), because their appeal raised issues about the court’s subject-matter jurisdiction. They also argued for a discretionary stay, asserting that an appellate decision would help streamline the legal issues and promote the “orderly course of justice.”The motion stated that a stay would not cause hardship to the plaintiffs because the Supreme Court had already determined the interim status quo. Additionally, the defendants sought a stay on all compliance discovery, arguing that any civil contempt order would be invalid if the preliminary injunction were ultimately overturned on appeal. As an alternative to a full stay, the defendants sought a 21-day extension to respond to the plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment to allow additional time to prepare.\n\nLitigation over the legality of third-country removals remains ongoing in the district court and the First Circuit, although the Supreme Court’s July 3 order permits such removals to proceed while appeals are pending.",

    "summary/long": "This putative class action lawsuit, filed on February 28, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, challenges the steps the Trump administration has taken to close off various paths into the United States for immigrants. Those paths included \"Uniting for Ukraine\" (U4U) for Ukrainians displaced by the war with Russia; special processes for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) responding to the natural disasters and/or political strife in those countries; and \"Operation Allies Welcome\" (OAW) for Afghans fleeing the Taliban. The case was assigned to District Judge Indira Talwani.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to address the government's attacks on additional immigration programs and to add additional plaintiffs. The additional programs include \"Family Reunification Parole (FRP), for nationals of Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras with approved family-based immigrant visa petitions; \"Military Parole in Place\" (MPIP), which allows U.S. military service-members to seek parole for their parents, children, and spouses; and the \"Central American Minors\" (CAM) parole process, which provides a pathway for children from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to reunite with their parents in the United States.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought to represent two subclasses: the \"Sponsor Subclass\" includes all individuals with pending applications to sponsor a beneficiary for any humanitarian parole process, and the \"Immigration Benefits Subclass\" includes all individuals who have received humanitarian parole through humanitarian parole processes, including CHNV, U4U, FRP, OAW, MPAP, and CAM. They alleged that the government's actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. They sought a declaration that the humanitarian parole processes are lawful, an injunction prohibiting the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from continuing to close the availability of parole, and vacatur of the recent agency actions to the contrary.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a preliminary injunction and a stay of the defendants' termination of humanitarian parole processes and moratorium on adjudicating any application for an immigration benefit that would permit the parolees to extend their lawful presence in the U.S. The motion was subsequently supported by an amicus brief filed by New York, 14 other states, and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for class certification on March 21, 2025, and the defendants filed a memorandum opposing class certification on April 4, 2025.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, adding more individual plaintiffs. They subsequently filed a motion for a supplementary preliminary injunction and stay of defendants' termination of humanitarian parole processes for foreign nationals to gain entry to the United States.\n\nOn April 13, the plaintiffs notified the court that DHS continued to send the “Notice of Termination of Parole” message en masse to an unknown number of parolees, and non-parolees (including native-born U.S. citizens, noncitizens with green cards, and others). The plaintiffs' notice to the court also included information that on Friday, April 11, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs stated that Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem had “determined that Afghanistan no longer continues to meet the statutory requirements for its TPS5 designation and so she terminated TPS for Afghanistan.” TPS for Afghans was expected to end on May 20.\n\nOn April 14, Judge Talwani granted the plaintiffs' March 27 emergency motion for relief. First, the court paused the government’s termination of parole processes for CHNV pending further court order; this pause applied specifically to people who had already been granted parole under the CHNV programs and were still within their original parole period. Second, the court paused, pending further court order, all individualized notices to noncitizens from CHNV that informed that their parole is being revoked without case-by-case review. Judge Talwani based her decision primarily on the total absence of individualized due process in the government's actions. She reasoned that \"the early termination, without any case-by-case justification, of legal status for noncitizens who have complied with DHS programs and entered the country lawfully undermines the rule of law.\" Judge Talwani rejected government arguments challenging jurisdiction based on political question doctrine and related arguments.\n\nJudge Talwani also granted class certification on April 14, 2025. She described the class as follows:\n\n\"All individuals who have received a grant of parole that is subject to the Termination of Parole Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, 90 Fed. Reg. 13611 (Mar. 25, 2025), rescinding individual grants of parole on a categorical and en masse basis, except: (1) those individuals who voluntarily left, and remain outside, the United States prior to the issuance of that Notice; and (2) those individuals who choose to opt out of the class in order to seek relief in separate litigation.\"\n\nOn April 18, the government filed an appeal to the First Circuit, seeking review of the district court's substantive and class certification orders. After the First Circuit denied to stay the orders, the government filed a stay application in the U.S. Supreme Court. On May 5, the First Circuit again denied the government's emergency motion to stay Judge Talwani's April 14 orders. Expedited briefing is ongoing in the First Circuit with oral arguments scheduled for July 29.\n\nOn May 28, back in the district court, Judge Talwani granted in part plaintiffs' March 17 emergency motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of administrative action. The court granted class-wide preliminary relief to plaintiffs paroled into the U.S. under categorical parole programs and to those supporting individuals present under the MPIP program. They enjoined:\n\n• The suspension of re-parole adjudications for Parole Program recipients;   • The suspension of initial MPIP parole adjudications; and   • The suspension of immigration benefits adjudications for Parole Program recipients.\n\nThat same day, Judge Talwani issued an amended order granting class certification, certifying a class of all individuals who:\n\n• Received parole subject to the mass rescission in 90 Fed. Reg. 13611;     • Received humanitarian parole under programs allowing re-parole and have pending re-parole applications;     • Have pending applications for other immigration benefits after receiving such parole; or     • Have pending applications to support family under MPIP.\n\nOn May 30, in the Supreme Court, a majority of the justices granted defendants' requested stay, over the noted dissent of Justice Jackson joined by Justice Sotomayor.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court held:\n\n\"The April 15, 2025 order entered by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, case No. 1:25-cv-10495, is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari, if such a writ is timely sought. Should certiorari be denied, this stay shall terminate automatically. In the event certiorari is granted, the stay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court.\"\n\nJustice Jackson's dissent noted the significant human cost in lifting the stay and the comparatively minor harm shown in the government's filings.  She found the government's harm-related showing to be \"patently insufficient.\"\n\nThat same day, following the Supreme Court's order, defendants filed a motion to dismiss in the district court, arguing that the Supreme Court's stay permitting the Secretary's termination of CHNV parole grants to proceed pending appeal warranted dismissal of the complaint.\n\nOn June 16, in the district court, plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment challenging the mass truncation of CHNV parole grants.\n\nOn June 24, Judge Indira Talwani ordered the government to inform the court of the steps they had taken to resume adjudicating requests for immigration benefits for the class certified in this case.  Judge Talwani reviewed the repeated efforts during May and June to obtain information from the government about the website virtual agent and other form communications regarding any ongoing suspension or resumption of adjudications.  Judge Talwani then ordered that \"Defendants shall confirm that the guidance for USCIS adjudicative directorates is complete and has been implemented, and shall confirm that Defendants have completed all other implementation efforts necessary for processing holds to be lifted and for all applicants to be properly informed of the same.\" Judge Talwani reviewed the proceedings and updated her order on June 30,\n\nOn July 1, the government provided the required documentation on the steps taken.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the Trump administration’s 2025 Title VI enforcement policies restricting race-related programming and speech in public education. On February 25, 2025, represented by Democracy Forward Foundation, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), American Sociological Association (ASA), AFT–Maryland, and Eugene School District 4J filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against the U.S. Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon, and Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the Department’s February 14, 2025 “Dear Colleague Letter” (DCL), its February 28 FAQ, and an April 3 “Certification” violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the First and Fifth Amendments, and the Department of Education Organization Act. The challenged document, issued in response to the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard Coll., reinterpreted Title VI to prohibit many forms of race-conscious educational activity, mandated new compliance certifications from states and school districts, and directed the removal of prior DEI-related guidance. Plaintiffs argued that the policies chilled lawful speech, threatened federal funding, and had been adopted without rulemaking or statutory authority.\n\nOn March 28 and April 9, the plaintiffs filed motions for a preliminary injunction (PI) and for a stay under APA § 705. They sought to block enforcement of the DCL and Certification, invalidate any signed certifications, and require the Department to reinstate prior guidance. The Department opposed both motions, arguing the documents were nonbinding interpretive guidance and that plaintiffs lacked standing. The court heard argument on April 18.\n\nOn April 24, Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher granted a partial stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705, holding that the February 14 DCL was likely a final agency action adopted without required notice and comment, and that it exceeded statutory authority by regulating curriculum and potentially chilled protected speech. The court stayed the DCL pending final resolution but denied broader relief. It declined to strike the Certification, finding it was not itself final agency action, and rejected demands to reinstate prior DEI guidance or remove the Department’s complaint portal. The court also ruled that only Eugene School District 4J had plausibly alleged standing.\n\nOn June 5, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment (SJ) and sought a permanent, nationwide injunction. On July 1, the government moved to dismiss or for summary judgment, arguing again that plaintiffs lacked standing and that the challenged materials were lawful, nonbinding interpretive rules. Citing the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc. (June 27, 2025), the government also argued that any relief must be limited to parties with standing and could not extend nationwide.\n\nOn August 2, 2025, the government filed its reply brief in support of its dispositive motion. It argued that:\n\n-The plaintiffs still lacked standing, as District 4J was not a direct recipient of federal funds and the state of Oregon had refused to comply with the Certification.\n\n-The DCL and Certification were nonbinding interpretive rules, not final agency actions, and thus not subject to APA challenge.\n\n-The Department had acted within its statutory authority and consistent with Title VI, DEOA, and SFFA, merely clarifying existing obligations.\n\n-The DCL was not vague or viewpoint-discriminatory, and concerns about chilled speech were speculative and attributable to third-party institutions, not federal coercion.\n\n-The government also objected to plaintiffs’ proposed order, which sought sweeping declaratory and injunctive relief affecting all education agencies and federal civil rights enforcers. It contended that such relief would violate Article III limits and separation-of-powers principles.\n\nOn August 14, 2025, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and, construing the defendant's July 1 filing as a motion for summary judgment, granting it in part and denying it in part.\n\nIt held as follows:\n\n• That every plaintiff had standing for every claim and as to each challenged document;   • That both the Letter and the Certification Requirement were final agency actions subject to judicial review;    • That the government failed to follow required notice-and-comment procedures as to both the Letter and the Certification requirement, in violation of the APA;   • That the Certification Requirement failed to comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act, and was therefore procedurally defective and arbitrary and capricious;    • That both the Letter and the Certification Requirement were arbitrary and capricious under the APA because they were issued without consideration or explanation of changes in position, and because they failed to account for facts, law, baseline conditions, or reliance interests;    • That the Letter exceeded the authority delegated by Congress to the Department of Education because it exercised control over content of curriculum;   • That the Letter’s provisions proscribing specific forms of classroom speech violated the First Amendment by regulating speech based on its content;   • That the Certification did not violate the First Amendment because it was too vague to suppress speech at all, much less speech based on viewpoint or content, and it was not facially overbroad because it did not unambiguously punish protected speech; • That the Letter and the Certification Requirement wer unconstitutionally vague because they did not provide sufficient clarity on which DEI practices were impermissible and it was therefore impossible to determine what conduct would trigger the prohibitions and potentially severe sanctions, enabling arbitrary enforcement and chilling lawful and societally beneficial speech.\n\nAccordingly, the court held the Letter and Certification Requirement unlawful and set them aside under 5 U.S.C. § 706. It granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to Counts One (Letter - First Amendment), Two (Letter - Fifth Amendment), Three (Letter - APA), Five (Certification - Fifth Amendment), and Six (Certification - APA), and denied as to Count Four (Certification - First Amendment), as to which it granted the government's motion for summary judgment.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged Elon Musk’s role in the Trump Administration as well as the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (“DOGE”). On February 13, 2025, twenty-six current and former employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the District of Maryland against DOGE and U.S. DOGE Services, seeking relief under Ex Parte Young. Represented by the State Democracy Defenders Fund and private counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the broad scope of authority asserted by Musk and DOGE, including laying off thousands of government workers, slashing agency funding, and accessing highly sensitive government data and payment systems, violated the Appointments Clause and Separation of Powers because Musk was never confirmed by the Senate. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to Judge Theodore D. Chuang.\n\nOn February 18, the plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction. The defendants filed their opposition to the motion on February 24, and the plaintiffs filed their reply to the defendants' opposition on February 26. A hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was held on February 28.\n\nOn March 18, the court issued a preliminary injunction requiring the defendants to reinstate electronic systems access to USAID employees and contractors and prohibiting them from taking any further action to shut down USAID or disclosing employees' personal information to anyone outside USAID. Judge Chuang ordered the defendants to submit an agreement among the parties within 14 days ensuring that USAID could reoccupy its headquarters.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Fourth Circuit on March 21, 2025. They first sought an emergency stay of the preliminary injunction while the appeal was pending. The plaintiffs filed their opposition to a stay on March 24. On March 25, the Fourth Circuit issued a stay until the end of the day on March 27, 2025. On March 28, the Fourth Circuit issued a stay of the preliminary injunction pending the resolution of the appeal by that court.\n\nOn April 17 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding a number of defendants including President Trump, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit issued a briefing schedule on April 18, ordering defendant-appellants to file their opening brief and appendix by June 13. The plaintiff-appellees' response brief was due July 14.\n\nA case management conference was held in the district court on April 22, where the parties discussed the plaintiffs' notice of intent to file a motion for class certification and the defendants' notice of intent to file a motion to dismiss. Following the conference, the court granted both parties leave to file their respective motions. The plaintiffs filed a motion for discovery on April 25.\n\nOn May 1, in the district court, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim and that the court lacked jurisdiction. On the same day, the plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification. They sought to represent a class of \"all persons who, between January 20, 2025 through the present, worked at any time as employees of USAID, including as personal services contractors.\"\n\nOn May 27, 2025, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery without prejudice, citing multiple factors weighing against the request, including the pendency of defendants' motion to dismiss. The court further ordered plaintiffs to file a second amended complaint specifically identifying which named plaintiffs were employees of USAID and which were personal services contractors, without making any other changes to the pleading. Plaintiffs submitted the amended complaint three days later.\n\nAlso on May 27, in the Court of Appeals, defendant-appellants moved to hold the appeal in abeyance pending resolution of their motion to dismiss. The court granted their request on June 9, placing the appeal in abeyance pending the district court's decision.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the Trump Administration's authority to suspend nearly all congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance funding and dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). On February 10, 2025, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Journalism Development Network filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, the U.S. State Department of State, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and USAID. Plaintiffs sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Ex Parte Young. Represented by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, Plaintiffs alleged that a January 20, 2025, Executive Order calling for the suspension of foreign aid funding and subsequent implementation guidance from the State Department, USAID, and OMB terminating existing foreign aid obligations violated the Administrative Procedure Act, Take Care Clause, and Separation of Powers. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorney’s fees. The case was assigned to Judge Amir H. Ali.\n\nOn February 11, Judge Ali related this case to Global Health Council v. Trump [../../../../case/46098/], which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that same day.\n\nOn February 12, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), and Judge Ali held a telephonic hearing. The court issued the TRO the following day, prohibiting the State Department, USAID, and OMB from pausing disbursement of congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance funds on contracts that were in place as of January 19, 2025. Judge Ali denied Plaintiffs' additional requests to enjoin Defendants from making individual personnel decisions or terminating individual contracts.\n\nThe Court ordered Defendants to submit a status report detailing their compliance with the order by February 18, 2025. The day after the status report was filed, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion arguing that Defendants should be found in contempt because their status report and other evidence demonstrated that they had not followed the TRO. The Court partially granted Plaintiffs' motion on February 20, finding that Defendants had not substantially complied with the terms of the TRO but declining to hold Defendants in contempt.\n\nOn February 21, Defendants asked the court to clarify or stay the TRO, arguing that the TRO as written purported to prohibit Defendants from relying on existing statutory and contractual authorities to review, suspend, and terminate existing foreign assistance grants. Such an order, Defendants argued, would implicate constitutional concerns warranting a stay pending emergency appellate relief. Judge Ali rejected the request for a stay the next day, on February 22.  On February 25, at a status conference, Plaintiffs made an emergency oral motion to enforce the TRO. This was granted; Judge Ali ordered Defendants to comply with the TRO by February 26, 2025.\n\nOn February 25, Defendants sought relief from this last order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (Docket No. 25-5046), filing a motion for an immediate administrative stay and a stay pending appeal. The following day, Plaintiff-Appellees' filed a cross-motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals subsequently denied Defendants' motions and dismissed the appeal. Defendants sought relief from the Supreme Court, filing an application (Docket No. 24A831) to vacate the District Court order. Chief Justice Roberts granted an administrative stay on February 26 and ordered further briefing.\n\nOn March 5, 2025, the Supreme Court withdrew the administrative stay, and denied the motion to vacate the TRO, which was therefore permitted to go into effect; the Court instructed, \"Given that the deadline in the challenged order has now passed, and in light of the ongoing preliminary injunction proceedings, the District Court should clarify what obligations the Government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order, with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines.\" As is usual in emergency motions, the Court did not explain itself. Justice Alito, joined by Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, dissented, objecting to both the procedure followed by the District Court and to the rejection of the government's sovereign immunity defense, which the dissent characterized as the District Court's \"blithely discard[ing] of sovereign dignity.”\n\nMeanwhile, PI briefing moved forward in the District Court; a hearing was held on March 6, 2025. The court issued a PI on March 10 prohibiting Defendants from enforcing the State Department guidance regarding implementation of the EO, or giving effect to any actions taken to restrain foreign assistance between January 20 and February 13, 2025. The court further restrained Defendants from \"unlawfully impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds\" and required them to make available \"the full amount of funds that Congress appropriated for foreign assistance programs in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024.\"\n\nOn March 17 the Court ordered Defendants to submit a status report by March 19 \"which includes the updated total number of payments for work completed prior to February 13, 2025 (1) which have been processed since March 10 for Plaintiffs; (2) which have been processed since March 10 for non-Plaintiffs; and (3) which remain to be processed for Plaintiffs and non-Plaintiffs. Defendants' status report shall include a proposed timeline for processing the remaining payments that is consistent with the Court's [300 payments per day feasibility] benchmark.\"\n\nAfter some back and forth between the parties regarding Defendants' compliance with the PI, the Court issued an order on March 28 finding that Defendants proposed compliance timeline was consistent with the Court's feasibility benchmark and ordering the parties to meet and confer regarding any outstanding disputes regarding compliance with the PI.\n\nDefendants appealed the PI to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on April 2 (Docket No. 25-5098). On May 6, the Court of Appeals consolidated this appeal and the appeal filed in Global Health Council (Docket No. 25-5097), and issued a briefing schedule requiring Defendant-Appellants to submit their brief by May 9. Plaintiff-Appellees' brief was due June 6, with Appellants' reply brief due June 18.\n\nMeanwhile in the District Court, Defendants filed an unopposed motion to stay the PI on April 11, citing the Supreme Court's April 4 decision in Department of Education v. California [../../../../case/46201/] issuing a stay of a preliminary injunction and indicating that suits involving contracts with the federal government must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Defendants also sought an indicative ruling from the Court that if the D.C. Circuit returned jurisdiction over the PI to the District Court, it would \"dissolve the provision of the preliminary injunction mandating monetary payments to non-Plaintiffs for work completed prior to February 13, 2025.\" The District Court issued a partial stay the same day, and also ordered Plaintiffs to respond to the request for an indicative ruling by April 16 and set a status conference for May 6.\n\nPlaintiffs immediately filed a motion for extension of time to respond to the motion for an indicative ruling, which the Court granted on April 14, giving the plaintiffs until April 25.\n\nOn May 2, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding the Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) as a party.\n\nOn May 13, the District Court denied Defendants' motion for an indicative ruling on the PI, stating that if Defendants wished to rely on the Department of Education in support of their argument on appeal, the proper forum for that argument was the Court of Appeals.\n\nOn June 12, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaints for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The following day, Plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the PI, requesting that the Court order Defendants to submit a plan for compliance with its March 10 order.\n\nOn August 13, the Court of Appeals issued a decision reversing the District Court's PI, holding that Plaintiffs lacked a cognizable cause of action to pursue their claims. The majority reasoned that the Impoundment Control Act (ICA) provides a specific enforcement mechanism, which, together with existing case law, precludes the claims as brought. In dissent, one judge argued that the majority improperly waived consideration of a central argument and emphasized that the President's actions constituted a clear violation of the constitutional separation of powers, rather than merely a statutory violation.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "On February 10, 2025, three refugee resettlement agencies and nine individuals filed this putative class action against President Donald J. Trump, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Acting Secretary of Health and Human Services in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The Plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14163, titled \"Realigning the United States Refugee Admission Program,\" which barred entry into the United States for all refugees and suspended decisions on refugee applications, both for an indefinite period. The plaintiffs alleged that the order violated the Refugee Act, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Separation of Powers, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They sought preliminary and permanent injunctions to block enforcement of the order, restoration of refugee processing and funding, and a declaratory judgment that the order was unlawful and unconstitutional. The case was assigned to District Judge Jamal N. Whitehead.\n\nThe named individual plaintiffs sought to represent a proposed class of individuals whose ability to (a) be resettled in the United States, (b) reunite with family members in the U.S., and/or (c) access legally mandated post-resettlement services had been disrupted by the Executive Order, including (1) individuals currently undergoing processing for admission to the United States as refugees; (2) U.S.-based individuals petitioning for family reunification under the Follow-to-Join (FTJ) program; and (3) refugees and Afghan and Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders who have been resettled in the United States and are within their first 90 days post-resettlement.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs argued that the Executive Order suspending the Refugee Admissions Program violated the Refugee Act of 1980, an Act that created a comprehensive framework for admitting and placing refugees within the United States. They also claimed that the order exceeded presidential authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and separation of powers principles. They alleged that the Executive Order violated the APA by being arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. The plaintiffs further argued that the order has already caused immediate and irreparable harm, with many refugees, including named plaintiffs, having their travel abruptly canceled. As the plaintiffs assert, the resettlement agencies—many of which rely on federal funding—struggled to continue operations in the aftermath of the Executive Order, forcing layoffs.\n\nOn February 25, 2025, the court granted a nationwide preliminary injunction temporarily blocking the defendants from enforcing the Executive Order while the case proceeds. Judge Whitehead granted the provisional relief because the plaintiffs demonstrated that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their case by showing that Executive Order “has crossed the line from permissible discretionary action to effective nullification of congressional will.”  The government immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit and sought a stay pending the appeal from the district court and the Ninth Circuit.\n\nThe day following the preliminary injunction order, February 26, 2025, the State Department terminated all cooperative agreements with resettlement agencies to provide reception, placement, and support services to newly arrived refugees and Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders. Furthermore, the State Department terminated the cooperative agreements of settlement partners for United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) processing. After the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to include these new developments, the plaintiffs moved for another preliminary injunction, arguing that the new developments make it \"all but impossible\" for the government to comply with the court's preliminary injunction.\n\nOn March 14, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for class certification in the district court. They asked the court to certify three subclasses, including a refugee and family member subclass, a reception and placement subclass, and a follow-to-join petitioner subclass.\n\nOn March 24, 2025, the district court ordered a second preliminary injunction ordering the reinstatement of the terminated cooperative agreements. The court enjoined the defendants from enforcing or implementing the termination of USRAP-related funding provided to resettlement partners through their cooperative agreements with the State Department and ordered the defendants to reinstate the aforementioned cooperative agreements to their pre-February 2025 status.\n\nOn March 25, 2025, the Ninth Circuit partially granted the government's emergency motion to stay the district court’s first preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit stayed the preliminary injunction in all respects except as it applies to individuals who had been conditionally approved for refugee status by the USCIS before January 20, 2025 (the date that EO 14163 was issued). That same day, the government appealed the court's second preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit. (A few days later, the district court denied a stay of the second preliminary injunction during the pendency of that appeal; the court held to that result on a subsequent motion for reconsideration.)\n\nIn light of the overlapping facts and legal issues, on March 26, 2025, the government filed a consented motion in the Ninth Circuit to consolidate the appeals of both preliminary injunctions granted by the district court.\n\nOn April 3, 2025, the plaintiffs asked the district court for an order (1) requesting the defendants to show cause why the district court should not conclude that they are in violation of the first preliminary injunction and (2) enforcing its first preliminary injunction order as it applies to individuals who were conditionally approved for refugee status before January 20, 2025.  The district court entered an enforcement order on April 11:\n\nDespite this Court’s orders and the Ninth Circuit’s partial denial of a stay, the Government has taken the position that it may suspend cooperative agreements and halt refugee processing for individuals conditionally approved before January 20, 2025. Twice now this Court has rejected this interpretation of the Ninth Circuit's stay order. . . .\n\nThe record shows that the Government has not complied with the First Injunction as it applies to individuals conditionally approved for refugee status before January 20, 2025. Indeed, the Government has effectively acknowledged its noncompliance through its interpretation of the Ninth Circuit’s partial stay order, suggesting that the “in all other respects” language permits it to suspend processing for all refugees, including those conditionally approved before January 20, 2025.\n\nAccordingly, the district court ordered a number of compliance steps, requiring the government to resume refugee processing and report on the schedule for compliance.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the Ninth Circuit issued a clarification order that narrowed the category of refugees protected by the first preliminary injunction (that is, those for whom the preliminary injunction was not stayed, pending appeal) to those individuals who, on or before January 20, 2025, met three specific conditions: (1) the individual had an approved refugee application authorizing Customs and Border Protection to admit the individual “conditionally as a refugee upon arrival at the port within four months of the date the refugee application was approved,” 8 C.F.R. § 207.4; (2) the individual was cleared by USCIS for travel to the United States; and (3) the individual had arranged and confirmable travel plans to the United States.\n\nIn the district court, the parties continued to disagree about the scope of the unstayed parts of the first preliminary injunction; the government argued that under 200 individuals were required to be resettled, and the plaintiffs said the number was in the thousands. On May 5, the district court ruled, finding (as the plaintiffs had urged) that the Ninth Circuit's third criterion \"applies to all refugees who, as of January 20, 2025, had received confirmation of travel arrangements to the United States through some USRAP instrumentality, regardless of when that travel was scheduled to occur, and regardless of whether that travel was self-arranged or arranged by the International Organization of Migration (IOM). This straightforward reading respects both the letter and the purpose of the clarification order.\"  The court added:\n\nThis Court will not entertain the Government’s result-oriented rewriting of a judicial order that clearly says what it says. The Government is free, of course, to seek further clarification from the Ninth Circuit. But the Government is not free to disobey statutory and constitutional law—and the direct orders of this Court and the Ninth Circuit—while it seeks such clarification. The Government’s obligation to process, admit, and provide statutorily mandated resettlement support services to the Injunction-Protected Refugees is immediate. Likewise, the Government’s obligation to restore funding, information, and operational support to its USRAP partners as necessary to process, admit, and provide resettlement services to these individuals is also immediate.\n\nThe next day, the government sought clarification; in response, on May 9, 2025, the Ninth Circuit further refined its three-part test for determining which refugees remain protected by the preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit explained that its prior order “should be interpreted narrowly, on a case-by-case basis, to apply to individuals with a strong reliance interest arising prior to January 20, 2025, comparable to Plaintiff Pacito.”\n\nThe District Court then revisited its May 5 Compliance Framework, which had taken a categorical approach to processing thousands of refugee applicants. On May 15, the District Court rescinded its framework order and explained that case-by-case determinations would be required; it moved towards appointment of a Special Master to assist, asking the parties to submit their nominations for that role and their suggested procedures.\n\nFollowing extensive briefing and argument, the District Court issued a framework on July 14, 2025, to clarify the process for making individual determinations. They found that the complexity of the issues did not warrant the appointment of a specialized expert and appointed U.S. Magistrate Judge Michelle L. Peterson to assist with case-by-case determinations.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the constitutionality of President Trump’s January 28, 2025 Executive Order 14187 (EO 14187), titled “Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” that sought in the sections relevant to this case: (1) to prevent medical institutions from providing gender-affirming care to individuals under nineteen years old by conditioning federal funds on institutions' cessation of such care (Section 4 of EO 14187), and (2) to encourage criminal prosecution by insinuating that gender-affirming care—called “chemical and surgical mutilation” in the EO—is “female genital mutilation,” a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. § 116 (Section 8(a) of EO 14187). (To see the Clearinghouse's collection of legal challenges to trans-related actions by the second Trump Administration, click here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38759&issue_lgbtq=5195&issue_lgbtq=38668&issue_lgbtq=38669&ordering=-summary_approved_date].)\n\nAs filed on February 7, 2025, the original plaintiffs in this case were three states--Washington, Minnesota, and Oregon--and three physicians. (Colorado was later added as a plaintiff on February 19, 2025 through an amended complaint.) In the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle, the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against President Trump, the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Commerce (DOC), the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Education (ED), the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and the United States. (The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. Department of the Treasury (USDT), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) were later added as defendants on February 19, 2025 through an amended complaint).\n\nIn the original complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that Section 4 of EO 14187 violated the Equal Protection clause of the Fifth Amendment by discriminating against transgender and gender-diverse people and violated the separation of powers by usurping Congress’s spending power. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged that Section 8(a) violated the Tenth Amendment by exceeding executive authority. Represented by the Attorneys General of Washington, Minnesota, and Oregon, the plaintiffs asked the court to declare Sections 4 and 8(a) of EO 14187 unconstitutional, unlawful, and unenforceable; to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) prohibiting implementation and enforcement of Sections 4 and 8(a); and to hold an expedited hearing on further enjoinment of the defendants (whether through a preliminary injunction or an extended TRO). Accordingly, the plaintiffs also filed an emergency motion for a TRO on February 7, to temporarily stop implementation and enforcement of Sections 4 and 8(a) of EO 14187. The case was assigned to District Judge Lauren King.\n\nOn February 11, 2025, the defendants filed a response in opposition to the plaintiffs' motion for a TRO. In support of the defendants', on the same day, Alabama (represented by their Attorney General and the Silent Majority Foundation) filed an amicus brief opposing the plaintiffs’ motion.\n\nA few days later, on February 14, there was a hearing on the plaintiffs’ TRO motion. The court granted the TRO and set its expiration at 14 days from the date issued (unless the court extended it). The order prohibited the defendants “and all their respective officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them who receives actual notice of [the] Order” from enforcing or implementing Section 4(a) or Section 8(a) in the plaintiff states, “to the extent that Section 8(a) purports to redefine ‘female genital mutilation’ under 18 U.S.C. § 116 as ‘chemical and surgical mutilation'.”\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 19, 2025. It added: (1) Colorado as a plaintiff; (2) additional U.S. agencies--USAID, USDT, DOT, and SBA--as defendants; (3) a claim against another Executive Order, EO 14168, “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” in which Trump denounced, and ordered federal agencies to denounce and defund, “gender ideology,” a term Trump used to refer to transgender identity and the fluidity of gender; and (4) a claim that EO 14187 and 14168 are unconstitutionally vague, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, because they authorize the defendant agencies total discretion in assessing whether federal funding is promoting “gender ideology” and deciding whether gender-affirming care is “chemical and surgical mutilation.”\n\nIn the amended complaint, the plaintiffs challenged Sections 3(e) and (g) of EO 14168, in particular. Section 3(e) ordered agencies to remove and cease “all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology;” to list only “male” and “female”—and never “gender identity”—on agency forms that collect information on sex; and to “take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology.” Section 3(g) reiterated that federal funds and grants may not be used “to promote gender ideology” and ordered agencies to assess grants for compliance. Regarding EO 14168, the plaintiffs asked the court for (1) a TRO, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction against implementation or enforcement of Sections 3(e) and (g), and (2) a declaration that Sections 3(e) and (g) are unconstitutional and unlawful.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, the same day the plaintiffs filed their amended complaint, they also moved for a preliminary injunction. The court heard the motion on February 28, 2025, and issued an order granting a preliminary injunction against enforcement of Section 4 of EO 14187 and Sections 3(e) and (g) of EO 14168 in the four plaintiff states; the court denied a preliminary injunction against Section 8(a) of EO 14187 (because the plaintiffs lacked standing). The preliminary injunction, thus, prohibited the defendants and their “respective officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them who receives actual notice of [the] Order” from conditioning or withholding federal funds based on the recipient’s provision of gender-affirming care in the plaintiff states.\n\nRegarding the court's February 28, 2025, decision to deny the preliminary injunction of Section 8(a) of EO 14187, they explained: “Section 8(a) directs the Attorney General to prioritize ‘enforcement of protections against female genital mutilation’ under 18 U.S.C. § 116. The plaintiffs contend that any prosecution under Section 116 for the provision of the gender-affirming care referenced in the first EO would be ‘baseless,’ and the defendants affirm that the EO does not expand the criminalized conduct under that statute;” thus, there was “no credible threat of prosecution.” (f.n. 1 of 02/28/2025 Order).\n\nOn March 6, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt, asking the Court to hold the defendants in contempt for violating the Court's 14-day TRO issued February 14, 2025 and its preliminary injunction (PI) issued February 28, 2025. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the TRO and PI when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) terminated grants to plaintiff state WA's Seattle Children's Hospital for gender-affirming care and HHS issued notices threatening to terminate as much as $370 million of education grants to children's hospitals nationally—including to children's hospitals in plaintiff states. In their motion for contempt, the plaintiffs asked the Court to hear the motion on shortened time, sought attorneys' fees, and requested an oral argument on the motion. The Court denied the plaintiffs' request to have their motion for contempt heard on shortened time based on a local rule in the Western District of Washington that abolished motions to shorten time. On March13, the defendants filed a response opposing the plaintiffs' motion for contempt, shortened time, and attorney's fees.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, in compliance with the court's order, the parties filed a joint status report. In the portion of the report stating their position, the plaintiffs requested a Rule 16(f) pretrial conference, noting that the defendants refused to provide a date that they would attend a 26(f) conference regarding discovery. In the portion of the report stating the defendants' position, the defendants argued that, because the Solicitor General authorized the defendants to appeal the district court's preliminary injunction, the district court should stay its proceedings pending resolution of the appeal. The defendants indicated their intention to file a motion for such a stay if the court did not issue one on its own. Further, the defendants proposed that the parties submit another joint status report no later than 14 days after conclusion of the appeal.\n\nOn March 17, 2025 the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery and denied their motion for contempt and attorney's fees. Although the court held that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden to show contempt, the court found that the defendants unreasonably interpreted the term \"gender-affirming care\"—as used in the court's preliminary injunction—narrowly and self-servingly. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to \"correct their unreasonable interpretation of the Court’s preliminary injunction by notifying all Defendants and agencies and their employees, contractors, and grantees of the following by no later than March 20, 2025,\" and file a copy of the notice with the court. The defendants filed a notice of compliance on March 20.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, the court set deadlines for the parties to have a rule 26(f) discovery conference, make initial disclosures, and submit a joint status report and discovery plan; those deadlines were March 31, April 14, and April 28, respectively.\n\nOn March 21, the defendants appealed the district court's February 28 Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Motion for Preliminary Injunction and its March 17 Order Denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Contempt and Attorney’s Fees and Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Expedited Discovery. The defendants brought the appeal in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where the case was assigned docket number 25-1922. After completing a mediation questionnaire on March 31, the defendants received a mediation order directing them to \"email Circuit Mediator regarding settlement potential.\" On April 10, the case was released from mediation with a directive that \"[c]ounsel are requested to contact the Circuit Mediator should circumstances develop that warrant settlement discussions.\" On April 11, the appellate court granted an unopposed motion from the defendants for extended time to file their opening briefing, giving the defendants until May 21 to file their opening brief. However, on May 16, the court of appeals issued a stay on opening briefing until a decision was reached in United States v. Skrmetti, ordering the parties to file a status report seven days after the Supreme Court handed down a decision.\n\nAlso on March 21, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to stay proceedings in the district court pending their appeal of the preliminary injunction.  The court granted the defendant's motion to stay on April 23, stating that the plaintiffs were unlikely to suffer harm as a result of the stay, since the court's preliminary injunction was already in force and providing the plaintiffs with their requested relief. Therefore, the court ordered a \"limited stay\" of the proceedings in the district court.\n\nOn March 28, 2025, the defendants filed a Notice of Reinstatement in the district court, stating that the NIH had reinstated a previously terminated research grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital, following the district court's March 13 order allowing expedited discovery into whether the termination violated a preliminary injunction. In the notice, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs' requests for expedited discovery \"are now moot.\" On June 16, the court agreed with the defendants, finding that since \"Defendants reinstated the grant and are immune from the type of monetary sanctions Plaintiffs sought in their underlying motion for contempt, Plaintiffs’ discovery requests are moot.\"\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the defendants filed another Notice with the district court; this one stated that the CDC had terminated 17 grants on January 31, 2025, but had not de-obligated any funds as a result of the terminations. Additionally, the defendants claimed that on February 11, 2025, the CDC reinstated those grants via Notices of Award.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenges the legality of two executive orders issued by President Trump, EO 14168 and EO 14187. The EOs aimed to restrict access to gender-affirming medical care for transgender individuals under the age of nineteen. On February 4, 2025, PFLAG Inc., alongside the American Association of Physicians for Human Rights (GLMA) and several individual plaintiffs, filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs sued President Trump, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the National Institutes of Health for exceeding presidential authority, discriminating on the basis of sex and disability in violation of applicable statutes--including the Affordable Care Act, the Public Health Service Act, and the Rehabilitation Act--and violating constitutional rights to equal protection, due process, and freedom of speech. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the EOs were unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the orders. The case was assigned to District Judge Brendan Abell Hurson.\n\nExecutive Order No. 14168, titled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\" was issued on the second Trump Administration's first day in office, January 20, 2025. Executive Order No. 14187, titled \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" was issued on January 28, 2025. The first EO declared that gender identity is not legally recognized and restricted federal funds from supporting \"gender ideology.\" The second EO directed federal agencies to revoke funding from institutions providing gender-affirming medical care for individuals under nineteen.\n\nPlaintiffs argued these executive orders exceeded presidential authority by circumventing Congress’s control over federal funding. They further alleged the orders violated the Fifth Amendment’s due process and equal protection clauses by targeting transgender individuals, as well as the First Amendment. The lawsuit also cited violations of the Affordable Care Act’s Section 1557 and the Public Health Service Act, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded healthcare programs. Additionally, the suit claimed violations of the Affordable Care Act’s Section 1557 and the Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability.\n\nThe day after the complaint, February 5, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent the executive orders from taking effect, citing immediate harm to transgender patients who were being denied essential medical care.  On February 13, the court granted the TRO, enjoining defendants from withholding funding based on the EOs for fourteen days. 766 F.Supp.3d 535. On February 14, defendants filed a motion to clarify the scope of the TRO, arguing that it should extend only to the agencies named as defendants in the case. Plaintiffs filed a non-opposition motion to the defendants' interpretation of the scope of the TRO on Feb. 16. On February 18, the court granted the defendants' motion, narrowing the TRO to extend only to the defendant agencies named in the case.\n\nThat same day, the plaintiffs filed for a preliminary injunction, to which the defendants filed their response in opposition on February 25. On February 26, the court extended the TRO pending a ruling on the requested preliminary injunction.\n\nThe district court granted the preliminary injunction on March 5, explaining that the plaintiffs were likely to win on the case's merits, because \"the challenged provisions of the Executive Orders place significant conditions on federal funding that Congress did not prescribe. This, the Constitution simply does not allow.\" The court enjoined the defendants from conditioning, withholding, or terminating federal funding based on the challenge executive orders, and required the government to provide written notice of the preliminary injunction to employees, contractors and grantees, including to \"instruct the aforementioned groups that Defendants may not take any steps to implement, give effect to, or reinstate under a different name the directives in Section 3(g) of Executive Order 14168 or Section 4 of Executive Order 14187 that condition or withhold federal funding based on the fact that a healthcare entity or health professional provides gender-affirming medical care to a patient under the age of nineteen. The written notice shall also instruct Defendant agencies to release any disbursements on funds that were paused due to the Executive Orders.\"  769 F.Supp.3d 405.\n\nOn March 7, two days after the preliminary injunction was granted, plaintiffs filed an emergency order requesting enforcement of the injunction order. They argued that the defendants violated the order \"by issuing notices to covered entities and federal funding recipients, renewing previous threats to withhold federal funds.\" They requested the court to enforce the injunction, make the defendants take back any noncompliant directives issued after March 5, and \"direct Defendants to file with the Court signed confirmation from the leader of each Defendant agency (including all subagencies of HHS) that they have personally received a copy of the enforcement order and have read it.\" The defendants' response argued that the documents the plaintiffs claimed violated the preliminary injunction were compliant, because those documents merely,\n\n\"inform[ed] interested parties of HHS’s concerns about the proliferation in use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery to treat children with gender dysphoria and certain research and data on the potentially harmful effects of such interventions. And they explain that, moving forward, the agencies may take action, consistent with applicable law, to protect children from these interventions.\"\n\nPlaintiffs' response argued that the disputed documents were actually \"overt threats.\" Plaintiffs' motion was denied without prejudice on March 28, 2025. 2025 WL 949086.\n\nDefendants filed an interlocutory appeal of the preliminary injunction in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on March 24, 2025. On April 8, both parties filed a joint motion to stay litigation in the district court pending resolution of the interlocutory appeal, which was granted. Meanwhile, on May 12, the court of appeals granted the defendants' motion to hold the case in abeyance for a decision in United States v. Skrmetti [../../../../case/44135/], in which the Supreme Court, on June 18, 2025, decided that a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors did not discriminate on the basis of sex or transgender status and was therefore not subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. After the Supreme Court's decision, the Court of Appeals ordered briefing to resume, with the opening brief due July 25.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "On March 21, 2025, the Trump administration officially terminated funding for legal representation for unaccompanied immigrant children. This case challenges this action.\n\nOn March 26, 2025, Community Legal Services and other non-profit legal services and advocacy groups for immigrants and refugees filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), and the Department of the Interior (DOI). Plaintiffs alleged violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Represented by Immigrants Defender Law Center, Justice Action Center and Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment and a nationwide injunction to compel the government to reinstate this funding and continue providing legal counsel. The case was assigned to Judge Araceli Martinez-Olguin.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which Judge Martinez-Olguin granted the same day, effective through April 16, 2025. The TRO barred the government from terminating, suspending, or reducing funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children, and required the continued disbursement of funds to legal service providers at the levels in effect as of March 20, 2025. It also prohibited the implementation of any new policies or directives inconsistent with those funding obligations, pending resolution of a preliminary injunction motion.\n\nThe same day, the government filed a motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order on the basis that there had been a significant change in controlling law, affirming the discretion of federal agencies to make funding determinations without judicial interference, following the Supreme Court’s decision in Department of Education v. California.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the temporary restraining order, alleging that the government had not complied with the court’s order.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, the government filed a motion for recusal of the district judge, asserting that Judge Martinez-Olguin was biased in favor of the plaintiffs because of her prior role as managing attorney at Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto.\n\nIn light of the recusal motion, on April 10, 2025, the court extended the temporary restraining order through April 30, and scheduled a joint hearing on April 23, to consider both the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction and the government’s motion to dissolve the order.\n\nOn April 12, 2025, the government appealed the TRO to the Ninth Circuit (docket 25-2358). Two days later, they sought a stay pending resolution of that appeal. The Ninth Circuit denied relief on April 18, holding that the time-limited TRO was not appealable. 2025 WL 1189827. On May 5, the court denied rehearing en banc.\n\nBack in the district court, Judge Martinez-Olguin denied recusal on April 17, 2025, stating that a judge's past employment at a plaintiff organization does not, by itself, create a presumption of bias. 2025 WL 1346877. Her reasoning was that the recusal statute requires more than a mere suggestion of prejudice. She also noted that the central issue for recusal is whether a judge was involved in the specific litigation as an advocate before taking the bench, not that they simply worked for a legal employer or practiced in a given area of law.\n\nOn April 29, 2025 the district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1233674. It held that the plaintiffs had standing and that the Tucker Act did not require the claims to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims, since they did not sound in contract. On the merits, the court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on three Administrative Procedure Act theories. First, the court found that the government likely violated the TVPRA by cutting all funding for direct legal representation without any alternative plan to ensure unaccompanied children received legal counsel as required by statute. Second, the court held that ORR failed to follow its own regulations, which required the agency to fund legal services when appropriations were available and pro bono counsel was not feasible. Ending all funding, the court concluded, was inconsistent with this obligation. Third, the court determined that the decision was likely arbitrary and capricious because the government failed to provide a reasoned explanation supported by evidence and instead relied on post hoc attorney argument. Accordingly, the court enjoined the government from withdrawing ORR services or funding in place as of March 20, 2025, including funding for direct legal representation under the TVPRA and ORR’s Foundational Rule. The injunction barred any cutoff of congressionally appropriated funds while it remains in effect.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, the government appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit (docket 25-2808). Then, on May 13, the government filed a motion to stay the preliminary injunction, which the court denied on May 14. 2025 WL 1393876. The court found that there was no Tucker Act obstacle to the suit and that the government had not demonstrated irreparable harm from the challenged injunction. The court denied the government’s subsequent petition for rehearing en banc on May 26, over a dissent by Judges Bumatay and VanDyke, who raised concerns about judicial overreach and separation of powers.\n\nThe government's appeal of the preliminary injunction remains pending in the Ninth Circuit (docket 25-2808), while the underlying case remains ongoing in the district court.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the Trump Administration's authority to terminate approximately $600 million in Congressionally-authorized education grants that included efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) in the recruitment and hiring of teachers in hard-to-staff localities and subject areas. On March 6, 2025, the states of California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Wisconsin filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Plaintiffs sued the Department of Education under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). Represented by the Attorney General of each plaintiff state, the plaintiffs alleged that the Education Department’s termination of the previously appropriated grants, meant to address nationwide teacher shortages and improve teacher quality particularly in rural and other underserved communities, violated the APA. Plaintiffs asked the court to vacate the terminations and also sought a preliminary and permanent injunction, declaratory relief, and attorney’s fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Myong J. Joun.\n\nThat same day, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). The Court issued a TRO on March 10, requiring Defendants to reinstate the terminated grants and preventing them from terminating any additional educational grants previously approved for recipients in the plaintiff states.\n\nOn March 11, Defendants sought relief from the TRO in the First Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the forced reinstatement of the grants allowed recipients to begin drawing down funds immediately, even though this litigation was ongoing. The Court of Appeals denied Defendants’ emergency motion and set a briefing schedule for their broader request for relief. In accordance with this schedule, Plaintiff-Appellees submitted their response to the stay motion on March 13. Defendant-Appellants filed a reply on March 14.\n\nOn March 12, Judge Joun issued an order setting a preliminary injunction (PI) briefing schedule, treating Plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO as a motion for a PI. Defendants were ordered to file their opposition to a preliminary injunction by March 21, and Plaintiffs had until March 28 to file a reply. A hearing was scheduled for April 4, 2025.\n\nAlso on March 12, Defendants filed an emergency motion for a stay in the district court pending their appeal to the First Circuit. Judge Joun denied this motion the next day, finding that the TRO was not appealable and thus declining to address the merits of Defendants’ stay motion.\n\nDefendants filed their response in opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for a PI on March 17, 2025.\n\nOn March 19, Defendants filed a letter to the First Circuit informing it of the Solicitor General's intent to seek relief on their motion for a stay of the district court's TRO pending appeal in the U.S. Supreme Court on March 20 unless the Court of Appeals issued a decision. A three-judge panel from the First Circuit denied the defendants' stay motion on March 21.\n\nPlaintiffs filed a motion to extend the TRO on March 21, asking the court to extend the deadline of the TRO from March 24 to March 31 to ensure that it didn't expire before the court ruled on the preliminary injunction motion. Judge Joun granted the motion, extending the TRO to April 7, 2025.\n\nOn March 26, the Acting Solicitor General appealed the TRO to the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of Defendants. The application asked the Supreme Court to vacate the TRO and enter an immediate stay pending the resolution of the appeal. Notably, the Acting Solicitor General argued that it was outside the authority of federal district courts to order the government to unfreeze and disburse federal funds.\n\nThe Supreme Court stayed the TRO on April 4 pending disposition of Defendants' appeal in the First Circuit, and, if sought, a writ of certiorari. The per curiam opinion found that special factors counseled in favor of treating the TRO as an appealable preliminary injunction and that Defendants were likely to succeed in showing the District Court lacked jurisdiction. The Court held that \"the APA’s limited waiver of [sovereign] immunity does not extend to orders to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money along the lines of what the District Court ordered here,\" and that the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. § 1491) granted jurisdiction to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for suits based on \"any express or implied contract with the United States.\" Chief Justice Roberts noted that he would have denied the application.\n\nOn April 8, Plaintiffs notified the District Court that they were withdrawing their PI motion in light of the Supreme Court's decision. Judge Joun held a hearing the next day, where the parties discussed the Supreme Court's opinion and scheduling for Defendants' expected motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. That same day, the Court denied Plaintiffs' PI motion as moot.\n\nOn April 23, Defendant-Appellants voluntarily dismissed their appeal in the First Circuit. On May 12, they filed a motion to dismiss in the District Court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or, in the alternative, to transfer the action to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n\nOn June 2, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting four additional causes of action: (1) a claim for declaratory relief; (2) a substantive violation of the Spending Clause; (3) an equitable ultra vires claim; and (4) a violation of the Separation of Powers. In light of the amended complaint, Defendants' May 12 motion to dismiss was denied as moot. On June 3, Judge Joun recused himself, and the case was reassigned to District Judge Angel Kelley.\n\nOn June 30, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to transfer the action to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

Trump’s January 27, 2025 executive order banning transgender people from serving in the military, which reverses the U.S. Armed Forces’ policy of permitting transgender people who meet military standards to serve.

(President Trump was dismissed as a defendant on March 28, 2025.) The plaintiffs included six transgender service members in the U.S. military; one prospective service member who is transgender; and Gender Justice League, a civil rights organization with transgender military members. They were represented by Perkins Coie LLP; Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc.; and Human Rights Campaign Foundation. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.\n\nThe complaint alleged that the categorical exclusion of transgender people from military service was not based on any legitimate governmental purpose. Further, the plaintiffs contended that the ban on transgender people serving in the military discriminated against the plaintiffs based on their sex and based on their transgender status in violation of the Equal Protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In addition, they alleged a Procedural Due Process violation under the Fifth Amendment.  Finally, the complaint claimed that the executive order was a violation of their free speech guarantee of the First Amendment because its purpose and effect is to “chill, coerce, and punish the [plaintiffs] for their speech and gender expression—constitutionally protected First Amendment activity.” The complaint stated that, on its face, the executive order labels transgender peoples’ expression of their own identities as inconsistent with “a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life.” The plaintiffs requested a declaratory judgment that the President’s executive order is unconstitutional, a preliminary and permanent injunction barring implementation of the order, and attorneys' fees.\n\nOn February 7, 2025, the case was assigned to District Judge Benjamin H. Settle.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on February 19, 2025, asking the court to bar implementation of the executive order until it could adjudicate the case. Briefing on the preliminary injunction motion will be complete by the end of March. In the meantime, on March 4, Judge Settle ordered the Government to immediately notify the plaintiffs and the court if the Department of Defense (or any of its subsidiaries) issues any policy or guidance implementing the challenged Executive Orders in the military, and before any changes were \"made to plaintiffs' status quo in any respect.\" The order stated that the court would \"entertain a motion for a temporary restraining order should any action be taken against Plaintiffs before a preliminary injunction hearing.\" The defendants' filed a notice of such policies or guidance on the same day. (Additional notices were filed on March 5 and March 7.) Also on March 4, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.\n\nA hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction was held on March 25, 2025, and District Judge Settle issued an order and opinion granting the injunction on March 27. It noted that \"[t]he effect of the Court’s Order is to maintain the status quo of military policy regarding both active-duty and prospective transgender service that existed nationwide immediately before President Trump issued the Military Ban.\" It also included that the order applies to all plaintiffs and any similarly situated individuals nationwide, including those serving out the country.\n\nThe next day (March 28), the defendants filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. They also filed a motion for an immediate administrative stay of the district court's March 27 order and a stay pending appeal. The Court of Appeals denied the administrative stay on March 31, and on April 18, the three-judge panel declined to stay the district court’s March 27, 2025, preliminary injunction pending appeal. They noted that the government has not demonstrated that they will suffer irreparable harm absent a stay. Briefing on the injunction is scheduled through May 23, 2025. (Meanwhile, in the district court, the defendants were given an extension until May 14, 2025, to respond to the plaintiffs' amended complaint. The district court also dismissed President Trump as a defendant on March 28.)\n\nOn April 24, 2025, the government went to the U.S. Supreme Court to seek a stay pending resolution of the appeal in the Ninth Circuit and any further Supreme Court review. The Court granted that stay on May 6, 2025, over the recorded dissent of Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson.\n\nBack in the district court, the defendants filed their answer to the complaint on May 19. The defendants raised several affirmative defenses, including that the plaintiffs had failed to state a cause of action, that they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, and that the Gender Justice League lacked organizational or associational standing.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

(On February 13, 2025, Judge Reyes dismissed President Trump, in his official capacity, as a defendant.) The plaintiffs were represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and private counsel. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nIn the complaint, the plaintiffs argued that the categorical exclusion of transgender people from military service was not based on any legitimate governmental purpose and was issued without any study of the effectiveness of transgender service members and without any assessment of whether their service entailed greater costs. Further, the plaintiffs contended that the ban on transgender people serving in the military discriminated against them based on their sex and their transgender status in violation of the Equal Protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiffs requested a declaratory judgment that the President’s executive order is unconstitutional, a preliminary and permanent injunction barring implementation of the order, and attorneys' fees.\n\nOn January 29, 2025, the case was assigned to District Judge Ana C. Reyes.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on February 3, 2025, and moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) the following day, asking the court to bar implementation of the executive order until it could adjudicate the case.\n\nOn the same day, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. In addition to adding a new plaintiff, the filing made a reference to a second executive order, titled “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” that had been signed by President Trump on January 20, 2025. The January 27, 2025 executive order expressly incorporated the definitions for “sex” and “gender identity” from the January 20, 2025 executive order.\n\nIn response to a Joint Status Report, on February 5, 2025, Judge Reyes ordered the defendants to immediately notify the plaintiffs and the court about any policy or guidance promulgated by the Department of Defense implementing the challenged executive orders. In addition, the order stated that the defendants must immediately notify the plaintiffs and the court before any changes are made to the plaintiffs’ status quo. If this were to occur, then Judge Reyes would consider a TRO before the preliminary injunction hearing on February 18, 2025. The defendants provided their first notice on February 6, 2025, listing various implementing documents promulgated by the Department of Defense related to the challenged order.\n\nThe court held the preliminary injunction hearing on February 18–19, 2025. The hearing was scheduled to continue in March.\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 24, 2025. On the same day, the court ordered the defendants to notify the plaintiffs and the court when the Secretary of Defense issued his guidance implementing the executive order, EO 14183. The defendants' filed this notice on February 26. In response, the next day, Judge Reyes ordered that the defendants provide additional information including: details on DoD spending from 2015-2024 (including on psychotherapy and surgical care for all service members); identification of any \"mental health constraint,\" other than gender dysphoria, that DoD has previously found to be inconsistent with \"honesty, humility, and integrity;\" for each plaintiff, whether implementation of the memo would require him or her to be separated from the armed forces; and their most recent estimate of the number of transgender individuals currently serving. The defendants filed a response on March 1.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint on March 4, 2025 and a renewed application for preliminary injunction on March 7. The court heard the motion on March 12 and granted the preliminary injunction on March 18. 2025 WL 842332. The order included that the defendants are preliminarily enjoined from implementing EO 14183, \"Additional Guidance on Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness\" (Dkt. 63-1), and any other communications issued pursuant to them in order to \"maintain the status quo of military policy regarding transgender service that existed immediately before [President Trump] issued Executive Order 14183.\" However, on its own motion, the court stayed the effect of the order until March 21 at 10:00 a.m. eastern, giving the defendants a couple of days to consider filing an emergency stay with the court of appeals. In her accompanying opinion, Judge Reyes noted, \"[t]he Court’s factual findings, the vast majority conceded by Defendants and all supported by the Record, make it highly unlikely that the Military Ban will survive judicial review, whether it be rational basis or intermediate scrutiny.\" Additionally, responding to the defendants that the court must \"defer to the military’s judgment,\" the opinion said:\n\n\"The Court must defer. But not blindly. The President issued EO 14183 within seven days of taking office, and Secretary Hegseth issued the Policy thirty days later. There is no evidence that they consulted with uniformed military leaders before doing so. Neither document contains any analysis nor cites any data. They pronounce that transgender persons are not honorable, truthful, or disciplined—but Defense counsel concedes that these assertions are pure conjecture.\"\n\nIn response, on March 21, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction and extend the district court's stay of the injunction pending the motion to dissolve, or alternatively, to stay the injunction pending appeal. Judge Reyes heard the motion the same day. She reinstated the court's stay of the injunction until 48 hours after ruling on the defendants' motion. She also requested briefing from the plaintiffs by March 25; requested additional information from the defendants; and stated that if any action occurs that negatively impacts a service member based on their transgender status before the court lifts its stay, that individual may file a TRO (including if the plaintiffs need to amend their complaint to add the individual(s)).\n\nOn March 24, 2025, the plaintiffs filed their fourth amended complaint, which added twelve individual plaintiffs--all current service members who are transgender. Additionally, they filed a motion for a TRO, requesting specific relief for five of the new plaintiffs while the court decides on the defendants' March 21 motion. The requests included that four of the individuals be returned to active duty from administrative absence and that none of them be required to serve in their birth sex while the order is in effect, among other things. Judge Reyes heard this motion on the same day and requested additional information from the defendants while she considered the motion.\n\nLater that week, on March 26, District Judge Reyes issued an order and opinion denying the defendants' March 21 motion to dissolve the court's preliminary injunction and for a stay pending appeal. However, on its own motion, the court stayed the effect of the order until March 28 at 7:00 p.m. Eastern, giving the defendants a couple of days to consider filing an emergency stay with the D.C. Circuit. In her accompanying opinion, Judge Reyes noted that a newly-issued guidance document—the Military Department Identification Guidance—continues to reflect the defendants' argument that the military ban is concerned with \"military readiness, deployability, and costs associated with a medical condition.\" However, the opinion stated:\n\nGender dysphoria is not like other medical conditions, something Defendants well know. It affects only one group of people: all persons with gender dysphoria are transgender and only transgender persons experience gender dysphoria. Does this mean that all transgender persons have gender dysphoria? No, of course not. But it does mean that when Defendants regulate gender dysphoria, they knowingly and necessarily regulate only transgender persons.\n\nWithin hours, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; the appeal was docketed as 25-5087. The next day (March 27), the defendants filed an emergency motion in the appellate court, requesting an immediate administrative stay of the district court's preliminary injunction and a stay pending appeal. The court of appeals responded with an order setting deadlines for additional briefing and ordering:\n\n[T]hat the district court’s order filed March 18, 2025, granting appellees’ renewed application for preliminary injunction be administratively stayed pending further order of the court. The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion . . . If any action occurs that negatively impacts service members under the Hegseth Policy and MDI guidance before the court lifts the administrative stay, the plaintiffs may file a motion to lift the administrative stay, and the court will consider it expeditiously.\n\nIn the D.C. Circuit, the oral argument was held before Judges Pillard, Katsas, and Rao on April 22. Meanwhile, back in the district court, the plaintiffs filed a notice with the court, informing it that two individuals had been dismissed as plaintiffs in the action.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case is one of several challenging President Trump's effort to narrow birthright citizenship--the Fourteenth Amendment right to U.S. citizenship to individuals born on U.S. soil and \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\" You can see all these cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&constitutional_clause=38810].\n\nPresident Trump was sworn in to his second term as President on January 20, 2025, and immediately issued a number of Executive Orders--including Executive Order 14160, which proclaimed that birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to children born in the United States when: (1) their mother was unlawfully present in the country and their father was neither a U.S. citizen nor a permanent resident at the time of the child’s birth; or (2) when their mother was lawfully, but temporarily, present in the United States and their father was neither a U.S. citizen nor a permanent resident.\n\nThis case was filed on January 21, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The plaintiffs included four states: Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon. The lawsuit named as defendants President Trump, the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration, the Department of State, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Agriculture. The case was assigned to District Judge John C. Coughenour.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the Executive Order violated the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a). They sought a declaratory judgment against the administration and an emergency Temporary Restraining Order enjoining the defendants from implementing or enforcing the Executive Order, which was scheduled to go into effect on Feb. 19, 2025.\n\nSimultaneously with the complaint the plaintiffs filed an Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order.  At the resulting motion hearing on Jan. 23, 2025, Judge Coughenour (a Reagan appointee) temporarily (for 14 days) enjoined operation of the EO nationwide; news reports quoted him describing it as \"blatantly unconstitutional.\"\n\nOn Jan. 27, under FRCP 42(a)(2), the court consolidated this case with Aleman v. Trump [../../../../case/45981/], another suit challenging EO 14160 in the Western District of Washington. The plaintiffs filed a motion for the court to certify this suit as a class action with the class defined as \"[a]ll pregnant persons residing in Washington State who will give birth in the United States on or after Feb. 19, 2025, where neither parent of the expected child is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of the child’s birth; and, all children residing in Washington State who are born in the United States on or after Feb. 19, 2025, where neither of their parents is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of the child's birth.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on January 27, and the defendants filed a response opposing the injunction on Jan. 31.\n\nIowa and 17 other states filed an amicus brief opposing the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on Feb. 3, arguing that the Executive Order complies with the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment and that it reduces harm to the states by disincentivizing \"illegal immigration\" and \"birth tourism.\"\n\nOn Feb. 4, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding two individual plaintiffs--expectant mothers who are neither U.S. citizens nor lawful permanent residents--who sought class certification for similarly situated persons.\n\nAfter holding a hearing on Feb. 6, Judge Coughenour granted the plaintiffs' motion for a nationwide preliminary injunction and enjoined the defendants from enforcing or implementing the Executive Order nationwide. That same day, the individual plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the court's order, specifically asking the court to grant provisional class certification and to order class-wide relief. Shortly thereafter, the defendants appealed the court's order granting the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (docket no. 25-807). The Court of Appeals set briefing for March and April.\n\nJudge Coughenour then stayed this matter in the district court, including all outstanding motions, pending the outcome of the defendants' appeal to the Ninth Circuit. The plaintiffs then requested that the court deny the defendants’ motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction.\n\nIn the Ninth Circuit, the defendants sought an emergency stay of the nationwide scope of the preliminary injunction. They argued that the plaintiff states lack standing and that the injunction is overbroad. They asked the court to limit the injunction only to the individual plaintiffs in this case. On Feb. 19, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants' emergency motion for a partial stay of the district court’s Feb. 6, 2025, preliminary injunction, finding that they had not made a “strong showing that [they are] likely to succeed on the merits” of this appeal.\n\nOn February 13, the State of Tennessee filed an amicus brief in the Ninth Circuit in support of the defendants-appellants, arguing that the court should stay the preliminary injunction and rejecting the plaintiffs' interpretation of birthright citizenship because \"[c]onferring United States citizenship requires a more meaningful connection than mere presence by happenstance or illegality.\" A coalition of 18 members of Congress--led by Rep. Jim Jordan--who serve on the Judiciary Committee filed an amicus brief arguing that the court should grant the defendants-appellants' emergency motion to stay in part the District Court's preliminary injunction. Amicus briefs were also filed in support of the defendants-appellants by the State of Texas; Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III; and the State of Iowa and 18 other States.\n\nIn the Ninth Circuit, briefing was due in March and April, and the case was scheduled for oral argument on June 4, 2025. After oral argument, the court decided to hold the case in abeyance until a decision was reached in another case, Casa Inc. v. Trump, that was currently pending in the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the United States Supreme Court, on March 13, 2025, Acting Solicitor General Harris filed an application for a partial stay of the district court's injunctions in this case, in CASA Inc. v. Trump [../../../../case/45965/], and in State of New Jersey v. Trump, [../../../../case/45962/] two other cases challenging the executive order. Arguing that the injunctions improperly grant relief to non-parties and prevent the executive branch from taking steps to implement the Executive Order, the Solicitor General asked the Supreme Court to stay the preliminary injunction in this case \"except as to the two individual respondents—and, if the Court concludes that the state respondents are proper parties, as to individuals who are born or reside in those States.\"\n\nOn March 14, 2025, the same coalition of members of Congress that filed an amicus brief in the Ninth Circuit filed another amicus brief in the Supreme Court supporting the government's application for stays in these three cases, as did the State of Tennessee. On March 28, 2025, the Attorney General of Iowa, on behalf of Iowa and 19 other states, also filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court supporting the government.\n\nThe Supreme Court consolidated the applications for partial stays in the three birthright citizenship cases pending before it and scheduled oral argument for May 15, 2025. The Court deferred resolution of the stays/applications pending its decision--which was issued on June 27, 2025. Justice Barrett, writing for a 6-3 majority (with Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissenting), found that \"universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.\" Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, federal courts have jurisdiction over \"all suits in equity,\" which the Court had previously held \"encompasses only those sorts of equitable remedies traditionally accorded by courts of equity at our country's inception.\" Here, the Court found that universal injunctions were not \"sufficiently analogous\" to any relief offered by the court of equity in England at the time of the founding.\n\nInstead, the Court focused on the requirement that parties (not individuals who are not parties before the court) receive complete relief. It held that an injunction prohibiting enforcement of the EO against the particular individual plaintiffs in this case gave them complete relief, so the challenged injunctions were certainly overbroad with regard to the individual plaintiffs. However, the Court declined to consider whether the injunctions were overbroad with regard to the state plaintiffs, leaving that question to the lower courts to consider (expeditiously) in the first instance. The Court also left open the possibility of a nationwide injunction in cases with a certified nationwide class. Therefore, the Court issued a partial stay of the preliminary injunctions but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue.\" Since the overbreadth issue has not yet been resolved, the injunctions remain in effect.\n\nBack in the Ninth Circuit, on June 27, the court ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs explaining what effect the Supreme Court's decision had on the issues presented in this case.\n\nMeanwhile, the plaintiffs filed a motion in the district court asking it to lift the stay pending appeal with regard to its motion for class certification (which had not been acted on by the court before it stayed the case pending appeal). The court rejected the request on July 3, stating that \" it would be premature for this Court to lift its stay when the Ninth Circuit has already moved expeditiously to determine the scope of the preliminary injunction.\" Therefore, the case remained stayed in the district court while the Ninth Circuit decided the appeal.\n\nOn July 23, 2025, the Ninth Circuit (with Judge Bumatay dissenting) issued an opinion upholding the District Court's injunction. The court ruled that \"because State Plaintiffs have standing and are likely to succeed in demonstrating that the Executive Order is unconstitutional, we affirm the district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction and its determination that a universal preliminary injunction is necessary to give the States complete relief on their claims.\" Looking first at standing, the court found that \"the States have shown that the loss of reimbursements, funding, and additional expenses incurred by the development of a new system to determine eligibility are concrete and imminent injuries-in-fact, traceable to the Executive Order, and redressable by an injunction\" and that \"the automatic and direct effect of denying citizenship to children affected by the Executive Order renders them ineligible for federal programs and for Social Security Numbers, which results in a quantifiable loss of funding to the States.\"\n\nLooking to the merits, the court found that the \"plain text and ordinary meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, controlling precedent interpreting the Citizenship Clause, drafting history, and most post-ratification public understanding weigh in favor of Plaintiffs’ interpretation of the Citizenship Clause.\"\n\nFinally, the court examined the scope of the universal injunction that the District Court had issued. The court found that the District Court had not abused its discretion in issuing a nationwide injunction, since \"the States would be obligated to overhaul their existing systems for determining citizenship and incur an administrative burden even if the injunction were narrowed as Defendants suggest.\" The court found that without a nationwide injunction, the States would still suffer harm, and therefore the injunction fell within the \"complete relief to the parties\" principle announced by the Supreme Court in Casa Inc. v. Trump. Therefore, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision of the lower court.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

(CASA) and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP) – and five pregnant women, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, challenging the Executive Order. The plaintiffs were represented by attorneys within their respective organizations and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. Named defendants included President Donald J. Trump and officials of the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the Social Security Administration. The case was assigned to Judge Deborah L. Boardman.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought their challenge to the Executive Order under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and under 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a) which states that every “person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” “shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth.” They sought a declaration that the Executive Order is unconstitutional, both on its face and as applied to them, and that it violates 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a). The plaintiffs also sought a declaration that all children born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents covered by the Executive Order are U.S. citizens, entitled to all related rights and privileges. Additionally, they requested a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent the enforcement of the Executive Order, an award for legal costs and attorney's fees, and any other relief the court deems appropriate. On February 3, the State of Tennessee filed an amicus brief in support of defendants.\n\nJudge Boardman granted a nationwide preliminary injunction after holding a hearing on February 5, 2025. Judge Boardman found that the Executive Order conflicted with the plain language of the 14th Amendment, contradicted 125-year-old binding Supreme Court precedent, and ran counter to the nation’s 250-year history of citizenship by birth. On February 11, 2025, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, appealing to the Fourth Circuit the court's Memorandum and Order granting plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. On March 25, 2025, the Fourth Circuit agreed to expedite oral argument in this case by scheduling it during the September 2025 sitting.\n\nThe defendants also filed a motion for a partial stay, requesting that the court stay the injunction's nationwide application so that it would apply only to the individual plaintiffs and organization plaintiffs who had been identified in the complaint or preliminary injunction papers. On Feb. 18, the district court denied the defendants’ motion for a partial stay pending appeal.\n\nIn the Court of Appeals, the government also sought a stay pending appeal, which that Court denied on Feb. 28, 2025.\n\nIn the United States Supreme Court, on March 13, 2025, the United States' Acting Solicitor General Harris filed an application for a partial stay of the district court's injunctions in this case, in State of  [../../../../case/45964/]Washington v. Trump [../../../../case/45964/], and in State of New Jersey v. Trump [../../../../case/45962/]. [../../../../case/45962/] Arguing that the injunctions improperly granted relief to non-parties and prevented the executive branch from taking steps to implement the Executive Order, the Solicitor General asked the Supreme Court to stay the preliminary injunction in this case \"except as to the five individual respondents and the eleven members of the organizational respondents identified in the complaint.\"\n\nOn March 14, 2025, a coalition of 18 members of Congress--led by Rep. Jim Jordan--who served on the Judiciary Committee filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court supporting the government's application for stays in these three cases, as did the State of Tennessee.

The amended complaint added additional new individual plaintiffs and asked the district court to certify a class of “All children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.” The plaintiffs argued that the class was sufficiently numerous as to make joinder impractical, that numerous questions of fact and law were common to the class, and that the class representatives (the individual plaintiffs) had claims that were typical of the class and would serve as adequate class representatives in the litigation. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, asking the court to issue an order protecting the putative class.\n\nOn July 16, 2025 the district court entered an indicative ruling regarding the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The court ruled that it \"does not have jurisdiction over the motion because nearly every aspect of it is on appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" However, the court issued an indicative ruling that \"[i]f the Fourth Circuit were to remand for the limited purpose of allowing this Court to decide the motion for a class-wide preliminary injunction, the Court would grant the motion.\" The court decided to hold the motion in abeyance while waiting for further guidance from the Fourth Circuit.\n\nOn July 29, 2025 the Fourth Circuit dismissed the appeal and remanded the case in its entirety to the district court to \"allow the district court to comport expeditiously with the Supreme Court’s directions in CASA, ensuring that any injunction complies with that decision.\"\n\nThereafter, on August 7, 2025, the district court certified a nationwide class and extended preliminary injunctive relief to all members of that class.\n\nFirst, it granted the motion for class certification, although it modified the proposed class definition. 2025 WL 2263001. Plaintiffs sought to certify a class of “All children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.” The court concluded that \"their parents\" were not appropriately included in the class definition because the parents, in their individual capacities, could not establish that they would suffer the same injury as the children or as other parents, and therefore did not satisfy the commonality or typicality requirements for certification.  The court modified the class definition and certified the following class:\n\nAny child who has been born or will be born in the United States after February 19, 2025, (1) whose mother was unlawfully present in the United States and whose father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) whose mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary and whose father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.\n\nNext, the court enjoined enforcement of Executive Order 14,160 against the nationwide class, citing, among other considerations, the extreme likelihood that plaintiffs would succeed on their claim that the Order violated the Fourteenth Amendment. 2025 WL 2257625.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "COVID-19 Summary: This suit was brought on May 19, 2020, by two non-profit organizations and three voter plaintiffs against the state of Louisiana to challenge Louisiana’s Excuse Requirement, Witness Requirement, and Cure Prohibition. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin the defendants from enforcing the Excuse and Witness Requirement, as well as provide absentee voters with notice and opportunity to cure defects in their absentee ballots for all elections in 2020 held in Louisiana. On June 22, the court dismissed the case. <hr>\n\nOn May 19, 2020, two non-profit organizations and three individual voters brought suit against the state of Louisiana to challenge its election laws. Represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and private attorneys, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02 and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 52 U.S.C. § 10301, alleging that the requirement violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The plaintiffs sought to enjoin the defendants from enforcing the Excuse and Witness Requirement, as well as provide absentee voters with notice and opportunity to cure defects in their absentee ballots for all elections in 2020 held in Louisiana. The plaintiffs also sought attorney fees. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, and was assigned to Chief Judge Shelley D. Dick. \n\nOn April 15, the Secretary of State proposed an emergency election plan expanding the category of excuses needed to request an absentee ballot and waiving the Witness Requirement for the July and August elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed plan was rejected by the Louisiana Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee. On April 20, the Secretary of State presented a revised emergency election plan, which did not waive the Witness Requirement and presented fewer categories to fulfill the Excuse Requirement, which was approved. The plaintiffs noted that there was no emergency action plan in place for the November and December elections and that even with the plan in place, the narrow category of excuses and the need for a witness forced voters to choose between exercising their right to vote and potentially endangering themselves. Therefore, the plaintiffs alleged that Louisiana’s Excuse Requirement and Witness Requirement imposed undue burdens on the fundamental right to vote, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The plaintiffs also challenged the lack of notice and opportunity to cure defects with mail-in votes. The plaintiffs alleged that the “Cure Prohibition” violated the Fourteenth Amendment by denying certain populations the right to due process. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on May 29.\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate case, <i>Power Coalition v. Edwards</i>, its plaintiffs also filed a suit to challenge the Excuse Requirement, Witness Requirement, and the Cure Prohibition. <i>Power Coalition v. Edwards</i> and <i>Clark v. Edwards</i> were consolidated on June 3. \n\nOn June 5, the State of Louisiana filed a motion to intervene as defendants, which was granted on June 8. The same day, they filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not adequately alleged state action. The defendants also claimed that because of the proximity of the election, there should not be last-minute electoral meddling. On June 15, the defendants filed a joint motion to amend, which was denied on June 17. The same day, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to remove the Parish Registrars of Voters as defendants. \n\nOn June 22, the court granted the motion to dismiss and all claims against the defendants were dismissed with prejudice. 2020 WL 3415376. The court found that the plaintiffs’ claims did not adequately allege an injury in fact sufficient to give rise to standing, because the demonstrated injury was not traceable to state action. The hearing scheduled for the preliminary injunction was accordingly canceled. On June 25, the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the judgment to dismiss their claims without prejudice, which was granted on June 30. \n",

On May 12, the South Carolina General Assembly passed legislation allowing all qualified South Carolina voters to vote by absentee ballot for the June primaries. On May 25, the court granted the plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions in part, granting relief as to the witness requirement. On September 18, the Witness Requirement was enjoined for the November 2020 General Election in a separate case, and the district court stayed the case. The defendants sought reconsideration.<hr>\n\nOn April 22, four individuals facing a heightened risk of contracting COVID-19 and the Family Unit, a non-profit organization, filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina against the enforcement of South Carolina’s witness requirement and the excuse requirement, which were required in order to vote by an absentee ballot. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (ACLU), the ACLU of South Carolina, and the NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund, the plaintiffs brought this action against the South Carolina State Election Commission and the Governor of South Carolina. They sought sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C § 1983 for violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. §§ 10301, 10302(b), and 10501. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that enforcement of South Carolina’s witness signature requirement during the pandemic posed an unconstitutional barrier to voting and that the exclusive category of \"persons qualified to vote by absentee ballot,\" did not include voters fearful of COVID-19 transmission. The plaintiffs alleged that the two requirements threatened to disenfranchise thousands of eligible South Carolina voters and that COVID-19 would have a disproportionate impact on older populations, voters with disabilities, and African-American voters. The plaintiffs sought a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing the requirements during COVID-19, as well as modification of election materials to reflect the elimination of the requirements before the June 2020 primaries. The case was assigned to Judge Michelle Childs. \n\nOn April 28, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of the two requirements, include self-isolation as an excuse exempting the witness requirement and enter an expedited schedule requiring the defendants to respond within seven days. The motion to enter an expedite the schedule was granted in part, but the specific schedule proposed by the plaintiff was denied. \n\nThe South Carolina Republican Party (SCRP) filed a motion to intervene alleging voter fraud concerns on May 1. On the same day, the Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, an independent non-profit corporation, requested to file an amicus brief. The motion to file an amicus brief was granted on May 6. And, on May 8, SCRP’s motion to intervene was granted. 2020 WL 2306615. \n\nOn May 11, the defendants and the SCRP each submitted a motion opposing the preliminary injunction. \n\nMeanwhile, <a href=\"https://clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17587\"> another action</a> was filed by individuals and the South Carolina Democratic Party on May 7, challenging the absentee ballot requirement in South Carolina against the same defendants. The Middleton plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction enjoining the witness requirement, election day cutoff, and the absentee ballot age restriction limiting the categorical prohibition of all voters under 65 from casting a mailed absentee ballot.\n\nOn May 12, the South Carolina General Assembly passed legislation allowing all qualified South Carolina voters to vote by absentee ballot for the June 9 primary and the June 23 runoff election. Two days later, the court determined that the injunctive relief sought by both Thomas and Middleton plaintiffs would be limited to the June 2020 primaries, as the defendants did not receive proper notice to prepare arguments regarding elections following the June 2020 primaries. \n\nOn May 15, there was a consolidated hearing to address the pending motions for preliminary injunctions in both the Thomas and Middleton cases, with the remaining issues limited to the June primaries. \n\nOn May 25, the court granted the preliminary injunction motions pertaining to the witness signature requirement, to be applied only for the June 2020 primaries. 2020 WL 2617329. The defendants were also ordered to immediately and publicly inform South Carolina voters of the elimination of the witness requirement. \n\nOn July 13, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP as plaintiff while dropping one plaintiff. In addition, the plaintiffs withdrew the claim alleging that the witness requirement violated Section 201 of the Voting Rights Act, while adding the claim that the requirement discriminates against the plaintiffs in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). On July 24, the SCRP sought to re-intervene for the amended complaint. On August 4, the court noted that they had already allowed SCRP to intervene and that intervention is still in effect. \n\nOn August 10, 3 individual plaintiffs, The Family Unit, and the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP voluntarily dismissed the case. The same day, the defendant and the SCRP both filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that none of the requirements violated the Constitution, the VRA, or the ADA. On August 11, the Attorney General of South Carolina sought to file an amicus brief for the case.\n\nOn August 12, Jay Lucas, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and Harvey Peeler, the President of the Senate, sought to intervene, which was granted on August 24. 2020 WL 4934305. The intervening defendants submitted responses in support of both motions for summary judgment, arguing that determining how to conduct South Carolina's elections was a legislative function, not a judicial one, and that the challenged provisions of South Carolina law were lawful. \n\nOn August 14, the parties filed a stipulated motion to dismiss without prejudice as to the defendant Governor of South Carolina. \n\nOn September 15, 2020, the South Carolina General Assembly passed legislation suspending the Excuse Requirement by allowing all qualified voters to vote by absentee ballot for the November 2020 General Election due to the current state of emergency. Three days later the court enjoined the Witness Requirement for all South Carolina voters in the upcoming November 2020 General Election in the Middleton case. In light of the suspension of the challenged provisions for the November 2020 General Election, the district court stayed the case. 2020 WL 5593847. The court instructed that the plaintiffs may request to lift the stay when the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or future statewide elections in South Carolina are sufficiently determinable. The defendants sought reconsideration of the stay, arguing that staying the case on grounds that the Middleton injunction resolved the issues to be tried in this case, would effectively grant the Thomas plaintiffs their requested relief \"without having to ever prove anything at all . . . [which is] unjust and an abuse of discretion.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs sought to consolidate the current case with <i>Middleton v. Andino</i>, however, the court denied the motion on September 22, reasoning that a district court did not have jurisdiction to consolidate an action before it with an action pending before an appellate court.\n\nThe case is ongoing.

    "summary/long": "COVID-19 Summary: This class action challenged COVID-related conditions at the Prince Georges County jail and sought mitigation and release for pretrial and post-conviction detainees. On May 21, the court granted in part the plaintiff's motion for temporary restraining order. Defendants appealed and were denied a stay pending their appeal. On July 7, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint, pointing to the lack of mental health services during an indefinite lockdown. On August 27, the parties filed a joint motion to stay proceedings pending settlement talks. The case is ongoing. <hr>\n\nOn April 21, 2020, pretrial and post-conviction detainees at Prince George’s County Jail, many of whom have pre-existing medical conditions, some of whom were exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, and all of whom were scared of contracting the virus, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs sued the Director of the Prince George’s County Department of Corrections in her official capacity under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. § 2241. The plaintiffs, represented by Civil Rights Corps, sought constitutionally sufficient procedures to protect their health and safety consistent with CDC guidelines and the judgment of correctional health specialists. The plaintiffs claimed that they had been deprived of their rights to reasonably safe living conditions under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and that defendant’s policy of detaining COVID-positive people in the jail who are legally entitled to release violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Additionally, a subclass of medically vulnerable pre-trial plaintiffs claimed they were being held in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs also filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction, requested a hearing, and moved to certify a class. \n\nOn April 23, District Court Judge Paula Xinis ordered the defendant to file a response to plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO by April 25, and for plaintiffs to reply by April 27. Judge Xinis also directed the parties to submit a joint recommendation for an Independent Inspector by April 27, or two recommendations each, with supporting documents, if they were unable to agree. \n\nThe defendant filed their response in opposition to plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25 under seal. The plaintiffs filed their reply on April 29. On April 30, each party individually recommended two experts. On May 1, Judge Xinis appointed Carlos Franco-Paredes, MD, MPH as inspector, pursuant to the plaintiffs' recommendation. \n\nOn May 21, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion for the temporary restraining order. The court ordered a written plan or protocol to be completed within five days that addressed: \n1. The identification, monitoring, treatment, and housing of detainees who are “high risk” (aged 65 or over and/or have an applicable medical condition) for suffering adverse outcomes if infected with COVID-19. \n2. The training, education, and supervision of defendant's staff (medical and corrections officers). \n3. A protocol for testing and isolation of detainees.\n\nThe court also ordered the defendants to submit the following within fourteen days:\n1. The total number of tests administered and the total number of confirmed COVID-19 positive detainees.\n2. A written plan or protocol regarding the provision of adequate cleaning supplies and face masks, as well as social distancing measures.\n\nOn May 26, the defendants appealed to the Fourth Circuit and filed a motion to stay pending appeal. The defendant's motion to stay pending appeal was denied by the district court on June 3, and by the Fourth Circuit on June 10. The plaintiffs moved to dismiss the appeal on June 4. \n\nAs of June 18, 715 individuals at the jail had been tested for COVID-19, with 26 positive results. Those with a positive test result were moved to medical isolation. \n\nStatus conferences were held between June 22 and July 2. On July 2, the court denied the plaintiff's preliminary injunction and the temporary restraining order expired. \n\nOn July 7, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint, stating that in the four months since the initial complaint was filed, indefinite lockdown had continued at the jail, with detainees reporting no more than one or two hours of time out of their cells per day. The plaintiffs alleged a violation of the detainees' Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, pointing to a lack of mental health services while detainees are anxious, depressed, and suicidal due to the indefinite lockdown.\n\nOn July 17, the defendant moved to dismiss the case, or alternatively, sought summary judgment. The defendant claimed that all of the released plaintiffs’ claims are moot because they are no longer in their custody, and that therefore the plaintiffs failed to state a claim for relief. \n\nOn August 12, the Fourth Circuit dismissed the defendant's appeal as moot, agreeing with the plaintiff that the district court recently extinguished the injunctive relief order and denied Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe parties filed a joint motion to stay proceedings on August 27 pending settlement talks. Settlement conferences are currently ongoing. \n\nThe case is ongoing. ",

    "summary/long": "COVID-19 Summary: This class action lawsuit for declaratory, injunctive and habeas relief, brought on behalf of detainees in civil immigration detention at three ICE detention centers in Florida. The petitioners sought a writ of habeas corpus, requesting the immediate release of all individuals in custody, as well as a declaration that continued detention violated the Due Process Clause, and an order prohibiting the respondents from placing new detainees in detention. The court partially granted the petitioners’ temporary restraining order, ordering ICE to implement CDC sanitation guidelines and to review detainees for potential release, and then on June 6, granted a preliminary injunction. On July 17, the court appointed a Special Master to oversee compliance.<hr>\n\nOn April 13, 2020, a group of 34 civil immigration detainees at three Florida detention centers within the jurisdiction of the Miami Field Office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) filed this federal class action lawsuit and petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Petitioners were represented by University of Miami School of Law’s immigration clinic, the Southern Poverty Law Center, Rapid Defense Network, Legal Aid Service of Broward County, and private counsel. Petitioner-plaintiffs (\"the petitioners\") challenged the detention of noncitizens in South Florida as the spread of COVID-19 in ICE detention centers. The petitioners' cause of action arose under the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq.; the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C §§ 701 et seq.; and the federal habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. § 2441. The case was assigned to Judge Marcia G. Cooke and referred to Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman.\n\nFirst, the petitioners alleged that their Fifth Amendment Due Process rights were violated when the respondents failed to follow the CDC guidelines for social distancing, disinfecting, or recommended hygiene practices. They alleged that ICE’s 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards (“PBNDS”) and National Detention Standards (”NDS”) required the respondents to follow CDC guidelines, and that a failure to do so violated the APA and the Due Process Clause. Second, the petitioners alleged that the respondents’ continued detention of the petitioners was excessive in relation to any government purpose and that the petitioners were deliberately indifferent to their health and safety, which was a violation of their Due Process rights. Third, the petitioners alleged that their detention violated the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause because respondents affirmatively subjected petitioners to an unreasonable risk of danger with deliberate indifference to employing policies that drastically increased the risk of petitioners’ contracting COVID-19.  \n\nThe petitioners sought to certify a class of all individuals in civil immigration detention, as of April 13, 2020, at three Florida detention centers: Krome Service Processing Center, Broward Transitional Center, and Glades County Detention Center. Petitioners also sought to certify the following subclasses:\n- Sub-class A: detained individuals with a stable location and/or place of residency in which they can self-quarantine and practice social distancing and hygiene pursuant to the CDC guidelines and Exec. Order No. 20-91 upon release.\n- Sub-class B: all other detained individuals without access to a stable location and/or place of residency in which they can self-quarantine and practice social distancing and hygiene pursuant to CDC guidelines and Exec. Order No. 20-91 upon release.\n\nThe petitioners sought a writ of habeas corpus for immediate release of all individuals in the custody of ICE's three Florida detention centers, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief against unconstitutional conditions of confinement.\n\nOn the same day, the petitioners also filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and a motion for a preliminary injunction. They requested the court to enjoin the respondents from transferring detainees in or out of the three detention centers and to order the respondents to implement CDC health guidelines and protocols, and to release petitioners into community-based alternatives to detention.\n\nOn April 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Goodman recommended the court grant in part the petitioners’ motion for a temporary restraining order and recommended 13 specific measures the court could take. 2020 WL 1949737. The court adopted in part Magistrate Judge Goodman's Report and Recommendation on April 30, 2020. 2020 WL 2086482. The court ordered ICE to: \n1. Evaluate each of the named petitioners consistent with its regulations and inform the court which of the petitioners could be released by May 7, 2020.\n2. Submit a report by May 3, 2020 describing how it intends to accelerate its review of its protocols resulting in release of detained individuals with the goal of reducing the population to 75% of capacity by May 14, 2020.\n3. File weekly reports every Friday with information on the detained individuals ICE is releasing.\n4. File twice-weekly reports containing information on the detained individuals remaining in custody. \n5. Comply “immediately” with the CDC and ICE guidelines on providing adequate amounts of soap, water, and cleaning materials. ICE must have provided masks by May 2, 2020.\n6. Provide appropriate training to its staff and detained individuals on the risks of COVID-19. \n\nJudge Cooke clarified the April 30 temporary restraining order on May 2, 2020, stating that the order included all named petitioners in the action and that ICE could still transfer detainees from all three facilities after first evaluating them and determining their eligibility for release. 2020 WL 2203576.\n\nOn May 15, 2020, the court extended the temporary restraining order for an additional 14 days pending Magistrate Judge Goodman's Report and Recommendations on petitioners' motion for class certification and further hearing on the matter. \n\nOn May 20, 2020, the petitioners filed a motion to compel compliance with the court's temporary restraining order, alleging that ICE had failed to comply with the court's order and CDC guidelines.\n\nOn May 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Goodman recommended that Judge Cook grant the class certification for the claims concerning conditions of confinement and for declaratory relief, but deny it for habeas corpus claims for release stating that those claims did not meet the commonality element because each release decision requires individual evaluation.\n\nThe court held a remote hearing on the motion to compel and on May 28, Judge Cooke extended the temporary restraining order from April 30 for another seven days.\n\nOn May 29, Magistrate Judge Goodman recommended the court deny the motion for class certification as to the requests for release, but grant class certification as to the other claims. Both parties filed objections to this report on June 3.\n\nOn June 6, Judge Cooke certified the class as \"all current civil immigration detainees who are now held by ICE at Krome, BTC, and Glades when this action was filed, since this action was filed, or in the future.\" Judge Cooke granted the preliminary injunction, requiring ICE to comply with all ICE and CDC guidelines, including providing soap, hand sanitizer, and masks to detainees, and to limit transportation. The injunction also required ICE to educate detainees on mask-wearing and other prevention and to submit weekly reports to the court regarding the number of detainees being held and their detention status. 106 Fed.R.Serv.3d 1595.\n\nOn June 16, the plaintiffs filed a motion to compel compliance with the June 6 order, stating that the facilities were not implementing social distancing and not educating detainees on the importance of masks. \n\nOn July 5, the court granted the motion to compel compliance and appointed a Special Master, Michael B. Chavies of Akerman LLP, \"to assess whether ICE is committing an ongoing violation of the detainees’ constitutional rights.” The Special Master would have the authority to request any records, physically inspect the three facilities and take photos and videos of the conditions inside. The court vacated that order the following day and didn't issue another order on the motion until July 17, this time appointing Matthew C. Dates of Stearns Weaver Miller Weissler Alhadeff & Sitterson P.A. as Special Master instead. 2020 WL 4047334.\n\nBetween July and September, several plaintiffs moved for release or home confinement, but none of the motions were granted. Several individuals also successfully moved to intervene. \n\nOn January 4, 2021, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that they are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs’ deliberate indifference claim because they've acted reasonably to implement measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at Krome, BTC, and Glades. As to the due process claim, they argue it should be dismissed for failure to state a claim since the CDC Guidelines are not regulations with the force and effect of law. Finally, they argue that the state created danger claim also fails to state a claim for the same reason that the deliberate indifference claim fails. Plaintiffs responded on February 2, 2021, alleging that defendants ignored substantial evidence, including evidence recognized by the court in previous rulings, that contradict their claims for why summary judgment should be granted. \n\nOn January 21, 2021, the court denied an emergency motion to intervene for a plaintiff that had been deported to Guatemala. The Court held that it did not retain jurisdiction over class members that had been deported out of the United States, so the motion to intervene was moot.\n\nOn February 8, 2021, the court ordered that the Special Master give plaintiffs' counsel full access to his report on or before February 19, 2021, and file a redacted version of the Special Master’s report and recommendations on CM/EMF. This report details the investigations that the Special Master made during the summer of 2020 into the conditions at these facilities. \n\nDiscovery and attempts at mediation remain ongoing as plaintiffs file for release or to remove themselves from the case as their circumstances change. The case is ongoing.",
