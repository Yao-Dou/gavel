    "summary/long": "On April 28, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees and several other labor organizations, nonprofits, and cities/counties filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. They named President Donald Trump and numerous federal departments and agencies and their agency heads as Defendants. The Plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14210, which ordered agencies across the federal government to engage in a radical transformation of the federal bureaucracy, including by conducting large-scale Reductions in Force (RIFs), without Congressional authorization. They challenged the executive order and implementing memoranda under the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Susan Illston. On May 1, 2025, plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on May 9, 2025, Judge Illston granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, applicable to the following department:  OMB, OPM, DOGE, USDA, Commerce, Energy, HHS, HUD, Interior, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, VA, AmeriCorps, EPA, GSA, NLRB, NSF, SBA, and SSA.  The order paused any further reductions in force and compelled speedy limited discovery.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal, and sought a stay pending appellate litigation.  The district court declined to enter a stay, and the 9th Circuit set a schedule for briefing to proceed through May 22 (the day before the TRO is set to expire unless extended).  On May 16, the government asked the Supreme Court to grant a stay.\n\nBack in the district court, after briefing, on May 22, 2025, Judge Illston granted a preliminary injunction, barring the challenged government actions during the pendency of the litigation. Following the lead of numerous other courts, Judge Illston rejected the arguement that the agencies were acting of their own accord and were not directed by OMB. Judge Illston held the President would exceed his authority by dismantling programs authorized by Congress. The court reasoned that the dramatic staff reductions will render the agencies unable to do what Congress directs the agencies to do. In light of the evidence, Judge Illston held that the plaintiff's were likely to succeed in their claims that the defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority. American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. Supp. 3d, 2025 WL 1358477 (N.D. Cal. 2025). The government filled an appeal and a motion for a stay pending appeal with the 9th Circuit, on May 23.  (This mooted the request for a stay of the TRO pending before the Supreme Court, so the government withdrew that request.)\n\nOn May 30, 2025, the 9th Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, holding in a published opinion by Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher (joined by Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh) that  \"the government does not 'suffer by a temporary preservation of the status quo,'\" and was likely to lose the case. First looking at jurisdiction, the court found that the plaintiffs' claims were not appropriately channeled through the comprehensive administrative system established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), because the CSRA did not give any administrative tribunal the authority to address broad challenges to the defendants' constitutional and statutory authority to direct large-scale federal reorganizations and reductions in force.  On the merits, the court found that neither the Constitution nor any federal statute grants the President the authority to direct the kind of large-scale reorganization of the federal government at issue, noting that the challenged RIFs appear \"inextricably intertwined with broad agency reorganization, which the president undoubtedly cannot undertake without Congress.\" American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, F. 4th, 2025 WL 1541714 (9th Cir. 2025).  A dissent by Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan countered that Article II of the Constitution vests the President with sufficient authority to cover the challenged conduct.  Judge Callahan dissented that the Executive Order and memorandum merely directed agencies to exercise their own lawful statutory authority and that the district court erred by not finding whether specific RIFs would violate statutory mandates or eliminate agencies.\n\nThe government filed a Supreme Court application for a stay on June 2, 2025. The stay application was presented to Justice Kagan. On July 8, the Court granted the stay of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California pending the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. The Court reasoned that the executive order and implementing memoranda themselves were likely legal as they only direct agencies to plan reorganizations in force \"consistent with applicable law.\". The Court declined to express a view on the legality of the Agency RIF or Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan (ARRPs) saying that it was outside the scope of the question in front of them.\n\nJustice Jackson dissented from grant of application for stay. She argued that the Court made this determination outside of the facts and evidence necessary to \"responsibly override, reasoned lower court fact-finding.\" Justice Jackson pointed to the District Court's preliminary findings (which were based \"on actual evidence\") and argued that the Supreme Court should have declined to intervene. The Court resting the granting of the stay on the merits of the case was inappropriate because the District Court issued an injunction based on the facts collected. She further argued that the executive order and memorandum themselves were unconstitutional executive action that does not \"rest on any grant of reorganization authority by Congress.\"\n\nIn response to the stay by the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked Judge Illston to reconsider the plaintiffs' request that the government turn over the specific agency proposals for reductions-in-force (RIFs). The government asserted that these documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege. However, Judge Illston rejected this argument, finding that the documents were \"likely not pre-decisional and deliberative documents.\" Judge Illston then ordered the government to respond to the plaintiffs' request by July 14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for an order shortening the government's time to respond to the discovery request for the RIFs and AARPs (from the standard 30 days to 14 days). The government responded by saying that all the plaintiffs' claim were APA claims and thus, there is no basis for any discovery in the adjudication of those claims.\n\nOn July 15, the government moved for a protective order and/or to quash the plaintiffs' request for production of documents. The motion consisted of seven major claims:\n\n• Discovery is premature because the government still had not responded to the complaint and was planning on moving to dismiss the complaint. The government requested the court rule on the forthcoming motion first before the request for discovery.   • The government reiterated that it would be inappropriate to grant discovery in the adjudication of an APA claim, particularly before an administrative record is certified.   • The requested information is not relevant in light of the stay by the Supreme Court.   • DOGE and United States DOGE services are not agencies that can be sued subject to the APA. The discovery sought against them is without basis.   • The Request for Production (RFP) 1 seeks documents that should be protected by deliberative process privilege.   • The plaintiffs' demand for application for waivers of RIF notice periods and all responses by OMB or OPM to those applications are not relevant to the issues before the court.   • The discovery sought by the plaintiffs is outside the scope of relief the court could grant. The court cannot review the lawfulness of the ARRPs because they are not final agency actions under the APA.\n\nJudge Illston granted this motion in part and denied it in part on July 18. The court reject the government's assertion that the Supreme Court's stay \"ends this case\" because the stay did not reach several claims in the amended complaint. The Supreme Court's decision did not foreclose considerations of the legality of the ARRPs (\"In a concurrence, Justice Sotomayor noted that the Supreme Court's decision allows the district court to consider the legality of the ARRPs in the 'first instance.'\") Judge Illston reiterated that a full review of the ARRPs would \"significantly aid the Court's review of the merits of these APA claims.\" Judge Illston rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs never challenged any of the ARRPs as being arbitrary and capricious. She argued that the defendants are \" [arguing] essentially that plaintiffs cannot prove their case because plaintiffs do not have the ARRPs because the ARRPs have not been made public.\" Judge Illston held that the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized \"narrow exceptions\" to the general rule that the reviewal of APA claims are limited to the administrative record. Finally, the court held that even if some material within the ARRPs should be protected by deliberative process privilege, \"the need for accurate fact finding overrides the government's interest in non-disclosure.\"\n\nHowever, at this point, Judge Illston limited the distribution of the ARRPs to the plaintiffs' counsel and the court. The court also allowed the defendants to redact any material addressing union negotiating strategy to the plaintiffs' counsel. The government was ordered to provide the full version to the court and to highlight any redacted material.\n\nThe government filed two motions on July 21: a motion to dismiss and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The government alleged that in light of the Supreme Court's decision, all the plaintiff's claims fail. This is due to the fact that all the claims in the amended complaint \"depend on the assertion that the Workforce Executive Order, the Workforce Memorandum, or both are unlawful.\" Further, the government alleged that to the extent the complaint challenges the ARPs, the ARPs are not final agency actions subject to review under the APA. The government complains that the allegations regarding the RIFs and the ARPs are speculation about future actions the government will take. In regards to the jurisdiction arguments, the government argued that challenges to the lawfulness of federal agency personnel action are precluded from district court review. The government reasserted its claim that the complaint be dismissed as to DOGE which is an initiative and not an agency that can be sued.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking review of the court's July 18 discovery order. The district court released a statement in response to augment the appellate record. Judge Illston noted that in the government's application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the U.S. Solicitor General represented that 40 RIFs in 17 agencies were in progress and enjoined. However, in response to the discovery order, the petitioners produced a list of those represented RIFs, and numerous agencies that were not defendants in the case (and therefore, not enjoined by the preliminary injunction) were included in the figure presented to the Supreme Court. Judge Illston highlighted that this is no insignificant discrepancy and she reasserted her previous finding that \"any deliberative process privilege. . .is overridden by 'the need for accurate fact-finding in this litigation.'\"\n\nJudge Illston denied the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring production of the administrative record. The court found that much of the information plaintiffs sought from an administrative record overlapped with other discovery requests that plaintiffs issued and on which the court had already ruled. The court suggested the plaintiffs clarify some of their APA claims to give the government a more \"specific understanding of the challenged final agency actions\" so that the government can be \"expected to produce an administrative record for those actions.\"\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the abrupt termination of numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded research projects and the halting of grant application processes. On April 2, 2025, the American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); and four private plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs, consisting of leading health research organizations and individual research scientists, sued the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs were represented by counsel from the Protect Democracy Project, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. The case was initially assigned to Judge Murphy, but on May 1, 2025, he recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including “gender identity,” “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” (DEI), “vaccine hesitancy,” and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump’s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories. This led to the abrupt termination of ongoing projects—many years in progress with significant financial and time investments—and the refusal to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds. The plaintiffs argued that these terminations lacked scientifically valid reasons and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought seven claims, primarily under the Administrative Procedure Act , to challenge the defendants' actions, including the termination of grants, refusal to consider applications, and the issuance of new directives. The first three counts alleged that these actions were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and exceeded statutory authority. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the defendants failed to provide adequate reasoning, ignored their own policies, and improperly relied on external guidance that had not yet been formally adopted. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unreasonably delayed reviewing grant applications, and that the directives were unconstitutionally vague, violating the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Finally, they asserted that the defendants violated the separation of powers by usurping Congress's legislative authority and ignoring statutory mandates.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory relief to have the court declare the defendants’ actions unlawful and unconstitutional, along with temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent the enforcement of the directives, including further grant terminations and withholding of application reviews. They requested an order requiring NIH to restore the terminated grants retroactively and to review all properly submitted applications in accordance with existing NIH policies and strategic plans. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought regular status reports from the defendants confirming compliance with any court orders, an injunction protecting them from any retaliatory consequences for their involvement in the litigation, and an award of their reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a motion for a protective order. In the preliminary injunction motion, they sought the court’s intervention to halt the ongoing disruption caused by the defendants’ alleged unlawful and unconstitutional actions. In the protective order motion, the plaintiffs requested that the court safeguard the names and other identifying information of certain organizational declarants from unnecessary disclosure to the defendants and prevent their participation in the litigation from being used for any potentially retaliatory purposes.\n\nBetween April and June 2025, a wide range of academic institutions, professional associations, civil rights organizations, and attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a series of amicus briefs. These briefs collectively underscored the broad alarm within the scientific, academic, and public health communities regarding the sweeping implications of the challenged NIH policies. They emphasized the dangers of politicizing scientific grantmaking, warned against the erosion of established peer review protocols, and highlighted the discouraging effect on critical research related to marginalized populations, public health misinformation, and global health collaboration. Several amici also detailed the institutional and societal harms caused by abruptly halting ongoing projects—pointing to disruptions to career trajectories, institutional partnerships, and public trust in federal research systems.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court held a status conference to clarify the procedural posture of the case, focusing on the defendants’ earlier filings that raised jurisdictional and legal sufficiency challenges. During the conference, Judge Young and the parties discussed treating portions of the government’s prior briefing as a de facto motion to dismiss. The judge noted that resolving these threshold legal issues early would help streamline the litigation. On May 28, 2025, Judge Young held a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs emphasized the immediate and irreversible harms resulting from the abrupt termination of their NIH-funded research, as well as the chilling effect on future scientific inquiry. The defendants responded that NIH had acted within its discretion in realigning grant priorities in accordance with updated government policy.\n\nThen, on May 30, 2025, Judge Young issued a Memorandum and Order formally resolving the construed motion to dismiss. 2025 WL 1548611. The court dismissed without prejudice Counts IV (vagueness under the APA), VI (vagueness under the Fifth Amendment), and VII (separation-of-powers claim), finding that they were either insufficiently pleaded or jurisdictionally improper. However, it denied dismissal as to the remaining claims—Counts I–III (arbitrary-and-capricious, failure-to-follow-law, statutory overreach) and Count V (unreasonable delay)—allowing those claims to proceed. This order narrowed the litigation to the core equitable and statutory challenges related to grant reinstatement and procedural fairness, while preserving plaintiffs’ ability to refile the dismissed constitutional claims at a later stage if appropriate.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Young issued a temporary order barring further grant terminations and granted the protective order in part, allowing limited redactions of declarant identities to prevent retaliation. That same day, he granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that NIH’s termination of numerous grants was “arbitrary, unlawful, and discriminatory.” The court ordered NIH to reinstate funding for affected grants and resume review of pending applications per established procedures—emphasizing the unprecedented and unlawful nature of NIH’s actions. The injunction took immediate effect.\n\nShortly after, on June 20, 2025, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over certain claims, particularly those seeking monetary relief, which they contended must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. They also argued that some claims were nonjusticiable and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue relief for future or speculative harms.\n\nThen, on June 23, 2025, Judge Young entered a partial final judgment, formally resolving the preliminary injunction and protective order rulings to permit immediate appellate review. 2025 WL 1747128. That same day, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit and moved to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal. On June 24, Judge Young issued an order clarifying that the injunction remains in effect and that the June 23 partial final judgment only applied to the injunctive phase. 2025 WL 1745899.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, asserting that their claims sought equitable relief, not monetary damages, and were properly within the district court’s jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the court issued a supplemental judgment order, reaffirming that the earlier injunction would remain in force during the appeal and reiterating that the judgment covered only the resolved portion of the case. The next day, on July 3, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the district court’s orders pending appeal, seeking expedited relief from the First Circuit to halt enforcement of the preliminary injunction. On July 4, 2025, the First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief and noted its intent to rule on the broader stay relief \"as soon as practicable\" after the completion of briefing.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied the defendants’ motion for a stay pending appeal, holding that the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review the agency action and issue declaratory relief. The court found that the defendants had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on either their jurisdictional challenge or the merits. It also concluded that the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs. The court declared the Directives void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated. Likewise, the resulting grant terminations were also declared void, unlawful, of no effect, set aside, and vacated.\n\nFollowing the First Circuit’s decision, the defendants submitted an application for a stay to the Supreme Court on July 24, 2025. They argued [https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/07/trump-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-pause-order-requiring-payment-of-grants/] that the district court lacked authority under federal law to compel the grant payments, citing a prior Supreme Court order permitting the Department of Education to suspend comparable funding. They also contended that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court’s judgments vacating the government’s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual “obligation to pay money,” which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe litigation remains ongoing on two tracks: continued merits proceedings in the district court, and an active appeal in the First Circuit concerning the merits of the case.",

    "summary/long": "On June 6, 2025, federal law enforcement arrived in Los Angeles to launch what Trump Administration officials described as “the largest Mass Deportation Operation in History.” This case challenges the enforcement practices used during that operation, focusing specifically on the use of roving patrols. Petitioners alleged that federal agents conducted indiscriminate roundups without reasonable suspicion, often appearing masked, without visible badges or identification, and without identifying their agency. These patrols were further alleged to have based detentive stops not on individualized suspicion but on factors such as race, ethnicity, accent, or presence at day laborer sites, bus stops, car washes, or agricultural locations. Certain case documents, including the original petition, have not been made publicly available.\n\nOn June 18, 2025, in Pasadena, California, several individuals were arrested while waiting for a job and subsequently detained in the basement of the Los Angeles federal building (B-18), where they reported experiencing dungeon-like conditions, crowded, unsanitary conditions with limited access to basic necessities and medical care, and were denied phone calls.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, these individuals, along with Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, and organizations such as the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center, filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The petitioners sued the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of a regional ICE field office, the U.S. Attorney General, and various other federal officials from agencies including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The case was assigned to District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong and referred to Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym.\n\nRepresented by attorneys and legal representatives from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) and Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), the petitioners sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. They argued that the defendants’ operation involved two unconstitutional features: “roving patrols” indiscriminately rounding up numerous individuals without reasonable suspicion and denying these individuals access to lawyers, which they contended violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, respectively.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the petitioners filed a first amended complaint and an application for a temporary restraining order concerning access to counsel. The next day, on July 3, 2025, they filed a second application for a temporary restraining order focusing on unlawful stops.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Frimpong granted a temporary restraining order and order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1915964. The court concluded that the petitioners were likely to succeed in showing that the defendants had conducted roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and had denied access to lawyers, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively. The court also highlighted restricted access to counsel for individuals detained at B-18, noting that attorneys and legal representatives were often denied entry or permitted only brief, limited visits. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to cease these practices, specifically prohibiting federal agents from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation and forbidding reliance solely on four factors (alone or in combination): the district court temporarily enjoined the government from stopping people based only on four factors, alone or in combination:  race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence in certain kinds of locations frequented by the public, like bus stops, car washes, and parking lots; and type of occupation.  The order further required immigration agencies to provide detainees with access to attorneys or legal representatives seven days a week, including confidential, unmonitored telephone calls at no charge.\n\nOn July 13, 2025, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 14, 2025, they filed a motion to stay the district court’s TRO pending appeal. On July 16, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants’ motions to stay the district court’s injunction pending appeal, without prejudice. The court found that DHS and other defendants failed to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8 because they neither sought a stay pending appeal from the district court nor showed that doing so was impracticable.\n\nBack in the district court, petitioner Carlos Osorto filed an application for release from immigration custody on July 21, 2025. Petitioner Osorto argued his case was extraordinary because he withdrew his TRO request and delayed briefing based on DHS’s promise of a bond hearing, only for DHS to later deny the immigration court’s jurisdiction. After reversing course again, DHS requested a hearing, which was denied for lack of new facts or jurisdictional basis. Osorto also cited serious, persistent health issues, including dizziness, confusion, and a blood pressure reading of 190. The court granted Osorto’s application for release from immigration custody on July 30, 2025. The court found \"special and unusual circumstances,\" citing DHS’s shifting positions, Osorto’s serious health issues, and the immigration court’s repeated refusal to hear the case. The court held it had habeas authority to grant bail, found Osorto neither a danger nor flight risk, and ordered his immediate release on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring, declining to stay the order due to his condition.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants’ motion to stay the TRO, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits. However, the court agreed with the defendants that the TRO’s clause “except as permitted by law” was impermissibly vague and that they were likely to succeed on the merits of that specific challenge.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief due to a \"realistic threat\" of being stopped again without reasonable suspicion, as the harm resulted from a \"pattern of officially sanctioned behavior.\" The court noted that in the Central District of California, where the stops occurred and approximately 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, factors such as apparent race, ethnicity, language, or accent had \"limited probative value\" in establishing reasonable suspicion. The court also concluded that a person’s presence at places like car washes or bus stops, or the type of work they do, did little to arouse reasonable suspicion. Finally, the court rejected the defendants’ argument that the TRO would have a \"chilling effect\" on enforcement, finding that defendants \"cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the district court's TRO decision. The Administration argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not shown a sufficient risk of future unlawful encounters with law enforcement, and that past incidents did not establish such a risk. They claimed the district court order imposed a “straitjacket” on enforcement that was “inimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry” required by the Fourth Amendment, and that the lower court erred in holding that the four prohibited factors—again, apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, presence at locations where undocumented immigrants gather, and certain jobs like landscaping or construction—could never contribute to reasonable suspicion. They argued that actually race, ethnicity, language, etc. were appropriate factors for reasonable suspicion, but complained that under the order:\n\nThe only safe harbor for an immigration agent in the Central District of California would be to ignore the apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, and occupation of a suspected illegal alien—and thus to ignore factors that may often support reasonable suspicion in context.\n\nThey further argued that the district-wide injunction violated Trump v. CASA, Inc. (24A884), which barred such sweeping relief, noting that the August 1 order applied to all 20 million residents of the Central District rather than just the named respondents, and that it inflicted “manifest irreparable harm” by hindering enforcement and making every stop a potential “contempt trap.”\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed an amicus brief supporting the stay, arguing that the injunction misapplied the Fourth Amendment’s reasonable suspicion standard. FAIR emphasized that temporary investigative stops required only reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause, as established in Terry v. Ohio and reinforced in Kansas v. Glover.\n\nOn the same day, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and 20 other cities in the Central District of California filed an amicus brief opposing the stay. They contested the applicants’ claim that “apparent ethnicity” and language could justify stops and detentions, noting that applying this standard would have subjected over half of the Central District’s population, including millions of U.S. citizens, to detention. They further argued that the applicants’ unconstitutional actions had harmed communities by diverting local law enforcement resources, reducing public cooperation, and deterring victims and witnesses from participating in the justice system.\n\nThis case remains active at all three levels of federal court: In the Central District of California, briefing proceeds on a preliminary injunction (with a hearing scheduled for September 24, 2025), and class certification.  In the Ninth Circuit, the TRO appeal is pending. And in the Supreme Court, stay briefing concluded on August 13.",

    "summary/long": "This case is about the alleged unlawful termination, suspension, or reduction of federal research grants to University of California researchers under a series of executive orders issued by President Trump and directives from the Department of Governmental Ethics (DOGE). On June 4, 2025, a group of University of California researchers, faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Trump, DOGE, and numerous federal agencies, departments, and their heads. Judge Rita F. Lin was assigned to the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that these grant-related actions (1) exceeded presidential and agency authority in violation of the Separation of Powers, (2) infringed on academic freedom and free expression in violation of the First Amendment, (3) deprived them of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment, (4) violated statutory limitations on executive spending authority under the Impoundment Control Act, and (5) constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the enforcement of the challenged executive orders and directives, as well as reinstatement of their research funding and attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from taking any further actions to unlawfully terminate federal research grants. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked the court to restore their previously awarded grants, provide no-cost extensions for the time necessary to complete their interrupted work, and require the defendants to return to their lawful grant procedures from before January 20, 2025. These procedures included providing plaintiffs with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before termination, as well as a specific, individualized explanation for any proposed termination. The motion also sought to compel the defendants to file declarations verifying their compliance with the court's order.\n\nAlso on June 5, 2025, the plalintiffs moved for class certification, seeking to represent a proposed class of “All University of California researchers, including faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees across the University of California system whose research grants have been or will be terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced” by the defendants pursuant to Executive Orders 14151, 14154, 14158, 14168, 14173, 14217, 14238, and/or 14222, or any other Trump Administration or DOGE directives issued on or after January 20, 2025.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, Judge Lin granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification, extending the injunction to all similarly situated University of California researchers. 2025 WL 1734471. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims under the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act, noting that the defendants’ actions showed signs of \"quintessential viewpoint discrimination\". The order immediately enjoined the Trump Administration, DOGE, and the involved federal agencies from giving effect to the vacated grant terminations and prohibited any future terminations that would meet the criteria of the certified classes. It also required that the defendants restore the grants to the plaintiffs, pending the resolution of the case.\n\nOn July 10, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The following day, they filed a motion in the Ninth Circuit seeking a partial stay of the district court’s injunction, limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). They argued that the injunction was overly broad, that the First Amendment did not require the defendants to subsidize particular projects or to do so on a content-neutral basis, that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, and that the EPA’s actions were unreviewable because they were committed to agency discretion by law. The defendants asserted that the injunction caused irreparable harm to the public fisc and the Executive Branch. The defendants did not seek a stay as to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which had no plans to re-terminate grants during the appeal.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two University of California researchers whose work was affected by the terminated grants as plaintiffs. The amended filing also sought to add the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Transportation as defendants. The filing included concrete examples, identifying specific projects and their details to support the plaintiffs’ allegations of widespread and unlawful grant terminations, such as the termination of an NSF grant supplement commemorating the agency’s 75th anniversary. It also added new information about the Department of Energy, noting that the agency would review 179 awards totaling more than $15 billion to ensure consistency with the Trump Administration’s policies and priorities.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on the preliminary injunction appeal on July 31, 2025.\n\nIn the district court, on August 1, 2025, the plaintiffs moved to extend the injunction to the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation and to certify new classes of plaintiffs, introduced in the amended complaint, whose grants had been terminated by those agencies.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, in a letter brief to the court, the plaintiffs alleged that NSF had violated the June 23 preliminary injunction by indefinitely suspending hundreds of grants to UCLA researchers is a \"de facto termination\" and a \"brazen end-around\" the court's order. The letter stated that the NSF's July 30, 2025, letter to UCLA's Chancellor had suspended the grants because they were \"not aligned with current NSF priorities and/or programmatic goals,\" which the plaintiffs argued was \"indistinguishable\" from the form termination letters that the court had already deemed insufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act. An August 1, 2025, letter from the NSF further accused UCLA of noncompliance with federal statutes and regulations, citing its \"affirmative action\" policies, its failure to combat \"antisemitism and bias,\" and its allowance of transgender athletes in women's sports. The plaintiffs argued that these actions violated the First Amendment and constituted an attempt to \"penalize disfavored viewpoints.\" The letter also highlighted that the NSF had not sought a stay of the preliminary injunction and, in fact, that its attorney had told the Ninth Circuit that the NSF did not want to terminate grants, reinstate them, and then terminate them again—an assertion the plaintiffs believed misrepresented their intent.\n\nThe defendants argued that the June 23 preliminary injunction should not be extended to cover the suspension of grants to UCLA. They contended that the factual and legal basis for the suspensions was fundamentally different from the terminations at issue in the original injunction. They stated that the suspensions were based on an investigation into UCLA's alleged discriminatory practices, not on a keyword-based termination of \"equity-related\" grants. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the suspensions because none of the named plaintiffs had their grants suspended for the reasons cited in the NSF's letters. Furthermore, they asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction to modify the injunction, as it would \"materially alter the core questions of the case on appeal\" by requiring a new analysis of different claims and facts. The brief also highlighted that the suspensions were a temporary action, not a permanent termination, and that the NSF was willing to work with UCLA to bring them into compliance to prevent termination.\n\nThe following day, the court issued an order to show cause and set a hearing in the district court for August 12, 2025. After the hearing, the court ordered the NSF to vacate the grant suspensions and restore the affected class members to the status quo by reinstating their grants. The court found that the NSF’s use of “suspension” was indistinguishable from a termination, which the preliminary injunction prohibited. The court clarified that “termination” encompassed long-term or indefinite funding cuts, such as the NSF’s suspensions. The court also held that the NSF’s letters lacked grant-specific reasons for the cuts and failed to explain how researchers’ reliance interests were considered. Although the letters included boilerplate language on reliance interests, they contained no individualized analysis of harm to researchers.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants’ motion to partially stay the June 23 preliminary injunction, finding that the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits, the district court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, the plaintiffs had standing, and that the grant terminations were likely arbitrary, capricious, and viewpoint-based under the First Amendment. The court rejected the defendants’ claims of irreparable harm, reasoning that stopping unlawful practices did not qualify. By contrast, the court found that a stay would cause serious harm to the plaintiffs, including layoffs, program disruptions, and the loss of research. Finally, ithe court determined that the public interest weighed against halting taxpayer-funded projects already underway.\n\nThis case is ongoing, with the Ninth Circuit’s August 21 decision allowing grant funding to continue while the defendants’ appeal of the injunction proceeds.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged Florida's and the Trump Administration's construction of an immigration detention facility dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" in the Everglades. The facility was built in mere days, which plaintiffs alleged circumvented or ignored regulatory and environmental standards. Designed to hold up to 5,000 noncitizens at a time, the facility was located on the grounds of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Although the airport was located in Collier County, 36 miles west of Miami, it was owned by Miami-Dade County and operated by that county's aviation department. Miami-Dade County regulations limited the use of the site to aviation purposes. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stated that the facility's construction was requested, and would be fully bankrolled, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) using Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Plaintiffs alleged violations of: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); and Miami-Dade County Code.  They also alleged that defendants' actions were ultra vires (i.e., in excess of their legal authority to act).\n\nPlaintiffs were two Florida-based environmental nonprofits, Friends of the Everglades and Center for Biological Diversity. On June 27, 2025, they filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against DHS and its Secretary; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its Acting Director; the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director; and Miami-Dade County. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that defendants' actions were unlawful, an injunction against the continued construction and use of the facility for non-aviation purposes including immigration detention, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Jose E. Martinez. The same day, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction; they renewed that motion on July 17, 2025.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, Miami-Dade County filed its response. The County argued that the state of Florida had commandeered the airport under state emergency authority and that it could not use county law to restrain the state; additionally, the County contended that plaintiffs did not have a right of action to compel the County to enforce its own regulations. The same day, the Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management filed his response, arguing that plaintiffs' complaint alleged only violations of federal law which did not bind him and his state agency.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, DHS and ICE filed their response. The federal agencies argued that plaintiffs' case was likely to fail because it did not challenge a final agency action, and did not show that they would suffer an irreparable harm from the detention center's construction given Supreme Court precedent that NEPA violations do not give rise to a presumption of irreparable injury.\n\nOn July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida moved to intervene as a plaintiff in the case. The Tribe noted that Big Cypress National Preserve, which included the land co-opted to build the detention center, had traditionally been part of its home and that the center's continued construction and operation would accelerate the land's environmental degradation. The court granted the Tribe's motion to intervene on July 30, 2025.\n\nTwo days later, Judge Martinez recused himself from the case. The case was automatically reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.\n\nOn July 28, 2025, the court granted in part plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery. 2025 WL 2253243. Defendants were ordered to produce any agreements among themselves relating to Alligator Alcatraz. The next day, defendants filed a motion requesting limited reciprocal discovery from plaintiffs; that motion is still pending before the court.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, while a multi-day hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was ongoing, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' renewed motion for a limited temporary restraining order. First, it noted that it would withhold ruling on the defendants' venue challenge until the conclusion of the preliminary injunction hearing. It further rejected defendants' challenge to the court's jurisdiction, reasoning that because the plaintiffs did not seek to enjoin or restrain the operation of any immigration statute, the statute cited by the defendants to assert lack of jurisdiction was inapplicable.  As to the TRO, the court concluded that, at minimum, the federal defendants' legal control over the facility's operations, evidence that it was constructed at the request of DHS, and regular inspections of the site by ICE officials, as well as undisputed lack of prior environmental assessment under NEPA, created a sufficient likelihood of success of the merits of the APA claim to warrant preliminary relief. Citing minimal harm to the defendants from briefly suspending expansion of the facility and the difficulty of reversing course at a later date, the court entered a temporary restraining order that prohibited the state and federal defendants from installing any additional industrial-style lighting, doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing, or doing any other site expansion including placing or erecting buildings and other structures. The TRO was to last fourteen days from the date of the order or until the court entered an order on the preliminary injunction.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, after a hearing, the court granting in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 242325. First, it again found that it had jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claim, which neither challenged the fact nor the manner of detention or removal, nor sought to halt, suspend, or alter operation of any INA provision, nor otherwise challenged the defendants' authority to implement or enforce immigration laws (as would preclude jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. 1252).  Next, the court held that the defendants had waived challenge to venue in the Southern District of Florida by litigating the case on the merits for a month before raising venue issues.  Rejecting the venue argument on the merits, it reasoned that the NEPA claim did not involve \"real property\" within the meaning of the applicable venue statute and therefore that venue was proper in the Southern District as the home of plaintiff's principal place of business, and not required to lie in the Middle District of Florida, where the facility is located.  Moreover, a substantial portion of events that gave rise to the lawsuit took place within the Southern District, and some of the environmental concerns relevant to the NEPA claim would also affect the Southern District. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs met the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction. As to a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiffs' NEPA claims, the court noted that the defendants did not dispute the \"major\" environmental effects that would justify the need for an environmental impact statement or assessment.  Moreover, the decision to construct the detention camp without issuing an impact statement or conducting an assessment was a definitive position that caused actual, concrete injury to the plaintiffs' recreational and conservational interests, and therefore constituted a final agency action. In addition, evidence the federal defendants requested that the facility be built and committed federal funding precluded them from disclaiming involvement or responsibility under NEPA.  The environmental risks posed by the facility threatened irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, and the balance of equities and the public interest similarly favored granting the preliminary injunction.\n\nTherefore, the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional industrial-style lighting (so-called “Sunbelt” lighting); or doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential or administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time the order went into effect. The preliminary injunction did not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities that were made for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site. It further ordered that after no more than sixty days, and once population attrition allowed for safe implementation, the defendants were to remove 1) the temporary fencing in order to allow tribe members access to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the facility was built; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed for this project.\n\nThat same day, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, appealing the district court's preliminary injunction ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On August 23, 2025, the defendants filed a district court motion to stay the injunction pending appeal and, on August 26, 2025, they filed a similar motion in the appellate court.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the federal deployment of the California National Guard to protect federal property and immigration officials from protesters in Los Angeles and the surrounding area. On June 9, 2025, Governor Gavin Newsom and the State of California filed suit in the Northern District of North California, challenging recent actions by President Trump in deploying the National Guard in the Los Angeles area. On June 6, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers carried out multiple enforcement actions in and around Los Angeles, leading to the arrest of around 44 persons with 70-80 people detained. The same day as the arrests, crowds gathered at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles to protest the Trump Administration and its immigration agenda.  The complaint alleged that, while some protestors engaged in violence against property and law enforcement, the majority were peaceful and non-violent. Protests continued on June 7 and June 8.\n\nThe complaint alleged that Los Angeles police and sheriffs had responded to the protests and had dispersed several crowds at various places during the three days of protests. However, on the evening of June 7, despite a message on social media by Gavin Newsom stating that it was unnecessary, President Trump issued a memorandum that said because of \"numerous incidents of violence and disorder\" that had taken place in response to ICE actions, he was calling into service members of the National Guard. Under 10 U.S.C. § 12406, the President is allowed to call out the National Guard if one of three conditions is met: (1) the United States, or any of the Commonwealths or possessions, is invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; (2) there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States; or (3) the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\n\nCiting this statute, President Trump authorized the Secretary of Defense to (1) \"coordinate with the Governors of the States and the National Guard Bureau in identifying and ordering into Federal service the appropriate members and units of the National Guard under this authority,” (2) call out up to 2,000 National Guard personnel for up to 60 days, and (3) use them to perform protective activities for the protection of federal personnel and property.\n\nThat same evening, Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense, sent a memorandum to the Adjutant General of California, who commands the California National Guard under the Governor. Relying on President Trump's memo, and without the consent of the Governor, Secretary Hegseth called into service 2,000 members of the California National Guard for 60 days of service. Control of the Guard members was handed over to the General of the U.S. Northern Command, and the Guard began to arrive in Los Angeles on June 8. On June 9, Secretary Hegseth called into federal service another 2,000 Guard members, again without the consent of the California Governor.\n\nRepresented by the State's Attorney General, the plaintiffs sued President Trump, the Secretary of Defense, and the Department of Defense. The plaintiffs alleged that the President's and the agency's actions were ultra vires and exceeded the scope of their authority under 10 U.S.C. § 12406 and the Posse Comitatus Act. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants violated the Tenth Amendment and Article I, § 8 of the Constitution. Finally, the plaintiffs alleged that the agency's action violated the Administrative Procedure Act. Therefore, the plaintiffs asked the court to declare President Trump's memo, and both of Secretary Hegseth's orders relying on it, to be unlawful, to enjoin the Department of Defense from deploying the National Guard, and to award court costs.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Charles R. Breyer. On June 10, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), asking the court to maintain the status quo \"by temporarily enjoining Defendants from ordering or deploying the active-duty members of the military and federalized National Guard soldiers to patrol communities or otherwise engage in general law enforcement activities beyond the immediate vicinity of federal buildings or other federal real property.\" The court scheduled a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for June 12. After the hearing, the court issued a TRO ordering the defendants to return control of the California National Guard to the plaintiffs. The court first found that the case was justiciable and not a political question over which the courts have no oversight.\n\nTurning next to Section 12406, the court rejected the defendants' argument that there was a rebellion sufficient to sustain Section 12406, since \"violence is necessary for a rebellion, but it is not sufficient,\" and there is no evidence \"that any of the violent protestors were attempting to overthrow the government as a whole.\" The court also disagreed that Section 12406 is triggered \"when the President faces obstacles that cause him to underperform in executing the laws,\" or when \"the President faces some risk in executing the laws.\" Instead, the statute requires the President to be \"unable\" to execute the laws, and the court found that \"did not happen here.\" Finally, the court found that the defendants had failed to comply with the statute's procedural requirement that any orders federalizing state National Guard members be issued through the governor of the state. The court held that typing the phrase \"THROUGH: THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA\" at the top of the document sent to California's adjutant general was insufficient to meet the statute's requirement.\n\nThe court also agreed with the plaintiffs that the defendants had likely violated the Tenth Amendment, finding that, given its holding that the defendants had unlawfully mobilized the National Guard under Section 12406, \"the unlawful federalization of those members has interfered with the state's legitimate police power, and thus it violates the Tenth Amendment.\" Therefore, the court ordered the defendants to return control of the National Guard to Governor Newsom; however, the court stayed its order until noon the following day to provide the defendants with the opportunity to appeal.\n\nThe defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that same day, asking the court for an immediate administrative stay and for a stay pending appeal. Without explaining its reasoning, the court granted an immediate administrative stay the night of June 12. Having received briefing and heard oral argument on the defendants' motion for a stay pending appeal, the court granted the stay on June 19. While the court of appeals agreed with the district court that the case is judicially reviewable, the court stated that any review under Section 12406 should be \"highly deferential\" to any determination made by the President.\n\nApplying that standard of review, the court found that the defendants were likely to prevail on their argument under Section 12406's provision enabling the President to federalize the National Guard when he \"is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\" Contrary to the district court's holding, the court of appeals found that \"Section 12406 does not have as a prerequisite that the President be completely precluded from executing the relevant laws,\" nor does it require \"that activation is inappropriate so long as any continued execution of the laws is feasible.\" Here, the defendants presented sufficient evidence that was sufficient interference with federal agents to support the President's finding.\n\nAs to Section 12406's procedural requirement, the court found that it was likely met \"because the federalization order was issued through an agent of the Governor in the Governor's name.\" Since the order was sent to the adjutant general, who then relinquished command and forwarded the order to Governor Newsom, the court found the requirement satisfied. Given these findings, the court found that the defendants were likely to prevail on the merits, and therefore a stay was warranted. The court also ordered further briefing on the appeal to conclude, at the earliest, by August 19.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the district court, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on June 16. After the Ninth Circuit's ruling on June 19, the plaintiffs filed a supplement to their brief arguing that the district court retained jurisdiction over issues not currently on appeal, such as their arguments (not reached by the Ninth Circuit) that the defendants had violated the Posse Comitatus Act and that the deployment of the National Guard must be tied to, and last no longer than, the exigency claimed as support for the orders. The plaintiffs also requested the court to allow for discovery prior to ruling on their motion for a preliminary injunction. The court granted expedited discovery and set a trial on the merits for August 11-13, 2025.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This is one of several class action challenges to the Trump Administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (\"AEA\") to circumvent removal procedures and deport Venezuelan nationals without due process. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 12, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), the Department of State, and the Denver Contract Detention Facility, the Colorado ICE facility where the petitioners are being held.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the ACLU of Colorado, and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, the petitioners challenged the Administration’s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was “under invasion” by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Charlotte Sweeney.\n\nThis action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in J.G.G. v. Trump [../../../../case/46232/] that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.\n\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. On April 14, the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the District of Colorado while the case proceeded. The court also set a briefing schedule for the TRO motion and scheduled a hearing for April 21.\n\nJudge Sweeney issued another 14-day TRO following the April 21 hearing, prohibiting the respondents from removing petitioners and class members from the District of Colorado and requiring respondents to give petitioners and class members a 21-day notice if the government sought to detain them pursuant to the AEA. The order also directed petitioner to file any motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) within three days. The court also ordered respondents to respond to the motion for class certification by April 28, with petitioner's reply due by May 2.\n\nRespondents appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on April 23 (USCA case no. 25-1164). In the district court, respondents filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, which Judge Sweeney denied on April 24. The same day, the respondent-appellants also filed an emergency stay motion pending appeal in the Tenth Circuit, which ordered petitioner-appellee to respond by April 26, with any reply due by April 27. The Court of Appeals denied the emergency stay motion on April 29, finding that the government had not made the required irreparable-injury showing.\n\nThe petitioner filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) on April 25. The respondents filed their response five days later, and petitioner filed his response on May 2.\n\nBriefing on the class certification motion took place according to the court's schedule included in its order granting the TRO, concluding on May 2.\n\nOn May 6, Judge Sweeney certified a class of \"All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.\"\n\nJudge Sweeney examined closely each of the requirements for certifying a class, holding most importantly that the class members' risk of deportation under the Proclamation provided the required commonality. She rejected arguments that differences in other parts of class members' cases should prevent certification. She also certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2) finding that the proposed class was “sufficiently cohesive,” and that the injunctive relief the petitioners sought “would benefit them as well as all members of the proposed class in the same fashion.”\n\nJudge Sweeney also entered a preliminary injunction ordering the government not to detain, transfer, or remove petitioners and members of the certified class from the District of Colorado.\n\nJudge Sweeney found that petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits because a “invasion” under the AEA demands military action by a foreign nation government.  She held that the Proclamation fails to adequately find or assert TdA was a foreign nation or government. Judge Sweeney accepted the petitioners' allegations that they faced the risk of irreparable harm in part because of the detention conditions in El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).  In balancing the equities and public interest, Judge Sweeney found that the public interest in preventing wrongful removals—particularly where those removals exposed Petitioners and class members to harmful conditions—outweighed any harm to the government, partly because any such harm was mitigated by the government's availability to prosecute and remove noncitizens under Title 8,\n\nIn reaching this decision, Judge Sweeney rejected the government's argument that the petitioners lack standing because they were not at the time of the hearing designated as falling under the Proclamation. Judge Sweeney concluded “there is a  substantial risk that the harm of being subject to the Proclamation will arise—despite [Petitioners’] current designation as individuals who do not fall under it.”\n\nJudge Sweeney also rejected respondents' broad challenges to jurisdiction on the basis that the petition constituted an unconstitutional challenge to presidential power, the political question doctrine, and several other broad attacks on the court's jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 7, the government appealed the injunction and class certification to the U.S. Circuit Court for the Tenth Circuit (Case No. 25-1265).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "Executive Order 14251, issued by President Trump on March 27, 2025, revoked collective bargaining rights for the majority of federal workers, citing “national security” as justification. Section 3 of the Executive Order specifically excluded employees of certain “agency subdivisions” within the Department of State and USAID from the protections of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). On the same day, the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum guiding departments and agencies on implementing the Executive Order, including identifying which agencies and subdivisions were to be excluded. This lawsuit challenges Executive Order 14251.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), a federal labor union that represents approximately 18,000 foreign service members, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Trump, the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The plaintiffs claimed that the Executive Order exceeded the President's authority, violated the Separation of Powers, and infringed on First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to bar defendants from enforcing the Executive Order or any accompanying guidance. Judge Paul L. Friedman presides over the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the Executive Order was ultra vires because it effectively repealed the FSLMRS without a valid national security justification, a power reserved for Congress, thereby violating the Separation of Powers. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged the Executive Order constituted politically motivated retaliation, issued in response to the union's opposition to administration policies. Citing a White House “fact sheet” that described federal unions as “hostile” and at “war” with the President’s agenda, the plaintiffs claimed the Executive Order violated their First Amendment rights and sought to punish the union for defending the nonpartisan integrity of American diplomacy.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the Executive order caused irreparable harm, including the deprivation of statutory rights to organize and bargain collectively, the loss of 86% of the union’s revenue from dues, the forced return of union officers to regular duties, the potential closure of AFSA’s offices and loss of records, and member confusion over whether union representation remained available. The plaintiffs maintained that an injunction served the public interest, noting that Congress recognized collective bargaining as essential to the effective conduct of public business. The plaintiffs emphasized that preserving the status quo would not harm the defendants, whereas the union and its members would suffer significant injury without relief.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, blocking implementation of Section 3 of the Executive Order. The court held that the Order was ultra vires and that the union and its members would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the defendants sought an immediate administrative stay and a stay pending appeal of the preliminary injunction. That same day, they also filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in the district court.\n\nThe defendants contended that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the Foreign Service Act (FSA) provides the exclusive procedures for labor-management claims, which must be heard by the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board. They maintained that the Executive Order was lawful, as the President has discretion under the FSA to exclude agencies for national security reasons, and that the court erred by failing to defer to this determination. The defendants further argued that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate irreparable harm, noting their ability to collect dues and potential for reimbursement, while the injunction itself harmed the President by restricting his national security prerogatives. Finally, they asserted that the equitable factors overwhelmingly favored a stay, claiming that the district court had usurped a national-security authority statutorily entrusted to the President.\n\nWith Judge Friedman unavailable, the motion was referred to Judge Randolph D. Moss. On May 30, 2025, Judge Moss deferred ruling, noting that defendants’ week-long delay in seeking a stay undermined their claims of irreparable harm. He explained that Judge Friedman’s absence and the D.C. Circuit’s expedited consideration made deferral appropriate, though Friedman could revisit the matter upon his return.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, Judge Friedman denied the motion for a stay, finding that the defendants had not shown a likelihood of success on appeal. 2025 WL 1695059. The court held that any harm to the defendants was minimal, as the injunction preserved the status quo by maintaining collective bargaining rights established by Congress. While noting that a related D.C. Circuit case, National Treasury Employees Union [../../../../case/46319/], No. 25-5157, recognized potential irreparable harm in a national security context, the court distinguished that case, concluding the defendants had not demonstrated comparable harm here. In contrast, the plaintiffs would suffer “immense and irreparable injury” without an injunction, including disrupted communications with union representatives, loss of official time for union officers, and termination of union dues deductions, all of which impeded the union’s core mission. The court rejected the defendants’ reliance on National Treasury Employees Union, noting that a cited “Frequently Asked Questions” document was inapplicable.\n\nHowever, on June 20, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal. 2025 WL 1742853. The court reasoned that “foreign affairs are critical to national security,” and that the defendants were likely correct in asserting that the Executive Order was consistent with the Foreign Service Act’s delegation of national-security determinations to the President. The court emphasized that review of such decisions should be highly deferential, since they implicated the President’s core Article II responsibilities. On July 14, the plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing en banc, which the court denied on July 30.\n\nBack in the district court, on August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.\n\nThe case remains ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This is a case about the federal government's alleged retaliation against labor unions for opposing President Trump’s policy agenda.\n\nOn April 3, 2025, several labor unions, representing hundreds of thousands of federal employees nationwide, including veterans' healthcare workers, defense personnel, and regulatory staff, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Donald Trump, multiple federal agencies, and their heads. The plaintiffs, including AFGE, AFSCME, NNOC/NNU, SEIU, NAGE, and NFFE, challenged Executive Order 14180, titled “Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Programs,” signed on March 27, 2025, alleging that it unlawfully retaliated against their protected speech in support of civil servants and violated the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Separation of Powers Doctrine. They also alleged statutory overreach under 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b) of the Civil Service Reform Act, claiming the order targeted them for engaging in protected activity such as litigation, public criticism, and union advocacy. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, vacatur of the order, and attorneys’ fees. Judge James Donato was assigned to the case\n\nThe Exclusion Order targeted nearly 40 federal departments and sub-agencies—including the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Justice, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services—citing national security grounds. However, the complaint alleged that the order was pretextual and driven by political animus, referencing the administration’s rhetoric and social media statements attacking “hostile unions” and “grievance filers.” The order also uniquely authorized only a few departments, such as DOD and VA, to restore bargaining rights to specific subdivisions, leaving thousands of workers' rights in limbo.\n\nIn parallel, the Trump administration filed a related lawsuit in Waco, Texas, seeking to nullify collective bargaining agreements with local union affiliates, underscoring a coordinated legal strategy. Plaintiffs in the California case argued that these actions reflected a broader campaign to dismantle the statutory framework protecting federal labor-management relations established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause, accompanied by 50 supporting declarations from affected workers. On April 25, the government filed its opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the March 27 Executive Order was a lawful exercise of presidential authority in the interest of national security. In response, the court ordered both parties to submit by May 2 a joint statement identifying any other pending lawsuits challenging the Executive Order and to address potential coordination under local rules.\n\nOn June 24, 2025, Judge Donato granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1755442. The court rejected the government’s argument that Congress had precluded judicial review by providing administrative review through the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). It explained that the FLRA has authority “over those disputes which arise under Chapter 71,” but the Executive Order “expressly removed the employees of the listed departments, agencies, and subdivisions from Chapter 71’s coverage.” As a result, the court concluded it was “not precluded from exercising jurisdiction.”\n\nThe court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on their First Amendment retaliation claim, noting they engaged in protected activity by “frequently speak[ing] against actions undertaken by President Trump and his administration since January 2025.” It concluded the government’s conduct would “chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in protected activity” and that the evidence raised “a serious question whether the agency exclusions in EO 14251 constitute retaliation for protected speech.” Thus, the court held the plaintiffs had shown a serious First Amendment issue warranting preservation of the status quo pending further litigation. As such, the court declined to address the plaintiffs’ other arguments and enjoined the implementation of Section 2 of the EO. It also required the plaintiffs to post a $60,000 bond.\n\nOn June 26, 2025, the government appealed to the Ninth Circuit, seeking both an administrative stay and a stay pending appeal. The government also sought a stay from Judge Donato, which was denied. On July 7, the Ninth Circuit granted the government’s administrative stay pending the appeal, without providing an explanation.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit granted the government's motion for a stay pending appeal. 2025 WL 2180674. The court found that the government was likely to succeed on the merits, reasoning that even if the unions could show a prima facie case of retaliation, the President would have issued the order regardless of the unions' protected speech due to national security concerns. The court also found that the government would suffer irreparable harm without a stay, as an injunction would \"tie the government's hands\" in a national security context. Regarding the harm to other parties, the court found that any injury to the unions would be mitigated, as terminated collective bargaining agreements could be reinstated and a pause in dues collection could be managed by voluntary payments and future monetary damages. Finally, the court determined that a stay would serve the public interest by \"preserving the President's autonomy under a statute that expressly recognizes his national-security expertise.\"\n\nThis case remains ongoing in the district court and Ninth Circuit.",

    "summary/long": "In this case, two organizations involved in research about education policies, practices, and methods sued the Department of Education and its Secretary. The plaintiffs challenged actions taken by the Department regarding the Institute for Education Sciences (IES) and its centers. Under the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA), the Department, through IES, is charged with conducting, assessing, collecting, and disseminating research about education practices and policies in the U.S. \"Through IES and its Centers, Congress sought to improve both the quantity and quality of educational data collection.\"\n\nOn March 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14,242, titled \"Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities.\" In this order, President Trump instructed the Secretary \"to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, [to] take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education.\" In keeping with this directive, the Department canceled most of IES's contracts with independent contractors that it used to collect, analyze, and publish educational data. On March 11, the Department also announced a Reduction in Force of nearly 50% of its workforce.\n\nOn April 24, 2025, the plaintiffs filed suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged that the Department's actions \"will limit the availability and access of significant datasets that are needed to identify, investigate, evaluate, and improve educational outcomes.\" Furthermore, the plaintiffs alleged that the Department's actions would prevent the IES from carrying out its instructions from Congress to collect and disseminate educational data. Therefore, the plaintiffs argued that the defendant's actions exceeded statutory authority, were not in accordance with law, and were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs also claimed the actions violated the Constitution's separation of powers principles and exceeded the agency's statutory authority under ERSA. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare that the defendants had violated the APA, to enjoin the defendants from refusing to fulfill contracts or destroying any datasets in existence, and to order the defendants to reinstate cancelled contracts and a sufficient workforce to carry out the IES's duties.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Trevor N. McFadden. On May 2, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, telling the court that any delay in granting relief would cause them irreparable harm, given the President's directives to the Department. On May 5, the defendants moved for a stay. The defendants pointed to another related case that was also assigned to Judge McFadden, Association for Education Finance and Policy v. McMahon, [../../../../case/46342/] arguing that since the plaintiffs in both cases had moved for preliminary injunctions seeking identical relief, the court here should stay the proceedings until a decision was reached in the other case on the preliminary injunction. On May 6, Judge McFadden denied the defendants' motion for a stay. Judge McFadden said that the defendants had only argued that they would suffer hardship from having to litigate two similar cases at the same time, which does not warrant a stay. Furthermore, the judge said that comity concerns do not exist in this case, since both matters were before the same court, rather than before courts in different jurisdictions.\n\nOn May 19, the judge held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court denied the plaintiffs' motion on June 3, finding that the plaintiffs were \"seeking wholesale correction of general agency operations and bundling together claims to pursue outsized relief.\" Rather than bringing a claim against a discrete agency action as required by the APA, the plaintiffs were challenging a programmatic decision, the reduction of workforce and services by the Department. Therefore, the court found that the plaintiffs were not bringing a justiciable claim under the APA, dooming their request for a preliminary injunction based on the APA.\n\nTurning to the plaintiffs' constitutional claims, the court also found them deficient, stating that \"if every statutory compliance issue triggered separation of powers concerns, virtually all APA cases would balloon into disputes of constitutional proportions.\" Instead, the plaintiffs' constitutional claims in this case were simply statutory violation claims in disguise. Therefore, the court found that the plaintiffs failed to state a plausible claim for relief under the Constitution. Given these deficiencies, the court said the plaintiffs were unlikely to prevail on the merits of their claims and denied their request for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1568301.\n\nThe plaintiffs next filed an amended complaint on July 21. The amended compliant removed many of the general allegations of illegal activity by the defendants, instead focusing on ten specific studies and datasets used by the plaintiffs. The amended complaint focused on these ten datasets, their purposes, their use by the plaintiffs, and how their use had been hindered by the defendants' actions. The plaintiffs' claims for relief follow this updated structure, arguing that the defendants' actions in ceasing to provide access to these datasets were arbitrary and capricious under the APA. Finally, the amended complaint also restructures the relief sought, seeking specific injunctions for each of the datasets.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged a rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that allegedly endangered 24 million Americans' health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). CMS, which is a subagency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), proposed the challenged rule in March 2025, soon after the Trump Administration took office. The rule, entitled \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability,\" allegedly added several roadblocks to the acquisition of ACA health insurance; these included new fees, reductions in the enrollment period, and even a revocation of the ACA's central promise that any American can purchase health insurance. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nPlaintiffs the City of Columbus, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the City of Chicago, Doctors for America, and the Main Street Alliance filed this lawsuit on July 1, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit named HHS, its Secretary, CMS, and its Administrator as defendants. Plaintiffs were represented by Democracy Forward. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the CMS rule was unlawful under the APA; vacatur of the rule; a stay of, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against, the rule's enforcement; and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Brendan Abell Hurson.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting a stay, or alternatively a preliminary injunction, of the new CMS rule. The municipal plaintiffs argued that as healthcare providers of last resort for those who lose insurance under the new rule, the rule would bestow a heavy financial burden on them. The organizational plaintiffs argued that the rule would make it harder for them to pay their employees or to receive adequate compensation for healthcare services rendered.\n\nThe court held a hearing on the requested preliminary injunction on August 14, 2025. On August 22, 2025, it issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion and entering a stay enjoining certain provisions of the CMS rule that were to take effect on August 25. 2025 WL 2426382. It reasoned that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their challenges to seven provisions of the rule, but that they failed to show likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to warrant preliminary relief as to their remaining challenges to two other provisions of the rule. As to the seven, the plaintiffs had also shown that they faced irreparable harm – economic harms that could not adequately be remedied at the conclusion of litigation –  and that the balance of the equities and the public interest weighed in favor of a stay.\n\nFirst, the court found that Main Street Alliance and the city plaintiffs had standing based on the increased premiums and uncompensated care costs that would be \"predictable results\" of the challenged provisions. Next, it addressed the plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits of their claims across three categories: (1) challenges to provisions that eroded the value of coverage, including a provision imposing a $5 monthly surcharge to reconfirm eligibility, a provision revising the premium adjustment methodology, and a provision revising the actuarial value policy; (2) challenges to provisions that imposed barriers on enrollment, including a provision requiring enrollees to pay past-due premiums before receiving new coverage and a provision adding verification requirements for some enrollments; and (3) challenges to provisions that limited the availability of subsidized coverage, including a provision re-instituting a policy regarding failure-to-reconcile tax data and two provisions requiring heightened income verification under certain circumstances.  As to the first category, the court held that CMS lacked authority to impose the challenged fees, which were untethered to the statutory formula, and that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by revising the actuarial value policy because it provided an insufficient and conclusory rationale for the changes. However, the court concluded that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim that the provision revising premium adjustment methodology was arbitrary and capricious because the agency provided the necessary and reasoned explanation for the changes. As to the second category, the court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their challenge to past-due payment requirements, because the agency was not authorized to create a new exception to the ACA’s categorical guaranteed-issue rule, and to the verification requirements provision because defendants’ rationale for imposing the requirements was not indicative of reasoned decision-making. As to the third category, the court first held that plain text of the ACA contradicted the agency’s failure-to-reconcile provision, and therefore that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the provision was imposed contrary to law. Next considering the agency’s decision to rescind an automatic 60-day extension to reconcile income verification data, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the agency had misinterpreted its modification authority. The court did find, however, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the agency acted arbitrarily by instituting additional verification requirements for income below the federal poverty line and by rescinding a regulation requiring acceptance of self-attestation of projected household income because those changes were made without sufficient data justifying the need to impose them and in light of the agency’s circular reasoning and conclusory statements offered in support of the changes.\n\nUltimately, the court held that the appropriate course of action was to temporarily stay the seven challenged provisions as to which it found likelihood of success on the merits, postponing the effective date until final resolution of the lawsuit.  It reasoned that the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision in  CASA  [../../../../case/45965/] did not preclude such relief, because that decision did not limit a court’s ability to preliminarily set aside new agency rules under the APA. On August 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to clarify the scope of the preliminary injunction, which the court granted that same day, amending its August 22, 2025 order as clarified to order that the effective dates of the following provisions of the rule were stayed pending resolution of the merits of the case:\n\n• The imposition of a $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees, through the addition of 45 C.F.R. § 155.335(a)(3) and (n) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.330(j);   • The revocation of guaranteed insurance coverage for individuals with past-due premiums, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 147.104(i);   • The failure to reconcile policy in 45 C.F.R. § 155.305(f)(4), including the final rule’s amendments to that policy through the addition of 45 C.F.R. § 155.305(f)(4)(iii);   • The imposition of eligibility verification for the special enrollment period, through the revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.420(g);   • The imposition of a requirement that Exchanges verify household income inconsistencies when a tax filer’s attested projected annual household income differs from “trusted data sources,” through revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.320(c)(3)(iii) and the addition of 45 C.F.R. § 155.320(c)(3)(vi)(C)(2);   • The changes to the de minimis ranges for actuarial value calculations, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. §§ 156.140(c), 156.200(b)(3), and 156.400;   • The changes to the policy regarding self-attestation of projected income, through revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.320(c)(5).\n\nThe effective dates of the following provisions were not stayed:\n\n• The change to the measure for calculating the premium adjustment percentage set forth in 90 Fed. Reg. 27,166 through 27,178;     • The elimination of the 60-day extension of time to resolve inconsistencies in household income data, through the removal of 45 C.F.R. § 155.315(f)(7) and revisions to 45 C.F.R. § 155.320(c)(5).\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "The lawsuit arose from a series of government directives beginning in February 2025 aimed at terminating NIH-funded research on topics and populations the administration disfavored, including “gender identity,” “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” (DEI), “vaccine hesitancy,” and studies involving certain foreign entities. According to the complaint, these directives followed President Trump’s January 2025 executive orders seeking to end equity-related programs and grants. The plaintiffs alleged that, in response, NIH issued guidance instructing staff to identify and terminate grants in these categories, abruptly ending ongoing projects—many years in progress with substantial financial and time investments—and refusing to consider certain pending applications, including those aimed at diversifying researcher backgrounds.\n\nSince January 2025, NIH has also canceled grant application meetings, indefinitely postponed future ones, and withheld final decisions on applications already approved through the standard review process. The agency sent hundreds of letters to grant recipients at public research institutions in the plaintiff states, terminating previously issued grants because they “no longer effectuate agency priorities.” The plaintiffs argued these actions lacked scientific justification and disregarded established NIH protocols, which normally require non-compliance or cause to justify termination.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, sixteen states filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its Director, and numerous federal agencies responsible for conducting and supporting biomedical research. Judge Brian E. Murphy was initially assigned to the case, but recused himself on May 1, 2025. The case was later reassigned to Judge William G. Young.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Separation of Powers doctrine, and the Spending Clause. They alleged that the defendants’ actions violated the APA by unlawfully withholding or unreasonably delaying agency action, taking action contrary to regulation or statute, and engaging in arbitrary and capricious conduct.\n\nThe plaintiffs initially filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), but on April 8, 2025, filed an assented-to motion withdrawing their TRO request and asking the court to approve a briefing schedule for a motion for a Preliminary Injunction (PI). On April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, along with a motion for a PI. The amended complaint expanded the original claims by directly linking NIH's grant disruptions to executive orders targeting DEI and gender identity. It reframed the case as a challenge to unlawful \"blacklisting directives\" and sought broader relief, including the invalidation of those directives.\n\nA hearing on subject matter jurisdiction was held on May 8. On May 12, the court issued an order affirming its subject matter jurisdiction. On May 29, a joint statement of counsel was filed, outlining an agreed-upon plan for resolving the grant termination issues (Phase 1) and identifying a dispute regarding how to handle the unreasonable delay claims (Phase 2). Each party submitted their respective proposals.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, the court held a Phase 1 bench trial and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs by vacating the challenged government directives. Pursuant to the court's order, the plaintiffs submitted a proposed judgment, which the court reviewed and modified. On June 18, the plaintiffs submitted a revised proposed judgment reflecting the court's modifications for further review.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs’ Phase 2 unreasonable delay claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. They also requested an expedited response deadline of June 26.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, the court adopted the plaintiffs’ revised proposed judgment, holding that the challenged directives and resulting grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, and therefore void, unlawful, and without legal effect. The court further ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs on Count Three of their amended complaint.\n\nThe defendants appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that same day and subsequently filed a motion in the district court to stay the judgment pending appeal. The court denied the motion, finding that a stay would result in irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, in the First Circuit, defendant-appellants filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, along with a request for an immediate administrative stay. The First Circuit denied the request for immediate relief the following day, stating that it would rule on the broader motion for a stay pending appeal as soon as practicable.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the First Circuit denied to stay the district court’s judgment pending appeal. The court concluded the defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits: the case involved declaratory and equitable relief under the APA, not a contract dispute for money damages, and agency discretion arguments were forfeited or limited by statutory requirements. The court upheld the district court’s finding that NIH’s grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, noting undefined prohibited research categories, lack of scientific justification, and interference from a non-NIH group, as well as unaddressed reliance interests of grantees. While the defendants might suffer some financial harm, the court held this was outweighed by irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, including lost research, euthanized animal subjects, and delayed clinical trials. Granting a stay would substantially injure plaintiffs, and the public interest favored enforcing federal law and preserving critical, life-saving research.\n\nOn July 24, 2025, the defendants filed a Supreme Court stay application, arguing that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction and citing Department of Education v. California as precedent. They contended that the Court of Federal Claims, not a district court, was the proper forum for suits seeking government payments and that the district court’s decision amounted to “judicial second-guessing” of the administration’s policy priorities.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court partially granted and partially denied the stay application. The court stayed the district court’s judgments vacating the government’s termination of research grants, reasoning that the court likely lacked jurisdiction over claims based on a contractual “obligation to pay money,” which belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the government would face irreparable harm if funds were disbursed. However, the court denied the stay for judgments vacating the NIH guidance documents, finding that the government had failed to show irreparable harm from their vacatur. The decision was closely divided: Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh favored granting the stay in full; the Chief Justice and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson favored denying it in full; and Justice Barrett concurred in the partial grant and partial denial.\n\nThe case remains ongoing, with Phase 2 claims regarding unreasonable delays and pending appeals still unresolved.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the abrupt dismantling of the federal government's primary education research agency. On April 4, 2025, the Association for Education Finance and Policy, Inc. and the Institute for Higher Education Policy filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. They sued the U.S. Department of Education under various laws, primarily the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and raised constitutional concerns. Represented by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the plaintiffs sought a court order to stop the Department of Education's actions and to restore the functions of the research agency. They argued that the Department was acting illegally by shutting down the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), an agency created by Congress. This case was assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Congress established IES in 2002 to conduct and share high-quality research, statistics, and evaluations related to education from early childhood through postsecondary study. The plaintiffs, organizations that rely on IES research for their work in education finance, policy, and higher education access, claimed that the Department of Education took several actions that effectively halted IES's operations. These actions included the mass cancellation of contracts that supported IES research, the elimination of approximately 90% of IES staff positions, and the termination of remote access for outside researchers to existing data. The plaintiffs argued that these actions exceeded the authority of the Department, violated specific laws, and were made without proper reasoning.\n\nThe lawsuit outlined five legal claims:\n\n• The plaintiffs asserted a non-statutory claim arguing that the defendants' actions were ultra vires, meaning they went beyond their legal powers and encroached upon the authority of Congress, which created IES.   • They claimed that the defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by acting contrary to law, specifically the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 and the Higher Education Opportunity Act, which established IES and its responsibilities.   • The plaintiffs argued that the defendants' actions were arbitrary and capricious under the APA because they offered no reasoned explanation and failed to consider the impact on researchers and other stakeholders who rely on IES.   • They claimed a violation of the APA based on the Impoundment Control Act, alleging that the defendants unlawfully rescinded or deferred funds appropriated by Congress for IES.   • Lastly, the plaintiffs asserted a violation of the APA based on the Anti-Deficiency Act, arguing that the defendants illegally refused to spend funds Congress had allocated to IES.\n\nThe plaintiffs asked the court to declare the defendants' actions unlawful and to issue several orders. These included orders to restore the terminated contracts, vacate the reduction in force of IES employees, and reverse the termination of remote access to restricted-use data. They also requested the court to prevent the defendants from taking any further actions that would hinder IES's ability to perform its legally required tasks and sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to immediately stop the shutdown of IES. Additionally, they asked for their legal costs and attorney’s fees to be covered.\n\nSubsequently, on April 17, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, detailing the harm the plaintiffs and their members were already experiencing due to the lack of access to IES data and the cancellation of research programs.\n\nOn June 3, Judge McFadden denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the plaintiffs were \"improperly bundling together a series of actions for wholesale correction rather than challenging one 'circumscribed [and] discrete' action.\" Instead of bringing a challenge to a discrete and final agency action, the plaintiffs brought a “challenge [to] an entire program by simply identifying specific allegedly-improper final agency actions within that program.\" The court also rejected the plaintiffs' constitutional claims, finding that they were simply repackaged APA claims to the \"entire program.\" Since the plaintiffs' APA claims failed, so too did the constitutional claims. Therefore, the court found that the plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, which doomed their request for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1568301.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 18. The amended complaint challenged the termination of eight specific programs run by the Department of Education: (1) the termination of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study;  (2) the termination of the 2020/25 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study; (3) the termination of the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009; (4) the termination of the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 2022; (5) the termination of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten: 2024; (6) the termination of IES’s peer review program for new grant funding; (7) the termination of IES’s program for remote access to restricted-use data; and (8) the termination of processing applications for access to restricted-use data. The amended complaint added/removed factual allegations and causes of action under the APA to match the new focus of the complaint.\n\nOn July 2, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the court still lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' claims under the Tucker Act, and that the plaintiffs still were making a programmatic challenge, rather than a challenge to a discrete, final agency action as required by the APA.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on July 16. The second amended complaint removed the challenges to two of the terminations mentioned in the first amended complaint: the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study and IES's program for remote access to restricted-use data. The amended complaint also added more concrete allegations detailing how the remaining terminations caused harm to the plaintiffs and emphasized that the plaintiffs were challenging the final agency action of terminating the programs. Given the second amended complaint, the court denied as moot the defendants' motion to dismiss and ordered them to file a renewed motion by August 19.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

Through career technical programs, career counseling, and apprenticeship programs, the Job Corps currently serves around 25,000 students.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, the plaintiffs, including national trade organizations and unions, companies with contracts with DOL relating to the Job Corps, Job Corps training center operators, and one current Job Corps student, filed suit in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs challenged multiple actions taken by the DOL that the plaintiffs allege were intended to shut down the Job Corps, such as halting background checks as required for new students, canceling pending or outstanding Job Corps procurements, terminating the provision of internet services, drastically reducing DOL's budget for Job Corps, and canceling contracts with Job Corps center operators. The notices of contract cancellation directed the centers to send students home and to begin the shutdown of the centers.\n\nRepresented by private and in-house general counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the DOL's actions exceeded its statutory authority, were contrary to law, and were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, and also that they were ultra vires and a violation of the Constitution's separation of powers. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare the defendants' actions unlawful, to enjoin the defendants from taking any steps to eliminate the Job Corps program, and to award the plaintiffs their court costs.\n\nThe plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on June 3. The case was assigned to District Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr., who granted the plaintiffs' motion on June 4. The court enjoined the defendants from giving effect to the elimination of the Job Corps program, or from taking any further actions to eliminate the program without Congressional authorization. The court also set a hearing for June 17 on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. After the hearing, the court extended the TRO until June 25 and ordered the parties to file a status report on June 20.\n\nThe court granted a preliminary injunction on June 25. The court found that at least some of the plaintiffs had standing and that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the suit. Turning to the merits, the court found that the defendants' actions effectively closed, rather than terminated, the centers. Because the defendants had attempted to close the centers, the court held that they were required by statute to meet certain procedural requirements, which were not met here. Therefore, the court announced that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the defendants had acted to contrary to law. As to the scope of the injunction, the court ruled that the injunction would be nationwide, but \"will not supersede any contrary ruling by the court in the District of Columbia or any other federal circuit or district courts outside of the Second Circuit.\" Finally, the court rejected the defendants' request to immediately stay its ruling pending appeal since the request was not fully briefed at the time of its ruling.\n\nOn June 27, the court ordered the parties to file letters discussing how, if at all, the Supreme Court's decision in Casa Inc. v. Trump, which held that that universal injunctions \"likely exceed the authority conferred [on District Courts] by the Judiciary Act,\" impacted the injunction issued by the court in this case. The plaintiffs filed their letter on June 30, arguing that Casa should have no effect in this case since (1) the injunction here was based on the APA, which was not addressed in the Supreme Court's decision; and (2) the injunction here was not overbroad since \"setting aside Defendants’ decision to eliminate Job Corps is necessary to accord complete relief to the plaintiffs in this case.\" The defendants filed their letter on July 11, arguing that \"this Court’s injunction is impermissibly overbroad because it extends beyond the plaintiffs to preclude the government from acting with respect to non-parties.\" The defendants also claimed that the injunction was not entered under the APA; instead, the court \"granted a preliminary injunction under its traditional equitable authority, an authority that CASA made clear is limited to providing relief to the parties themselves.\"\n\nOn July 11 and July 17, two pro se individuals, students who were either attending or planning to attend Job Corps Centers, moved to intervene in the case.\n\nAfter hearing oral argument on July 23, the court amended the preliminary injunction on July 24. The court ruled that the injunction applied \"to the 31 centers covered by the Operator Plaintiffs and the 5 additional centers at which Plaintiff Transportation Communications Union/IAM provides training services.\" The court enjoined the defendants \"from enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to the closure of the private Job Corps centers, including the stop work orders and termination and non-renewal notices delivered to Job Corps center operators starting May 29, 2025, from issuing, enforcing, implementing, maintaining or giving effect to any shutdown tasks, job terminations, or student removals; and from taking any further action to close any Job Corps Centers.\" The court ordered the parties to file a schedule on how to proceed in the case on August 1.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case raises urgent questions about the scope of presidential authority over trade and the constitutional rights of Indigenous communities living along the U.S.–Canada border. On April 4, 2025, two members of the Blackfeet Nation—Montana State Senator Susan Webber and rancher Jonathan St. Goddard—filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Montana against the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in her official capacity. Represented by private counsel, plaintiffs challenged a series of executive actions issued by President Donald Trump that imposed tariffs on goods entering from Canada. The plaintiffs argue that the tariffs unlawfully burden commerce and travel essential to Blackfeet citizens and violate longstanding treaty protections and constitutional guarantees.\n\nThe challenged actions include multiple executive orders and proclamations—collectively referred to as the “Canada Orders.” These include: (1) Executive Order 14193 (Feb. 1, 2025), which declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA); (2) Proclamations 10895 and 10896, which levied 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act; and (3) Executive Order 14257 (Apr. 2, 2025), which introduced reciprocal tariffs to counter perceived trade imbalances. Plaintiffs claim these measures, which apply universally without exemptions for Indigenous trade, violate constitutional principles and federal treaties.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert multiple legal theories. First, they argue that the President lacked statutory authority to impose tariffs of this scale and scope. Specifically, they contend that IEEPA does not authorize universal tariffs unrelated to a clear foreign threat and that the Trade Expansion Act's delegation of power under Section 232 cannot justify these broad economic measures. Second, they allege that the executive actions violate the separation of powers by encroaching on Congress’s exclusive authority over foreign commerce under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.\n\nIn addition to constitutional structure, the plaintiffs raise claims under the Due Process Clause. They argue that the tariffs impose arbitrary and sweeping economic burdens without procedural safeguards or individualized assessment. The complaint also references historical protections under the Jay Treaty of 1794, the Treaty of Ghent (1814), and early federal tariff acts that explicitly exempted Indigenous trade from duties. The plaintiffs maintain that these protections remain valid, self-executing treaty rights that predate and override later conflicting executive actions.\n\nTo support their claims, the plaintiffs filed declarations and affidavits documenting the concrete harms caused by the tariffs. These include rising business costs, lost tourism income, and disrupted family and trade relations across the northern border. In particular, Senator Webber emphasized the disproportionate impact on the Blackfeet Nation, whose homelands, commerce, and kinship networks span both sides of the U.S.–Canada border.\n\nPlaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, they asked the Court to declare key portions of the Canada Orders unconstitutional, enjoin their enforcement, and, alternatively, exempt tribally enrolled members or tribal border crossings from the tariffs. They also sought attorneys’ fees and any other relief deemed just and proper.\n\nThis case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Dana L. Christensen. On April 4, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary and permanent injunction. On April 11, they filed an amended complaint adding four additional plaintiffs: Ryan Biederman, Andrea Bocanegra, David Greer, and Lisa Ruelas. On April 14, the government moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade and requested a stay of proceedings pending that decision. Plaintiffs opposed both motions, arguing that their constitutional and treaty-based claims require resolution in a federal district court with jurisdiction over constitutional and equitable claims.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the Montana Farmers Union (MFU) moved the court to intervene as a party-plaintiff.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the court granted the defendants' motion to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade and denied their motion to stay as moot. Plaintiffs immediately appealed the transfer order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and filed a motion in the district court for a preliminary injunction pending appeal. On April 28, plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the transfer order. That same day, the district court denied their request for a preliminary injunction pending appeal.\n\nIn the Court of Appeals, plaintiff-appellants filed a motion for injunctive relief on May 1, 2025. Defendant-appellees filed a motion to dismiss that same day. On May 23, the court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice and ordered that all appellate proceedings, except for mediation, be stayed pending the district court's ruling on the timely tolling motion filed on April 28, 2025.\n\nOn June 2, the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. Following this, plaintiffs filed a motion to expedite in the Court of Appeals, arguing that the stay previously entered was moot in light of the district court's ruling. They requested that the Court of Appeals set an expedited briefing schedule on the merits of their appeal and grant their fully briefed motion for a preliminary injunction. The motion for an expedited briefing schedule was granted on June 18.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the removal of three former Commissioners of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). On May 21, 2025, the commissioners filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against President Donald Trump, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Acting Chairman of CPSC. All three Plaintiffs had been nominated by President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate and were only removable \"for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause.\" However, on May 8, 2025, two of the commissioners received emails from the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel stating that their positions were terminated but giving no explanation. On May 9, the third commissioner attempted to enter his office at CPSC but was prevented. Eventually, the Acting Chairman of the CPSC called and informed him that his position had also been terminated. The plaintiffs alleged that their terminations were ultra vires and in excess of the President's constitutional and statutory authority and requested the court to declare the terminations unlawful and to enjoin the defendants from taking any action to effectuate them.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Matthew J. Maddox. Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on May 21, asking the court to reinstate them for the pendency of the litigation. After a hearing on May 27, the court declined to implement temporary or preliminary relief but set an expedited briefing schedule on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on June 13, 2025, rejecting the defendants' argument that the statutory \"for-cause\" restriction on the president's removal power was unconstitutional. The court found that the exception on the removal power articulated in Humphrey's Executor, where the Supreme Court \"upheld tenure protections for officers of multimember bodies with quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative functions,\" was relevant here. Even though the Supreme Court has \"revisit[ed] and recast[ed] some views articulated in Humphrey's Executor,\" the court found that it remained good law and required the court to \"examine the characteristics of the agency before the court.\" Therefore, the court turned to whether the Humphrey's Executor exception applied to the CPSC.\n\nThe court found that the CPSC fell within the Humphrey's Executor exception due to its characteristics. First, the CPSC is a \"multi-member body of experts, balanced along partisan lines and appointed to serve staggered, seven-year terms,\" like the FTC, which was found constitutional in Humphrey's Executor. This structure was quite different from that of the CFPB with its single director, which was found unconstitutional in Seila Law. Second, the CPSC's functions also supported this conclusion, since the CPSC performed \"quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial\" functions like those of the FTC. The court also rejected the defendants' argument that CPSC's ability to prosecute civil and criminal enforcement actions in federal court distinguished it from the FTC, since the CPSC's ability to bring such actions \"is restricted by the consent and involvement of the Attorney General, who is accountable to, and subject to at-will removal by, the President.\"\n\nFinally, the court rejected the defendants' argument that the CPSC wielded such significant executive power as to remove it from the Humphrey's Executor exception, since an agency's structure must also be considered, and here the agency's structure strongly weighed in favor of finding the CPSC constitutional. The court therefore held that, given the \"historical pedigree\" of CPSC's structure as an \"independent agency headed by a multimember board or commission,\" the \"for-cause\" tenure protection was constitutional.\n\nGiven these findings, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, issuing a declaratory judgment that the plaintiffs were unlawfully removed and a permanent injunction reinstating the plaintiffs to their positions as CPSC commissioners. 2025 WL 1677099.\n\nOn June 16, the defendants appealed the court's judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and asked Judge Maddox to stay his order pending the result of their appeal. The defendants also filed a motion in the Fourth Circuit asking for an immediate administrative stay and for a stay pending appeal.\n\nJudge Maddox denied the defendants' motion for a stay on June 23, finding that the \"Defendants offer no new evidence or argument to persuade the Court that it erred in its ruling\" on the plaintiffs' summary judgment. Therefore, the court found the defendants unlikely to prevail on the merits of their argument and denied the motion to stay.\n\nOn July 1, the Fourth Circuit also denied the request for a stay. Without elaborating on its reasoning, the court denied both the request for an immediate administrative stay and a stay pending appeal. In concurrence, Judge Wynn rejected the defendants' argument that Humphrey's Executor had been overruled, stating that, as \"the district court thoroughly explained, the Commission’s statutory removal protections remain constitutional under Humphrey’s Executor and its progeny. That precedent remains binding on this Court unless and until the Supreme Court overrules it.\"\n\nOn July 2, the government went to the Supreme Court, repeating its request for a stay pending appeal and for an immediate administrative stay. The government argued that the Supreme Court's stay in Wilcox v. Trump [../../../../case/46045/], where the Court stayed injunctions ordering the reinstatement of members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), should be controlling in this case as well, since the board members here also exercise considerable executive power, \"for instance, by issuing rules, adjudicating administrative proceedings, issuing subpoenas, bringing enforcement suits seeking civil penalties, and (with the concurrence of the Attorney General) even prosecuting criminal cases.\" The government also pointed to the harm it would suffer if the board members were allowed to remain during the pendency of the litigation, since the removed board members would, and already have since their restatement, act against President Trump's agenda. \"Given the disruption at the CPSC ensuing from on-and-off reinstatement and termination of Commissioners comprising a majority of the agency,\" the government requested a stay. The plaintiffs filed their response to the government's request for an immediate administrative stay that same day.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed with the government on July 23 and granted a stay pending appeal and any petition for a writ of certiorari. The Court held that the \"application is squarely controlled by Trump v. Wilcox. Although our interim orders are not conclusive as to the merits, they inform how a court should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases.\" Here, the Court found that the case was equivalent to the facts of Wilcox, where the Court held that \"the Government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.\" Since the CPSC exercises \"executive power in a similar manner\" to the National Labor Relations Board at issue in Wilcox, the Court found that the same result should be reached here. Justice Kagan dissented, joined by Justices Sotomayor and Jackson.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenges the Trump Administration’s abrupt termination of hundreds of federal grants in April 2025. On May 21, 2025, five nonprofits filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and the Office of Justice Programs and its acting head. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' actions exceeded their executive authority and violated the Due Process Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Amit Mehta.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that in April 2025, defendants abruptly terminated more than 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants awarding more than $820 million in essential funding to the plaintiffs and other nonprofits. The terminated cooperative agreements and grants cut across a broad array of critical programs, including violence reduction and intervention, policing and prosecution, victims' services, juvenile justice and child protection, substance use and mental health treatment, and other public safety programs. Also on May 21, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, and on May 22, a motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nPlaintiffs sought both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to stop defendants from implementing their mass termination of the cooperative agreements and to restore or preserve funding for affected grantees while the case proceeded. They also sought declaratory relief, asking the court to declare that defendants’ actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act because they were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and failed to follow required procedures. Finally, plaintiffs requested an award of attorneys’ fees and litigation costs.\n\nOn June 6, 2025, a coalition of 33 amici curiae, including several local governments, filed a brief supporting plaintiffs’ motion. The brief highlighted the critical importance of the terminated grants for public safety, victim services, and violence-reduction initiatives. In their response, defendants dismissed the amici curiae brief as irrelevant, arguing that the dispute concerned routine contract administration rather than a broad, unlawful policy change, and therefore did not warrant extraordinary judicial intervention.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and to deny plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. defendants argued that the court lacked jurisdiction and that plaintiffs’ claims were likely to fail on the merits. Additionally, defendants contended that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. Later that day, plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief addressing a recent Supreme Court decision (Dep’t of Education v. California), which defendants had cited to argue that district courts lack jurisdiction to order payment of federal grant funds. plaintiffs argued that other forms of relief—such as reinstating grants—remained available.\n\nOn June 26, 2025, the court held a hearing on all pending motions, including the motions for class certification and a preliminary injunction, as well as the government’s motion to dismiss. Then, on July 7, 2025, the district court granted the government’s motion and dismissed the case. 2025 WL 1865160. Judge Mehta held that plaintiffs lacked a valid cause of action to compel reinstatement of federal funding under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThere is no doubt in the court’s mind that OJP’s award terminations were unfair and indiscriminate. When a government agency, especially the Department of Justice, agrees to fund private organizations to carry out a public purpose, such organizations expect regularity and respectful treatment. That is not what occurred here. The court laments that the limits of its own power prevent it from helping plaintiffs and similarly situated grantees. But the court cannot cure an injustice by exceeding its own authority.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed the district court’s July 7 decision to the D.C. Circuit on July 8, 2025 and filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal on July 11.\n\nPlaintiffs similarly sought an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal in the district court on July 10, 2025, arguing that, despite the dismissal, the district court’s memorandum opinion indicated that all factors supporting injunctive relief were present. Plaintiffs asserted that the grant terminations had already caused, and would continue to cause, severe irreparable harm, including layoffs of specialized staff, elimination of critical programs, and damage to organizational reputations. They provided specific examples of harm, such as increased homicides in King County, Washington, following the layoffs of gang outreach specialists; FORCE Detroit’s inability to intervene in gun violence; HRiA’s loss of resources for violence interruption efforts during the summer; and Stop AAPI Hate’s accelerated layoffs and program cuts amid rising threats against Asian-Americans. plaintiffs noted that the district court itself had concluded that defendants’ actions were “likely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence.”\n\nPlaintiffs also argued that both the public interest and the balance of equities strongly supported injunctive relief. They noted that the district court itself had described defendants’ abrupt and unexplained termination of the grants as “unquestionably arbitrary,” “shameful,” and “unfair and indiscriminate.” plaintiffs further emphasized that serious legal questions remained. They pointed out that the court’s own opinion suggested their Administrative Procedure Act claims were likely meritorious, having found defendants’ actions “arbitrary, at least in lay terms” and “indiscriminate.” Although the district court denied preliminary relief based on a perceived lack of jurisdiction, it acknowledged that its conclusion was “far from obvious” and that other district courts within the Circuit had interpreted the controlling Supreme Court decision (California III) differently, highlighting a substantial question warranting injunctive relief pending appeal. Finally, plaintiffs asked the court to waive any bond requirement, arguing that a bond would impede access to judicial review and further harm organizations already suffering from the funding cuts.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the district court denied the plaintiffs’ emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal but granted a narrower, stipulated injunction. The court found that plaintiffs had not met the high bar for such an “extraordinary remedy,” emphasizing that this was not a “rare” case warranting that relief. It concluded the threat of irreparable harm was not “so grave” as to justify an affirmative injunction, noting no plaintiff claimed they would be forced to close without the funding. The court also observed that plaintiffs had not addressed the jurisdictional ruling in depth and cited no case granting an injunction pending appeal after dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. However, because the parties agreed to a more limited injunction, the court barred defendants from re-obligating or diminishing the terminated grant funds. It declined to require an injunction bond, reasoning that the order did not compel any public expenditures the government might be unable to recover.\n\nIn the appellate court, on August 1, 2025, the D.C. Circuit denied the plaintiffs' emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, stating that the appellants did not satisfy the stringent requirements for such an injunction. Specifically, the court found that the appellants had not substantiated their claims of irreparable harm.\n\nThe case remains ongoing in the district court and the D.C. Circuit.",

    "summary/long": "This case is one of numerous lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s abrupt termination of immigration visas—mostly student or work visas—with no notice to the visa-holders and with dubious or no legal basis. You can see all of the cases here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38954&ordering=-summary_approved_date].\n\nOn April 11, 2025, four international students holding F-1 visas filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Acting Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs claimed that the termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the terminations, restore their legal status, and prevent further irreparable harm. Judge Steven White presides over the case.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order. They argued that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious because the government failed to provide individualized notice, consider relevant facts, or justify its decisions, and improperly relied on visa revocation, which was not a permissible basis under agency regulations and guidance. Second, they asserted a due process violation, claiming a protected interest in their F-1 status and SEVIS records that was taken away without notice, explanation, or an opportunity to respond. Third, they alleged an equal protection violation, contending that the terminations unlawfully discriminated against Chinese students, who were disproportionately targeted without evidence of security threats or regulatory violations, and were treated differently from similarly situated students of other national origins.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order for 14 days. 2025 WL 1150697. During that period, the defendants were barred from arresting or incarcerating the four plaintiffs, transferring them outside the Northern District of California, or imposing any legal effect from the termination of their SEVIS status or the potential unlawful revocation of their visas. The court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Administrative Procedure Act claim, finding that the defendants had not demonstrated compliance with regulatory requirements for SEVIS termination and that visa revocation alone did not justify such action. The court emphasized that although three plaintiffs had been arrested, none had been convicted of a crime. The court further held that the plaintiffs faced a strong likelihood of irreparable harm because their studies and work were threatened and they risked immediate arrest and deportation. The  court declined to reach the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, finding the APA claim sufficient to warrant relief, and limited the order to the four named plaintiffs rather than granting nationwide relief.\n\nThe court later extended the temporary restraining order until May 15, 2025.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction and expanded the earlier TROs into a nationwide injunction. 2025 WL 1467543. The court held that termination of a SEVIS record effectively ended F-1 status, rejecting the defendants’ argument that it served only as a “red flag.” The court pointed to DHS’s own materials and guidance from SEVP-approved institutions showing that terminated records invalidated both student status and work authorization. The order barred the government from arresting, detaining, or transferring the plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals outside their jurisdictions of residence, from imposing legal consequences based on terminated SEVIS records, and from reversing reinstated records of those maintaining status.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 29, 2025, the plaintiffs added three new plaintiffs to the lawsuit and named the Director of the U.S. Department of State Visa Services Office, as a new defendant. The amended filing expanded the claims to directly challenge the Department of State’s role in the SEVIS terminations by targeting the underlying visa revocations. The plaintiffs also sought new relief, asking the court to order the Secretary of State to restore their revoked F-1 visas as well as those of similarly situated individuals.\n\nOn July 30, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for an amended preliminary injunction that shifted the focus of the case to the Department of State’s role in visa revocations. They argued that the Department unlawfully relied on 8 U.S.C. § 1201(i) to revoke thousands of F-1 visas, contending that the statute was intended only for visas of individuals who had not yet entered the United States. Although the court’s earlier injunction restored SEVIS status, the plaintiffs emphasized that the revoked visas continued to cause harm by preventing international travel and risking re-entry denial. The motion included new declarations from three recently added plaintiffs describing these harms. The plaintiffs requested that the injunction be expanded to block any legal effect from the visa revocations and to require restoration of the revoked visas.\n\nOn August 8, 2025, the defendants moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. They argued that they were likely to succeed on appeal because the injunction was flawed, particularly in its nationwide scope, which they claimed conflicted with the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc. They further contended that the plaintiffs had not shown irreparable harm since ICE had already reinstated their SEVIS records, and that the injunction was vague and overbroad by restricting arrests and transfers for any reason, including unrelated criminal violations. Finally, they asserted that a stay served the public interest by preserving law enforcement authority and protecting public safety. The defendants asked the court to stay three parts of the injunction: its nationwide scope, the prohibition on arresting or transferring the plaintiffs for reasons beyond SEVIS terminations, and the restriction on terminating SEVIS records for reasons unrelated to the Student Criminal Alien Initiative.\n\nThis case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenges the alleged illegal termination of grant money for state and jurisdictional humanities councils by the United States DOGE Service.\n\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) was established by Congress in 1965 with the declaration that \"The arts and the humanities belong to all the people of the United States\". The goal was to provide funding for research, publication of scholarly works, and the promotion of the humanities. Congress also created a statutory framework to protect the agency from political influence. In 1972, Congress amended the NEH statutes to create grants-in-aid programs for each state and territory, which led to the funding of state and jurisdictional humanities councils. The Federation of State Humanities Councils, founded in 1977, is a non-profit organization that includes almost all of the 56 state and jurisdictional humanities councils as members. The Federation's mission is to advocate for increased investment in and engagement with this national network, and to support and amplify the work of its members. An example is the Oregon Council for the Humanities (Oregon Humanities), a non-profit corporation created in 1971 to distribute NEH funds for public humanities projects throughout Oregon.\n\nExecutive Order 14158, signed on January 20, 2025, by President Trump, created the \"United States DOGE Service\" (DOGE) as part of the Executive Office of the President. Following the order, the chair of the NEH was directed to resign in March 2025, and the NEH was allegedly instructed to review grants issued since 2021 for potential violations of new executive orders. This review allegedly resulted in the termination of nearly all grants to state and jurisdictional councils in March and April 2025, halting their operations and prompting the filing of this lawsuit.\n\nOn May 15, 2025, the Oregon Council for the Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against DOGE and its Acting Administrator, the NEH and its Acting Chairman, and the National Council on the Humanities. They argued that the termination of the grants violated the National Council on the Humanities' grant statute, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Separation of Powers, and exceeded DOGE's legal authority. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought an order directing the NEH to follow proper procedures for grant applications and funding, to continue providing funds appropriated by Congress to the Federation's members, and to set aside the unlawful termination of grants. The case was assigned to Judge Michael Howard Simon.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that DOGE illegally “gutted the NEH and terminated almost all grants issued to the state and jurisdictional councils” without reasoned analysis or proper notice and opportunity to appeal as required by law. They argued that these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Separation of Powers, as Congress, not the President, has the power to create agencies and direct how federal funds are spent. The plaintiffs claimed that the NEH could not refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress and that the delays and grant terminations caused “irreparable harm” to the Federation and its members, including councils terminating staff, canceling events, and risking permanent closure due to the loss of millions of dollars in already-awarded funding.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 11, 2025, underscoring the central role of federal grants in their work and including a table of congressional appropriations through 2024 to demonstrate Congress’s ongoing support for the program. The amended complaint also added a new section addressing NEH’s purported “rescission” on June 2 of the 2025 grant terminations, contending that the rescission letters were largely boilerplate, lacked individualized analysis, and still resulted in significant funding cuts while maintaining the rescission of other types of grants. Finally, the amended complaint introduced a new claim for relief under the Impoundment Control Act and the Appropriations Clause, asserting that the grant terminations were ultra vires.\n\nOn June 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that they were likely to succeed on the merits. They also claimed that they would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction, citing the need for councils to terminate staff, cancel events, and face potential permanent closure. They also argued that the balance of equities and public interest favored the injunction, as it would prevent unlawful agency action and protect the humanities.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, the states of Oregon, Maryland, Washington, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Vermont, and the District of Columbia filed a brief supporting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, citing unlawful termination of NEH grants to their humanities councils. The brief emphasized the cultural and legal interests at stake, the councils’ close ties to state governments, and argued the court had jurisdiction because the claims rested on statutory and constitutional grounds, not contract law, making the Tucker Act inapplicable. It supported the plaintiffs’ showing of likely success, irreparable harm, and a public interest in preserving funding, noting specific harms such as program pauses and potential cancellation of the nation’s 250th anniversary celebrations.\n\nOn August 6, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, specifically citing violations of the Separation of Powers doctrine, the Impoundment Control Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. 2025 WL 2237478. The court rejected the defendants' argument that they had the discretion to terminate grants, emphasizing that the Executive Branch cannot refuse to spend congressionally appropriated funds. Furthermore, the court agreed that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction and that the public interest favored the injunction to prevent unlawful agency action and to protect the humanities.\n\nThe case is ongoing.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenges federal agencies' imposition of alleged unlawful funding conditions on federal grants related to domestic violence, sexual assault, and homelessness services.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, several nonprofit organizations that receive federal grants to serve victims of domestic violence, victims of sexual assault, and homeless individuals filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary; the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and its Acting Assistant Secretary; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its Acting Director; the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) and its Administrator; and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and its Secretary. The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and were ultra vires. Judge Melissa R. DuBose presides over the case.\n\nPlaintiffs challenged funding restrictions imposed by the Trump Administration, including anti-Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEI/DEIA) requirements; \"Gender Ideology\" conditions, as defined in Executive Order 14168; and a \"HUD Abortion Condition\" that restricts the use of grant funds for elective abortions, following Executive Order 14182. Plaintiffs claimed these restrictions were ideologically motivated and designed to advance the Administration’s agenda, rather than to further the statutory purposes of the underlying grant programs. They claimed the conditions were unlawful, arbitrary and capricious, and untethered to the authorizing statutes, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nPlaintiffs argued that these conditions placed them in an untenable position: either fundamentally alter their programming or lose essential federal funding—jeopardizing critical services and displacing survivors from safe housing. They further contended that the executive branch unilaterally imposed these restrictions without congressional authorization, violating the separation of powers.\n\nIn addition, plaintiffs claimed the conditions were unconstitutionally vague, offering no clear guidance on prohibited conduct or enforcement standards, and thereby opening the door to arbitrary and discriminatory application. They also asserted that the rules violated the First Amendment by compelling grantees to endorse the Administration’s views on gender and chilling speech related to DEI. Finally, they argued that the restrictions conflicted with federal statutory mandates requiring services for “underserved” and “racial and ethnic minority” populations and were adopted without complying with the Administrative Procedure Act’s procedural requirements.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the new conditions were unlawful, as well as an order vacating and setting them aside, along with the defendants’ decision to include them in individual award programs. They also sought a stay of the conditions as applied in agency policies, funding opportunities, and grants, and requested preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the defendants from including or enforcing the conditions in any funding notices or awards.\n\nAlongside the complaint, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to block enforcement of the new conditions. They argued that immediate relief was necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the communities they serve, including the loss of housing and essential services. They reiterated that the conditions unlawfully compelled speech, threatened the stability of life-saving programs, and created confusion due to vague and unclear standards.\n\nA hearing on the motion for a temporary restraining order was held on July 24, 2025, and Judge DuBose granted the motion on July 28. 2025 WL 2104144. The court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed, at risk of immediate irreparable harm, and entitled to access their grant funding without the new HUD and HHS conditions after weighing the hardships and public interest. The temporary restraining order barred HUD from enforcing conditions related to gender ideology and elective abortions for Continuums of Care grants, and barred HHS and ACF from enforcing a condition requiring Family Violence Prevention and Services Act grant recipients to advance or promote DEI or related ideologies. The court declared these conditions null, void, and rescinded, and ordered defendants to take immediate compliance steps.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the challenged conditions. They specifically targeted HUD policies that barred grantees from using funds to promote “gender ideology,” as defined in Executive Order 14168; prohibited the use of funds for elective abortions under Executive Order 14182; and required certification that DEI-related activities would not violate federal antidiscrimination laws. They also challenged HHS policies requiring grantees to certify that they do not operate programs promoting DEI or “discriminatory equity ideology,” and to affirm compliance with Executive Order 14168 as a condition of Title IX funding.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Judge DuBose issued a revised TRO that clarified the scope of the earlier order and restated the specific prohibitions against HUD, HHS, and ACF in enforcing the challenged grant conditions. 2025 WL 2262896. Later that day, the court granted a third motion to amend the TRO, and the parties were instructed to appear for a virtual chambers conference on August 8. 2025 WL 2301661.\n\nA hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for September 4, 2025.",
