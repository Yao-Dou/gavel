    "46567": "On May 5, 2025, a Venezuelan asylum applicant detained at the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island, filed a habeas petition and complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island challenging the federal government’s plan to summarily remove him under a Presidential Proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). The case is before Judge Melissa R. DuBose (Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan is also assigned). The petitioner, proceeding under a pseudonym, is represented by the ACLU Foundation, the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island (with cooperating counsel), and pro hac vice national ACLU counsel. The respondents are federal officials and agencies responsible for immigration enforcement and detention, including the President (official capacity, declaratory relief only sought), the Attorney General, DHS and ICE leadership (including the Boston Field Office), the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Department of Defense, and the warden of Wyatt.\n\nThe suit arises from a March 2025 Presidential Proclamation titled “Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua.” The Proclamation designates Venezuelan nationals age 14 and over alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang (excluding lawful permanent residents) as “alien enemies,” authorizing immediate removal without the procedures of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The petitioner alleges that DHS has accused him—based on tattoos and an “Alien Enemy Validation Guide” checklist—as a TdA member; he denies any gang affiliation, has no known criminal history, and has a pending asylum, withholding, and Convention Against Torture (CAT) application. He was arrested at work on March 26, 2025, and his bond was denied on May 1, 2025, after DHS asserted TdA affiliation; he was not permitted to testify at that hearing. He fears imminent AEA designation and removal, potentially to El Salvador’s CECOT prison, citing prior removals carried out on March 15, 2025, when at least 137 Venezuelan men were sent to El Salvador.\n\nLegal foundation and claims: The petition proceeds under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas), the AEA (50 U.S.C. §§ 21–24), the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act/CAT (8 U.S.C. § 1231 note), the All Writs Act (28 U.S.C. § 1651), the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. § 2201), and the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. Causes of action include: (1) ultra vires action under the AEA because TdA is not a “foreign nation or government” and there is no “declared war,” “invasion,” or “predatory incursion” within the Act’s terms (50 U.S.C. § 21); (2) violation of the INA’s “sole and exclusive” removal procedures (8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3)); (3) interference with the statutory right to apply for asylum (8 U.S.C. § 1158); (4) violation of mandatory withholding of removal protections (8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)); (5) violation of FARRA/CAT (8 U.S.C. § 1231 note); (6) violation of the AEA’s departure/grace period requirement (50 U.S.C. § 22); (7) Fifth Amendment due process violations (lack of adequate notice and opportunity to contest designation); and (8) violation of the right to habeas corpus and the Suspension Clause. The petitioner does not seek release from detention or to halt his immigration court proceedings; he challenges only removal under the AEA.\n\nRemedies sought include: a temporary restraining order and injunction barring his removal under the Proclamation and barring transfer out of the District; a writ of habeas corpus enjoining removal under the AEA; a declaration that the Proclamation is unlawful; an order requiring at least 30 days’ advance notice and an opportunity to respond to any AEA designation before removal; and attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act.\n\nProceedings: The petition and an emergency TRO motion were filed May 5, 2025. That same day, Judge DuBose issued an order requiring at least 48 hours’ advance notice to the Court before moving the petitioner outside the District of Rhode Island. After a public hearing on May 7, 2025, the Court amended the order to require at least 72 hours’ advance notice to both the Court and the petitioner, calculated only on business days, before any move outside the District, “until otherwise ordered.” The Court has not yet ruled on the TRO’s merits. Government counsel entered appearances on May 13 and 15, 2025. A transcript of the May 7 hearing was filed on May 19, 2025.\n\nFactual context: The petitioner asserts that the AEA Proclamation was published March 15, 2025, and that DHS attempted and, in at least one instance, completed removals before publication. He alleges the Proclamation provides no process to contest gang “membership,” displaces statutory protections under the INA and CAT, and relies on an English-only notice process that gives only 12 hours’ warning of removal and 24 hours to file habeas if the detainee expresses intent to file—procedures the petitioner contends do not satisfy due process. He also alleges the government is using a point-based “Alien Enemy Validation Guide” focused on tattoos and similar attributes to identify TdA “members,” and that experts have questioned the reliability of those criteria.\n\nRelated cases: The filings cite multiple decisions addressing the same Proclamation and issues. Notably, the Supreme Court vacated a nationwide TRO but emphasized detainees’ entitlement to due process and advance notice sufficient to “actually” seek habeas relief before removal, Trump v. J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. 1003, 1006 (Apr. 7, 2025). Other cited rulings include district court decisions granting TROs or preliminary injunctions and finding the Proclamation likely exceeds AEA authority or violates due process, such as J.A.V. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1257450 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2025); D.B.U. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1163530 (D. Colo. Apr. 22, 2025), and G.F.F. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1166480 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2025), amended by 2025 WL 1166911 (Apr. 11, 2025). The D.C. Circuit denied a stay of a TRO before the Supreme Court’s vacatur, J.G.G. v. Trump, 2025 WL 914682 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 26, 2025).\n\nCurrent status and interim relief: No final ruling has issued on the TRO or the merits. The operative order requires at least 72 hours’ business-day notice to the Court and the petitioner before any move outside the District of Rhode Island, preserving the Court’s ability to adjudicate the habeas petition.",
    "46582": "On April 30, 2025, a Palestinian national in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody filed a verified petition for writ of habeas corpus and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division (Case No. 3:25-cv-01072-L-BT). She is confined at the Prairieland Detention Facility in Alvarado, Texas. The respondents are federal immigration and law-enforcement officials (including the heads of the Department of Homeland Security and ICE), the U.S. Attorney General, the acting director of ICE’s Dallas Field Office, and the Prairieland warden. The petitioner is represented by private counsel with civil-rights organizations (Waters Kraus Paul & Siegel; Texas Civil Rights Project; Southern Poverty Law Center; CUNY School of Law; Muslim Advocates). This is an individual action, not a class case.\n\nThe petition alleges that the government detained her on March 14, 2025—one day after she voluntarily appeared at ICE’s Newark office—because she had participated in an April 2024 demonstration near Columbia University and once sent $1,000 to a relative in Palestine (February 2022). She had lawfully entered the United States in 2016 (initially in B-2 status, then F-1) and contends she withdrew from her student program in 2022 based on erroneous advice. According to the petition, federal agents in March 2025 investigated her social media and personal contacts and found no “national security” violations beyond the single remittance to a family member. After serving her with a Notice to Appear for immigration court in Batavia, New York, ICE transferred her overnight to Texas. The petition asserts this transfer contravened ICE’s own detainee-transfer policy because she had immediate family and counsel in the Northeast and no documented need for an inter-field-office transfer.\n\nThe petitioner alleges that her confinement is a product of a broader federal initiative announced in early March 2025 to target noncitizens perceived to support Palestinian rights. She cites executive orders issued in January 2025 and public statements by senior officials as evidence of viewpoint-based targeting. She further alleges that, during her detention, she has been denied halal meals and basic prayer accommodations, that men enter her dorm without notice while she is not wearing a hijab, and that the facility is overcrowded with poor sanitation and inoperable fixtures. She reports substantial weight loss and adverse health effects. The petition states that an immigration judge granted her release on April 3, 2025, upon a $20,000 bond—finding she was neither a flight risk nor a danger—but that ICE appealed and invoked the automatic stay provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(i), preventing her release pending the Board of Immigration Appeals’ review.\n\nCauses of action and legal bases: (1) habeas under 28 U.S.C. § 2241; (2) First Amendment (retaliation for speech and association related to Palestinian-rights advocacy); (3) Fifth Amendment procedural due process (challenging the automatic-stay regime that prevents effectuation of the immigration judge’s bond order without contemporaneous neutral review); (4) Fifth Amendment substantive due process (alleged lack of a permissible, nonpunitive justification for continued civil detention after the bond grant); and (5) the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c), against the facility warden and ICE field-office director for substantially burdening her religious exercise (halal meals and prayer accommodations). The petition invokes the Suspension Clause, the All Writs Act, and the Declaratory Judgment Act. Remedies sought include a writ of habeas corpus ordering immediate release; preliminary injunctive release pending final judgment; declarations that the detention violates the First and Fifth Amendments and RFRA; injunctive relief requiring religious accommodations; and an order restricting re-detention absent notice and a clear-and-convincing showing.\n\nProceedings: The court referred the case to Magistrate Judge Rebecca Rutherford; District Judge Sam A. Lindsay is the presiding district judge. On May 5, 2025, the petitioner moved for a preliminary injunction ordering release pending final judgment. The court set and held a hearing on June 5, 2025 (no witness testimony; attorney argument only). The court allowed public remote audio access and permitted the petitioner to attend remotely from the facility, but declined to issue a writ for her physical presence. On June 27, 2025, Magistrate Judge Rutherford issued Findings, Conclusions, and a Recommendation (FCR) that the district court grant the motion and order the petitioner’s immediate release from immigration detention pending a final judgment on the habeas claims. The court also issued an Order to Show Cause requiring the government to answer the habeas petition. Both sides filed objections and responses. On July 16, 2025, Judge Lindsay recommitted the matter to the magistrate judge to address new issues raised after the FCR. The court subsequently modified the briefing schedule (amended pleadings due August 18, 2025; responses due September 2, 2025; replies due September 9, 2025). As of the latest docket entries, the preliminary-injunction motion remains pending before the district court, and the merits have not been adjudicated.\n\nAdministrative immigration context: The petitioner alleges ICE’s own Risk Classification Assessment rated her a low public-safety and low flight risk; an immigration judge granted bond; and ICE’s appeal triggered an automatic stay that may extend up to 90–130 days without contemporaneous neutral review, during which she remains detained in Texas far from her home and counsel.\n\nRelated or cited matters: The petition cites contemporaneous litigation involving other noncitizens or residents allegedly targeted in similar circumstances, including Öztürk v. Trump, 2025 WL 1145250 (D. Vt. Apr. 18, 2025) and Mahdawi v. Trump, 2025 WL 1243135 (D. Vt. Apr. 30, 2025), among others. These cases are not consolidated with this action.\n\nJudge information: Magistrate Judge Rebecca Rutherford (hearing and FCR); District Judge Sam A. Lindsay (orders and recommittal). No trial has been held, and no appeal has been taken. No settlement or monitoring arrangement has been entered.",
    "46496": "On April 24, 2025, three nonprofit organizations—a human rights advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., a coalition of organizations serving U.S.–Mexico border communities, and a New York legal services provider—filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Secretary of Homeland Security. The case was assigned to Judge Ana C. Reyes.\n\nThe suit challenges DHS’s March 21, 2025 shutdown of three DHS oversight offices established by Congress: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS Ombudsman), and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO). According to the complaint, DHS placed virtually all staff of the three offices on administrative leave with separation dates of May 23, 2025, halted their work (including complaint intake and investigations), and terminated related contracts. The nonprofits allege they regularly used these offices to file complaints, obtain case assistance, and advocate for clients and communities, and that the shutdown forces them to divert resources to more costly, less effective avenues.\n\nLegal foundation and claims. The nonprofits bring (1) a non‑statutory ultra vires claim alleging DHS exceeded its authority by eliminating or disabling offices that Congress created and funded; and (2) Administrative Procedure Act claims under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) (agency action in excess of statutory authority) and § 706(2)(A) (arbitrary and capricious action). The complaint cites the statutes establishing and governing the three offices—6 U.S.C. § 345 and 42 U.S.C. § 2000ee‑1 (CRCL), 6 U.S.C. § 272 (CIS Ombudsman), and 6 U.S.C. § 205 (OIDO)—and alleges the closures also implicate separation‑of‑powers concerns by nullifying congressional directives. In seeking preliminary relief, the nonprofits also argued the actions violated the Impoundment Control Act and the Anti‑Deficiency Act. They request declaratory and injunctive relief setting aside DHS’s actions, reinstating employees and contractors necessary to perform the offices’ statutory functions, prohibiting further steps that hinder those functions, and preserving federal records; they also seek fees and costs.\n\nFactual context. The pleading describes the statutory duties of each office: CRCL’s civil rights/civil liberties complaint intake, oversight, training, and reporting to Congress; the CIS Ombudsman’s case assistance and systemic‑recommendations role with USCIS and annual reporting; and OIDO’s independent detention‑conditions complaint work, unannounced inspections, recommendations to ICE and CBP, and annual reporting. Congress specifically appropriated funds for these offices in FY 2024. The complaint alleges that, on March 21, 2025, nearly all staff in the three offices received reduction‑in‑force notices (with May 23 separation dates) reflecting “dissolution” of their offices, pending complaints were frozen, and outside observers—including members of Congress—raised concerns. A DHS spokesperson publicly stated the offices were closed because they obstructed immigration enforcement.\n\nProceedings. On May 8, 2025, the nonprofits moved for a preliminary injunction to stop DHS from terminating the offices’ functions, to reinstate employees/contractors, to resume complaint processing, to preserve records, and to restore removed materials to the offices’ websites. Judge Reyes set expedited briefing, held an evidentiary hearing on May 19–20, and took the motion under advisement. On May 23, with RIF separations imminent, the nonprofits also sought a temporary restraining order (TRO). After a same‑day hearing with testimony from DHS officials, the Court denied the TRO without prejudice but ordered the parties to provide concrete updates on posting vacancies and restaffing to enable performance of statutory functions.\n\nStatus reports filed May 27 and June 2 reflected DHS’s position that, following the RIF, the offices could post new positions, were seeking detailees, and were moving to restaff; the nonprofits expressed concern that staffing remained insufficient to perform statutory duties and that job postings restricted eligibility to current DHS employees. The nonprofits also alerted the Court that DHS’s FY 2026 congressional budget justification stated OIDO “has been eliminated in its entirety” and projected only “interim” funding focused on severance and leave payouts for the other two offices, which they argued conflicted with DHS’s assurances in this litigation. The Court held a status conference on June 12 and ordered DHS to explain whether and how it communicated with the Executive regarding the budget language; DHS submitted an ex parte declaration on June 16, and a redacted version was filed publicly. The nonprofits responded on June 18, noting continued inconsistencies between public statements and litigation positions and reporting that detention facilities had removed posted information on contacting CRCL and OIDO.\n\nAmicus participation. Multiple states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief supporting the nonprofits’ motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nRulings and current posture. On July 11, 2025, the Court granted a joint motion setting an expedited schedule for discovery and cross‑motions for summary judgment and denied the preliminary‑injunction motion as moot in light of that schedule. The Court ordered the administrative record be filed by August 22, 2025 (filed), set motions to compel by September 5, 2025, and scheduled summary‑judgment briefing through December 2025, with argument to be set for January 2026. On August 1, 2025, the nonprofits moved for partial reconsideration of the order denying their preliminary‑injunction motion as moot; briefing on that request concluded by August 22, 2025. No reported opinions have issued, there has been no trial, and there are no appeals.\n\nContext and alleged harms. The nonprofits describe specific pre‑ and post‑shutdown matters they would have brought to the oversight offices, including civil rights complaints regarding detention conditions, medical care, alleged retaliation against detainees, and confidentiality violations under 8 U.S.C. § 1367, as well as routine USCIS case‑assistance needs. They assert the shutdown has halted statutory complaint intake, inspections, recommendations, and annual reporting; increased their costs; and deprived affected individuals and communities of congressionally mandated oversight mechanisms. DHS maintains the offices continue to exist and are being restaffed; the nonprofits contest that assertion, citing the RIF notices, restrictions in job postings, the FY 2026 budget language, and continued delays in core functions.",
    "46432": "On April 18, 2025, a Bangladeshi F‑1 student at Minnesota State University, Mankato filed a habeas petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota challenging his immigration detention. He sued federal executive officials responsible for immigration enforcement (including the President, the Attorney General, the heads of DHS, State, and ICE and local ICE officials) and local jail officials (the county sheriff and jail administrator holding him under an ICE contract). He was represented by a private law firm together with civil‑rights and human‑rights organizations (ACLU of Minnesota; The Advocates for Human Rights) and a law school clinic. The federal defendants were represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office; the sheriff by the county attorney.\n\nThe petition was brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and alleged three primary grounds: (1) a First Amendment violation—retaliatory arrest and detention for his protected political speech in support of Palestinian human rights; (2) a Fifth Amendment due process violation—detention without individualized justification and use of procedures that deprived him of liberty without adequate process; and (3) an Administrative Procedure Act violation—arbitrary and unlawful termination of his SEVIS student status. He sought a writ ordering release, as well as temporary relief barring transfer or removal.\n\nThe factual record showed he lawfully entered on an F‑1 visa in 2021 and was in good standing until DHS officers arrested him on March 28, 2025, shortly after he posted pro‑Palestinian content on social media. Immediately thereafter, his SEVIS record was terminated, initially citing failure to maintain status and a “foreign policy” ground, which later shifted in SEVIS to “OTHER – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked.” The State Department issued a March 23, 2025 memo revoking his visa “effective immediately” in response to DHS’s request, based on an old misdemeanor disorderly conduct matter; the memo indicated DHS intended to “immediately pursue removal.” In immigration court, an Immigration Judge on April 9, 2025 found he was not dangerous and ordered release on a $7,500 bond, but DHS appealed and invoked the automatic stay under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(i)(2), preventing release without any additional showing. DHS later withdrew the original removability charge (failure to maintain status) and proceeded solely on visa revocation under INA § 237(a)(1)(B). While detained, the student reported worsening hernia symptoms and missed a scheduled surgical consultation.\n\nJudge Jerry W. Blackwell expedited the case. On April 22, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) barring the government from removing or transferring the student from the District of Minnesota to preserve jurisdiction and prevent irreparable harm. The court ordered the government to answer by April 25 and allowed a reply by April 29. After full briefing, on May 5, 2025, the court granted release on bail pending adjudication (applying Martin v. Solem, 801 F.2d 324 (8th Cir. 1986)), finding substantial constitutional claims and exceptional circumstances (unrebutted medical issues, an IJ order finding no danger, shifting government rationales, and the risk that transfer or removal would frustrate judicial review). The release order required immediate release subject to the IJ’s prior bond conditions, including the $7,500 bond, and release to counsel or an approved responsible adult. The TRO preventing transfer/removal was extended on May 5, May 20, and June 3, 2025. No evidentiary hearing was held; both sides agreed the record was sufficient for decision.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, the court granted the habeas petition. First, it held habeas jurisdiction existed because the student challenged only the legality of his detention, not any discretionary decision or a final removal order, and the INA’s jurisdiction‑stripping provisions did not bar review. On the merits, the court sustained all three claims. On the First Amendment claim, the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the student was targeted, arrested, and detained because of his protected political speech; the government’s reliance on visa revocation did not break the causal link given the sequence of events, shifting justifications, the DHS‑initiated revocation, the lack of contemporaneous individualized danger evidence, and disparate treatment compared to similarly situated international students. On the Fifth Amendment claim, the court found the detention punitive and not justified by the permissible aims of immigration detention (ensuring appearance and protecting the community), especially in light of the IJ’s bond decision and the government’s use of the automatic stay to continue detention without any individualized showing—a procedure the court deemed arbitrary as applied. On the APA claim, the court held DHS’s termination of SEVIS status was arbitrary and not in accordance with law: the stated reasons shifted, did not fit the regulatory grounds, lacked required Federal Register notice where applicable, and contravened DHS policy that visa revocation alone does not justify SEVIS termination, with no evidence of a status‑violating offense or regulatory basis under 8 C.F.R. § 214.1 or § 214.2.\n\nAs a remedy, the court ordered that the student remain released from custody subject to the IJ’s existing bond conditions. Judgment entered on June 18, 2025. The federal defendants noticed an appeal to the Eighth Circuit on July 29, 2025 (No. 25‑2516); the appeal remains pending.\n\nDecree and interim relief terms and durations: The April 22 TRO barred removal or transfer from the District of Minnesota for 14 days; it was extended on May 5 (to May 20), May 20 (to June 3), and June 3 (to June 17), maintaining the status quo through final adjudication. The May 5 bail order required immediate release subject to the IJ’s $7,500 bond and approved custodian. The June 17 final order granted the writ and continued release on the same bond conditions.\n\nImportant filings and rulings:\n- April 18, 2025: Petition filed under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 alleging First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and APA violations, and seeking release.\n- April 22, 2025: TRO granted prohibiting transfer/removal; expedited answer order issued.\n- April 25/29, 2025: Government filed answer; student filed reply.\n- May 5, 2025: Bail pending adjudication granted; TRO extended.\n- May 20 and June 3, 2025: TRO extended twice more.\n- June 17, 2025: Habeas petition granted on all claims; release continued on IJ bond.\n- June 18, 2025: Judgment entered.\n- July 29, 2025: Appeal noticed to the Eighth Circuit.\n\nContext and factual basis: The court credited evidence that the student’s arrest and detention followed his public pro‑Palestinian speech; DHS initiated a visa revocation that State then issued; removal charges and SEVIS termination reasons shifted over time; an IJ had already found him not dangerous and set bond; and detention continued solely via an automatic stay without individualized findings. Medical evidence of multiple hernias and missed care, and the risk of transfer/removal undermining judicial review, supported interim release and the TRO.\n\nRelated cases (not consolidated) cited by the court include similar student‑detention challenges: Aditya W. H. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1420131 (D. Minn. May 14, 2025); Mahdawi v. Trump, 2025 WL 1243135 (D. Vt. Apr. 30, 2025); Ozturk v. Trump, 2025 WL 1145250 (D. Vt. Apr. 18, 2025); Doe v. Noem, 2025 WL 1203472 (S.D. Iowa Apr. 24, 2025); Shaik v. Noem, 2025 WL 1170447 (D. Minn. Apr. 22, 2025); Arizona Student DOE #1 v. Trump, 2025 WL 1192826 (D. Ariz. Apr. 24, 2025); and John Roe v. Noem, 2025 WL 1114694 (D. Mont. Apr. 15, 2025). No settlement or monitoring was ordered in this case.",
    "46477": "On April 14, 2025, thirty-one international students and recent graduates (initially ten, later expanded) studying at public universities and vocational programs in Michigan and several other states filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against the Department of Homeland Security’s leadership—specifically the DHS Secretary, the Acting ICE Director, and the Detroit ICE Field Office Director. The students, many on F‑1 (and one on M‑1) nonimmigrant status, including several engaged in post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) or STEM‑OPT, were represented by private counsel. They alleged that DHS/ICE’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) had unilaterally changed their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records to “terminated,” often with the notation that the student had been identified in a criminal records check and/or had a revoked visa. Their institutions then told them to cease work and/or depart immediately. Plaintiffs asserted no one had been convicted of a qualifying violent crime and they did not challenge any separate visa revocations—only the SEVIS terminations.\n\nThe complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), alleging the actions were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, and for violations of the U.S. Constitution’s Due Process Clause. The case was assigned to Judge Jane M. Beckering. It is not a class action.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, plaintiffs moved for an emergency TRO and preliminary injunction. After briefing and an April 22 hearing, the court granted a TRO on April 23, 2025. The TRO: (1) required the DHS Secretary and Acting ICE Director to set aside the SEVIS termination decisions and (2) restore each plaintiff’s F‑1 record in SEVIS retroactive to the termination date; (3) barred those officials from terminating plaintiffs’ F‑1 records absent a valid regulatory basis under 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d) or § 214.2(f) and adherence to plaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory rights; (4) prohibited revocation of plaintiffs’ OPT employment authorizations; (5) prohibited arresting, detaining, or transferring plaintiffs without prior notice to the court and counsel and time to contest; and (6) prohibited initiating removal or deportation based on the SEVIS terminations. The court waived Rule 65(c) security and set the TRO to expire in 14 days unless extended or by consent. The court’s accompanying opinion held plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their APA claim and rejected jurisdictional defenses, finding (a) sovereign immunity did not bar review, (b) the SEVIS terminations were “final agency action” with immediate legal consequences and no administrative review mechanism, and (c) any exhaustion requirement did not bar suit. The court concluded the record did not show any of the limited agency grounds for status termination under 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d) and no qualifying convictions under 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(g). It found irreparable harm (loss of academic and employment progress and uncertain legal status with risk of arrest/removal), and that the public interest and equities favored injunctive relief.\n\nPlaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 25, 2025 adding additional students. After the TRO issued, DHS restored plaintiffs’ SEVIS records, though SEVIS continued to display a “terminated” event in the history visible to Designated School Officials (DSOs). SEVP added internal notations indicating retroactive restoration, but those were not visible to DSOs. Plaintiffs’ first contempt motion regarding TRO compliance was withdrawn once restoration occurred; their second was denied without prejudice on May 7, 2025, but the court ordered DHS to file, by May 13, 2025, a notice confirming a retroactivity notation was on each plaintiff’s record and addressing whether that notation could be made visible to DSOs.\n\nOn May 7, 2025, after a May 6 hearing, the court granted a preliminary injunction, again waiving security. The court reiterated plaintiffs’ likelihood of success under the APA, rejecting DHS’s reliance on 8 U.S.C. § 1372 (which authorizes collecting student information) as a source of authority to terminate status, given the specific limits in 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d). The court declined to reach the due process claims at that stage. On irreparable harm and mootness, the court held DHS’s restoration did not moot the case under the voluntary-cessation doctrine, particularly in light of an April 26, 2025 ICE “Broadcast Message” authorizing SEVIS terminations for, among other reasons, “evidence of a failure to comply with the terms of nonimmigrant status” and immediate terminations upon visa revocation. The court found the government had not shown the challenged conduct could not reasonably be expected to recur and that the same harms persisted without an injunction. The preliminary injunction preserves the status quo established by the TRO—maintaining restored records and restricting future adverse actions absent a lawful basis.\n\nKey proceedings and orders:\n- April 14, 2025: Complaint filed seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\n- April 23, 2025: TRO granted; opinion issued; security waived; TRO effective for 14 days.\n- May 7, 2025: Preliminary injunction granted; opinion issued; second show-cause motion denied; DHS ordered to confirm retroactivity notations and address DSO visibility.\n- May 13, 2025: DHS filed notice with supporting declarations regarding SEVIS notations.\n- July 7, 2025: Defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal from the preliminary injunction to the Sixth Circuit (No. 25-1611). Outcome not reflected in the record provided.\n\nLegal foundation:\n- Cause of action: APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law); constitutional Due Process Clause.\n- Statutory/regulatory context: 8 U.S.C. § 1372; 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.1(d), 214.1(g), 214.2(f) & (m).\n- Remedy sought: declaratory and injunctive relief (no damages).\n\nFactual basis:\nBeginning in late March/early April 2025, SEVP unilaterally changed plaintiffs’ SEVIS records to “terminated,” typically noting a criminal records check and/or a visa revocation. Institutions notified students, instructed them to stop working, and in some instances to depart. Plaintiffs—students and recent graduates across multiple states—asserted they had no qualifying violent-crime convictions and had complied with immigration status requirements. The court found the agency action likely unlawful under the APA, imposed TRO and preliminary injunctive relief to restore and protect their student status and employment authorizations, and enjoined further adverse actions absent lawful grounds.\n\nJudge: Jane M. Beckering, U.S. District Judge, Western District of Michigan, Southern Division.\n\nClass status: Individual plaintiffs; not a class action.\n\nCounsel: Private counsel for plaintiffs.\n\nConsolidation/related cases: None consolidated; the court noted similar cases nationwide but did not consolidate this action.\n\nDecrees’ duration: TRO effective April 23, 2025 for 14 days; preliminary injunction entered May 7, 2025 remains in effect pending adjudication on the merits.",
    "46239": "On March 17, 2025, a New York county filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Corporation for National and Community Service (AmeriCorps) and its interim agency head in her official capacity. The county, represented by private counsel, challenged AmeriCorps’ new certification demand tied to two January 2025 executive orders concerning “DEI,” asserting the agency abruptly imposed vague, unauthorized conditions on an already-awarded Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) grant. The federal defendants were represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Chief Judge James E. Boasberg presided.\n\nThe dispute arose after the county applied in October 2023 for a three‑year RSVP grant (about $250,000) and received an award in January 2024. AmeriCorps’ long‑standing RSVP regulation, adopted in 1999 after notice and comment, requires sponsors to establish an advisory council “of a diverse composition that reflects the demographics of the service area” (45 C.F.R. § 2553.24(a)(5)). The county’s application, consistent with the program’s notices and guidance, described efforts to reach diverse communities and to recruit a diverse advisory council. Following Executive Orders 14151 (Jan. 20, 2025) and 14173 (Jan. 21, 2025), AmeriCorps on February 14, 2025, told the county to either: (1) certify by set language that the RSVP grant “complies with all administration Executive Orders and does not include any activities that promote DEI activities,” (2) amend the award to remove or update “out of compliance” language, or (3) relinquish the award, warning that nonresponse could lead to termination. AmeriCorps later acknowledged a District of Maryland preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the executive orders in other litigation, told the county it could continue activities for the existing award, but on March 12, 2025, required action on the county’s FY 2025 continuation application. On March 18, 2025, the Fourth Circuit stayed the Maryland injunction pending appeal.\n\nThe county brought two claims: (1) under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging AmeriCorps’ new certification requirement was a final agency action that was arbitrary and capricious because it contradicted AmeriCorps’ own RSVP regulation and was imposed without notice and comment (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)); and (2) under the Spending Clause, alleging the agency conditioned funds on a fatally vague and unrelated “promotes DEI” prohibition (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1). The county sought declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining the new requirements and enforcement of the executive-order–based restrictions. On March 21, 2025, it moved for a preliminary injunction directing AmeriCorps to deem it compliant and to disburse funds without requiring the DEI certification.\n\nDefendants opposed on April 4, 2025, arguing the county faced no imminent irreparable harm; the claims were unripe; sovereign immunity barred review because the challenged actions were committed to agency discretion in administering discretionary grants and, alternatively, belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act as a contract dispute; and the merits failed because no conflict with 45 C.F.R. § 2553.24(a)(5) was shown and grantees could amend applications. The court set a briefing schedule and a hearing for April 25, 2025, but no merits ruling issued.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, the county voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice, stating AmeriCorps had changed its certification requirements since the suit was filed. The preliminary‑injunction motion was withdrawn, the scheduled hearing was vacated, and the case was closed. No opinions were issued. Related litigation noted in the filings included National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education v. Trump, No. 25‑cv‑333 (D. Md.) (preliminary injunction entered Feb. 21, 2025) and the Fourth Circuit’s stay pending appeal, No. 25‑1189 (Mar. 18, 2025). The case did not involve class claims, went no further than preliminary‑injunction briefing, and ended without settlement or decree. The factual backdrop concerned the RSVP program’s senior‑volunteer services and AmeriCorps’ post‑order request for a DEI‑related certification that the county alleged conflicted with AmeriCorps’ existing RSVP diversity regulation.",
    "46230": "Filed March 14, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, this case was brought by twelve nonprobationary career civil servants in the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Veterans Benefits Administration, formerly assigned to the Office of Equity Assurance (OEA). They sued the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in his official capacity. The employees alleged that after the January 20–21, 2025 issuance of Executive Order 14151 (ending federal DEI/DEIA programs) and subsequent Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidance, the VA improperly designated OEA as a DEIA office, shut it down on January 22, 2025, placed its staff on paid administrative leave, cut off their network access, and later initiated reduction-in-force (RIF) actions limited to OEA. Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel; the Secretary was represented by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nLegal foundation. Plaintiffs proceeded under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704, 706, and the U.S. Constitution. They alleged that designating OEA as a DEIA office and the cascading actions violated the First Amendment (viewpoint discrimination and retaliation based on perceived association) and the Fifth Amendment (due process—property and liberty interests—and equal protection). They also alleged arbitrary and capricious agency action under the APA. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief (including orders barring the “DEIA” designation for OEA and themselves, restoring network and employment benefits access, and requiring public recantation of the designation), and recovery of fees and costs; the complaint also referenced compensatory damages.\n\nFactual basis. OEA was established in 2023 within VBA to identify and address disparities in access to VA benefits (e.g., rural and geographically isolated veterans) and to validate or rebut findings such as those in GAO-23-106097 concerning race-based disparities in claims outcomes. After EO 14151, OPM issued memoranda directing prompt termination, to the maximum extent permitted by law, of DEI/DEIA offices and advising agencies to place DEIA-office employees on administrative leave and to define RIF competitive areas solely as the DEIA office where the employee worked. On January 22, 2025, the VA’s Acting Secretary emailed VA personnel that DEIA offices would be closed and contracts terminated; OEA was closed that day, its employees were placed on administrative leave, and their access to VA systems was revoked. VA issued a January 27 press release stating nearly 60 employees solely focused on DEI/DEIA had been placed on leave and that DEI-related contracts were being canceled.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged they were excluded from opportunities available to other active employees (including a January 28, 2025 deferred resignation program email they could not receive because their access had been revoked) and that their attempts to secure reassignment to funded vacancies within VBA were foreclosed by OPM’s direction to proceed by RIF. On February 14, 2025, they received “Specific RIF” notices after the stated effective time, without the usual 60 days’ notice or reassignment/severance processes, and with the competitive area limited to OEA (even though OEA had already closed). On February 27, 2025, VA rescinded the February 14 separations and placed plaintiffs back on administrative leave retroactive to February 14 but allegedly did not pay a full pay period and continued to block their system access. On March 13, 2025, VA issued new specific RIF notices setting May 10, 2025 separation dates, again defining the competitive area as the “DEIA office where the employee worked.” Plaintiffs contended these actions stigmatized them as “DEIA employees,” damaged their reputations and career prospects, and differed from how other VA components—such as the Office of Health Equity—were treated.\n\nProceedings and rulings. Plaintiffs moved to proceed under pseudonym; on April 9, 2025, Chief Judge James E. Boasberg granted the motion in part and denied it in part, directing use of the pseudonyms listed in the complaint in public filings and ordering plaintiffs to file their real names and addresses under seal. Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Related Case to Perkins Coie LLP v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:25-cv-00716); on April 18, 2025, Judge Beryl A. Howell concluded the cases were not related under the local rules and directed random reassignment. The case was reassigned to Judge Rudolph Contreras.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order seeking to bar VA from designating OEA as a DEIA office and them as DEIA employees, and to restore their access to VA systems and employee benefits (including consideration for the deferred resignation program), citing due-process and First Amendment harms and pointing to recent orders in other courts addressing OPM-related directives. After expedited briefing and a May 2, 2025 hearing, Judge Rudolph Contreras denied the TRO for reasons stated on the record. No written opinion accompanied the TRO denial. The court directed the parties to confer on a preliminary-injunction schedule.\n\nDisposition. On July 17, 2025, plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice; the case was dismissed on July 21, 2025.\n\nJudges. Chief Judge James E. Boasberg (pseudonym order); Judge Beryl A. Howell (related-case reassignment order); Judge Rudolph Contreras (presiding thereafter; TRO denied).\n\nRelated matters. Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Related Case to Perkins Coie LLP v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:25-cv-00716), but the court found the cases not related. Plaintiffs’ TRO papers referenced other courts’ orders involving OPM guidance to agencies, but no case was consolidated with this one.\n\nNo trial, decrees, settlement, or appeal occurred in this action.",
    "46242": "On March 5, 2025, three plaintiffs—a national motorized-access nonprofit, a Utah motorcycle club, and an individual rider—filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah challenging the Bureau of Land Management’s December 31, 2024 San Rafael Swell Travel Management Plan, its Environmental Assessment, Finding of No Significant Impact, and Decision Record for the San Rafael Swell Travel Management Area in Emery County, Utah. The San Rafael Swell TMA encompasses roughly 1.3 million acres (about 1.15 million acres BLM-managed). The court assigned the case to District Judge David Nuffer. The plaintiffs proceed individually (not as a class) and are represented by private counsel. The federal defendants are BLM and the U.S. Department of the Interior, represented by government counsel. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (a conservation nonprofit represented by its staff attorneys) intervened as a defendant.\n\nThe suit is brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706), NEPA (42 U.S.C. § 4332), and the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act (Pub. L. No. 116-9). Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including vacatur and setting aside of the San Rafael Swell TMP, and attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (28 U.S.C. § 2412). They also sought temporary relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or, alternatively, a preliminary injunction.\n\nAs factual context, BLM’s 2024 decision closed approximately 665 miles of routes within the San Rafael Swell network, left a large network of routes open to motorized use (over 1,300 miles), and limited certain additional miles. The agency stated it selected a hybrid alternative to balance recreation access and resource protection. The EA also describes route reclamation measures for closed routes, including signage, barriers, and techniques such as “vertical mulching,” ripping and reseeding, and other methods intended to make closed routes undetectable.\n\nPlaintiffs allege three principal violations. First, they contend BLM’s closures unlawfully create de facto wilderness “buffer zones” around the 2019 Dingell Act wilderness areas in the Swell (e.g., near Sid’s Mountain, Mexican Mountain, and Devil’s Canyon), contrary to the Act’s repeated prohibition on protective perimeters and on closing adjacent lands merely because nonwilderness uses may be seen or heard from within wilderness. They similarly argue BLM effectively created a de facto “wild” river corridor along segments of the Price River by closing routes to “encourage only non-motorized access,” despite Congress not designating the Price River under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act; by contrast, Congress designated segments of Utah’s Green River and specified accessibility considerations. Second, under the APA, they allege the decision is arbitrary and capricious: BLM purportedly failed to respond to significant comments (including about Dingell Act compliance), relied on unsubstantiated “user conflict” to close certain single-track routes, adopted closures inconsistent with its own route reports and wildlife analyses, and routed approval through the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary rather than a district manager—thereby eliminating Interior Board of Land Appeals review and making the decision immediately effective without explanation. They also challenge BLM’s reliance on OHV “minimization criteria” (43 C.F.R. § 8342.1) as lacking a clear statutory basis in light of a D.C. Circuit decision (Marin Audubon Society v. FAA) regarding executive orders and regulatory authority, and they question BLM’s reliance on Council on Environmental Quality regulations after those regulations’ removal by CEQ’s interim rule in February 2025. Third, under NEPA, they argue BLM should have prepared an Environmental Impact Statement because closing hundreds of miles of long-used routes significantly affects the human environment and because the plan required substantial planning, time, and resources; they also assert BLM failed to take the requisite “hard look” and that a FONSI was improper.\n\nOn March 6, 2025, plaintiffs moved to postpone the plan’s effective date under APA § 705 or for a preliminary injunction, asserting irreparable harm from imminent route obliteration and loss of access to state trust lands and a historic family homestead. The court set a briefing schedule. Federal defendants opposed the motion on April 3, 2025; the intervenor conservation group filed its response on April 10; plaintiffs replied on April 24. No ruling on interim relief appears in the record provided.\n\nOn March 10, 2025, the conservation group moved to intervene as of right, citing decades of advocacy, participation throughout travel planning, and interests in minimizing motorized impacts to wildlife, riparian, soil crust, and cultural resources. On April 21, 2025, Judge Nuffer granted intervention, holding the motion timely; that the group has direct, substantial, legally protectable environmental interests that may be impaired by vacatur or remand requiring new decision-making; and that the federal defendants may not adequately represent those interests given their obligation to represent the broader public interest and potential for policy shifts. (No Westlaw citation is provided in the record.)\n\nThe docket reflects service on the defendants, completion of preliminary-injunction briefing, and entry of an administrative-appeal scheduling order on June 17, 2025 (later amended August 28, 2025). The court set the administrative record due October 31, 2025; plaintiffs’ opening merits brief due in early 2026; defendants’ and intervenor’s response briefs thereafter; and plaintiffs’ reply due June 5, 2026. There are no consolidated cases, no trials, no reported opinions on the merits, and no appeals or settlements noted in the record provided.\n\nThe case arises from longstanding disputes over motorized access in the San Rafael Swell. A 2017 settlement in prior litigation required BLM to redo travel plans in multiple Utah areas, leading to the 2024 decision now at issue. Plaintiffs characterize the new closures as unlawful buffer-zone expansion and improper constraints on river access; the federal agency and the intervenor conservation group characterize the plan as a balanced network that designates a substantial mileage for motorized use while minimizing user and resource conflicts and protecting sensitive resources. The court has not yet adjudicated the merits.",
    "46039": "On February 4, 2025, a professional association for FBI agents and seven current FBI employees proceeding under pseudonyms filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of Justice and, in one case, the United States. The individual plaintiffs include special agents and other FBI personnel. This is not a class action. Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel and a nonprofit advocacy organization; the government is represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nThe cases arise from post–January 20, 2025 actions by DOJ leadership. On January 31, 2025, DOJ directed the FBI to identify all current and former FBI personnel assigned at any time to January 6, 2021–related matters and to United States v. Haniyeh, 24 Mag. 438 (S.D.N.Y.). According to DOJ, the request supports an internal review under Executive Order 14,147 (“Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government”). The FBI responded by providing lists that used unique employee identifiers (not names) along with each person’s current title, title at the time, current office, role, and last activity date. Internal FBI communications filed by DOJ state the Bureau did not view inclusion on the lists as evidence of misconduct and described an optional questionnaire to help ensure accuracy; managers could complete it for employees. Plaintiffs allege the Department’s actions are part of an effort to identify, punish, and publicly expose personnel who worked on January 6 investigations, placing them and their families at risk amid documented online threats and recent pardons of January 6 offenders.\n\nPlaintiffs assert statutory and constitutional claims and seek injunctive and mandamus relief. The causes of action include: violations of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(6) (dissemination without ensuring accuracy) and § 552a(b) (unlawful disclosure from a system of records); arbitrary and capricious agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); mandamus under 28 U.S.C. § 1361; First Amendment retaliation based on perceived political affiliation; and Fifth Amendment due process claims for reputational harm (“stigma-plus”) and compelled disclosure of personal information. Plaintiffs invoke federal-question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and mandamus jurisdiction, § 1361, and cite the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity, 5 U.S.C. § 702. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief barring aggregation and dissemination of personally identifying information linking them to January 6 matters, and, if necessary, a writ of mandamus to prevent or rescind any unlawful personnel actions, along with fees and costs.\n\nThe government opposed temporary restraining orders, arguing plaintiffs lack standing and irreparable harm because no public disclosure has occurred or been authorized, the Privacy Act permits intra-agency sharing (5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(1)), the lists do not contain names, and any review is internal and lawful. DOJ also contended the requested injunctions were overbroad and beyond the pleadings.\n\nJudge Jia M. Cobb presides. The court granted leave for the Doe plaintiffs to proceed under pseudonyms and permitted a declaration to be filed under seal and ex parte. On February 6, 2025, the court issued a short administrative stay preserving the status quo (no disclosure outside DOJ) pending further proceedings. On February 7, 2025, with the parties’ consent, the court deferred ruling on the TROs and entered an order that: (1) the government will not disseminate to the public, directly or indirectly, the list at issue (including any subsequent versions or any record pairing unique identifiers to names) before the court rules on anticipated motions for preliminary injunction; and (2) the government may terminate that proscription on two business days’ notice absent further order. The cases—John and Jane Does 1–9 v. DOJ (No. 25‑0325) and FBI Agents Association v. DOJ, et al. (No. 25‑0328)—were consolidated, with No. 25‑0325 designated as the lead case. The court set a preliminary injunction schedule: motions due February 24, 2025; oppositions due March 14, 2025; replies due March 21, 2025; and a hearing set for March 27, 2025. On April 9, 2025, John Doe #4 was dismissed by stipulation. No trials have occurred, no final judgment has been entered, and there are no reported opinions in these consolidated cases to date.\n\nFactual context pleaded by plaintiffs includes the January 6 attack, subsequent DOJ/FBI investigations nationwide, and, after January 20, 2025, presidential pardons/commutations of January 6 defendants and online statements by some recipients perceived as threatening. Plaintiffs allege DOJ is pursuing mass personnel actions based on involvement in January 6 matters and intends to disclose or enable the disclosure of employees’ identities and roles, creating safety and reputational risks. DOJ denies any intent to publicly release identifying information and asserts any review will consider misconduct only, not lawful case work.",
    "46681": "Filed February 3, 2025, in the U.S. Court of International Trade, this case is an individual, pro se constitutional challenge by a U.S. citizen consumer to tariffs announced by the President in early 2025. The plaintiff alleged that Congress unconstitutionally delegated its Article I powers to “lay and collect” duties and that the President unconstitutionally imposed tariffs by executive order, violating Article I, Sections 7 and 8; the separation of powers; and the President’s oath in Article II. He invoked the Court’s residual jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i) and also cited 28 U.S.C. § 1361 (mandamus). He sought declaratory relief, preliminary and permanent injunctions halting collection of the tariffs and prohibiting any future presidential imposition of tariffs, and an order compelling the President to perform constitutional duties.\n\nThe suit challenged executive actions issued after a January 20, 2025 national emergency proclamation. On February 1, 2025, executive orders announced: 25% tariffs on products from Mexico; 10% on energy from Canada and 25% on other Canadian products; and 10% on products from China, invoking authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. §§ 1701–1702. Implementation included amending the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to add an extra duty line for Chinese goods, with de minimis exceptions under 19 U.S.C. § 1321. Subsequent orders paused or modified the Canada and Mexico measures and altered China rates; in March and April 2025 additional orders increased rates, imposed a general 10% reciprocal tariff, adjusted country-specific China rates, and limited de minimis treatment for certain Chinese goods, followed by a May 12, 2025 order that scaled back some China tariffs. The government did not dispute that the Court possessed § 1581(i) jurisdiction, and the Court later confirmed that jurisdiction because the measures were imposed for reasons other than raising revenue.\n\nThe defendant (the United States, represented by the Department of Justice, Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch) moved to dismiss under USCIT Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of Article III and prudential standing. It argued the plaintiff alleged only generalized grievances about economic conditions and government adherence to the Constitution; he was not an importer paying the challenged duties; any downstream price effects were speculative and dependent on third-party decisions; and any alleged harms were not fairly traceable to the tariffs or redressable by court order. It also argued prudential standing was lacking because importers—the parties who pay the duties—are better positioned to litigate such claims, citing importer suits recently filed in the Court (e.g., V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump, Ct. No. 25‑00066; Princess Awesome, LLC v. U.S. Customs & Border Prot., Ct. No. 25‑00078).\n\nThe plaintiff opposed, maintaining that the Constitution operates as a “contract” the courts must enforce, that Article III should be applied with latitude to permit challenges to unconstitutional acts, and that his injury was the breach of the constitutional “contract” and, by way of example, anticipated consumer price increases. He disclaimed reliance on any injury tied to his personal payment of duties.\n\nJudge Jennifer Choe-Groves granted the motion. In a reported opinion, Slip Op. 25-65 (May 23, 2025), the Court held that while § 1581(i) jurisdiction existed over the subject matter (tariffs imposed for non-revenue purposes), the plaintiff lacked Article III standing. The Court found no injury in fact because the asserted injury—government nonobservance of the Constitution—is an abstract, generalized grievance common to all citizens, and the consumer-price harms were speculative and not particularized to the plaintiff (he did not allege he paid duties or incurred specific increased costs). Because injury in fact was lacking, the Court did not reach causation, redressability, prudential standing, or the merits of the constitutional claims, and it expressed no view on the constitutionality of the IEEPA tariffs. The complaint was dismissed without prejudice, with leave to amend by June 23, 2025.\n\nProcedurally, the Court assigned the case on February 7, 2025, held a status conference on February 28, 2025, and set initial scheduling deadlines. After dismissal without prejudice, the docket reflects that the plaintiff filed an amended complaint; on July 1, 2025, the Court set a briefing schedule. On July 21, 2025, the United States filed a renewed motion to dismiss (or, alternatively, a response to the plaintiff’s reconsideration request). The plaintiff filed his response on August 11, 2025. No further ruling on the amended complaint is reflected in the materials provided.\n\nKey legal foundations and authorities cited include: 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i) (jurisdiction), IEEPA (50 U.S.C. §§ 1701–1702), the National Emergencies Act, the First, Article I, and Article II provisions invoked by the plaintiff, and standing precedents such as Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United, DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, and Clapper v. Amnesty International. There was no trial or settlement, and no appeal is noted in the record.",
    "46758": "On June 20, 2025, three immigration detainees filed a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 in the Central District of California, challenging their arrests during a large federal immigration enforcement effort in Los Angeles and seeking to prevent transfer out of the district. Days later, they and additional individual and organizational plaintiffs filed a First Amended Petition/Complaint alleging a putative class action against senior federal officials responsible for immigration enforcement in the Los Angeles region. The plaintiffs include day laborers and other workers and three membership organizations (including a major farmworker union and a worker center network). They are represented by nonprofit legal organizations and private counsel. The defendants are the Department of Homeland Security Secretary, the Attorney General, ICE and CBP leadership, and the local ICE Field Office Director, represented by the federal government.\n\nThe case challenges “Operation At Large,” which began June 6, 2025 and deployed CBP and ICE teams to make contacts in public places across the Central District (Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo Counties). Plaintiffs allege that agents, often masked and armed, in unmarked vehicles, conducted detentive stops without reasonable suspicion, focusing on locations such as carwashes, day labor pick-up sites, tow yards, bus stops, and Home Depots. The record includes incidents where a U.S. citizen was seized outside a tow yard despite presenting a Real ID, a dual U.S.–Mexico citizen taken to a nearby location for questioning after providing a California driver’s license, and three Pasadena day laborers surrounded by masked men with guns, handcuffed, and taken away without agents identifying themselves or stating the basis for arrest. Organizational declarations describe similar stops of their members and widespread fear and disruption. Plaintiffs also assert separate claims concerning denial of access to counsel and illegal conditions in the downtown Los Angeles federal holding area known as “B-18.”\n\nProceedings moved quickly. The initial transfer-related TRO application on June 20 was withdrawn based on the government’s agreement to keep the habeas petitioners at Adelanto and not transfer them pending bond hearings. On July 2, 2025, plaintiffs filed their First Amended Petition/Complaint, adding individuals and four organizations and class allegations. On July 3, plaintiffs filed two ex parte TRO applications: (1) to enjoin suspicionless detentive stops district-wide; and (2) to remedy denial of access to counsel and conditions at B-18. After full briefing and a July 10 hearing, on July 11, 2025, Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong granted both TRO applications. As to stops and arrests, the court enjoined federal officials in the Central District “from conducting detentive stops unless the agent or officer has reasonable suspicion that the person to be stopped is within the United States in violation of U.S. immigration law,” and further barred them, “in connection with” that requirement, from relying solely—alone or in combination—on four factors to form reasonable suspicion: (i) apparent race or ethnicity; (ii) speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; (iii) presence at a particular location (e.g., bus stop, car wash, tow yard, day-labor site, agricultural site, etc.); or (iv) the type of work one does, with an “except as permitted by law” clause attached to that list. The district court found plaintiffs likely to succeed in showing a pattern of detentive seizures without reasonable suspicion, and addressed the same Fourth Amendment issues only (the statutory and regulatory theories were not the basis of the Stop/Arrest TRO). See 2025 WL 1915964 (C.D. Cal. July 11, 2025).\n\nDefendants noticed an appeal and sought stays in both courts. The district court denied a stay on July 17, 2025. The Ninth Circuit initially denied the government’s first stay motions for failure to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8 but set expedited argument. On August 1, 2025, a Ninth Circuit panel (Judges Gould, Berzon, and Sung) denied a stay pending appeal except for staying the single phrase “except as permitted by law” in the TRO’s paragraph limiting the four enumerated factors. The court held the TRO appealable and concluded that plaintiffs—both individuals and associations—have standing to seek prospective equitable relief based on evidence of a pattern of officially sanctioned detentive stops and a realistic threat of recurrence. It further held the TRO is not an impermissibly vague “follow-the-law” order when read together with its specific prohibitions, and that prohibiting sole reliance on the four factors is consistent with the Fourth Amendment’s totality-of-the-circumstances standard because, in the Central District’s context, those factors describe a broad profile that cannot alone yield particularized reasonable suspicion. The panel also upheld the district-wide geographic scope as necessary to give complete relief to the named individual and association plaintiffs. The stay was granted only to the extent of suspending the words “except as permitted by law” in the TRO; otherwise, the TRO remains in effect pending appeal. (Order, No. 25-4312 (9th Cir. Aug. 1, 2025) (published).)\n\nSeparately, one of the initial habeas petitioners sought release from detention after the immigration court declared itself without jurisdiction to hold a bond hearing. On July 30, 2025, Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym granted the ex parte application and ordered the petitioner’s immediate release on a $5,000 bond with electronic monitoring, finding the court had inherent authority to grant bail in habeas proceedings and that extraordinary circumstances warranted release, including the government’s inconsistent positions on bond-hearing jurisdiction and the petitioner’s serious uncontrolled hypertension and related symptoms. The court found the petitioner neither a danger nor a flight risk and declined to stay its order.\n\nKey filings and schedules include: the district court’s denial of a stay (July 17, 2025); the Ninth Circuit’s procedural denial of the first stay motions for Rule 8 noncompliance (July 16, 2025); intervention granted to the City and County of Los Angeles and several local municipalities (July 29, 2025); the defendants’ motion for reconsideration of intervention denied (Aug. 13, 2025); plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunction (including on the Fifth Amendment right to counsel at B-18) set for hearing September 24, 2025; and plaintiffs’ motion to certify a “Suspicionless Stop” class filed August 7, 2025. A related Central District case, Bautista v. Santacruz, Jr. (No. 5:25-cv-01873-SSS-BFM), involved parallel issues; the government’s jurisdictional arguments from that matter were noted and rejected in the orders here.\n\nLegal basis and remedies: Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable seizures (stop/arrest practices) and Fifth Amendment due process (denial of access to counsel and conditions at B-18), as well as habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 for individual detainees. The government invoked INA channeling provisions (8 U.S.C. § 1252), but both the district court and the magistrate judge rejected those arguments for these collateral detention challenges. The TRO presently bars federal agents in the Central District from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion and from relying solely on the four enumerated factors to form reasonable suspicion; the clause “except as permitted by law” is stayed by the Ninth Circuit pending appeal. The preliminary injunction hearing is set for September 24, 2025. No trial has occurred, and no settlement or monitoring regime has been ordered. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong presides at the district court; Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym ruled on the habeas release application. The Ninth Circuit panel comprises Judges Ronald M. Gould, Marsha S. Berzon, and Jennifer Sung.",
    "46378": "On April 10, 2025, four noncitizen students enrolled at Michigan public universities filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the federal immigration authorities—the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and ICE’s Detroit Field Office Director. The students are individuals (not a class). They are represented by cooperating counsel with the ACLU of Michigan and private counsel.\n\nThe case arose after DHS terminated each student’s record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) between April 4–8, 2025. Each learned of the termination from their school, not from DHS. The termination reason entered in SEVIS was substantially the same across the students, stating that the individual was “identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked,” and—at least for some—was prefaced with “OTHERWISE FAILING TO MAINTAIN STATUS.” The students alleged they maintained their F‑1 status requirements, had no criminal convictions (two had brief arrests with no charges; one had only traffic infractions; another had previously withdrawn an application for admission at the border), and had received no State Department notice of visa revocation (one never held an F‑1 visa because he changed status inside the U.S.). They also alleged the SEVIS actions were part of a nationwide pattern of mass terminations affecting hundreds of students within days.\n\nLegal foundation and claims. The students sought emergency and permanent relief under:\n- The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause (procedural due process), alleging DHS terminated their F‑1 student status without notice, reasons, or an opportunity to be heard before an impartial adjudicator.\n- The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), alleging the terminations were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and contrary to constitutional right, including that DHS lacked regulatory authority to terminate F‑1 status on the stated grounds, citing 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.1(d) and 214.2(f). They also alleged a policy/pattern-and-practice (Accardi doctrine) and a due process claim regarding potential detention.\n\nRelief sought. The students requested: (1) a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction restoring each student’s valid F‑1 status in SEVIS and setting aside the termination decisions; (2) an order prohibiting DHS/ICE from terminating their F‑1 status absent valid grounds and pre-deprivation procedures; (3) prohibitions on arrest, detention, transfer, initiation of removal, or deportation based on the SEVIS terminations without notice to the court and counsel; (4) declaratory relief; and (5) attorneys’ fees. They asked to waive bond.\n\nDefendants’ response. DHS/ICE opposed the TRO, arguing a TRO would alter, not preserve, the status quo. Substantively, the government asserted SEVIS is a DHS recordkeeping system and a SEVIS termination does not control or necessarily reflect lawful nonimmigrant status; accordingly, there was no final, reviewable agency action and no protected property interest in a SEVIS record. ICE submitted a declaration from its National Security Division (Andre Watson) stating:\n- SEVP terminated the SEVIS records after criminal-history checks returned matches or after a prior CBP inadmissibility encounter; the State Department had prudentially revoked visas for two students (revocation upon departure).\n- SEVIS termination does not terminate nonimmigrant status; prudential visa revocation, by itself, does not render one removable.\n- No plaintiff had been detained or placed in removal proceedings.\n\nProceedings and rulings. Judge Stephen J. Murphy III held a hearing on April 15, 2025. On April 17, 2025, the court denied the requested TRO. The court held the record was insufficient to conclude that terminating a SEVIS record is synonymous with terminating F‑1 status or that a SEVIS termination, standing alone, carries legal consequences—issues central to likelihood of success under the APA and due process claims. The court noted the government’s representation that it did not believe the students had lost status and saw no basis then to initiate removal, undermining irreparable-harm arguments tied to detention or deportation. The court set a briefing schedule and a preliminary injunction hearing (later extended by stipulation). The court did not issue any injunctive decree.\n\nSubsequent filings included plaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery, which the court granted in part and denied in part on April 30, 2025, and defendants’ preliminary-injunction opposition. Before the scheduled preliminary injunction hearing, the parties filed a stipulated order of dismissal, which the court entered on May 29, 2025. No settlement terms were filed on the docket, and there were no reported opinions, trials, appeals, monitors, or enforcement disputes.\n\nContext and legal basis cited by the parties. The students relied on Fifth Amendment procedural due process and APA § 706(2) (arbitrary/capricious, contrary to law, contrary to constitutional right), arguing DHS lacked authority to terminate status outside the grounds specified in 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d), and that visa revocation cannot by itself warrant SEVIS termination during ongoing study. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting terminations without valid grounds and pre-deprivation procedures and barring arrest/detention/removal based on the SEVIS entries. The government responded that SEVIS is a data system (with schools contributing entries under 8 C.F.R. § 214.3(g)) that does not determine immigration status, that prudential visa revocations had occurred for two students, that no removal proceedings were initiated, and that the APA claim failed for lack of final agency action and because the Privacy Act provides an exclusive scheme for data-record challenges not available to non-U.S. persons.\n\nJudge:\n- District Judge Stephen J. Murphy III presided; Magistrate Judge David R. Grand was assigned.\n\nKey dates:\n- Complaint and emergency TRO/PI motion filed: April 10, 2025.\n- TRO hearing: April 15, 2025.\n- Order denying TRO: April 17, 2025 (ECF No. 20).\n- Partial grant of expedited discovery: April 30, 2025.\n- Stipulated dismissal: May 29, 2025.\n\nRelated litigation (not consolidated): Plaintiffs cited contemporaneous cases in other districts where courts issued TROs in similar SEVIS/F‑1 disputes (e.g., D.N.H., E.D.N.Y., D. Mass.), but no formal relation was established in this case.",
    "46385": "On April 9, 2025, two Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law clinical professors—one who directs the Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic and another who teaches and practices in the Center on Negotiation, Mediation, and Restorative Justice—filed a federal lawsuit in the Northern District of Illinois (Case No. 1:25‑cv‑03837). They sued the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce, its Chair, and the Chair of its Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development in their official capacities. Northwestern University and two of its officers (the president and the board chair) were named as nominal defendants to effectuate injunctive relief because they received the Committee’s demand and control the records at issue. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel and the Center for Constitutional Rights.\n\nThe suit arises from a March 27, 2025 letter in which the House Committee demanded that Northwestern produce, by April 10, 2025, extensive materials concerning the law school’s Bluhm Legal Clinic and the plaintiffs’ academic and legal work. The demanded categories included: (1) all written policies governing law school clinics and client representations; (2) detailed budgets for the Bluhm Legal Clinic and for each of its clinics and centers; (3) a list of funding sources for the clinic and its programs; (4) a list of all payments by the Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic to non‑employees since 2020; and (5) all hiring materials and performance reviews for one of the professors. The Committee’s letter stated its concerns about “left‑wing” advocacy and referenced the professor’s pro bono defense of protesters named in civil litigation, while copying the U.S. Attorney General and the U.S. Secretary of Education.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the Committee’s demands exceed congressional authority and lack a valid legislative purpose, and that enforcing them would violate multiple constitutional protections. They assert First Amendment violations (free speech, freedom of association, right to petition, and academic freedom) based on alleged viewpoint discrimination, compelled disclosure of donors and associations, and retaliation; Fifth Amendment violations (due process and equal protection) based on interference with attorney‑client relationships and allegedly irrational targeting; and Sixth Amendment violations premised on interference with clients’ right to counsel of choice and effective representation. They contend that producing donor identities, budgets, personnel files, and vendor payments would chill speech, deter donors and partners, expose confidential mediation and clinical practice information, and impair ongoing representations (including one client who, they say, already withdrew).\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and emergency injunctive relief (temporary, preliminary, and permanent) to stay and prohibit Northwestern’s production of the demanded materials and to bar the Committee from obtaining them.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Elaine E. Bucklo. Because the Committee’s deadline was imminent, an emergency hearing on the TRO motion was held on April 10, 2025 before Emergency Judge Andrea R. Wood. The court denied the emergency TRO as moot and without prejudice, for reasons stated on the record. No written opinion issued.\n\nSubsequent docket activity included appearances by counsel for the Committee and Northwestern, waivers of service by the nominal defendants, and routine pro hac vice admissions. On June 24, 2025, Judge Bucklo granted the parties’ joint motion to stay the case. The matter is stayed until further order, with a status hearing set for September 22, 2025 and a joint status report due September 15, 2025.\n\nThere are no reported opinions, no class allegations, and no related or consolidated cases noted on the docket. No trial has been set. The relief sought remains declaratory and injunctive, with no claim for damages.",
    "46353": "On April 7, 2025, a software engineer in lawful F‑1 student status working under a STEM OPT authorization filed suit in the Northern District of California against the President, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of ICE, and ICE’s San Francisco Field Office Director. Represented by private counsel (Van Der Hout LLP), the plaintiff brought an individual (non‑class) action under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act, alleging that DHS/ICE unlawfully terminated the plaintiff’s SEVIS record on March 28, 2025, by coding the record as “Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status” with a narrative referencing INA § 237(a)(1)(C)(i), and that the termination lacked legal authority and due process. The plaintiff also alleged that DHS adopted an unlawful policy targeting African, Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim, and Asian students, in violation of the APA and the Accardi doctrine. The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief: vacatur of the SEVIS termination; restoration of the SEVIS record; an order preserving F‑1 status, continued STEM OPT employment, and eligibility to change to H‑1B; and prohibitions on arrest, transfer out of the district, and removal during the litigation.\n\nThe factual predicate asserted that since late March 2025 DHS/ICE, through SEVP, terminated hundreds of students’ SEVIS records, often after State Department notifications of visa revocations, and that some affected students were arrested and transferred to detention facilities in Louisiana and Texas. The plaintiff’s school confirmed it did not initiate the termination. The plaintiff acknowledged a single minor misdemeanor that had been disclosed to DHS and did not involve a crime of violence or a potential sentence exceeding one year; DHS had approved immigration benefits after learning of the offense. The plaintiff alleged compliance with F‑1/OPT requirements and argued that neither a visa revocation nor a criminal records “hit” authorizes ICE to terminate status or SEVIS, and that visa issues can be litigated in removal proceedings if charged.\n\nThe government opposed emergency relief, arguing that SEVIS is an information‑tracking system created under 8 U.S.C. § 1372; that SEVP’s change of a SEVIS record to “terminated” is a ministerial, record‑keeping action that neither terminates F‑1 status nor has independent legal effect; that DOS (not a defendant) controls visa revocations, which are distinct from status; that ICE had not charged the plaintiff as removable; and that the plaintiff lacked a protected property interest in a SEVIS record and had not shown likely irreparable harm. The opposition included a declaration from an ICE official stating that SEVP changed the plaintiff’s SEVIS designation after receiving DOS communications that the visa was not valid.\n\nJudge Jeffrey S. White granted a temporary restraining order ex parte on April 17, 2025, and set a prompt hearing. At the April 25 hearing, the Court questioned the government’s “flag only” characterization in light of DHS’s own public guidance stating that SEVIS termination eliminates employment authorization and can trigger ICE investigations. The Court extended the TRO for 14 days, enjoining defendants from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring the plaintiff during the proceedings and from imposing any legal effects that might otherwise flow from the SEVIS termination or any potential visa revocation. The Court also ordered supplemental briefing, including on whether nationwide relief might be appropriate.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, the government notified the Court that ICE would reactivate or maintain as Active the SEVIS records for the plaintiffs in these related cases (and similarly situated plaintiffs) while ICE developed a new policy framework for SEVIS terminations; at that time, DHS could not represent what notice or opportunity to respond would be provided before future SEVIS terminations. That same day, the plaintiff’s DSO informed the plaintiff that the SEVIS record had been restored to Active and a new Form I‑20 issued.\n\nSeveral similar cases were related to Judge White for coordinated proceedings, including S.Y. v. Noem (No. 25‑cv‑03244), Zhuoer Chen v. Noem (No. 25‑cv‑03292), Emma Bai v. Lyons (No. 25‑cv‑03481), Sky Qui v. Lyons (No. 25‑cv‑03475), Jungwon Kim v. Noem (No. 25‑cv‑03383), W.B. v. Noem (No. 25‑cv‑03407), J.C. v. Noem (No. 25‑cv‑03502), Shangshang Wang v. Noem (No. 25‑cv‑03323), and Yiwei He v. Noem (No. 25‑cv‑03480). The Court heard these matters together for TROs and later for preliminary injunctions.\n\nAfter further briefing and a May 14, 2025 hearing, the Court on May 22, 2025 granted motions for preliminary injunctions in this and the related cases. Although the written order is not reproduced in the record provided here, the Court had previously enjoined the government from imposing legal consequences based on the SEVIS terminations or potential visa revocations and from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring plaintiffs during the pendency of the cases; the preliminary injunctions continued to preserve the status quo while the merits are litigated. The Court set case management conferences for August 1, 2025 (later continued to September 26, 2025) and granted extensions for defendants to respond to the complaints.\n\nDefendants filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025 (No. 25‑4514) from the preliminary injunction orders and moved to stay the injunctions pending appeal. On August 22, 2025, Judge White granted the stay motions in part and denied them in part (terms not detailed in the materials provided).\n\nJudge: Jeffrey S. White, United States District Judge.\n\nLegal basis and relief: The plaintiff’s claims arise under the APA (5 U.S.C. § 706) and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief that ICE lacked authority to terminate the SEVIS record and that the action was arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, and taken without required procedure; injunctive relief restoring the SEVIS record and prohibiting arrest, transfer, removal, or other legal effects based on the termination or any visa revocation; and preservation of work authorization and ability to change status. The Court conditionally granted the plaintiff’s motion to proceed under a pseudonym.\n\nRelated proceedings: Numerous similar actions were related to this case and jointly heard for TRO and preliminary injunction purposes. The government stated on April 25, 2025 that ICE would keep or make those plaintiffs’ SEVIS records Active while it developed a new policy on SEVIS terminations. No trial has occurred. Appeals from the preliminary injunctions are pending in the Ninth Circuit.",
    "46337": "On April 3, 2025, nineteen states filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts challenging portions of Executive Order No. 14248, “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,” issued by the President on March 25, 2025. The plaintiffs are state governments represented by their state attorneys general. They sued the President (for declaratory relief), the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and its commissioners, and the Secretary of Defense in their official capacities.\n\nThe states seek declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201. Their causes of action allege ultra vires and separation-of-powers violations and intrusions on state authority under the Elections Clause and Electors Clause. They also contend that the executive order conflicts with federal election statutes—the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). The complaint challenges executive order provisions that would: (1) require the EAC to add a “documentary proof of citizenship” requirement to the national mail voter registration form and require state/local officials to record specified document details; (2) require “the head of each” voter-registration agency covered by the NVRA to assess citizenship before providing the federal registration form at public assistance programs; (3) require the Secretary of Defense to add documentary proof of citizenship and state-eligibility proof to the UOCAVA Federal Post Card Application; (4) direct the EAC to withhold election funding from states that do not accept and use the federal form as so modified; and (5) direct the Attorney General to enforce a reading of federal “Election Day” statutes that would bar states from counting mail ballots received after Election Day, and direct the EAC to condition funding on adoption of an Election Day ballot-receipt deadline.\n\nThe case is before Chief District Judge Denise J. Casper. Early in the case, the court denied the federal defendants’ motion to transfer or stay in favor of consolidated litigation by private plaintiffs in the District of Columbia, noting this state suit involved different parties and also challenged a provision not at issue there (§ 3(d)). The court recognized the related D.D.C. decision preliminarily enjoining §§ 2(a) and 2(d) as to private plaintiffs. See League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Exec. Off. of the President, 2025 WL 1187730 (D.D.C. Apr. 24, 2025).\n\nOn June 13, 2025, after briefing and argument, Judge Casper granted the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court held the claims challenging §§ 2(a), 2(d), 3(d), 7(a) and 7(b) were ripe, the states were likely to succeed on the merits, and they faced irreparable harm. The court concluded the President lacks authority to direct the EAC to mandate documentary proof of citizenship on the NVRA federal form (§ 2(a)) or to direct state-designated voter-registration agencies to assess citizenship before distributing forms (§ 2(d)), and that those commands contravene Congress’s scheme and procedures for the bipartisan, independent EAC under the NVRA and HAVA. The court likewise found the President lacks authority to require the Secretary of Defense to impose documentary proof and proof-of-state-eligibility on the UOCAVA Federal Post Card Application (§ 3(d)), observing that UOCAVA employs a postcard form and attestation. As to § 7(a), the court held the Attorney General could not undertake civil or criminal enforcement actions against thirteen plaintiff “Ballot Receipt States” whose laws count ballots mailed by Election Day but received shortly thereafter, because the cited Election Day statutes do not provide such enforcement mechanisms and do not bar states from counting ballots cast by Election Day. As to § 7(b), the court held HAVA does not authorize conditioning EAC funding on a state’s ballot-receipt deadline and the President cannot direct the EAC to impose such extra-statutory conditions.\n\nThe amended preliminary injunction, entered July 18, 2025, enjoins executive-branch officials (but not the President) from: (1) implementing § 2(a) (EAC documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement and recording of document details); (2) implementing § 3(d) (UOCAVA FPCA documentary proof and state-eligibility proof); (3) implementing § 2(d) (pre-distribution citizenship assessments by voter-registration agencies) as to the plaintiff states; (4) taking civil or criminal enforcement actions under § 7(a) against the thirteen plaintiff Ballot Receipt States (California, Nevada, Massachusetts, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Rhode Island); and (5) implementing § 7(b) to condition EAC funding on an Election Day receipt deadline against those Ballot Receipt States. The court found imminent irreparable harm from required system overhauls, diversion of resources, threatened loss of HAVA funds, and likely disenfranchisement of eligible voters lacking ready access to citizenship documents. No bond was required. The injunction remains in effect unless modified.\n\nKey procedural steps include: the complaint (April 3, 2025); denial of transfer/stay (May 9, 2025); grant of preliminary injunction (June 13, 2025), with an amended order (July 18, 2025); and the federal defendants’ notice of appeal (First Circuit No. 25-1726) filed July 31, 2025. A motion to dismiss is pending in the district court with a hearing set for September 4, 2025.\n\nThe case turns on constitutional separation of powers and the Elections and Electors Clauses, and on Congress’s statutory framework (NVRA, HAVA, UOCAVA) assigning roles to the states and the EAC. The court has not consolidated this matter with the D.D.C. cases, but cited the D.D.C. injunction of §§ 2(a) and 2(d) as related context. No trial has occurred, no settlement has been reached, and there is no court-appointed monitor.",
    "46238": "On March 17, 2025, two active‑duty Air Force members—both transgender men—filed a constitutional suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey challenging President Donald J. Trump’s January 27, 2025 Executive Order 14183, Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness, the January 20, 2025 Executive Order 14168 (defining “sex” biologically for executive branch purposes), and Department of Defense (DoD) and Air Force memoranda implementing those orders. The suit was brought by the service members against the Secretary of Defense in his official capacity, the United States, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force, and the Department of the Air Force. Plaintiffs were represented by public‑interest civil rights organizations (GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders and the National Center for Lesbian Rights) and private firms (Stapleton Segal Cochran LLC; Langer Grogan & Diver P.C.).\n\nThe complaint alleged that the new policy reversed prior open‑service rules and now bans transgender people from military service and requires any transgender service member to serve only in their birth sex, including with respect to pronouns, facilities, and grooming; pauses accessions for those with a history of gender dysphoria; and directs separation processing of current members meeting those criteria. Plaintiffs—an E‑7 Master Sergeant with over 14 years of decorated service and an E‑5 Staff Sergeant with six years of service—alleged they were pulled from assignments in early March 2025 (one from training at Joint Base McGuire‑Dix‑Lakehurst, the other from deployment in Kuwait), placed on administrative absence because they are transgender, told they must comply with female standards, and warned they could face involuntary administrative separation as early as March 26, 2025. They asserted violations of the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection component (for exclusion from service, the requirement to serve in birth sex, and the discriminatory executive‑branch definition of sex), procedural due process, and estoppel, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement of the challenged directives, as well as preliminary relief.\n\nJudge Christine P. O’Hearn presided. On March 18, 2025, the court issued an Order to Show Cause setting a TRO hearing for March 24. Defendants opposed, arguing military deference, that the policy regulates a medical condition (gender dysphoria) rather than sex or transgender status, applies at most rational‑basis review, that plaintiffs had not shown irreparable harm, and that they had failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Defendants also cited prior litigation over a 2018 DoD policy and a then‑recent nationwide preliminary injunction entered in Talbott v. United States (D.D.C.) enjoining implementation of EO 14183 and related DoD policies.\n\nAfter briefing and argument, on March 24, 2025 the court granted a 14‑day TRO. The order enjoined defendants from initiating administrative separation proceedings against the two plaintiffs based on their transgender status and from enforcing the challenged executive orders and implementing guidance as to them. The court found plaintiffs likely to succeed on their Fifth Amendment equal protection claims because the orders classify based on sex and transgender status and failed to show an “exceedingly persuasive” justification under intermediate scrutiny; that plaintiffs were already suffering and faced imminent irreparable harm, including removal from duty, administrative absence, reputational stigma associated with separation processing, and disclosure of personal information; that no bond was required; and that exhaustion was not required because the policies presented a clear constitutional violation, administrative procedures would be inadequate to prevent irreparable injury, and exhaustion would be futile given the directives to separate. On March 25, 2025 defendants asked to stay implementation of the TRO to align with parallel litigation and asserted no separations would begin before March 28; on March 26 the court denied the stay request, noting defendants had not shown a basis for a stay and that staying the TRO would return plaintiffs to the status that prompted emergency relief.\n\nThroughout, the parties and the court referenced related cases, including Talbott v. United States (D.D.C.), which had entered a nationwide preliminary injunction against EO 14183 and implementing DoD policies, and Shilling v. United States (W.D. Wash.). No appeal was noticed in this case. On May 15, 2025, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice.\n\nLegal foundation and relief sought: Plaintiffs proceeded under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343, asserting Fifth Amendment equal protection (challenging exclusion, the requirement to serve in birth sex, and the executive‑branch definition of sex), procedural due process, and estoppel. They sought declaratory and permanent injunctive relief, preliminary injunctive relief, and fees and costs.\n\nFactual context: The complaint traced prior DoD policy development: a 2016 policy allowing open service; a 2018 policy restricting service by those with gender dysphoria; a 2021 reversal allowing transgender service under President Biden; and the 2025 executive orders and DoD/Air Force memoranda that, among other things, defined sex biologically, barred accessions by those with gender dysphoria, required service in birth sex, ended use of gender‑identity pronouns, and directed identification and separation of affected service members on an expedited timeline.",
    "46234": "Filed March 15, 2025 in the Northern District of New York, this case was brought by three individuals connected to Cornell University: a non‑citizen Ph.D. student studying on an F‑1 visa, a U.S.‑citizen Cornell professor, and a U.S.‑citizen Cornell Ph.D. student. They sued the federal government—initially the President, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the DHS Secretary—challenging portions of two executive orders issued in early 2025: Executive Order 14161 (Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats) and Executive Order 14188 (Additional Measures to Combat Anti‑Semitism). After a hearing on their first TRO motion, the plaintiffs amended their pleading on March 27, 2025 to add the Department of State, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)’s Acting Director, and ICE’s Buffalo Field Office Director.\n\nThe suit is an individual, not class, action. Plaintiffs are represented by a combination of private counsel and a civil rights advocacy organization.\n\nLegal foundation and claims. Plaintiffs asserted constitutional claims under the First Amendment (free speech, right to receive information, and freedom of association) and the Fifth Amendment (due process—vagueness/overbreadth), along with claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706), the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and the Accardi doctrine. In the amended filing, the non‑citizen plaintiff also sought habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and invoked the Suspension Clause. Statutory provisions central to the dispute included 8 U.S.C. § 1201(i) (consular visa revocation), § 1227(a)(1)(B) (removability upon loss of status), and the jurisdiction‑channeling provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1252. Constitutionally, plaintiffs alleged viewpoint discrimination and unconstitutional vagueness/overbreadth in the Orders’ references to “hostile attitudes” toward U.S. “citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles” (EO 14161) and the directive to use all available tools to “prosecute [and] remove” people for “unlawful anti‑Semitic harassment and violence,” including having universities “monitor and report” non‑citizen students and staff (EO 14188).\n\nFactual basis. The non‑citizen plaintiff has publicly criticized U.S. policy toward Israel and supported Palestinian rights in campus and public forums. Plaintiffs alleged that high‑level public statements by federal officials conflated pro‑Palestinian advocacy with antisemitism and warned of deportations or criminal prosecution. In March 2025, DHS arrested a former Columbia student activist, which the President publicly characterized as the first of many enforcement actions under the Orders. The State Department revoked the Cornell student’s F‑1 visa under 8 U.S.C. § 1201(i), and ICE stated it attempted to locate him for a civil arrest to initiate removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B) because his authorization had been revoked. Government declarations asserted that the revocation relied on DHS information that the student engaged in “disruptive protests … creating a hostile environment for Jewish students,” and not on foreign policy grounds. Plaintiffs alleged that these actions—and the Orders themselves—chilled their speech and association; the citizens also claimed a First Amendment right to hear the non‑citizen student.\n\nRemedies sought. Plaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief to bar enforcement of challenged provisions of the Orders (including EO 14161 § 1(b) and EO 14188 § 2 and monitoring/reporting directives), to enjoin detention and removal of the non‑citizen plaintiff, to vacate the visa revocation under § 1201(i), and to obtain habeas relief preventing custody and transfer, along with fees.\n\nProceedings and rulings. Judge Elizabeth C. Coombe presided; Magistrate Judge Miroslav Lovric handled case‑management issues. Plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) with their initial filing; an ex parte TRO request was denied on March 20, 2025 and unsealed the next day. After expedited briefing, the court held a hearing on March 25, 2025 and, on March 27, 2025, denied TRO relief. The court concluded: (1) it lacked subject‑matter jurisdiction to enjoin the initiation of removal proceedings against the non‑citizen plaintiff because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5) and § 1252(b)(9) channel such challenges to a petition for review after a final order; (2) plaintiffs’ challenge to EO 14161 appeared constitutionally unripe because that Order expressed policy and preparatory steps but did not itself proscribe conduct or threaten imminent enforcement against plaintiffs; (3) the citizen plaintiffs failed to show redressable injury for their “right‑to‑listen” claim, because any remedy would require enjoining removal proceedings the court could not reach; and (4) plaintiffs had not established irreparable harm warranting a TRO, including any imminent enforcement of EO 14188 against U.S. citizens. The court noted that the State Department had already revoked the non‑citizen plaintiff’s visa before suit was filed.\n\nAmended filings and disposition. On March 27, 2025, plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint and Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus that added the State Department, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and ICE officials, challenged the visa revocation under 8 U.S.C. § 1201(i), and renewed requests to enjoin detention, transfer, and removal, as well as enforcement of the Orders. The court set expedited briefing on a second TRO motion. Before the court ruled, plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice on March 31, 2025. The case was closed on April 2, 2025.\n\nJudge: U.S. District Judge Elizabeth C. Coombe (N.D.N.Y.). No reported opinions were issued; the TRO denial is reflected at Dkt. 40 (Mar. 27, 2025).\n\nRelated matters. Plaintiffs cited a contemporaneous Southern District of New York case involving a lawful permanent resident student who obtained a TRO against detention and transfer while challenging enforcement actions (Chung v. Trump, No. 1:25‑cv‑02412 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2025)), but this case was not consolidated with any other. No trial occurred, and no appeal was taken. No decrees, settlements, or monitors were appointed.",
    "46216": "Basic Case Information\n- Filing date: March 12, 2025.\n- Parties: Two physicians who are Harvard Medical School faculty sued the federal personnel agency, the federal health department, and the federal patient‑safety research agency, along with their acting leaders in their official capacities. The suit concerns those agencies’ actions affecting a federal patient‑safety website.\n- Plaintiffs: Individual physicians and medical school faculty (not a class action).\n- Counsel: Plaintiffs are represented by the ACLU of Massachusetts, the national ACLU, and Yale Law School’s Media Freedom & Information Access Clinic. Defendants are represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n- Judge: District Judge Leo T. Sorokin (D. Mass.).\n\nLegal Foundation\n- Causes of action: (1) First Amendment (viewpoint discrimination and unreasonable restriction in a government‑run forum), and (2) Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claims alleging agency action that is arbitrary and capricious, contrary to constitutional right, and exceeding statutory authority (5 U.S.C. § 706).\n- Statutory/constitutional bases: First Amendment; APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551–706. Plaintiffs also challenge OPM’s reliance on 5 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1), (5).\n- Remedy sought: Declaratory and injunctive relief, vacatur of the OPM guidance to the extent it mandates takedowns, restoration of removed materials, and fees.\n\nContext and Factual Basis\n- AHRQ’s Patient Safety Network (PSNet), launched in 2005 and merged with “WebM&M” in 2015, publishes case studies and expert commentaries on patient safety. Content is authored by private experts, curated by contractor‑editors, and displays a disclaimer that it is not the official position of AHRQ or HHS.\n- Plaintiffs authored two PSNet commentaries: (1) an endometriosis diagnostic commentary (published June 24, 2020) noting that endometriosis can occur in trans and non‑gender‑conforming people, and (2) a suicide‑risk commentary (published January 7, 2022) listing LGBTQ and transgender individuals among higher‑risk groups with a JAMA citation.\n- On January 20, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14168 (“Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”), directing agencies to remove statements that “promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.”\n- On January 29, 2025, OPM issued a memorandum to all agencies instructing—by January 31, 2025—removal of “all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) that inculcate or promote gender ideology,” and to report actions by February 7, 2025.\n- On January 31, 2025, HHS relayed the directive internally. AHRQ identified PSNet materials via word searches for terms including “transgender,” “nonbinary,” “gender identity,” and “LGBTQ,” and removed the two plaintiffs’ commentaries (and about 20 items total).\n- AHRQ offered to repost plaintiffs’ content only if the “problematic words” were deleted; the suicide‑risk piece required removing “transgender” and “LGBTQ,” and the endometriosis piece required deleting its final sentence. Plaintiffs declined. AHRQ later rejected plaintiffs’ proposed alternative wording for the endometriosis piece and reiterated that “no reference to transgender” would be permitted.\n\nFilings and Proceedings\n- March 12, 2025: Complaint filed alleging First Amendment violations (viewpoint‑based censorship in a limited public forum and unreasonableness) and APA violations (arbitrary and capricious, ultra vires, and contrary to constitutional right); seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and restoration of removed content.\n- April 1, 2025: Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. Defendants opposed, arguing lack of standing/redressability (PSNet contract had expired on March 24, 2025 and the site was static), reasonableness of actions in a limited public forum, no final agency action, and that OPM did not exceed statutory authority.\n- May 21, 2025: Hearing held.\n- May 23, 2025: Preliminary injunction granted in part.\n\nCourt Rulings on Important Filings\n- Preliminary Injunction (May 23, 2025):\n  - The court held plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment claim because PSNet is a limited public forum and the removals amounted to “textbook” viewpoint discrimination; restrictions also appeared unreasonable in light of PSNet’s patient‑safety purpose.\n  - The court found plaintiffs also likely to succeed on APA claims: the removals were final agency action and likely arbitrary and capricious, and OPM likely exceeded statutory authority by directing agencies to take down outward‑facing media under 5 U.S.C. § 1103, which concerns OPM’s own functions and civil‑service management, not other agencies’ website content.\n  - The court rejected defendants’ standing/redressability arguments, finding restoration feasible despite the PSNet contract lapse.\n  - Irreparable harm was presumed from the First Amendment violation. Balance of equities and public interest favored plaintiffs.\n  - Relief ordered: within seven days, defendants must restore to PSNet complete, unaltered versions of (a) the two plaintiffs’ commentaries and (b) all other content authored by private parties that was removed from PSNet pursuant to implementation of EO 14168. The injunction remains in effect until judgment unless modified. The court declined broader, forward‑looking relief enjoining all future implementation of the OPM memorandum because the record did not show ongoing harm beyond PSNet.\n\nDecrees\n- Date and terms: Preliminary injunction entered May 23, 2025; restoration of specified content within seven days; no bond required; remains in effect until entry of judgment unless altered by a higher court or the district court.\n\nRelated Cases\n- The court noted, but did not defer to, a separate suit in the District of Columbia (Doctors for America v. OPM) addressing similar issues. No consolidation.\n\nSubsequent Proceedings\n- June 16, 2025: Defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject‑matter jurisdiction (mootness, standing, ripeness). That motion was fully briefed and remains pending on the docket as of the latest filings.\n\nMonitoring/Settlement\n- No court‑appointed monitor. No settlement reported.\n\nSummary of the Dispute\n- The case challenges the removal and conditional reposting of privately authored, peer‑reviewed patient‑safety commentaries from a government‑run medical‑safety website based on references to LGBTQ and transgender people, undertaken to comply with an Executive Order and an OPM directive. The court found a strong likelihood that the actions were unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination in a limited public forum and likely unlawful under the APA, and ordered restoration of the removed private‑party materials to PSNet while the case proceeds.",
    "46207": "Filed March 7, 2025 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, this class action is brought by three transgender federal prisoners on behalf of similarly situated people in Bureau of Prisons (BOP) custody against the President (official capacity), the Attorney General, the Acting BOP Director, and senior BOP officials. The plaintiffs are represented by public‑interest counsel (ACLU Foundation, ACLU of the District of Columbia, and Transgender Law Center). They challenge Executive Order 14168 (issued Jan. 20, 2025) and BOP implementing memoranda that, as applied in federal prisons, prohibit spending for medical procedures, treatments, or drugs “for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex,” and bar gender‑affirming accommodations (e.g., binders, opposite‑sex undergarments, hair‑removal devices, and pronoun use). Before the EO, BOP provided gender‑affirming care under its 2016 and 2023 clinical guidance and a 2022 Transgender Offender Manual, including hormone therapy, surgery referrals, and clothing/commissary accommodations.\n\nLegal foundation and relief sought: Plaintiffs allege (1) Eighth Amendment violations (deliberate indifference to serious medical needs), (2) Fifth Amendment equal‑protection violations, (3) disability discrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and (4) Administrative Procedure Act (APA) violations (final agency action that is unconstitutional and arbitrary and capricious). They seek declaratory and injunctive relief setting aside BOP’s memoranda, enjoining EO 14168 as applied to BOP medical care and accommodations, a stay of agency action under 5 U.S.C. § 705, restoration/continuation of gender‑affirming hormone therapy and accommodations, class certification, and fees.\n\nProceedings and rulings: On March 17, 2025, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction (and § 705 stay) and for provisional class certification. Amici States (Indiana, Idaho, and 22 others) supported defendants, arguing policymakers may categorically regulate contested medical interventions and that the Eighth Amendment does not compel prisons to provide them. After briefing and a May 22 hearing, Judge Royce C. Lamberth granted the preliminary injunction and certified a class on June 3, 2025.\n\n- Jurisdiction and exhaustion: The court found the case not moot despite partial restoration of some hormones (voluntary cessation), and held PLRA exhaustion was excused because, as of filing, the grievance process operated as a “dead end” given BOP’s then-uniform implementation of the EO and memoranda.\n\n- APA merits: The court found the challenged BOP memoranda were reviewable final agency action and that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their APA claims. The memoranda provided no reasoned explanation, treated gender dysphoria differently from comparable medical needs without justification, and failed to account for reliance interests or the abrupt reversal of longstanding BOP policy. The court declined, at this stage, to reach the constitutional claims.\n\n- Irreparable harm and equities: The court credited evidence that stopping hormone therapy and revoking accommodations caused or risked serious psychological harm (including suicidality) and found the equities and public interest favored an injunction.\n\n- Preliminary injunction (significant terms): The court ordered BOP to make social accommodations available to all class members to the same extent as before the EO and to provide hormone therapy to class members prescribed such medications by BOP or other medical personnel to the same extent as before the EO (pending litigation). On August 20, 2025, the court granted a renewed preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of EO 14168 § 4(c) against any class member from September 1 to November 30, 2025.\n\nClass certification: The court certified a Rule 23(b)(2) class (after modifying the proposed definition) consisting of “all persons who are currently or will be incarcerated in BOP facilities with a current diagnosis of gender dysphoria or who receive such a diagnosis in the future.” The court found numerosity (over 1,000 BOP inmates with gender dysphoria), commonality/typicality (a uniform policy restricting care), adequacy (no conflicts; experienced public‑interest counsel), and that a single injunction would provide indivisible relief. The court appointed plaintiffs’ counsel as class counsel.\n\nContext and factual basis: The EO directed BOP to revise policies to end “gender ideology” spending; BOP then (1) disbanded the Transgender Executive Council, (2) removed the Transgender Offender Manual from its website, and (3) issued two memoranda (Feb. 21 and Feb. 28, 2025) halting gender‑affirming accommodations and prohibiting funds for treatments or drugs to conform appearance. Plaintiffs had previously received hormone therapy and accommodations that alleviated gender dysphoria; after the EO/memoranda, hormones were reduced, halted, or threatened with discontinuation, and accommodations were revoked, causing anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, and suicidality. The court noted BOP later restored some hormone therapy to hundreds of inmates but found, as of filing, implementation was categorical.\n\nJudge: Judge Royce C. Lamberth.\n\nImportant filings and opinions:\n- Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction and for Provisional Class Certification (Mar. 17, 2025).\n- Amicus Brief of 24 States in support of defendants (Apr. 1, 2025).\n- Hearing (May 22, 2025).\n- Memorandum Opinion granting preliminary injunction and class certification (ECF 67, June 3, 2025); Order (ECF 68).\n- Renewed Preliminary Injunction Order enjoining EO § 4(c) for the class from Sept. 1–Nov. 30, 2025 (ECF 79, Aug. 20, 2025).\n\nRelated case: Doe v. McHenry, No. 1:25‑cv‑00286‑RCL (D.D.C.) (earlier TRO/PI involving BOP treatment of transgender inmates referenced by the court).\n\nStatus/appeals: Defendants answered on June 24, 2025. No appeals are reflected in the record provided. No settlement or monitor has been appointed. The President remains a defendant; the court noted potential availability of declaratory relief against the President and declined to dismiss him at this stage.",
    "46104": "Filed February 11, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, this Freedom of Information Act case is brought by a nonprofit public‑interest watchdog organization against several executive‑branch entities and one White House component: the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the U.S. DOGE Service (USDS), the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, the former U.S. Digital Service, and the Office of Management and Budget. The plaintiff seeks to compel responses to eight FOIA requests, two of which it asked to be processed on an expedited basis, for records of communications involving Elon Musk and key staff and for records related to the January 2025 removals of inspectors general. The nonprofit is represented by its own in‑house counsel. The case is before Judge Beryl A. Howell.\n\nThe suit alleges jurisdiction under FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B), and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202. The plaintiff contends the DOGE entities are “agencies” subject to FOIA because, as created and implemented by executive orders in January and February 2025, they perform functions beyond advising and assisting the President, including directing embedded “DOGE teams” within federal agencies and accessing or influencing agency systems and operations. The plaintiff further alleges that, despite proper FOIA requests submitted between January 30 and February 3, 2025—including requests to OMB and USDS for (1) communications using specified key terms tied to the inspectors general removals, (2) communications with congressional offices, (3) pre‑inauguration exchanges between the then‑U.S. Digital Service and a nongovernmental “DOGE” group, and (4) post‑inauguration records such as Musk’s calendars, staffing records, Musk’s employment records, and his external communications—defendants did not make timely determinations, did not grant expedited processing, and did not produce records. OMB acknowledged several requests and assigned tracking numbers (including OMB 2025‑613, ‑614, ‑641 to ‑646) but, as pled, provided no determinations. In March 2025, USDS informed the plaintiff that USDS sits within the Executive Office of the President, is subject to the Presidential Records Act, and is not subject to FOIA, which the plaintiff disputes.\n\nThe First Amended Complaint (filed March 5, 2025) asserts three FOIA claims: failure to grant expedited processing for the two January 30 requests concerning the inspectors general removals; failure to conduct adequate searches; and wrongful withholding of non‑exempt records. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief ordering expedited processing of the two urgent requests, FOIA‑compliant searches for all eight requests, prompt production of non‑exempt records and Vaughn indices for any withholdings, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees.\n\nKey procedural steps include: service completed March 6, 2025; an extension granted for defendants to answer; and defendants’ answer filed April 21, 2025 (amended April 24, 2025). On April 2, 2025, Judge Howell granted the plaintiff’s motion for a preservation order, directing DOGE to preserve all records responsive to the eight FOIA requests and to disclose whether all such records had been preserved to date. In granting preservation, the Court noted the use of ephemeral messaging and the need to guard against spoliation during litigation, and observed that FOIA and Presidential Records Act obligations differ.\n\nOn May 23, 2025, the Court issued a scheduling order for briefing on whether the plaintiff should be permitted limited discovery to determine whether DOGE wields independent authority sufficient to be subject to FOIA. The plaintiff’s motion for limited discovery was filed June 2, 2025, attaching proposed, narrowly tailored interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission focused on DOGE’s authority, structure, leadership, and the role of “DOGE teams.” Defendants opposed on June 16, 2025, and the plaintiff replied on June 23, 2025. As of the latest docketed entries, that discovery motion remained under submission, and no dispositive motion schedule had been set.\n\nJudge: Beryl A. Howell.\n\nCause of action and legal basis: FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552 (including expedited processing provisions) and Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202. The case turns in part on whether DOGE/USDS/USDS Temporary Organization qualify as “agencies” under FOIA. The plaintiff cites related D.D.C. decisions discussing DOGE’s status, including AFL‑CIO v. Department of Labor, 2025 WL 542825 (D.D.C. Feb. 14, 2025) (discussing agency status issues) and CREW v. U.S. DOGE Service, 2025 WL 752367 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025) and 2025 WL 1392836 (D.D.C. Apr. 15, 2025), which addressed preservation and FOIA applicability in other litigation.\n\nRelief sought: declaratory and injunctive orders requiring expedited processing of two requests, FOIA‑compliant searches and productions on all eight requests, Vaughn indices for withholdings, and attorneys’ fees and costs. The preservation order was granted on April 2, 2025 and remains in effect during the litigation. No settlement, trial, or appeal has occurred. The case remains in pre‑dispositive motion practice focused on preservation and limited discovery regarding DOGE’s agency status.\n\nFactual context: The requests concern communications involving Elon Musk and his staff; the establishment and operations of DOGE as implemented by executive orders; access to and direction of agency systems and functions by DOGE personnel; and the mass removal of inspectors general. The plaintiff alleges urgency due to widespread public interest and potential risks of record loss through ephemeral or non‑governmental messaging platforms.",
    "46602": "Filed May 15, 2025 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, this case challenges the April–June 2025 actions that disrupted the federal-state humanities funding partnership. The plaintiffs are a state humanities council and the national federation of state and territorial humanities councils. The defendants are the White House’s DOGE component and its acting administrator; the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and its advisory National Council on the Humanities; and the Acting Chair of NEH. Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel; defendants by the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nCongress created NEH to fund humanities activities nationwide and, since 1976, to provide grants-in-aid to each state and U.S. jurisdiction through the Federal/State Partnership. In FY 2024 Congress appropriated $207 million to NEH, with $192 million for humanities activities and administration and, by joint explanatory statement and table, $65 million identified for the Federal/State Partnership. A full-year continuing resolution in March 2025 extended those amounts through September 30, 2025. The authorizing statutes direct how Federal/State funds must be allotted to councils with approved plans, including a mandatory formula: 44% in equal shares, 22% by population, and 34% available for discretionary state or regional grants, with funds “available” to states with approved plans at the start of the fiscal year. 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(4)-(5).\n\nIn early April 2025, after DOGE operatives arrived at NEH, NEH sent near-identical emails to roughly 1,500 grantees terminating awards, including operating, special initiative, and other grants to the state councils. The termination letters, sent from a non-NEH email account and not through NEH’s grants system, cited a Presidential Executive Order and 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4), asserted the grants no longer effectuated agency priorities, and offered no appeal. NEH also placed most staff on leave and then executed a large reduction in force, including in the Office of Federal/State Partnership. On June 2, 2025, NEH partially rescinded some FY 2025 council operating grant terminations but restored only “up to 20%” of program funds, leaving many grants terminated and stating there would be no appeal. Plaintiffs alleged widespread harm including layoffs, cancelled programming, and loss of community partnerships.\n\nThe amended complaint (June 11, 2025) asserts: (1) APA § 706(1) unlawful withholding/unreasonable delay (failure to process and allocate funds as required); (2) APA § 706(2) agency action contrary to law (terminations and partial rescissions in violation of 20 U.S.C. § 956(f) and procedural requirements, and contrary to the Impoundment Control Act); (3) APA § 706(2) arbitrary and capricious action (lack of reasoned explanation and mass terminations); (4) Separation of Powers (Appropriations Clause, Spending Clause, Take Care Clause); (5) nonstatutory ultra vires action by DOGE; and (6) Impoundment Control Act/appropriations violations via nonstatutory review. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including to vacate the terminations and partial rescissions; to compel NEH to apply the statutory allocation formula and process grants and reimbursements; to prohibit reallocation of committed funds; and attorneys’ fees.\n\nPlaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction and an APA § 705 stay on June 25, 2025. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief supporting the motion. On August 6, 2025, Judge Michael H. Simon granted in part the requested preliminary injunction and § 705 stay. The court held plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of several claims. It found a strong likelihood of success on the Separation of Powers claim because NEH may not refuse to spend appropriated funds or ignore the mandatory allocation regime in 20 U.S.C. § 956(f); the general “carryover” clause, § 956(f)(6), does not authorize bypassing the statutory formula or withholding funds “available” to states with approved plans. The court also found a likelihood of success on APA “contrary to law” claims: NEH did not comply with the statutory process for suspending or terminating grants to councils, which requires the Chair to make specified findings after notice and opportunity for a hearing before halting further funding, § 956(f)(7); NEH failed to follow the formula in § 956(f)(4); and NEH’s actions likely violated the Impoundment Control Act, which does not permit withholding budget authority without the statute’s required procedures. The court further concluded the mass terminations and “partial rescission” were arbitrary and capricious because NEH provided only boilerplate assertions tied to presidential policy, offered no reasoned explanation or individualized analysis, and did not account for reliance interests.\n\nAddressing jurisdictional defenses, the court rejected the government’s Tucker Act argument, holding the case arises under statutes and the Constitution, seeks equitable relief, and challenges agency action—not contract claims. It found final agency action, that the decisions were not committed to unreviewable discretion, venue proper in Oregon, and associational standing for the federation. The court held there is no private right of action under the Impoundment Control Act, but ICA violations can render agency actions “contrary to law” under the APA. The court found irreparable harm from halted programs, layoffs, and reputational injury; the equities and public interest favored maintaining the statutory status quo.\n\nRelief ordered (Preliminary Injunction and § 705 Stay, Aug. 6, 2025): (1) NEH is enjoined from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations of grants awarded to the two plaintiffs and to all member councils of the federation; (2) defendants are prohibited from further terminating, suspending, or canceling plaintiffs’ grants approved as of April 2, 2025, absent cause specified in § 956(f)(7) or further court order; and (3) defendants are barred from obligating, encumbering, disbursing, or otherwise disposing of funds committed to plaintiffs and federation members through grants approved as of April 2, 2025, except to plaintiffs. The court stayed, under APA § 705, implementation of the April 2 terminations and any disbursement of the committed funds to others. The court denied the government’s request for an administrative stay and did not require a bond. The injunction remains in effect pending further order. No appeals are noted. There are no consolidated or related cases on this docket, no trial, and no settlement.",
    "46478": "On April 22, 2025, two Illinois‑based, family‑owned companies that design and sell educational toys—Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc.—filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the President, cabinet officials, and federal agencies, including Homeland Security, Treasury, Commerce, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the U.S. Trade Representative. Represented by private counsel (Akin Gump), the companies challenge a series of 2025 executive orders issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq., that imposed sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe challenged orders are: (1) Executive Order 14195 (Feb. 1, 2025), imposing a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods (later increased to 20% by Executive Order 14228 on Mar. 3, 2025), predicated on fentanyl trafficking; (2) a further order eliminating de minimis duty‑free treatment for covered Chinese goods; and (3) Executive Order 14257 (Apr. 2, 2025), which declared a national emergency based on persistent U.S. goods trade deficits and imposed a universal 10% tariff on nearly all imports plus country‑specific “reciprocal” tariffs. Executive Orders 14259 (Apr. 8, 2025) and 14266 (Apr. 9, 2025) adjusted the “reciprocal” rate on China to 84% and then 125% and paused those reciprocal tariffs for most other countries for 90 days. With the separate 20% China tariff, most Chinese imports faced a combined minimum ad valorem IEEPA tariff of about 145% before later adjustments. DHS/CBP implemented these orders by modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that: (1) the tariffs are ultra vires because IEEPA does not authorize tariff‑levying (they argue “regulate” importation under § 1702(a)(1)(B) does not mean “tax” and is limited to property in which a foreign country or national has an interest); (2) even if IEEPA could authorize tariffs, these particular measures violate § 1701(b) because they are not limited to “unusual and extraordinary” threats and are not reasonably related to the emergencies declared (trade deficits for the universal order; fentanyl for the China orders), and because the orders also eliminated statutory de minimis and drawback protections; (3) the agency actions implementing the orders violate the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706; and (4) to the extent IEEPA is construed to authorize such broad tariff power, it violates Article I and the separation of powers (nondelegation). They seek declaratory and injunctive relief, vacatur of HTSUS modifications, and fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act.\n\nThe government moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) under 28 U.S.C. § 1631 and § 1581(i), arguing the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction over tariff cases. On May 29, 2025, Judge Rudolph Contreras denied transfer and granted a preliminary injunction. The Court held it had jurisdiction because IEEPA is not a “law … providing for … tariffs” within 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B), and concluded the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their ultra vires claim. The Court reasoned that IEEPA’s text does not mention tariffs or duties, that “regulate” importation is distinct from raising revenue, that the statute’s other listed verbs confirm a non‑revenue regulatory focus, that Title 19 contains specific, limited tariff delegations that would be undermined by a broad IEEPA reading, that historical practice shows no President has used IEEPA to levy tariffs, and that § 1702(a)(1)(B) is limited to property in which a foreign country/national has an interest. The Court distinguished the 1975 Yoshida decision interpreting TWEA, found irreparable harm based on detailed evidence of immediate cancellations, lost sales, and existential business risk (Woldenberg Declaration), and determined that a plaintiff‑only injunction would minimally burden the government given broader, contemporaneous litigation. The injunction enjoined the agency defendants (not the President) from collecting tariffs from these plaintiffs under Executive Orders 14195, 14228, 14257, 14259, and 14266; the Court set a Rule 65(c) bond and initially delayed the injunction’s effectiveness 14 days.\n\nThe United States noticed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit (No. 25‑5202) and moved to stay the injunction pending appeal, submitting declarations from the Secretaries of State, Treasury, and Commerce, and the USTR attesting to ongoing, sensitive negotiations and national security concerns. On June 3, 2025, Judge Contreras granted a stay pending appeal, noting the Federal Circuit had stayed a separate, broader CIT injunction and that a stay here would protect the President’s ability to respond to perceived threats while appellate review proceeds. On July 18, 2025, the district court stayed further proceedings pending the D.C. Circuit’s decision.\n\nAmicus briefs were filed: America First Legal supported transfer; a bipartisan group of former officials and scholars supported the preliminary injunction; and several small businesses opposed transfer. Related litigation includes V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States, 2025 WL 1514124 (Ct. Int’l Trade May 28, 2025) (permanent injunction later stayed by the Federal Circuit), Barnes v. United States, 2025 WL 1483384 (Ct. Int’l Trade May 23, 2025) (standing dismissal after finding § 1581(i) jurisdiction), Webber v. DHS, 2025 WL 1207587 (D. Mont. Apr. 25, 2025) (transfer to CIT), and Emily Ley Paper, Inc. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1482771 (N.D. Fla. May 20, 2025) (transfer to CIT).\n\nFactual context: The President invoked IEEPA to address fentanyl supply chains (China order) and “large and persistent” trade deficits (universal/reciprocal order), estimating substantial revenue and asserting national security and economic rationales. Plaintiffs import directly from China and other affected countries and attested that the tariffs render many imports uneconomical, causing immediate order cancellations, projected steep sales declines, and potential layoffs and closures. The preliminary injunction currently is stayed, and the case is paused pending the D.C. Circuit appeal.",
    "46390": "Filed April 12, 2025, this class habeas action in the District of Colorado challenges the President’s March 2025 invocation of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), 50 U.S.C. §§ 21–24, to summarily remove Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of Tren de Aragua (TdA). The petitioners are Venezuelan civil immigration detainees held at ICE’s Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora who seek to represent a class of similarly situated detainees in Colorado. They are represented by the ACLU (national and Colorado affiliates) and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network. The respondents are federal officials and agencies, including the President, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, DHS/ICE leadership, the Secretary of State, and local ICE and facility officials, all sued in their official capacities.\n\nProceeding under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas), the All Writs Act (28 U.S.C. § 1651), and the Declaratory Judgment Act, the petition asserts that the Proclamation exceeds the AEA (ultra vires) because TdA is not a “foreign nation or government” and there is no qualifying “invasion” or “predatory incursion” within the AEA’s meaning; violates the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause (for lack of meaningful notice and opportunity to contest “alien enemy” designations); and conflicts with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including asylum (8 U.S.C. § 1158), withholding (8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)), and the Convention Against Torture (FARRA, 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note). Petitioners sought class certification under Rule 23(b)(2), a TRO and preliminary injunction (PI), an order barring transfers out of the district, adequate advance notice of any AEA removal, and declaratory relief.\n\nThe case arose after the March 14–15, 2025 Proclamation invoked the AEA to authorize immediate apprehension and removal of Venezuelan TdA “members,” bypassing INA processes. According to the filings, more than 100 individuals were removed to El Salvador shortly thereafter and incarcerated at the CECOT “mega-prison,” with reports of harsh conditions and lack of contact; petitioners challenged the government’s designation methods (e.g., reliance on tattoos) and asserted no process was afforded to contest TdA membership. The Supreme Court subsequently held in related litigation that challenges to AEA removals must proceed via habeas and that detainees are entitled to due process and “notice within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief” before removal. Trump v. J.G.G., 2025 WL 1024097 (U.S. Apr. 7, 2025). The government later described a notice protocol as short as 12 hours to indicate intent to file habeas and 24 hours to file.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, the district court (Judge Charlotte N. Sweeney) issued an All Writs Act order preserving jurisdiction by prohibiting removal of the named petitioners (and, as clarified, the putative class) from the District of Colorado or the United States for up to 14 days. On April 22, 2025, the court granted a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), provisionally certified the proposed class, barred transfers of class members outside the district, and required 21 days’ advance written notice (in a language the person understands) of any intended AEA removal, including notice of the right to seek judicial review and to consult an attorney. See D.B.U. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1163530 (D. Colo. Apr. 22, 2025). The court found habeas jurisdiction, standing (based on the substantial risk of imminent designation/removal), and justiciability (rejecting “political question” arguments). On the merits, the court concluded petitioners were likely to succeed because the Proclamation failed AEA preconditions: Founding-era and constitutional usage show “invasion” and “predatory incursion” are military concepts, and the Proclamation did not establish that TdA is a “foreign nation or government.” The court also found the government’s notice practices inadequate under due process and the Supreme Court’s J.G.G. guidance. The court denied the government’s request to stay the TRO; the Tenth Circuit also denied a stay, finding no irreparable harm given existing Supreme Court constraints on AEA removals and the TRO’s brief duration. See D.B.U. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1233583 (10th Cir. Apr. 29, 2025). The government later voluntarily dismissed its appeal of the TRO.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, the district court certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2): “All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled ‘Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua’ and/or its implementation.” The court found numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy, and that respondents had acted on grounds generally applicable to the class such that uniform injunctive relief was appropriate.\n\nThat same day, the court granted a preliminary injunction. Adopting its prior statutory analysis, the court again held petitioners were likely to succeed because the Proclamation exceeded the AEA’s scope; it found irreparable harm based on the risk of wrongful AEA removal and the harms alleged in detention abroad, and it held the equities and public interest favored relief. The PI enjoins respondents from detaining, transferring, or removing petitioners and class members under the AEA based on the Proclamation from the District of Colorado. In light of this broader relief, the court lifted the TRO’s 21‑day notice requirement for AEA removals (because AEA removals are now barred in the district while the case proceeds). The government filed a notice of appeal on July 7, 2025 from the class certification and PI (10th Cir. No. 25‑1265); an earlier TRO appeal had been dismissed after the stay was denied.\n\nReported opinions: D.B.U. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1163530 (D. Colo. Apr. 22, 2025) (TRO); D.B.U. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1233583 (10th Cir. Apr. 29, 2025) (stay denied). The orders certifying the class and granting the PI issued May 6, 2025 (ECF Nos. 51, 52).\n\nRelated national litigation includes J.G.G. v. Trump (D.D.C./D.C. Cir.) culminating in Trump v. J.G.G., 2025 WL 1024097 (U.S. Apr. 7, 2025) (requiring habeas route and adequate pre‑removal notice) and A.A.R.P. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1147581 (U.S. Apr. 19, 2025) (directing the government not to remove members of a putative AEA class pending further order); district courts in other jurisdictions have also issued class TROs or preliminary relief in analogous habeas class cases (e.g., J.A.V. v. Trump, S.D. Tex.).\n\nIn sum, the case is a certified Rule 23(b)(2) habeas class action brought by detained Venezuelan noncitizens challenging the President’s use of the AEA against alleged TdA members. The district court has enjoined any AEA‑based detention, transfer, or removal of the class in the District of Colorado while the case proceeds, and the government has appealed the class certification and preliminary injunction.",
    "46499": "Filed April 11, 2025 in the Northern District of California, this case challenges an early-April 2025 nationwide operation in which the Department of Homeland Security, through ICE’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), terminated hundreds or thousands of active SEVIS records for F‑1 international students. The plaintiffs—individual students pursuing degrees or OPT—allege they were in good academic standing and compliant with F‑1 rules, yet their records were terminated without notice or individualized process based on entries such as “otherwise failing to maintain status—identified in criminal records check and/or had visa revoked.” The terminations immediately jeopardized lawful presence, studies, and work authorization.\n\nParties and counsel. The plaintiffs are individual students (not a class) from several universities and programs. They are represented by private counsel at DeHeng Law Offices PC, joined later by the Chinese American Legal Defense Alliance. The defendants are the Secretary of Homeland Security and ICE’s Acting Director; in July 2025 the Secretary of State was added in connection with visa revocations. The government is represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nLegal foundation and claims. The students sue under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Declaratory Judgment Act, alleging the SEVIS terminations were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, and that the lack of notice and opportunity to be heard violated the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause; they also assert equal protection claims under the Fifth Amendment. They rely on 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f) (F‑1 rules) and § 214.1(d), which tightly limits DHS’s authority to terminate nonimmigrant status (revoked waivers, private bills, or a Federal Register notice on specified grounds), and on ICE Policy Guidance 1004‑04 stating visa revocation alone is not a basis to terminate a SEVIS record after admission. The amended complaint adds an APA claim against the State Department targeting mass F‑1 visa revocations or “prudential” revocations (often stated to become effective upon departure) purportedly under 8 U.S.C. § 1201(i), alleging those actions exceed statutory authority and were arbitrary when pegged to the unlawful SEVIS terminations.\n\nRelief sought. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief: restoration of their SEVIS records and F‑1 status, an order barring further unlawful SEVIS terminations without lawful process, and later, restoration or withdrawal of visa revocations linked to the same operation.\n\nProceedings and rulings. On April 15, 2025 the students moved for a TRO. On April 18, Judge Susan Illston issued a 14‑day ex parte TRO limited to the named plaintiffs, enjoining arrests, transfers, and adverse legal effects tied to the terminations, and set a later hearing. The case was related with other F‑1 student cases and reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White, who coordinated proceedings with several related actions (including John Doe v. Trump, S.Y. v. Noem, W.B. v. Noem, and J.C. v. Noem). After litigation began, ICE reactivated affected students’ SEVIS records retroactively and issued a new policy on SEVIS terminations; DHS stated the retroactive activation meant “as though the termination did not happen,” and sent letters to impacted students. On May 22, 2025, Judge White granted preliminary injunctions (covering this and related cases). He found plaintiffs likely to succeed on their APA claim because SEVIS termination functions as a termination of status and DHS did not adhere to § 214.1(d) or its own guidance; he also found irreparable harm (education and work disruption, risk of detention/removal), and that the equities and public interest favored relief.\n\nPreliminary injunction (terms and duration). The Court enjoined DHS and ICE from: (1) arresting or incarcerating the named plaintiffs and similarly situated F‑1 students nationwide; (2) transferring them outside their jurisdictions; (3) imposing any adverse legal effect caused by the SEVIS terminations; and (4) reversing the reinstatement of SEVIS records of students maintaining status under 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(5)(i) for reasons not set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 214.1 without further showing and court approval. The injunction is preliminary and remains in effect pending further proceedings; initial case management conferences were set for August 1, 2025.\n\nAmended pleading and further motion practice. On July 29, 2025, plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint adding the Secretary of State and three additional student plaintiffs, alleging visa revocations tied to the same April 2025 sweep were unlawful under 8 U.S.C. § 1201(i) and the APA. On July 30, they moved to amend the preliminary injunction to address the visa revocations; that motion remained pending on the record provided.\n\nAppeal and stay request. On July 21, 2025, DHS and ICE appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit and moved in the district court for a stay pending appeal on August 8, 2025. They argued (among other points) that the nationwide scope violates the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. CASA, that plaintiffs lacked irreparable harm after SEVIS reactivation, that the order is overbroad as to arrests and transfers, and that § 214.1(d) was misapplied to SEVIS records. Subsequent orders on the stay are reflected on the docket but not provided in the record excerpts.\n\nRelated cases and context. The Court handled this case together with several related F‑1 student cases in the same district for argument and coordinated relief (John Doe, S.Y., W.B., J.C.). The filings also referenced a TRO issued in a similar case in the District of New Hampshire (Liu v. DHS, No. 1:25‑cv‑00133‑LM, Apr. 7, 2025) and other contemporaneous cases around the country. No class has been certified in this action.\n\nFactual basis. Plaintiffs contend the April 2025 operation combined an NCIC data sweep with SEVIS terminations and visa revocations, without individualized assessments, notice, or lawful basis. Many affected students had no convictions; some had minor or dismissed matters (e.g., expunged arrests or traffic citations). Universities reported receiving no advance notice and advised students that terminations ended their F‑1 status and work authorization. DHS later reactivated SEVIS records retroactively, but plaintiffs allege harms persisted and, for some, visa revocations remained in place.",
    "46319": "On March 31, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (a labor union representing about 160,000 federal employees across 37 agencies) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the President and the heads of multiple federal departments and agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management, the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, Energy, Treasury, and the Interior (Bureau of Land Management), the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Communications Commission, and Treasury component heads (IRS, IRS Chief Counsel, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency). The union is represented by its in‑house counsel; the defendants are represented by the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Division.\n\nThe suit challenges Executive Order 14,251, issued March 27, 2025, which invokes 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) to exclude from the Federal Service Labor‑Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) a long list of agencies and subdivisions—among them, all of the NTEU‑represented bargaining units at: the IRS; IRS Office of Chief Counsel; Bureau of the Fiscal Service; Treasury Departmental Offices; TTB; OCC; DOE; EPA; FCC; BLM; and HHS components (Office of the Secretary, FDA, ASPR, CDC, and ORR in ACF); and DOJ’s Civil Rights Division and Environment and Natural Resources Division. According to the union, these exclusions immediately terminate recognition and collective‑bargaining obligations, and, under same‑day OPM guidance, end agency participation in grievance procedures, permit disregard of CBA provisions (including reduction‑in‑force articles), and cease payroll dues withholdings. NTEU alleges about two‑thirds of its represented employees (roughly 104,000) are removed from statutory coverage, that dues (94% paid via payroll deduction) will be cut off at the affected agencies, and that it will lose about half of its revenue (about $25 million annually), jeopardizing its operations.\n\nNTEU asserts three claims: (1) the Order is ultra vires because it exceeds § 7103(b)(1)’s narrow authority to exclude only agencies or subdivisions whose primary function is “intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work” and only where the statute cannot be applied “consistent with national security requirements and considerations”; (2) the Order conflicts with Chapter 71 generally by effectively nullifying Congress’s statutory collective‑bargaining program; and (3) the Order is First Amendment retaliation, citing a contemporaneous White House Fact Sheet stating “[c]ertain Federal unions have declared war on President Trump’s agenda,” contrasting “hostile” unions with those that “work with him,” and linking the Order to large‑scale reductions‑in‑force and removal of “procedural impediments” to firing. NTEU seeks declaratory relief and to enjoin non‑Presidential defendants from implementing Section 2 of the Order and OPM’s guidance.\n\nJudge Paul L. Friedman granted a preliminary injunction on April 25, 2025 (opinion issued April 28, 2025, 2025 WL 1218044). The court held district court jurisdiction was not precluded by the FSLMRS administrative scheme because the Executive Order itself removed the affected agencies and subdivisions from the statute, leaving no FLRA forum; it noted the FLRA has dismissed similar cases for lack of jurisdiction when an agency is excluded by executive order. On the merits, the court determined the usual presumption of regularity was rebutted by clear evidence in the Administration’s own materials: the Fact Sheet’s focus on “hostile” unions and “mass obstruction,” and OPM’s guidance tying the Order to facilitating RIFs and employee removals rather than to national security criteria. The court concluded NTEU was likely to succeed on its ultra vires claims because the President applied an overly broad interpretation of “primary function” and “national security work,” risking “allowing the exception to swallow the rule” and conflicting with Congress’s stated findings that collective bargaining is in the public interest (5 U.S.C. § 7101(a)). The court found irreparable harm based on ongoing loss of bargaining recognition and dues (already in the millions), threats to the union’s viability, and diminished ability to represent employees. Balancing the equities and public interest, the court emphasized preserving the statutory status quo Congress enacted. It enjoined non‑Presidential defendants from implementing Section 2 of the Order and OPM’s guidance as to the NTEU‑represented agencies and subdivisions, declined to require a bond, and rejected a carve‑out for any single agency on the preliminary record.\n\nDefendants appealed and sought a stay. The district court denied a stay on May 1, 2025, but on May 16, 2025, a D.C. Circuit panel (per curiam; Judge Childs dissented) granted a stay pending appeal. The panel held NTEU had not shown irreparable harm given government directions to agencies (in post‑Order FAQs) not to terminate CBAs or decertify units while litigation proceeds and that revenue loss could be redressed in FLRA proceedings if NTEU ultimately prevailed; it found the injunction impaired the President’s national‑security prerogatives and that the public interest favored preserving presidential autonomy under § 7103(b). The court also observed bonds are generally required for injunctions.\n\nWhile the appeal proceeds, the district court set summary‑judgment briefing. NTEU moved for summary judgment on June 9, 2025, pressing its ultra vires and First Amendment claims and detailing agency noncompliance (refusal to bargain or process grievances, eviction from union offices, and cessation of dues withholding). Defendants cross‑moved on June 23, 2025, arguing: (i) the FSLMRS review scheme precludes district court jurisdiction; (ii) sovereign immunity bars the suit; (iii) ultra vires review is unavailable or, if available, the Order is a lawful exercise of the President’s discretion under § 7103(b)(1) because the identified agencies’ primary functions include investigative or national‑security work and Chapter 71 cannot be applied consistently with national security; and (iv) retaliation fails because the Order would have issued regardless. NTEU opposed, reiterating that the Executive Order itself forecloses FLRA jurisdiction; that ultra vires review is proper to enforce Congress’s limits; that the Order’s stated rationale is unrelated to § 7103(b)(1); and that the record (including the Fact Sheet and Treasury’s immediate suit against an NTEU chapter) shows retaliatory motive and effect. Final decision on the cross‑motions is pending.\n\nJudge: Paul L. Friedman (D.D.C.). On appeal, a D.C. Circuit motions panel (Judges Henderson and Walker; Judge Childs dissenting) granted a stay pending appeal on May 16, 2025.\n\nLegal basis and remedies: The claims rest on the FSLMRS (Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 7101–7135) and the First Amendment. NTEU seeks declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining implementation of Section 2 of Executive Order 14,251 and OPM’s March 27, 2025 guidance and an award of fees and costs.\n\nKey factual context: The Executive Order excludes roughly two‑thirds of the federal workforce (including about two‑thirds of NTEU’s represented employees) from Chapter 71. OPM’s guidance states excluded agencies are no longer subject to Chapter 71, lose obligations to bargain, and should end payroll dues allotments, and it links the Order to large‑scale RIFs and easing removals. The White House Fact Sheet characterizes certain federal unions as having “declared war” on the President’s agenda and frames the Order as preventing “union obstruction” in agencies with “national security missions.” NTEU alleges immediate loss of recognition and dues (94% of its dues revenue is from payroll deductions), diminished bargaining power, and substantial financial harm. The government asserts the affected entities have primary investigative or national‑security functions and that Chapter 71 cannot be applied to them consistently with national‑security requirements. The case remains pending on appeal and on cross‑motions for summary judgment.",
    "46285": "Filed March 24, 2025 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, this case is brought by three nonprofit, membership-based immigrant-rights organizations—the organizations’ members include noncitizens paroled into the United States—against federal officials: the Secretary of Homeland Security, the acting heads of ICE, CBP, and USCIS, and the President, all sued in their official capacities. The plaintiffs are represented by nonprofit public-interest counsel (Justice Action Center), in coordination with counsel for the organizations. This is not a class action; the groups sue on behalf of their members.\n\nThe case challenges DHS’s use of expedited removal against noncitizens who were inspected at a port of entry and granted humanitarian parole. Plaintiffs target three written DHS actions issued in early 2025: (1) a January 23, 2025 memorandum instructing DHS components to consider applying expedited removal to any noncitizen amenable to it, including terminating active removal proceedings and parole; (2) a February 18, 2025 ICE directive instructing officers to consider for expedited removal “paroled arriving aliens” (stating there is “no time limit” to process such aliens for expedited removal); and (3) a March 25, 2025 Federal Register notice terminating the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole processes and ending existing CHNV parole, expressly to maximize use of expedited removal before many parolees reached two years’ presence. Plaintiffs allege that after these directives, ICE began dismissing immigrants’ pending § 1229a (section 240) removal cases in court and arresting them outside courtrooms to process them for expedited removal, with attendant detention and limited access to counsel.\n\nLegal basis and claims: Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief and vacatur under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3), contending that applying expedited removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) to individuals previously paroled at a port of entry is unlawful. They also assert that the agency actions are arbitrary and capricious and violate due process. The amended complaint (June 11, 2025) adds an Accardi claim and a direct APA challenge to the regulatory definition of “arriving alien” at 8 C.F.R. § 1.2. Plaintiffs also sought a temporary stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705.\n\nProceedings and rulings: The government moved to dismiss (May 30, 2025) arguing lack of standing, § 1252 jurisdictional bars, timeliness, zone-of-interests, and failure on the merits. Plaintiffs amended as of right (June 11), mooting the motion to dismiss, and moved the same day for a § 705 stay. After a July 9 hearing, Judge Jia M. Cobb granted the § 705 stay on August 1, 2025, staying the January 23 memorandum, the February 18 ICE directive, and the March 25 CHNV termination notice insofar as they subject to expedited removal any noncitizen who has been, at any time, paroled into the United States at a port of entry. The Court found a substantial likelihood of success that the actions exceed statutory authority and are arbitrary and capricious, that plaintiffs’ members face irreparable harm (including curtailed process, detention, family separation, and risk of wrongful removal), and that the balance of equities and public interest favor relief. The Court held that the Designation Provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II), by its terms excludes individuals who have been “admitted or paroled,” and that the Arriving Aliens Provision, § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), does not authorize treating previously paroled individuals as perpetually “arriving.” The Court also found the DHS documents internally inconsistent about the legal bases and time limits for using expedited removal and lacking a reasoned explanation. On jurisdiction, the Court concluded that § 1252(e)(3) authorizes the challenge, § 1252(f)(1) does not bar a § 705 stay, § 1252(g) does not foreclose review of systemwide policies, the claims were timely as challenges to written policy directives first implemented in 2025, and plaintiffs met associational standing and redressability. The Court issued the stay nationwide as to all such parolees and required no bond.\n\nPost-ruling activity: The government filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit on August 5, 2025 (No. 25-5289) and moved in the district court to stay the August 1 order pending appeal; Judge Cobb denied that stay on August 13, 2025. The Court vacated the deadline to answer the amended complaint and directed the government to serve the administrative record within 60 days while the stay remains in place, with a joint status report due after the D.C. Circuit’s decision.\n\nRelief sought and granted to date: Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, vacatur of the challenged DHS actions, an order barring application of expedited removal to individuals previously paroled at a port of entry, potential vacatur of any such expedited removal orders issued to members, facilitation of returns if needed, and attorneys’ fees. To date, the Court has granted interim § 705 relief staying the three DHS actions to the extent they subject previously paroled individuals to expedited removal, pending final resolution. No bond was required.\n\nJudge: Hon. Jia M. Cobb, U.S. District Judge, District of Columbia.\n\nRelated litigation: The filings reference other challenges to (i) the nationwide expansion of expedited removal (Make the Road New York v. Huffman, No. 25-cv-00190 (D.D.C.)) and (ii) the termination of parole programs (Doe v. Noem, 2025 WL 1099602 (D. Mass. Apr. 14, 2025), stay granted pending appeal, Noem v. Doe, 2025 WL 1534782 (U.S. May 30, 2025)).\n\nContext and factual basis: The case arises from January–March 2025 DHS actions following an executive order directing termination of categorical parole programs, a January 21, 2025 DHS designation expanding expedited removal to the statutory maximum nationwide for certain noncitizens with less than two years’ presence, and the shutdown of CBP One scheduling. Plaintiffs allege the combined effect exposes hundreds of thousands of parole beneficiaries, including those who built lives and pursued relief while on parole, to arrest, detention, and rapid removal without the procedural protections of section 240 proceedings. The Court’s stay preserves the pre-policy status quo as to expedited removal applicability to such parolees while the case proceeds.",
    "46179": "On February 24, 2025, two Senate‑confirmed members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Board, a sitting Board member, the Board’s Executive Director, a White House personnel official, and the President, all in their official capacities. The individual plaintiffs (not a class) are represented by private counsel (Arnold & Porter). The government is represented by the Department of Justice, Civil Division, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nThe dispute arises from events between January 21 and January 27, 2025. The White House Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel emailed each plaintiff requesting resignation by January 23 and stating they would otherwise be terminated. The plaintiffs did not resign. On January 27, they received one‑line emails stating their positions “were terminated on Thursday, January 23, 2025 at 17:01.” No cause was given. The third Democratic member (then‑Chair) was also terminated. A remaining Board member directed staff to cut off the plaintiffs’ Board access, and the Board publicly announced the terminations. Those actions left the five‑member Board without a quorum, limiting its ability to perform statutory functions, including issuing Board reports and its semiannual reports to Congress.\n\nThe suit asserted: (1) Administrative Procedure Act claims (agency action contrary to law, in excess of authority, and without required procedure) premised on 42 U.S.C. § 2000ee and the 2007 amendments that made PCLOB an “independent agency”; (2) a Fifth Amendment due‑process claim; (3) non‑statutory ultra vires claims; (4) mandamus; and (5) equitable relief to enforce statutory and constitutional limits. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief (including reinstatement). The initial complaint sought backpay not exceeding $10,000, but the amended complaint dropped all monetary relief.\n\nOn March 12, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment; the government filed a cross‑motion on April 3. After a hearing on April 30, Judge Reggie B. Walton granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs in a memorandum opinion issued May 21, 2025. See 2025 WL 1454010. The court held that, although PCLOB’s organic statute contains no express for‑cause removal clause, the statute’s structure and function clearly indicate Congress intended to restrict at‑will presidential removal of Board members: in 2007 Congress removed the Board from the Executive Office of the President, designated it an “independent agency,” deleted “serve at the pleasure of the President” and “under the general supervision of the President” language, required Senate confirmation, partisan balance, expert qualifications, and staggered six‑year terms, and assigned oversight and reporting functions to Congress and the public. The court further held those implied removal protections are constitutional under Humphrey’s Executor because PCLOB is a multimember expert body that does not wield substantial executive power (it cannot regulate, adjudicate, punish, or issue subpoenas on its own). Concluding the removals were unlawful, the court: (1) declared the terminations null and void; (2) ordered de facto reinstatement by enjoining the Board, the Board member, the Executive Director, and the White House personnel official—not the President—from treating the plaintiffs as removed or interfering with their duties; and (3) clarified that each plaintiff may be removed before his term ends only for cause (and, for the holdover member, upon confirmation of a successor). No damages were awarded.\n\nThe government noticed an appeal on May 27, 2025 (D.C. Cir. No. 25‑5197) and moved to stay the injunction; the district court denied a stay on May 29, 2025. On July 1, 2025, a D.C. Circuit panel (Judges Katsas, Rao, and Walker) granted a stay pending appeal, concluding the government satisfied the Nken factors. The panel stated PCLOB’s statute lacks clear removal restrictions; PCLOB is not an adjudicatory tribunal and therefore does not warrant implied removal protection; and enjoining the Executive Branch to work with removed principal officers risks irreparable injury to presidential supervision. The district court’s injunction is stayed pending further order of the court.\n\nKey statutory and constitutional bases include 42 U.S.C. § 2000ee (PCLOB’s organic statute); the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706; and the Fifth Amendment. Remedies sought were declaratory and injunctive relief (including reinstatement), mandamus, and—initially but later withdrawn—limited backpay. There was no trial. The case resulted in a reported district court opinion (2025 WL 1454010) and a subsequent D.C. Circuit stay order; the appeal remains pending.\n\nJudge: Reggie B. Walton.\n\nDecree (district court, May 21, 2025):\n- Declared the terminations unlawful and void.\n- Held each plaintiff remains a Board member (one through January 29, 2028; the other in holdover through January 29, 2026, unless a successor is confirmed), removable early only for cause (or upon successor confirmation for the holdover member).\n- Enjoined the Board and specified officials from treating the plaintiffs as removed or interfering with their duties or benefits of office.\n\nAppeal/Stay:\n- Notice of appeal filed May 27, 2025.\n- District court denied a stay May 29, 2025.\n- D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal July 1, 2025.\n\nContext:\nCongress created PCLOB to balance counterterrorism activities with privacy and civil liberties, expanded its independence in 2007, and assigned it significant oversight and reporting roles to Congress and the public. The January 2025 removals of all three members affiliated with one political party left the Board without a quorum, prompting this suit and the district court’s de facto reinstatement order, now stayed on appeal.",
    "46106": "Filed on February 11, 2025, this action challenges the U.S. Office of Personnel Management’s disclosure of federal personnel records to individuals associated with a new White House initiative. The plaintiffs are two unions representing federal employees and three current/former federal employees. They sued OPM and its Acting Director, as well as entities created or renamed by a January 20, 2025 executive order—the U.S. DOGE Service (formerly U.S. Digital Service), the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization—and its director. Plaintiffs are represented by private and public‑interest counsel (Lex Lumina LLP; Electronic Frontier Foundation; State Democracy Defenders Fund; The Chandra Law Firm). The United States Attorney’s Office represents the government.\n\nThe suit alleges that, immediately after inauguration day, OPM granted DOGE‑affiliated individuals sweeping, “administrative” access to numerous OPM systems that contain highly sensitive personnel information, including the Electronic Official Personnel Folder, the Enterprise Human Resources Integration data warehouse, USAJOBS, USA Staffing, USA Performance, and health‑benefits systems (FEHB/PSHB). Plaintiffs contend the access was given without required vetting, security training, or a demonstrated “need to know,” and that it facilitated creation of a Government‑Wide Email System that used names/emails extracted from OPM databases. The complaint pleads: (1) Privacy Act claims under 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b) (unlawful disclosure) and § 552a(e)(10) (failure to safeguard records); (2) APA claims (5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706) alleging agency action “not in accordance with law” and arbitrary/capricious action; and (3) an ultra vires claim against the DOGE defendants. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief halting disclosures, impoundment/destruction of any records obtained, and compliance measures; they also pleaded Privacy Act damages, though the case has proceeded focused on injunctive relief.\n\nAfter plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order on February 14, the Court directed briefing and converted the request to preliminary‑injunction proceedings. Defendants moved to dismiss on March 14. On April 3, Judge Denise L. Cote denied the government’s jurisdictional challenge, holding the plaintiffs had Article III standing based on an injury resembling the common‑law tort of intrusion upon seclusion and risk of future harm, and found the complaint plausibly alleged Privacy Act violations. The Court dismissed the direct Privacy Act claims (to the extent they sought injunctive relief) but allowed them to serve as the predicate for APA review, and it sustained the APA claims and the ultra vires claim at the pleading stage. Reported opinion: 2025 WL 996542.\n\nPlaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on April 25. Following a May 29 evidentiary hearing (including cross‑examination of OPM’s Chief Information Officer), the Court issued a detailed June 9 opinion granting a preliminary injunction. The Court found: (1) OPM “disclosed” records under the Privacy Act by granting access to systems containing personally identifiable information, even if some users did not personally log in, (2) the § 552a(b)(1) “need to know” exception was not satisfied because broad administrative access was extended absent a demonstrated need tied to OPM duties, and (3) OPM failed to establish appropriate safeguards under § 552a(e)(10) by bypassing basic vetting, training, and least‑privilege/separation‑of‑duties principles. The Court further held the challenged actions were reviewable final agency action under the APA and that the Privacy Act did not provide an adequate alternative remedy for the forward‑looking relief sought. It declined to grant relief on the ultra vires claim at this stage because the APA injunction provided meaningful relief. On June 20, the Court entered the preliminary‑injunction order, administratively stayed for 14 days under Rule 62(c) and conditioned on a $1,000 bond. The order requires, among other things, that OPM file within two weeks of the order’s effective date a report describing the processes and procedures put in place since March 6, 2025 to ensure adherence to the Privacy Act before any new grants of access to PII in OPM systems of records. Status conferences and additional administrative‑record supplementation followed.\n\nLegal foundation and remedies: The case is brought under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (particularly §§ 552a(b) and 552a(e)(10)), and the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706(2)(A); plaintiffs also invoked FISMA (44 U.S.C. § 3554) as context for required safeguards. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief and, in the pleadings, damages under § 552a(g), though the Court held injunctive relief lies under the APA rather than directly under the Privacy Act. The preliminary injunction was granted on June 9 and entered June 20 with a 14‑day administrative stay and ongoing reporting; it remains in effect pending further order.\n\nJudge: Hon. Denise L. Cote, U.S. District Judge, Southern District of New York.\n\nImportant filings and rulings:  \n- TRO motion filed Feb. 14, 2025; opposed by the government; converted to PI proceedings.  \n- Motion to dismiss filed Mar. 14, 2025; granted in part/denied in part Apr. 3, 2025 (standing found; Privacy Act claims dismissed only insofar as independent injunctive claims; APA and ultra vires claims proceed). Reported at 2025 WL 996542.  \n- Preliminary injunction motion filed Apr. 25, 2025; hearing May 29, 2025; PI granted in a June 9, 2025 opinion; PI order entered June 20, 2025 (administrative stay of 14 days; $1,000 bond; OPM reporting obligations to ensure Privacy Act compliance before any new access to PII).  \n\nDecrees (significant terms and duration): The June 20 preliminary‑injunction order (effective upon posting of a $1,000 bond and after a 14‑day administrative stay) requires OPM to file a report within two weeks of the effective date describing processes and procedures implemented since March 6, 2025 to ensure adherence to the Privacy Act before any new grant of access to PII in OPM systems of records. The preliminary injunction remains in effect pending further order of the Court.\n\nMonitoring: The Court directed OPM to file the compliance report and has held follow‑up status conferences; additional administrative‑record supplementation was ordered, including for DOGE‑affiliated individuals.\n\nRelated cases: Courts in other districts addressed similar DOGE‑related access issues. The District of Maryland issued and later converted a TRO to a preliminary injunction against OPM (Am. Fed’n of Teachers v. Bessent), which was stayed on appeal; a separate preliminary injunction issued against SSA (later stayed by the Supreme Court). Other courts addressed related challenges involving Treasury, DOL, HHS, DOE, and CFPB.\n\nContext and facts: The case arises from Executive Order 14,158 (Jan. 20, 2025) establishing the Department of Government Efficiency agenda and redesignating the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. DOGE Service within the Executive Office of the President. Plaintiffs allege—and the Court preliminarily found—that, beginning January 20, 2025, OPM granted DOGE‑affiliated personnel broad, administrative‑level access to numerous OPM systems containing the PII of tens of millions of federal employees, applicants, annuitants, and family members without required vetting or training and without demonstrating a need to know tied to OPM duties. The Court found these actions violated the Privacy Act’s disclosure and safeguarding provisions and were arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The Court emphasized that while IT modernization is legitimate, it must comply with applicable law and cybersecurity standards.",
    "46095": "On February 10, 2025, three higher‑education associations and sixteen universities filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts challenging the National Institutes of Health’s February 7, 2025 “Supplemental Guidance to the 2024 NIH Grants Policy Statement: Indirect Cost Rates” (Notice NOT‑OD‑25‑068). The plaintiffs—two national university associations and a land‑grant association, joined by private and public research universities—alleged that NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services unlawfully capped indirect (facilities and administrative) cost reimbursement at 15% for all new NIH grants and, for institutions of higher education, for existing grants on a go‑forward basis, effective February 10, 2025. Defendants were HHS, NIH, the Acting HHS Secretary, and the Acting NIH Director (later automatically substituted by the current Secretary and NIH Director). Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel (including Jenner & Block LLP and Clement & Murphy, PLLC).\n\nThe complaint arose under the Administrative Procedure Act and related statutes and regulations. Plaintiffs claimed the Guidance violated: (1) Section 224 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (a recurring rider preserving the 2017 regulatory treatment of indirect costs and forbidding HHS/NIH from developing or implementing a modified approach), (2) HHS’s own grant regulations, particularly 45 C.F.R. § 75.414 and the NIH Grants Policy Statement (governing negotiated indirect cost rates and limited, procedurally‑defined deviations), (3) APA requirements of reasoned decisionmaking (arbitrary and capricious action) and notice‑and‑comment rulemaking, and (4) the APA’s bar on retroactive rules. They sought declaratory relief, vacatur, and injunctive relief (TRO, preliminary, and permanent injunction). Plaintiffs described immediate and irreparable disruption to ongoing clinical trials, research operations, staffing, and compliance activities if the 15% cap took effect.\n\nThis case proceeded in tandem with two related cases before the same judge: an action by 22 states (Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. NIH, 1:25‑cv‑10338) and an action by medical and public‑health education associations and hospital groups (Association of American Medical Colleges v. NIH, 1:25‑cv‑10340). The court coordinated briefing and held a joint hearing on February 21, 2025.\n\nDefendants opposed, arguing among other things that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the claims sounded in contract under the Tucker Act; that 45 C.F.R. § 75.414(c)(1)–(3) authorized NIH to deviate from negotiated indirect cost rates for a “class of Federal awards” and the Guidance did so, with reasons including reorienting funds toward direct research, oversight concerns, and alignment with private grant‑maker rates; that the appropriations rider did not prohibit NIH’s action; that no notice‑and‑comment was required; and that the Guidance was not retroactive because it applied only to “go‑forward” expenses.\n\nOn March 5, 2025, Judge Angel Kelley granted a nationwide preliminary injunction. The court rejected the jurisdictional (Tucker Act) argument, holding the case stated APA claims based on statutes and regulations rather than contract terms. On the merits, the court found plaintiffs likely to succeed because: (1) the Guidance conflicted with 45 C.F.R. § 75.414—NIH did not provide the required documented justification or pre‑established, publicly available policies, procedures, and decisionmaking criteria, and a uniform, across‑the‑board cap for all awards exceeded the regulation’s allowance for deviations for a “class” or “single” award; (2) the Guidance violated Section 224 of the 2024 appropriations act by modifying the approach to indirect cost provisions and expanding the fiscal effect of deviations beyond the proportional effect in 2017; (3) the Guidance was arbitrary and capricious because NIH offered conclusory rationales, failed to consider critical factors (including reliance interests and differences from private funders), and disregarded the existing audit regime; (4) the Guidance was a legislative rule adopted without required notice‑and‑comment, and HHS had bound itself to use APA procedures for grants‑related rules; and (5) as applied to existing grants, the Guidance was impermissibly retroactive because it impaired rights under already‑issued awards and imposed new obligations on past transactions. The court found irreparable harm (including impacts on clinical trials, research continuity, animals and facilities, staffing, and institutional operations) and held the public interest and equities favored relief.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, on defendants’ assented motion, the court converted the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction, entered final judgment, and vacated the Guidance. In the states’ case (1:25‑cv‑10338), judgment entered for plaintiffs on their APA claims. In the AAMC case (1:25‑cv‑10340), judgment entered for plaintiffs on their APA claims (with a constitutional retroactivity claim dismissed without prejudice). In this AAU/universities case (1:25‑cv‑10346), judgment entered for plaintiffs on Counts I (appropriations rider), III (45 C.F.R. § 75.414/NIH policy), IV (arbitrary and capricious), V (cost‑recovery regulations), VI (notice‑and‑comment), and VIII (retroactivity). Two counts (Appropriations Clause and Public Health Service Act theories) were dismissed without prejudice. The permanent injunction prohibits NIH, HHS, and their officers and agents from implementing, applying, or enforcing NOT‑OD‑25‑068 nationwide, and the Guidance was vacated under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).\n\nDefendants filed a notice of appeal on April 8, 2025, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (No. 25‑1345), appealing the final judgment and permanent injunction and the interlocutory orders merged into it. No trial occurred, and no monitor was appointed. The court’s orders remain in effect pending appeal.",
    "46023": "Filed February 3, 2025, this APA case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenges the Treasury Department’s grant of access to its payment systems and records to personnel associated with the United States “DOGE” Service (a rebranded United States Digital Service created by Executive Order 14158). The plaintiffs are three membership organizations—the Alliance for Retired Americans, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFL‑CIO), and the Service Employees International Union (AFL‑CIO)—suing on behalf of their members who receive or make federal payments (e.g., Social Security benefits, wages, refunds). The defendants are the Secretary of the Treasury in his official capacity (Scott Bessent), the Department of the Treasury, and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). Plaintiffs are represented by Public Citizen Litigation Group and the State Democracy Defenders Fund; the government is represented by the Department of Justice, Civil Division, Federal Programs Branch.\n\nLegal foundation. Plaintiffs bring claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging that Treasury’s decision to allow DOGE-affiliated individuals to access BFS systems and the personal/financial information therein is (1) “contrary to law” because it violates the Privacy Act of 1974 and, for taxpayer data, Internal Revenue Code § 6103; (2) arbitrary and capricious for failure to engage in reasoned decision-making; and (3) in excess of statutory authority. The requested remedy is declaratory and injunctive relief halting access and requiring future compliance with the Privacy Act, § 6103, and BFS Systems of Records Notices (SORNs), plus fees and costs.\n\nContext and facts. BFS is Treasury’s component that handles most federal disbursements and collections through systems such as Payment Automation Manager (PAM), the Secure Payment System (SPS), and the Payment Information Repository System (PIRS). These systems contain sensitive personally identifiable and financial information (e.g., names, SSNs, dates of birth, addresses, bank account/routing numbers) covered by BFS SORNs published at 85 Fed. Reg. 11776 (Feb. 27, 2020). Executive Order 14158 (Jan. 20, 2025) renamed USDS as the U.S. DOGE Service and directed agency heads, “to the maximum extent consistent with law,” to ensure DOGE has full and prompt access to unclassified agency records and IT systems; agencies were to establish internal DOGE Teams.\n\nAt Treasury, Thomas H. Krause (a Special Government Employee) began duties connected with the DOGE initiative in late January 2025; Marko Elez (a temporary transitional Schedule C employee) also worked briefly before resigning on February 6, 2025. Treasury initiated a “payment process engagement plan” in late January to give the Treasury DOGE Team insight into BFS’s end‑to‑end payment process. BFS recognized the scope of access was broader than usual for one individual and adopted mitigations (e.g., “read‑only” configuration, a secure code “sandbox,” laptop logging). On February 3–5, 2025, Elez received access to PAM and SPS; SPS was mistakenly configured with read/write privileges briefly on February 5 before correction to read‑only. Treasury reports an initial forensic review showed no unauthorized actions in the systems; a later filing disclosed that (on January 30) Elez emailed to two GSA officials a spreadsheet with USAID payment information that included personally identifying details; the agency subsequently recovered his credentials and equipment after his resignation. Separately, Treasury and State coordinated to identify and flag certain foreign‑assistance-related payment files for State Department review under a separate Executive Order; one payment was held and four proceeded.\n\nProceedings and rulings. Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 5, 2025. After a same-day hearing, the parties negotiated a consent order (entered February 6) deferring ruling on the TRO and preserving the status quo by prohibiting access to any BFS payment records/systems except for: (i) Krause and Elez with “read‑only” access as needed for Treasury duties; (ii) other Treasury employees with a need for the record in performance of duty; (iii) persons otherwise entitled under 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(2)–(13) or the Internal Revenue Code. The Court converted the TRO motion to a preliminary‑injunction motion and set briefing. On February 20, the Court modified the consent order (unopposed) to substitute Ryan Wunderly (a Treasury employee) for Elez and to specify that “Special Government Employees or Treasury DOGE Team members” other than those identified could not be granted access; the consent order remained in place pending resolution of the preliminary‑injunction motion.\n\nOn February 24, 2025, the Court held an evidentiary hearing and ordered production of the administrative record. On March 7, 2025, Judge Colleen Kollar‑Kotelly denied preliminary injunctive relief and dissolved the interim access limits. In the detailed opinion (All. for Retired Americans v. Bessent, 2025 WL 740401 (D.D.C. Mar. 7, 2025)), the Court (1) concluded it had subject‑matter jurisdiction; (2) held plaintiffs had associational standing (the alleged privacy harm was sufficiently concrete by analogy to intrusion upon seclusion, causally connected, and redressable; sovereign immunity did not bar suit under APA § 702 and the Privacy Act did not impliedly foreclose APA relief); but (3) denied a preliminary injunction for failure to show irreparable harm: plaintiffs did not demonstrate a “likelihood” (as opposed to a possibility) of imminent public dissemination or disclosure outside the federal government, Treasury had imposed monitoring/mitigations, and the claimed injuries were capable of later remediation (e.g., retrieval/destruction) if necessary. The Court emphasized it did not prejudge the merits.\n\nAdministrative record and limited discovery. Treasury filed the administrative record on March 10, 2025. On March 13, the Court partially granted plaintiffs’ record objections and directed supplemental information. On March 20, the Court granted in part expedited discovery (narrow written discovery) because the record was insufficient to “ascertain the contours of the precise policy at issue” (what actions Treasury took to implement EO 14158 within BFS), while declining broader discovery. A stipulated protective order governing confidential discovery materials entered on April 1.\n\nDispositive motions. Defendants moved to dismiss or, alternatively, for summary judgment on April 11, 2025, arguing lack of standing, no final agency action, adequate alternative remedies (Privacy Act and § 6103), and compliance with law (including that DOGE team members were Treasury “employees” with a “need to know” under § 552a(b)(1) and that § 6103(h) permitted access for tax‑administration purposes). Plaintiffs cross‑moved for summary judgment on April 25, 2025, contending Treasury instituted an unlawful system of disclosure without required SORN changes or congressional/OMB notice (5 U.S.C. § 552a(e), (r)); that the “need‑to‑know” exception does not support unfettered access untethered to specific duties; that the policy is arbitrary and capricious for failure to consider privacy risks; and that § 6103 prohibits disclosure of return information absent strict statutory authorization. Briefing concluded May 23, 2025; a joint appendix was filed June 2, 2025. No final decision on the merits has issued.\n\nRelated matters. The Court noted other federal cases addressing DOGE‑related access. In New York v. Trump, 2025 WL 573771 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 21, 2025), the court preliminarily enjoined Treasury from granting DOGE access to payment systems containing PII/confidential financial information. Other courts denied TROs or preliminary relief in different contexts (e.g., EPIC v. OPM (E.D. Va.), UCSA v. Carter (D.D.C.), and State of New Mexico v. Musk (D.D.C.)).\n\nJudge. The case is before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar‑Kotelly.\n\nCurrent status. Interim access limits were dissolved on March 7, 2025. The administrative record is on file, limited discovery has been completed under a protective order, and cross‑motions for summary judgment are fully briefed and pending decision.",
    "46563": "Filed May 2, 2025 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, this case is brought by a growing coalition of local governments and public authorities (counties, cities, housing and transportation agencies) challenging new federal grant conditions the Trump Administration directed agencies to impose after January–April 2025 executive orders. The plaintiffs initially included King County (WA), Pierce County (WA), Snohomish County (WA), San Francisco (CA), Santa Clara County (CA), Boston (MA), Columbus (OH), and New York City (NYC); subsequent amendments added many more local governments and agencies, including transit and airport authorities. They are represented by local government counsel, the Public Rights Project, and private counsel (Pacifica Law Group LLP). The defendants are HUD; DOT and, as the case expanded, its operating administrations FTA, FHWA, FAA, and FRA; and the agencies’ leaders (including HUD Secretary Scott Turner and DOT Secretary Sean Duffy). Later amendments also added HHS and its Secretary.\n\nPlaintiffs challenge conditions newly attached to congressionally funded grants—including HUD’s Continuum of Care (CoC) grants under the McKinney‑Vento Homeless Assistance Act and DOT grants under multiple statutes (e.g., 49 U.S.C. §§ 5307, 5309, 5337, 5339; airport grants under 49 U.S.C. ch. 471; and programs funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act). The contested conditions flow from executive orders on “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit‑Based Opportunity” (anti‑DEI), immigration enforcement, “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism,” and “Enforcing the Hyde Amendment.” As implemented in HUD and DOT agreements, the conditions include: (1) a DEI certification paired with an admission that compliance with federal nondiscrimination laws is “material” under the False Claims Act; (2) a requirement to “comply with all executive orders”; (3) immigration cooperation mandates (e.g., cooperating with ICE) and, for HUD CoC grants, immigration eligibility verification using DHS’s SAVE system; (4) a prohibition on using funds to “promote gender ideology,” as defined in an executive order; and (5) a prohibition on using funds to “promote elective abortion.” Plaintiffs allege these conditions are unauthorized by statute, unrelated to the grants’ purposes, vague, and coercive.\n\nPlaintiffs bring claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706) and the Constitution, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and fees. They allege violations of separation of powers (Executive usurping Congress’s spending power), the Spending Clause (lack of clear notice and germaneness; coercion), the Tenth Amendment (commandeering state/local officials for federal immigration enforcement), Fifth Amendment due process (vagueness), and APA defects (arbitrary and capricious; contrary to law and constitution; in excess of statutory authority; failure to follow required procedures including HUD’s and DOT’s own rulemaking requirements).\n\nJudge Barbara J. Rothstein granted emergency relief twice. On May 7, 2025, the Court issued a TRO enjoining HUD, DOT, and FTA from imposing or enforcing the challenged CoC and FTA conditions, from withholding or delaying funds based on those conditions, and from requiring certifications tied to them. On May 23, 2025, the Court entered a second TRO extending materially identical relief to additional plaintiffs and to DOT’s other operating administrations (FHWA, FAA, FRA). After briefing and hearings, the Court granted preliminary injunctions on June 3, 2025, and again on August 12, 2025 (the latter addressing additional parties and agencies added by amendment). The June 3 order held the APA’s sovereign-immunity waiver applied; rejected defendants’ Tucker Act argument; found the challenged agency actions reviewable (not “committed to agency discretion”); and concluded plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their APA claims. Specifically, the Court found the new conditions are likely contrary to constitutional separation-of-powers limits and in excess of statutory authority (because Congress did not authorize these conditions in the CoC or transportation statutes) and arbitrary and capricious (no reasoned explanation, reliance on executive orders untethered to statutory mandates). The Court did not need to resolve all constitutional claims to issue the injunction. It also found irreparable harm (including budgetary disruption and loss of critical homelessness, transit, and safety projects) and that the equities and public interest favored maintaining the status quo. The injunctions bar agencies from imposing or enforcing the conditions (or materially similar ones) against plaintiffs and their subrecipients, from withholding or delaying funds based on those conditions, and from requiring related certifications; agencies must treat any actions taken to implement the conditions as null and void and not retroactively apply them. The Court later required agency notice and status reports on compliance. Defendants noticed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit on June 9, 2025.\n\nProcedurally, the case has expanded through amended complaints adding more plaintiffs and defendants (including FHWA, FAA, FRA, and later HHS), and a third preliminary injunction was granted on August 12, 2025. The matter remains pending in the district court with the preliminary injunction in effect “pending further orders,” while the June injunction is on appeal.\n\nFactual context: Plaintiffs allege Congress appropriated funds for homelessness and transportation under detailed program statutes and NOFOs that did not include the new policy conditions; after executive orders issued in early 2025, HUD and DOT inserted the conditions into grant agreements and program templates (including FTA’s Master Agreement and FAA grant assurances), threatening loss of crucial funding unless grantees agreed. Plaintiffs contend the conditions bear little or no relation to the grants’ purposes, force local governments into controversial federal policy positions (including anti‑DEI and immigration enforcement roles), and expose them to heightened False Claims Act risk, all without statutory authorization or required rulemaking. Judge Rothstein’s injunctions preserve existing funding flows while the legality of those conditions is adjudicated.",
    "46484": "On April 23, 2025, a national bar association filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice and two senior Department officials in their official capacities. The suit challenges the Department’s abrupt termination of multiple Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) grants that supported the association’s Commission on Domestic & Sexual Violence. The association is represented by a public‑interest nonprofit litigation organization; the government is represented by Department of Justice counsel. This is not a class action.\n\nThe case arises from events in early April 2025. On April 9, the Deputy Attorney General circulated a memorandum barring Department lawyers from participating in association‑sponsored events on official time, expressly citing the association’s recent participation in litigation against the federal government and its advocacy positions. The next day, the Department terminated all of the association’s OVW cooperative agreements “effective immediately,” invoking 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a) and asserting only that the awards no longer effectuated agency priorities. According to the record, there were five active OVW awards totaling approximately $3.2 million; the Department identified an unobligated balance of about $2.05 million. The association alleges it had no performance deficiencies, that comparable OVW awards to other organizations remained in place, and that two already‑ended awards were purportedly “terminated” as well.\n\nThe association’s complaint pleads multiple constitutional and statutory claims and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief: (1) First Amendment retaliation; (2) First Amendment viewpoint discrimination; (3) unconstitutional conditions (First Amendment/Spending Clause); (4) Fifth Amendment equal protection; (5) Fifth Amendment procedural due process; and (6) Administrative Procedure Act violations. The association promptly moved for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to: (a) bar enforcement of the terminations (including closeout steps); (b) prevent re‑obligation of the affected funds; and (c) require continued, customary disbursement of funds on the awards.\n\nThe motion was set on an expedited schedule. The government represented it would not re‑obligate the funds before June 2, 2025, and then moved to dismiss, arguing principally that the dispute belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act because it concerns federal cooperative agreements. After a May 12, 2025 hearing, Judge Christopher R. Cooper issued a memorandum opinion and order on May 14, 2025 granting a preliminary injunction on the First Amendment retaliation claim and denying the government’s jurisdictional objection as to that claim.\n\nIn his opinion, Judge Cooper held that the court had jurisdiction because the retaliation claim arises from the First Amendment, not from the grant contracts, and seeks specific equitable relief rather than money damages; sovereign immunity is not a bar to constitutional claims for injunctive relief under the Larson‑Dugan line of cases. On the merits, the court found the association likely to succeed on its retaliation claim: filing suit and engaging in advocacy are protected activities; grant termination is an adverse action; the temporal proximity to the Deputy Attorney General’s memo and the absence of performance failings, combined with the continued funding of similar OVW activities through other grantees, supported an inference of retaliatory motive. The court also found irreparable harm, both because loss of First Amendment freedoms constitutes irreparable injury and because the termination threatened the viability of the association’s domestic‑violence grant operations. The balance of equities and public interest favored relief because preventing likely constitutional violations serves the public interest.\n\nAs a remedy, the court enjoined the Department from enforcing the terminations and from taking steps that would give them effect, and required the Department to continue administering and disbursing funds on the association’s active OVW awards in the ordinary course. The court did not require reinstatement of two awards that had already expired by their terms and made clear the Department remains free to terminate or modify awards for permissible, non‑retaliatory reasons.\n\nKey filings and proceedings include: the complaint (April 23, 2025); the TRO/PI motion (April 24, 2025); a status conference and briefing schedule; the government’s motion to dismiss (May 2, 2025); the motion hearing (May 12, 2025); and the preliminary injunction order and memorandum opinion (May 14, 2025). The court’s memorandum opinion is at ECF No. 28. No trial has occurred, and no appeal is noted in the record. On July 17, 2025, after a joint status report, the court administratively closed the case and struck the pending motion to dismiss, directing the parties to file a further status report by October 1, 2027, or earlier if developments warrant. The preliminary injunction remains in effect pending further order.",
    "46279": "Filed March 23, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, this certified class action challenges the Department of Homeland Security’s policy and practice of removing noncitizens with final removal orders to “third countries” (countries not designated on the removal order) without prior meaningful notice and an opportunity to seek protection from persecution or torture. The plaintiffs—noncitizens with final orders (including individuals granted withholding of removal or CAT protection against removal to the country designated in their orders)—sue the Department of Homeland Security, its Secretary, the U.S. Attorney General, and the superintendent of a Massachusetts immigration detention facility. Plaintiffs are represented by nonprofit public‑interest counsel (National Immigration Litigation Alliance, Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, and Human Rights First).\n\nThe complaint pleads the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706(1), (2)(A), (C), (D)), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 implementing the Convention Against Torture (FARRA), the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, and a FOIA proactive‑disclosure claim (5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)). Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring DHS to provide written notice and a meaningful opportunity to present withholding/CAT claims to an immigration judge before third‑country removals, to set aside DHS’s challenged policies (including a February 18, 2025 redetention directive), to return class members who were removed without these protections, and to award fees.\n\nThe factual core alleges DHS has no operative process to ensure notice and a pre‑removal hearing when it seeks to remove an individual to a third country. On February 18, 2025, DHS directed officers to re‑detain previously released individuals for potential third‑country removals. On March 30, 2025, DHS issued “Guidance Regarding Third Country Removals” allowing removal without any process where the United States has blanket diplomatic assurances from the receiving country, and otherwise providing only notice and rapid (often 24‑hour) screening if, without prompting, an individual affirmatively voices fear. Plaintiffs assert this violates statutory, regulatory, treaty, and due‑process requirements for individualized adjudication and meaningful notice/opportunity to be heard.\n\nThe named plaintiffs exemplify the allegations. A Cuban man (final order to Cuba) faced imminent re‑detention and third‑country removal; a Honduran woman with 2021 withholding to Honduras was told she was on a deportation list; an Ecuadorean man granted CAT protection in 2018 was re‑detained; and a Guatemalan man granted withholding to Guatemala in February 2025 was quickly deported by DHS to Mexico without notice or a chance to raise fear; Mexico then removed him to Guatemala, where he remains in hiding.\n\nJudge Brian E. Murphy granted a TRO on March 28, 2025, enjoining third‑country removals without written notice and a meaningful opportunity to seek CAT protection. On April 18, 2025, the court certified a class of individuals with final orders who DHS has removed or will remove on or after February 18, 2025, to a country not designated or identified in writing in their prior proceedings. The court also issued a preliminary injunction requiring, before any third‑country removal: (1) written notice to the individual (and counsel, if any) in a language the person understands; (2) a meaningful opportunity to present a CAT claim; (3) if “reasonable fear” is shown, DHS must move to reopen immigration proceedings so an immigration judge can adjudicate the claim; and (4) if no reasonable fear is found, a minimum of 15 days to seek reopening. On April 30, 2025, the court amended the injunction to prevent DHS from ceding custody or control to avoid compliance (e.g., via Department of Defense removal from Guantánamo).\n\nOn May 20, 2025, DHS began removing eight class members to South Sudan with fewer than 24 hours’ notice. Following emergency hearings, on May 21 the court found DHS violated the injunction, clarified that “meaningful opportunity” requires a minimum of 10 days after notice, and ordered remedial relief: DHS must provide private reasonable‑fear interviews, with 72 hours’ notice, counsel access (in‑person or remote) and interpreters, and post‑interview procedures (including a 15‑day period to seek reopening after a negative screening), either in the United States or abroad so long as DHS retains custody/control and ensures access equivalent to that provided in the U.S. The court denied DHS’s motions for reconsideration and stay on May 26, 2025.\n\nSeparately, on May 23, 2025, the court ordered DHS to facilitate the immediate return to the United States of the named plaintiff who was removed to Mexico without notice after winning withholding to Guatemala, following DHS’s later admission that it could not identify any officer who had asked him about fear of Mexico as previously represented.\n\nAppellate proceedings followed. The First Circuit denied DHS’s request for a stay of the preliminary injunction (Order of Court, May 16, 2025). On June 23, 2025, the Supreme Court stayed the district court’s preliminary injunction pending appeal and any petition for certiorari (DHS v. D.V.D., 145 S. Ct. 2153), while the district court noted its May 21 remedial order for the eight individuals remained in effect. Additional appeals remain pending in the First Circuit. DHS has moved in the district court to stay proceedings pending appeal; plaintiffs have moved for an indicative ruling to dissolve the stayed preliminary injunction and for partial summary judgment on their APA, due‑process, and declaratory claims.\n\nIn sum, the district court (Judge Murphy) certified the class, granted preliminary relief requiring written notice and a meaningful pre‑removal opportunity to present fear‑based protection claims before third‑country removals, clarified and enforced that relief after attempted removals with less than a day’s notice, and ordered the return of one named plaintiff wrongfully removed without those protections. The preliminary injunction is currently stayed by the Supreme Court pending further appellate proceedings; the district court’s remedial order for the eight individuals removed toward South Sudan remains operative.",
    "46186": "Filed on February 28, 2025, this class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts challenges a series of federal executive actions that (1) terminated humanitarian parole programs and (2) halted adjudication of immigration benefits for parolees. The plaintiffs are individual parole beneficiaries (or would-be beneficiaries), U.S.-based sponsors (including military families), and Haitian Bridge Alliance. They sue the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Directors of ICE and USCIS, the Acting Commissioner of CBP, and the President, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel (Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP) and nonprofit legal organizations (Justice Action Center, Human Rights First).\n\nThe case centers on immigration parole authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5). Plaintiffs contend that, on Inauguration Day (January 20, 2025), the President issued Executive Orders directing DHS to terminate “categorical parole programs” (including the parole processes for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (collectively CHNV)), limit parole to case-by-case decisions, and re-establish rigorous vetting. Acting DHS Secretary Huffman then issued a memorandum authorizing pausing/terminating categorical parole programs; Acting CBP Commissioner Flores limited CBP parole authority; and Acting USCIS Director Higgins directed staff to cease decisions on parole, re‑parole, and other benefit applications for beneficiaries of programs such as Uniting for Ukraine (U4U), CHNV, Operation Allies Welcome (OAW), Family Reunification Parole (FRP), and Central American Minors (CAM). On February 14, 2025, Acting USCIS Deputy Director Davidson ordered an “administrative hold” on adjudicating immigration benefits (e.g., asylum, TPS, adjustment) for U4U, CHNV, and FRP parolees based on potential vetting deficiencies. On March 25, 2025, DHS published a Federal Register Notice terminating the CHNV parole processes and providing that all unexpired CHNV paroles and associated employment authorization would end April 24, 2025, absent individualized contrary determinations.\n\nPlaintiffs assert that these actions are contrary to the INA and the APA (5 U.S.C. §§ 701‑706) because they misinterpret the parole statute, impose categorical decisions where case‑by‑case determinations are required, and arbitrarily suspend adjudications. They also invoke the Accardi doctrine and allege Fifth Amendment Due Process violations. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including vacatur of the Huffman, Higgins, and Davidson directives and the March 25, 2025 CHNV termination notice, restoration of adjudications, and attorneys’ fees.\n\nJudge Indira Talwani presides. On April 14, 2025, the court preliminarily stayed the March 25 CHNV notice insofar as it revoked existing CHNV grants of parole and work authorization without case‑by‑case review, and certified a class of individuals whose CHNV parole grants were being truncated. The government appealed. The First Circuit denied a stay pending appeal on May 5, 2025, but on May 30, 2025, the Supreme Court stayed the district court’s April 14 order pending appeal and any petition for certiorari, allowing DHS’s mass truncation of CHNV parole to go forward (over a dissent).\n\nIn parallel, on May 28, 2025, the district court granted partial preliminary relief on plaintiffs’ broader motion, staying: (1) the January 23 Higgins directive to the extent it suspended adjudications of re‑parole and other non‑parole benefits for parolees under the identified programs; (2) any DHS actions suspending initial parole/re‑parole and related benefits under Military Parole in Place (MPIP); and (3) the February 14 Davidson memorandum to the extent it suspended adjudications of immigration benefit applications for U4U, FRP, and CHNV parolees and required case‑by‑case lifting of the hold even in the face of classwide court orders. The court simultaneously expanded class certification to cover (a) parolees with pending re‑parole applications under programs providing re‑parole, (b) parolees with pending applications for other immigration benefits, and (c) MPIP supporters with pending applications. The court then issued compliance orders requiring DHS/USCIS to resume adjudications, update system “holds,” contact‑center scripts, and public messaging, and to report on implementation. USCIS issued the June 9 “Alfonso‑Royals” memo authorizing resumption of adjudications, and reported lifting system holds by June 19, 2025, with adjudicator guidance to follow; the court continues to monitor compliance, including issues raised by plaintiffs about lingering “administrative hold” messaging and diversity‑visa processing for class members.\n\nDefendants moved to dismiss on May 30, 2025, arguing lack of standing, jurisdictional bars under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B), nonfinal/nonreviewable agency action under the APA, and failure to state an APA or due process claim. Plaintiffs opposed on June 13, 2025. Plaintiffs also moved for partial summary judgment on June 16, 2025, seeking to vacate DHS’s mass truncation of CHNV parole; defendants opposed on July 7, 2025, and an amicus (Immigration Reform Law Institute) filed in opposition. Defendants have appealed the May 28, 2025 preliminary injunction and amended class certification orders (First Circuit No. 25‑1715). On August 1, 2025, the district court denied the remaining portion of plaintiffs’ earlier PI motion addressing suspensions of initial parole adjudications for persons outside the U.S.\n\nThroughout the case, plaintiffs have proceeded under pseudonyms by court order, and several state and organizational amici have participated. No settlement has been reached. The court retains jurisdiction to enforce its preliminary orders and to adjudicate defendants’ motion to dismiss and plaintiffs’ partial summary judgment motion.",
    "46180": "On February 25, 2025, three national and state membership organizations of educators and scholars—the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the American Sociological Association (ASA), and AFT‑Maryland—filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against the U.S. Department of Education, the Secretary of Education (initially Acting Secretary Denise L. Carter; later Linda McMahon), and the Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, Craig Trainor. On March 5, 2025, they amended the complaint to add Oregon’s Eugene School District 4J. Plaintiffs are represented by the Democracy Forward Foundation (a private public‑interest nonprofit); Defendants by the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The suit challenges DOE’s February 14, 2025 Dear Colleague Letter, associated FAQs, and the Department’s April 3, 2025 demand that state and local education agencies certify compliance with DOE’s interpretation of Title VI and Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (SFFA). Plaintiffs assert Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claims (5 U.S.C. § 706), and constitutional claims under the First Amendment (free speech and association) and the Fifth Amendment (void‑for‑vagueness), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and a stay under APA § 705.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that DOE’s Letter misstates and greatly expands Title VI and SFFA by, among other things, characterizing as unlawful “DEI” programs; discouraging or proscribing classroom speech about “systemic and structural racism” or teaching that some racial groups bear “unique moral burdens”; warning against “relying on proxies for race” (e.g., dropping standardized tests to increase diversity); and threatening loss of federal funds. DOE simultaneously opened an “End DEI” reporting portal (Feb. 27) and issued FAQs (Feb. 28), and on April 3 directed state education chiefs to obtain and submit certifications—by April 24—acknowledging that compliance with DOE’s understanding (including that “certain DEI practices” and “illegal DEI” can violate federal law) is a material condition of federal funding, warning of funding termination, claw‑back, and possible False Claims Act liability. Plaintiffs alleged these actions were legislative rules issued without notice and comment, arbitrary and capricious, exceeded DOE’s statutory authority (including 20 U.S.C. § 3403’s prohibition on federal control of curriculum), and were unconstitutionally vague and viewpoint/content‑based.\n\nAfter a venue show‑cause (venue was held proper in Maryland), Plaintiffs moved for preliminary injunctions against the Letter and the Certification. Following an April 18, 2025 hearing, the Court (Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher) granted the Letter motion in part, staying the Letter under 5 U.S.C. § 705, and denied the Certification motion because certification‑related facts and claims had not yet been pled. Mem. Op., ECF 60 (Apr. 24, 2025). The Court found the Letter likely a final, legislative rule issued without notice and comment; likely arbitrary and capricious; likely beyond DOE’s statutory authority (because it effectively regulated curriculum and classroom speech); and likely contrary to the First Amendment where it targeted content and viewpoint (e.g., teaching on “structural racism”). The Court did not enjoin the FAQs or remove the portal but noted DOE could continue enforcing Title VI consistent with law.\n\nPlaintiffs then filed a Second Amended Complaint adding Certification‑specific claims. On cross‑motions for summary judgment, the Court again found standing (for District 4J directly and for the associations via their members) and concluded both the Letter and the Certification were reviewable final agency actions and legislative rules. The Court held that neither action complied with the APA’s procedural requirements; the Certification also violated the Paperwork Reduction Act. Substantively, both were arbitrary and capricious (for failing to acknowledge or explain major departures from prior policy, to rely on evidence, to account for existing federal and state standards and baseline conditions, and to consider reliance interests). The Court further held the Letter contrary to law (DOE may not control curriculum under 20 U.S.C. § 3403 and related statutes) and contrary to constitutional rights (First Amendment: content‑ and viewpoint‑based proscriptions of certain classroom speech; Fifth Amendment: vagueness). As to the Certification, the Court held it unconstitutionally vague (undefined “illegal DEI,” “certain DEI practices,” and “advantaging” one race), but granted judgment for the government on Plaintiffs’ separate First Amendment claim against the Certification. Mem. Op., ECF 83 (Aug. 14, 2025).\n\nRemedies: On April 24, 2025, the Letter was stayed under APA § 705 pending final resolution. On August 14, 2025, the Court granted summary judgment for Plaintiffs on Counts One (First Amendment as to the Letter), Two (Fifth Amendment vagueness as to the Letter), Three (APA as to the Letter), Five (Fifth Amendment vagueness as to the Certification), and Six (APA as to the Certification), granted summary judgment for the government on Count Four (First Amendment as to the Certification), and vacated both the February 14, 2025 Letter and the April 3, 2025 “Reminder of Legal Obligations… and Request for Certification” under 5 U.S.C. § 706. Order of Judgment, ECF 84 (Aug. 14, 2025). No trial occurred, and no appeal is noted on the docket.\n\nJudge: U.S. District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher (D. Md.). Reported decisions: Mem. Op., ECF 60 (Apr. 24, 2025); Mem. Op., ECF 83 (Aug. 14, 2025). Related litigation (not consolidated): Nat’l Educ. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Educ., No. 25‑91 (D.N.H.)

    "46119": "Filed on February 13, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, this case challenges the creation and actions of the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) established by executive order on January 20, 2025, and the role of Elon Musk as an unpaid special government employee. The plaintiffs—originally 26 current and former personnel of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), later narrowed and re‑pleaded as six pseudonymous representatives—allege that, beginning in late January 2025, DOGE personnel directed by Musk rapidly assumed control over USAID’s systems and operations, closed USAID’s headquarters and disabled its website, placed large numbers of USAID employees on administrative leave, terminated or attempted to terminate thousands of grants and contracts, and initiated a reduction-in-force to wind down the agency. The plaintiffs claim DOGE members without proper clearances accessed sensitive systems and data, and that these actions disrupted legally mandated programs and jeopardized safety and security of USAID personnel and beneficiaries. They seek only declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe suit began against Elon Musk in his official capacity, the U.S. DOGE Service, and the Department of Government Efficiency. On April 17, 2025, plaintiffs amended to add USAID, the Department of State, the President, the Secretary of State (acting as USAID Administrator), and senior USAID officials linked to the alleged actions (Peter Marocco, Jeremy Lewin, Kenneth Jackson) and Amy Gleason (Acting USDS Administrator). Plaintiffs’ counsel includes the State Democracy Defenders Fund (public‑interest) and private firms Marziani, Stevens & Gonzalez PLLC and Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP. The case is before Judge Theodore D. Chuang.\n\nPlaintiffs bring two constitutional claims: (1) violation of the Appointments Clause, alleging Musk exercised “significant authority” as the de facto DOGE leader without Senate confirmation or lawful statutory vesting; and (2) violation of the separation of powers, alleging that defendants’ actions to dismantle or abolish USAID—an agency established by law and funded by Congress—contravene Congress’s exclusive authority to create, fund, and abolish agencies. They seek declaratory judgments and injunctions to set aside actions taken at USAID by Musk and DOGE, to bar further dismantling of USAID absent congressional authorization, and to prohibit Musk and DOGE from further actions at USAID.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, after expedited briefing and a hearing, Judge Chuang granted a preliminary injunction in part. The court found plaintiffs likely to succeed on both claims as to key actions: the court concluded Musk appeared to have made the decisions to permanently close USAID headquarters and take down USAID’s website without approval by a duly appointed USAID officer, and that the broader effort to “effectively eliminate” USAID was incompatible with Congress’s establishment and ongoing appropriations for the agency. The injunction (1) barred defendants from disclosing plaintiffs’ sensitive information; (2) required restoration of USAID employees’ and PSCs’ access to email, payment, and security systems; (3) enjoined defendants from implementing terminations, stop‑work orders, or other shutdown measures at USAID; and (4) prohibited further actions relating to USAID absent authorization by a USAID official with legal authority. The court later denied defendants’ request to carve out Jeremy Lewin (then delegated duties as USAID’s Deputy Administrator/COO), holding the order applied to DOGE‑affiliated personnel to prevent circumvention.\n\nDefendants noticed an interlocutory appeal. On March 28, 2025, a Fourth Circuit panel (Judges Quattlebaum, Niemeyer, and Gregory) stayed the preliminary injunction pending appeal, concluding defendants made a strong showing of likely success and emphasizing, among other things, that many actions were taken or ratified by USAID officials and that plaintiffs had not sued the proper agency defendants at the time of the injunction. On June 9, 2025, the Fourth Circuit held the appeal in abeyance to allow the district court to resolve a pending motion to dismiss or enter any subsequent appealable order.\n\nMeanwhile, on May 1, 2025, defendants moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, arguing, among other things, that current and former USAID employees and personal services contractors must pursue personnel and contract disputes through the Civil Service Reform Act or Contract Disputes Act, and that plaintiffs lacked standing. Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Class Action Complaint on May 30, 2025, clarifying which named plaintiffs were USAID employees and which were PSCs and maintaining the two constitutional claims with USAID, State, the President, Secretary Rubio, Marocco, Lewin, Jackson, and Gleason added as defendants. On August 13, 2025, Judge Chuang granted the motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part (details not provided in the docket beyond the mixed disposition) and ordered the remaining defendants to answer, which they did on August 27, 2025.\n\nPlaintiffs moved for class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) on May 1, 2025, proposing a class of all USAID employees and personal services contractors during the class period. On August 18, 2025, the court granted the motion in part and denied it in part (again, details are not in the provided record). The case remains in the district court on the constitutional claims, with a partial injunctive relief framework initially issued by the district court but stayed by the Fourth Circuit; no trial has occurred, and there is no settlement.\n\nThe factual allegations underlying the claims include that DOGE teams—often including personnel with prior ties to Musk—were embedded across agencies; that on January 27, 2025 they began demanding and receiving administrator‑level access to USAID systems; that Musk and DOGE orchestrated the closure of USAID headquarters, took down the agency website, blocked staff access to systems, and removed signage; that large numbers of employees and contractors were placed on administrative leave or issued RIF or termination notices; and that mass terminations of grants and contracts were directed. Plaintiffs assert that DOGE members without appropriate clearances accessed restricted areas and systems and that these actions impeded statutory reporting and operations and risked safety and program continuity worldwide. Plaintiffs allege injuries in the form of unauthorized access or disclosure of personal data, interruptions to employment (including loss of system access and communications), reputational harm from public statements by Musk and the President labeling USAID corrupt or criminal, and dignitary harms. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief restoring lawful governance over USAID consistent with constitutional constraints.\n\nJudge: The Honorable Theodore D. Chuang, U.S. District Judge, District of Maryland.  \nAppellate proceedings: Fourth Circuit No. 25‑1273; preliminary injunction stayed on March 28, 2025; appeal held in abeyance on June 9, 2025 pending district court rulings.  \nRelated matters noted by the parties and the court include American Foreign Service Association v. Trump (D.D.C.) and AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coalition v. U.S. Department of State (D.D.C.), which addressed overlapping issues concerning USAID staffing and foreign assistance pauses. No settlement has been reported in this case.",
    "46099": "On February 10, 2025, two U.S. non‑profits—the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) and Journalism Development Network (JDN)—sued the U.S. Department of State, USAID, OMB, the Secretary of State (also acting as USAID Administrator), the OMB Director, and the President in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. (First Amended Complaint filed May 2, 2025, added the Center for Victims of Torture.) The case challenges a January 20, 2025 Executive Order (No. 14169) directing an immediate “pause” in foreign development assistance and a January 24, 2025 State Department memorandum instructing an immediate suspension and issuance of stop‑work orders for existing foreign‑assistance awards. Plaintiffs, represented by Public Citizen Litigation Group (and, in the related Global Health Council case, by private counsel), alleged violations of the APA (5 U.S.C. § 706), the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), the Anti‑Deficiency Act, the Constitution’s separation of powers and Take Care Clause, and non‑statutory ultra vires principles. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the government to stop enforcing the across‑the‑board funding “pause,” to pay amounts due, to make appropriated funds available, and (as later amended) to set aside mass terminations of awards.\n\nJudge Amir H. Ali presides. On February 13, 2025, after a joint hearing with a related case (Global Health Council v. Trump, No. 25‑cv‑402), the court granted in part a temporary restraining order, finding plaintiffs likely to succeed on their APA claim that the blanket suspension pending “review” lacked a reasoned explanation and failed to consider massive reliance interests, and that plaintiffs faced irreparable harm (layoffs, shuttered programs, and threats to humanitarian services). The TRO enjoined enforcement of the State memorandum and other directives implementing EO 14169 “including by” suspending or preventing disbursements, or issuing/maintaining stop‑work orders and terminations, for awards in existence as of January 19, 2025. At the same time, to tailor relief, the court allowed the agencies to enforce individual award terms (including expirations, modifications, or terminations) and declined to enjoin the President or the Executive Order itself. See Aids Vaccine Advoc. Coal. v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 2025 WL 485324 (D.D.C. Feb. 13, 2025).\n\nWhen plaintiffs reported non‑compliance, the court issued enforcement orders on February 20 and 22, reiterating that defendants must cease any blanket suspension and “take all necessary steps” to honor existing awards, including disbursing funds due. See 2025 WL 569381 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2025); 2025 WL 577516 (D.D.C. Feb. 22, 2025). On February 25, after another hearing, the court ordered immediate payment by February 26, 11:59 p.m., of invoices and drawdowns for work completed before the TRO date. The government’s interlocutory appeal was dismissed the next day because the order enforced a non‑appealable TRO; mandamus was denied. See AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal. v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 2025 WL 621396 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 26, 2025). The Supreme Court briefly entered an administrative stay but then denied the application to vacate the enforcement order—vacating the administrative stay and instructing the district court to clarify obligations with due regard to feasibility. See Dep’t of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal., 604 U.S. __, 2025 WL 698083 (U.S. Mar. 5, 2025); see also 145 S. Ct. 753 (2025) (mem.).\n\nOn March 10, 2025, the court granted in part a preliminary injunction. It held plaintiffs likely to succeed on their APA claim that the initial directives implementing the blanket “pause” were arbitrary and capricious, and it enjoined the government from giving effect to suspensions/terminations or withholding payments for work completed before February 13 on awards in existence as of January 19. It declined, however, to enjoin the government’s subsequent, post‑TRO “individualized” termination decisions based on award terms (finding that later termination decisions constituted distinct agency action and, on the record, plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on those APA challenges at that time). Separately, the court held plaintiffs likely to succeed on their constitutional separation‑of‑powers claim that defendants had engaged in a unilateral rescission/deferral of appropriated foreign‑assistance funds in violation of Congress’s Article I spending authority and the ICA, and it ordered defendants to “make available for obligation the full amount of funds that Congress appropriated for foreign assistance programs” in the FY2024 appropriations. The court set a feasibility benchmark of approximately 300 payments per day, required weekly compliance reports, and emphasized that agencies remained free to conduct program reviews consistent with governing law. See AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal. v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 2025 WL 752378 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025).\n\nDefendants appealed the preliminary injunction. While the appeal was pending, they sought an indicative ruling on the injunction’s “impoundment” component based on the Supreme Court’s stay in Dep’t of Educ. v. California; the district court denied the motion on May 13, 2025, and vacated a limited administrative stay it had granted while considering that motion. The court continued to require weekly status updates and later granted, in part, plaintiffs’ motion to enforce the preliminary injunction on July 21, 2025.\n\nOn August 13, 2025, a D.C. Circuit panel vacated the portion of the preliminary injunction requiring the government to make appropriated funds available for obligation, holding that the grantees lacked a cause of action to enforce the alleged impoundment (relying on Dalton v. Specter and finding the ICA’s scheme precluded APA review), but it did not disturb the district court’s APA ruling on the initial funding freeze (which was not on appeal). Judge Pan dissented. A few days later, on August 20, 2025, the court of appeals entered an en banc order stating that “the preliminary injunction that requires the government to obligate the appropriated funds remains in effect” pending further en banc proceedings, and the district court reminded defendants they remained obligated to comply absent further appellate or district court order. Appeals thus remain pending.\n\nMeanwhile, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 2, 2025 (adding the Center for Victims of Torture), alleging that after the TRO the government mass‑terminated most awards (roughly 9,900 of about 13,100 in both agencies) based on cursory review and form letters, and asserting these later terminations are arbitrary and contrary to law (APA), in addition to renewing constitutional and ultra vires challenges. Defendants moved to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) in June 2025 (arguing, among other things, lack of subject‑matter jurisdiction, Tucker Act/CDA channeling of contract‑based disputes, and preclusion of APA review by the ICA); briefing on dismissal has been held in abeyance pending resolution of the preliminary‑injunction appeal. The district court continues to require periodic compliance reports and, as of late August 2025, set a status conference to monitor compliance with the injunction’s obligation requirement.\n\nKey reported rulings include: TRO, 2025 WL 485324; TRO enforcement orders, 2025 WL 569381 and 2025 WL 577516; preliminary injunction, 2025 WL 752378; D.C. Circuit dismissal of appeal from TRO enforcement, 2025 WL 621396; Supreme Court order denying application to vacate TRO enforcement, 2025 WL 698083; and the D.C. Circuit panel opinion vacating the impoundment portion of the preliminary injunction (Aug. 13, 2025), followed by an en banc order (Aug. 20, 2025) leaving that obligation requirement in place pending en banc review.\n\nFactual context: Plaintiffs averred—and the district court credited at the TRO/PI stages—that EO 14169 and the January 24 State memorandum caused an immediate, across‑the‑board suspension of foreign‑assistance disbursements and stop‑work orders, disrupting global health, humanitarian, and democracy‑assistance programs, prompting widespread layoffs and shutdowns, and jeopardizing vulnerable populations. The court concluded the initial blanket “pause” lacked a reasoned basis and disregarded reliance interests (APA), and that the later “impoundment” conduct likely infringed Congress’s power of the purse (separation of powers/ICA). The court tailored relief to prohibit the blanket freeze while permitting individualized, lawful award actions; it required payments for pre‑TRO work and continued monitoring to ensure compliance. Appeals are active; the panel’s vacatur of the impoundment portion is currently subject to en banc proceedings, and the district court’s injunction continues to govern pending further appellate action.",
    "46093": "Filed on February 10, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington (Seattle), this case challenges actions taken by the federal government on and after January 20, 2025, related to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). The plaintiffs are eight individual refugees or U.S.‑based family/sponsors, and three nonprofit organizations central to refugee resettlement—HIAS, Inc., Church World Service, Inc. (CWS), and Lutheran Community Services Northwest. They sue the President, the Secretary of State (Marco Rubio), the Secretary of Homeland Security (Kristi Noem), and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Dorothy A. Fink, later Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.) in their official capacities. Plaintiffs are represented by the International Refugee Assistance Project (legal services nonprofit) and Perkins Coie LLP (private counsel).\n\nThe suit challenges Executive Order 14163, “Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program,” issued January 20, 2025, which indefinitely suspended refugee entries under USRAP and suspended decisions on refugee applications pending future presidential determinations. Plaintiffs also challenge how agencies implemented the order: the State Department canceled refugee travel before the order’s effective date, suspended all case processing, and on January 24, 2025, issued stop‑work notices and halted USRAP funding to resettlement partners under a separate foreign aid review order (EO 14169). On February 26, 2025, the State Department terminated resettlement partners’ cooperative agreements for domestic reception and placement services and, for most, overseas processing support through Resettlement Support Centers. Plaintiffs allege these steps dismantled USRAP infrastructure, stranded refugees who had been approved and booked to travel, and cut off statutory post‑arrival services to new arrivals.\n\nThe complaint pleads violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act/Refugee Act (8 U.S.C. §§ 1157, 1522), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (arbitrary/capricious, contrary to law, failure to follow required procedures), the Accardi doctrine, separation‑of‑powers principles, and the Fifth Amendment due process rights of “follow‑to‑join” petitioners. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief and class certification.\n\nOn February 25, 2025, Judge Jamal N. Whitehead granted a preliminary injunction (written order issued February 28) enjoining enforcement of EO 14163’s suspension provisions and enjoining the suspension of refugee processing, decisions, admissions, and USRAP funding (including withholding of pre‑January 20 reimbursements). The court found plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits: the President’s order likely exceeded 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) because it effectively nullified Congress’s refugee scheme and lacked the required findings, and the agencies’ implementation and funding suspensions were likely arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. The court also found due process concerns for follow‑to‑join petitioners and issued a nationwide injunction. The government appealed (No. 25‑1313) and sought a stay. On March 25, 2025, the Ninth Circuit stayed the injunction in large part, but denied a stay as to individuals conditionally approved for refugee status before January 20, 2025. On April 21, 2025, the Ninth Circuit clarified that the carve‑out applied to those who, by January 20, had: (1) an approved refugee application authorizing conditional admission per 8 C.F.R. § 207.4; (2) USCIS travel clearance; and (3) arranged and confirmable travel plans. On May 9, 2025, the court further clarified the carve‑out should be applied narrowly, case‑by‑case, to individuals with strong reliance interests comparable to the lead plaintiff.\n\nMeanwhile, the district court allowed a supplemental complaint addressing the February 26 terminations and, on March 24, 2025, issued a second preliminary injunction enjoining the State Department’s termination of USRAP cooperative agreements and ordering reinstatement. The court held APA jurisdiction, found the terminations likely contrary to the Refugee Act’s resettlement scheme (8 U.S.C. § 1522) and arbitrary and capricious, and denied the government’s request for a bond. The government appealed (No. 25‑1939). The district court denied motions to stay either injunction.\n\nAs implementation issues arose, the district court issued compliance orders. Initially (May 5), the court set detailed steps to resume processing for injunction‑protected refugees, but rescinded that framework (May 15) after the Ninth Circuit’s May 9 clarification requiring individualized reliance assessments. On July 14, 2025, the court entered an “Injunction Implementation Framework” appointing Magistrate Judge Michelle L. Peterson to manage case‑by‑case reliance determinations. The court defined “Review‑Eligible Cases” (those meeting the Ninth Circuit’s three criteria, including certain pre‑January 20 travel cancellations after December 1, 2024) and “Injunction‑Protected Refugees” (those with Pacito‑comparable reliance interests). The framework created a rebuttable presumption of sufficient reliance for: (1) approximately 160 refugees with travel within two weeks of January 20, 2025; (2) unaccompanied minor children; and (3) certain Afghan refugees processed via Camp As Sayliyah. It directed the government to identify Review‑Eligible Cases, notify applicants, facilitate standardized reliance surveys via RSCs, conduct initial decisions, and litigate disputed cases before Judge Peterson, whose reports and recommendations would be subject to objection and final ruling by Judge Whitehead. Addressing a June 4, 2025 presidential proclamation restricting certain nationals’ entry, the court held it did not apply to refugees due to an explicit carve‑out and directed processing for affected injunction‑protected refugees.\n\nClass certification was granted on July 30, 2025, under Rule 23(b)(2) for three subclasses: (1) Refugee and Family Member Subclass (represented by Pacito, Sara, Alyas, Marcos, Josephine, and Ahmed); (2) Reception & Placement Subclass (represented by Ali); and (3) Follow‑to‑Join Petitioner Subclass (represented by Esther). IRAP and Perkins Coie were appointed class counsel. On the same date, the court denied the government’s motion to dismiss, rejecting jurisdictional and merits challenges.\n\nThroughout, the Ninth Circuit issued stay and clarification orders narrowing the district court’s injunction to a case‑by‑case carve‑out, later issuing an administrative stay on July 19, 2025, pending resolution of an emergency motion concerning the implementation framework. The litigation remains ongoing on appeal (Nos. 25‑1313 and 25‑1939) and in the district court under the implementation framework, with the preliminary injunctions in force as narrowed by the Ninth Circuit. Judge Jamal N. Whitehead presides in the district court; Magistrate Judge Michelle L. Peterson oversees reliance determinations under the framework; and Judges Silverman, Bade, and De Alba comprise the Ninth Circuit panel.",
    "46065": "On February 7, 2025, the States of Washington, Minnesota, and Oregon, together with three University of Washington pediatric physicians, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington (Seattle) to challenge President Trump’s January 28, 2025 Executive Order 14,187, “Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” and, later by amendment, the January 20, 2025 Executive Order 14,168, “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” Colorado joined as a plaintiff on February 19, 2025. Plaintiffs are represented by their respective state Attorneys General; the physicians are represented by the Washington Attorney General. Defendants are the President (official capacity), the United States, and multiple federal departments and agency heads, including HHS, DOJ, and others.\n\nPlaintiffs bring constitutional claims under the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection component, the separation of powers, the Tenth Amendment, and (as to EO 14,168’s definitions of “sex,” “male,” and “female”) the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause (vagueness), invoking the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief. The challenged provisions are: (1) Section 4 of EO 14,187, which directs agency heads to “immediately” take steps to ensure institutions receiving federal research or education grants end gender‑affirming care for “children” (defined in that order as individuals under 19); (2) Section 8(a) of EO 14,187, which instructs the Attorney General to prioritize enforcement of 18 U.S.C. § 116 (female genital mutilation); and (3) Sections 3(e) and 3(g) of EO 14,168, which require agencies to end federal funding of “gender ideology” and ensure grant funds do not promote “gender ideology.”\n\nJudge Lauren King granted a temporary restraining order on February 14, 2025, enjoining enforcement or implementation of Section 4 of EO 14,187 within the plaintiff states and enjoining Section 8(a) to the extent it purported to redefine “female genital mutilation” under 18 U.S.C. § 116 as the order’s “chemical and surgical mutilation.” In a February 16 memorandum, the Court found Plaintiffs likely to succeed on separation‑of‑powers grounds (improperly conditioning congressionally appropriated grants), equal protection (sex and transgender‑status discrimination), and the Tenth Amendment (intruding on state regulation of medicine by attempting to expand § 116), and found standing based on threatened loss of funds, forced policy choices, and credible enforcement risks.\n\nAfter Plaintiffs amended the complaint to add Colorado, claims against EO 14,168’s funding instructions, and a vagueness claim, the Court held a preliminary‑injunction hearing on February 28, 2025. That day, the Court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ motion. The preliminary injunction (1) enjoined all Defendants (other than the President) from enforcing or implementing Section 4 of EO 14,187 within Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, and Colorado; and (2) enjoined enforcement of Sections 3(e) and 3(g) of EO 14,168 to condition or withhold federal funding based on the fact that a health‑care entity or professional provides gender‑affirming care within those four states. The Court denied preliminary relief as to Section 8(a) of EO 14,187 for lack of standing, finding no credible threat of prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 116 on the record presented.\n\nFollowing the injunction, Plaintiffs moved for contempt, citing NIH’s February 28 termination of a Seattle Children’s Hospital research grant related to transgender youth and HHS/CDC notices referencing the executive orders. On March 17, 2025, the Court denied contempt but granted expedited discovery limited to whether the NIH termination contravened the preliminary injunction, and ordered Defendants to correct an “unreasonable” interpretation of the injunction—clarifying that “gender‑affirming care” is not confined to the four treatments listed in EO 14,187 and that research may involve patient care. Defendants provided notice of compliance on March 20. On March 27, 2025, NIH reinstated the Seattle Children’s grant in full, and the Court later denied as moot Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further discovery.\n\nDefendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the Ninth Circuit (No. 25‑1922) from the preliminary‑injunction order (and the expedited‑discovery order) on March 21, 2025. On April 23, 2025, the District Court stayed further district‑court proceedings pending appeal, with important exceptions: the stay does not bar proceedings to enforce or clarify the preliminary injunction, motions to amend or seek additional preliminary relief (including on any new claims), or motions for relief from the stay. The Court noted similar limited‑stay terms entered in related litigation (PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, D. Md.) and observed that the issues on appeal are largely legal (ripeness, Article II authority, level of scrutiny), and that Supreme Court review in Skrmetti is expected to provide guidance.\n\nThroughout, the Court documented a concrete factual basis: the Executive Orders sought to cut off federal research and education grants to medical institutions providing gender‑affirming care; agencies issued rapid notices referencing the orders; a White House press release stated the orders were “already having [their] intended effect”; and some hospitals curtailed care pending legal developments. Plaintiffs presented evidence of immediate harms to research funding and patient care at institutions such as the University of Washington School of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Oregon State University, and Children’s Hospital Colorado, and described the medical‑community consensus that gender‑affirming care, when indicated, is the standard of care for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\n\nThere is no trial or settlement. The preliminary‑injunction order remains in place pending further order, and the case is on appeal to the Ninth Circuit.",
    "46028": "On February 4, 2025, two national membership organizations (PFLAG and GLMA) and several families and young adults under 19 filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland challenging two January 2025 Executive Orders: (1) Executive Order 14,168 (“Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”), which directs agencies to ensure federal funds are not used to “promote gender ideology,” and (2) Executive Order 14,187 (“Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation”), which directs agencies to “immediately” ensure institutions receiving federal research or education grants end gender‑affirming medical care for individuals under 19. Plaintiffs—transgender adolescents and 18‑year‑olds, their parents, and the two membership organizations—alleged that, after the Orders issued, federal health agencies sent notices and hospitals across the country abruptly halted gender‑affirming care for patients under 19, cancelling existing treatments and planned procedures. They sued the President (official capacity), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its leaders and sub‑agencies (including HRSA and NIH), and later, by amended complaint on February 11, 2025, added the National Science Foundation (NSF) and its Director.\n\nPlaintiffs are represented by civil-rights organizations and private counsel (ACLU; Lambda Legal; Jenner & Block; Hogan Lovells). The complaint (and amended complaint) assert: ultra vires separation‑of‑powers claims (usurpation of Congress’s spending power; violation of bicameralism and presentment); statutory conflicts (prohibiting sex‑based discrimination in federally funded health programs under ACA § 1557, 42 U.S.C. § 18116, and PHSA § 300w‑7; and, in the amended pleading, disability discrimination under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act as incorporated by § 1557); Fifth Amendment Equal Protection; substantive due process (parental decision‑making); and First Amendment viewpoint discrimination. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nJudge Brendan A. Hurson granted a temporary restraining order on February 13, 2025 (memorandum opinion issued February 14), enjoining HHS (and subagencies, including HRSA and NIH) and NSF from conditioning or withholding federal funding under EO 14,168 § 3(g) or EO 14,187 § 4 based on a grantee’s provision of gender‑affirming care to patients under 19. The Court found the case ripe and justiciable and held Plaintiffs were likely to succeed because the Orders imposed new funding conditions not authorized by Congress (violating separation of powers), conflicted with nondiscrimination statutes, and—under Fourth Circuit precedent—likely violated the Equal Protection Clause by discriminating based on sex/transgender status. The Court also found irreparable harm due to the shutdown of medically necessary care and issued a nationwide injunction to provide complete relief. The TRO was extended to March 5.\n\nOn March 4, 2025, after full briefing (including amicus participation), the Court entered a nationwide preliminary injunction on the same terms and ordered Defendants to notify covered components and release any disbursements paused due to the Executive Orders, without requiring a bond. The Court again concluded Plaintiffs showed a strong likelihood of success on separation of powers, statutory conflicts, and Equal Protection, as well as irreparable harm; and found the balance of equities and public interest favored relief.\n\nOn March 7, Plaintiffs moved to enforce the preliminary injunction after CMS, HRSA, and SAMHSA issued notices echoing the Executive Orders’ themes and stating they “may” review or adjust policies or grants; on March 28, the Court denied the enforcement motion without prejudice, holding those notices, as then framed, did not clearly violate the injunction’s specific commands (no actual conditioning, withholding, or termination) and did not yet amount to reinstating the enjoined directives “under a different name.” In April, Defendants notified the Court that CDC had, on January 31, 2025, briefly terminated 17 grants “in accordance with” EO 14,168 but reinstated them on February 11 with no de‑obligation of funds.\n\nDefendants noticed an interlocutory appeal of the preliminary injunction on March 21, 2025 (Fourth Circuit No. 25‑1279). On May 12, 2025, the Fourth Circuit placed the appeal in abeyance pending the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Skrmetti (No. 23‑477). In the district court, the parties jointly obtained a limited partial stay of responsive pleading and Rule 16 deadlines (April 9, 2025) pending the appeal, but the preliminary injunction remains in effect, and Plaintiffs retain the ability to seek further preliminary relief or enforcement if necessary.\n\nFactual background: Plaintiffs allege the two Executive Orders triggered immediate agency communications and led multiple federally funded institutions—including Children’s National (DC), VCU Health/Children’s Hospital of Richmond and UVA Health (VA), NYU Langone (NY), Boston Children’s (MA), Denver Health (CO), Children’s Hospital Colorado, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, and others—to halt gender‑affirming care for patients under 19, cancelling appointments, prescriptions, and surgeries for the adolescent and 18‑year‑old plaintiffs and PFLAG members. The Court credited these showings of harm and found a nationwide injunction necessary to prevent further coercive effects tied to federal funding.\n\nKey counsel: Plaintiffs are represented by the ACLU Foundation, Lambda Legal, and private firms Jenner & Block and Hogan Lovells. Defendants are represented by the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Division, Federal Programs Branch.\n\nCurrent status: A nationwide preliminary injunction enjoins HHS (including HRSA and NIH) and NSF from conditioning, withholding, or terminating federal funding under EO 14,168 § 3(g) and EO 14,187 § 4 based on a grantee’s provision of gender‑affirming care to patients under 19; the injunction remains in force while the interlocutory appeal is held in abeyance pending the Supreme Court’s resolution of U.S. v. Skrmetti. No settlement has been reached. The district court has partially stayed case‑management deadlines, but preserved Plaintiffs’ ability to seek additional preliminary relief or enforcement during the appeal.",
    "46306": "On March 26, 2025, eleven nonprofit legal service organizations that represent unaccompanied immigrant children filed this APA action in the Northern District of California against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), its Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), and the Department of the Interior (DOI). The organizations—based in California and across the country—alleged that the Government’s abrupt March 21, 2025 termination of contract line items for direct immigration representation of unaccompanied children violated the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), and ORR’s 2024 Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule, 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309, and was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to preserve funding and services.\n\nThe suit arises from a long-running federal program under which ORR funds legal services for unaccompanied children—children under 18 without lawful status and without a parent or legal guardian available in the United States—to ensure, “to the greatest extent practicable,” they have counsel in legal proceedings. For more than a decade, ORR funded such services through a prime contract with Acacia Center for Justice and subcontracts to providers like Plaintiffs. On March 21, 2025, DOI issued a “Notice of Partial Termination for the Government’s Convenience” of Contract No. 140D0422C0009, canceling the line items for direct representation, attorney recruitment/IJC fellows, and language tutoring (CLINs 2–4), while leaving only know-your-rights presentations and consultations (CLIN 1). Plaintiffs alleged that Congress has appropriated funds for TVPRA services—including direct representation—through September 2027 and that ORR’s Foundational Rule obligates ORR, subject to appropriations, to fund providers to deliver direct representation when pro bono counsel is not practicable.\n\nJudge Araceli Martínez-Olguín granted a temporary restraining order on April 1, 2025, enjoining Defendants from withdrawing ORR-provided services or funds as of March 20, 2025, particularly the provision of funds for direct legal representation, and precluding cutting off access to congressionally appropriated funding during the TRO. The court later extended the TRO to April 30, 2025. The Government moved to dissolve the TRO (arguing, inter alia, that the Tucker Act channeled the dispute to the Court of Federal Claims and that the Supreme Court’s April 4, 2025 decision in Department of Education v. California barred APA orders compelling payments), and also sought the judge’s recusal based on past employment at a plaintiff organization. The court denied recusal on April 17, 2025 and denied dissolution of the TRO on April 21, 2025.\n\nPlaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. After hearing on April 23, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction on April 29, 2025, preserving the status quo and prohibiting the Government from withdrawing the ORR funding and services for direct representation provided as of March 20, 2025. The court found Plaintiffs likely to succeed on their APA claims that the termination contravened the TVPRA’s mandate to “ensure, to the greatest extent practicable” that unaccompanied children have counsel, and the Foundational Rule’s requirement that ORR fund direct representation (subject to available appropriations) where pro bono representation is not practicable. The court also credited evidence of available appropriations for legal services through September 2027, and Plaintiffs’ declarations describing imminent layoffs, service cuts, and the risk that children would appear in immigration court without counsel.\n\nOn appeal, the Government’s challenge to the TRO was dismissed by the Ninth Circuit on April 18, 2025 for lack of jurisdiction; rehearing en banc was denied April 25, 2025, and the mandate issued May 5, 2025. The Government noticed an appeal of the preliminary injunction on April 30, 2025 and moved for a stay pending appeal. On May 14, 2025, the Ninth Circuit (Judge Koh, with Judge Callahan dissenting) denied the stay, holding the Government had not shown a likelihood of success on its arguments that the Tucker Act impliedly barred APA review or that the termination decision was committed to agency discretion by law, and had not demonstrated irreparable injury absent a stay.\n\nThroughout the case, amici curiae—including Former Immigration Judges and Former HHS Officials—supported Plaintiffs, addressing the importance of counsel for unaccompanied children and ORR’s historic provision of funded representation. The district court’s preliminary injunction remains in effect, enjoining Defendants from cutting off ORR funding and services for direct legal representation of unaccompanied children during the pendency of the litigation.",
    "46201": "On March 6, 2025, eight states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Wisconsin), represented by their Attorneys General, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Education, the Secretary of Education, and the former Acting Secretary (in their official capacities). The states challenge the Department’s abrupt mid‑February 2025 termination of virtually all previously awarded grants under two federal teacher pipeline programs—the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) Program (authorized by the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1022 et seq.) and the Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) Program (authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 6672). The states allege the Department sent standardized termination letters to grantees, asserting the awards no longer effectuated Department “priorities,” including concerns about alleged DEI‑related discrimination, but without program‑specific reasons or individualized analysis. The terminations followed a February 5, 2025 internal Department directive, issued amid new Executive Orders addressing “DEI,” directing staff to review grants for discriminatory practices and for consistency with Department policy objectives.\n\nThe complaint, brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to vacate and set aside the terminations, alleging they are arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, ultra vires, and inconsistent with notice‑and‑comment priority‑setting requirements in GEPA (20 U.S.C. § 1232(d)) and the Department’s regulations (34 C.F.R. § 75.105). The states also invoke the OMB Uniform Guidance—particularly 2 C.F.R. § 200.340—which permits termination for failure to effectuate program goals or agency priorities only if such conditions are “clearly and unambiguously” specified in the award terms and “to the extent authorized by law.” The states contend the TQP/SEED Grant Award Notifications did not authorize termination on new Department “priorities,” and that Congress itself embedded service to diverse and traditionally underserved students (and recruitment into hard‑to‑staff subjects) in the programs’ purposes. The amended complaint (filed June 2, 2025) adds Spending Clause and separation‑of‑powers claims and challenges the Department’s February 2025 “Eliminating Discrimination and Fraud in Department Grant Awards” directive, linking it to Executive Orders 14151, 14173, and 14190.\n\nJudge Myong J. Joun granted a temporary restraining order on March 10, 2025, requiring the Department to immediately restore the pre‑termination status quo for TQP/SEED awards within the plaintiff states, enjoining implementation or reinstatement of the terminations, and directing notice to grantees and staff. The order permitted individualized terminations consistent with Congress’s authorizations, the APA, applicable regulations, and grant terms. The TRO issued for 14 days and was later extended to April 7, 2025. The Department filed an emergency appeal.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, a First Circuit panel (Judges Gelpí, Kayatta, and Montecalvo) denied the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal. The panel—without deciding the merits—concluded the Department had not shown a likelihood of success on threshold arguments that the states’ claims belonged exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act or were committed to agency discretion, noting that federal regulations (including 2 C.F.R. § 200.340, adopted by 2 C.F.R. § 3474.1) cabin termination discretion and that plaintiffs sought equitable relief set by federal law rather than contract damages. The court also found the record at that stage did not show irreparable harm justifying a stay.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, the Supreme Court, in a per curiam opinion, stayed the district court’s order pending appeal, construing the TRO—extended and heavily contested—as an appealable preliminary injunction. The Court stated the government was likely to succeed in showing the district court lacked APA jurisdiction where the relief effectively compelled payment under federal grant contracts and the Tucker Act implies the APA’s sovereign‑immunity waiver does not extend to such claims. It also credited the government’s showing of potential irreparable harm if tens of millions could be drawn down and not readily recovered, and noted respondents could maintain programs or pursue appropriate monetary relief later. (The Chief Justice would have denied the application; separate dissents by Justices Kagan and Jackson (joined by Justice Sotomayor) disagreed.)\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s stay, the plaintiff states withdrew their pending preliminary injunction motion on April 8, 2025. The government then voluntarily dismissed its First Circuit appeal. The states filed a First Amended Complaint on June 2, 2025, expanding their APA and constitutional claims and describing the February actions as implementing the Department’s new directive and Executive Orders. As of June 30, 2025, the Department has moved to dismiss for lack of subject‑matter jurisdiction or, alternatively, to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (28 U.S.C. § 1631). That motion remains pending, and the case has been reassigned on the district court docket to Judge Angel Kelley (No. 1:25‑cv‑10548‑AK).\n\nThroughout, the states have emphasized the factual context of a nationwide teacher shortage and the role of multi‑year TQP/SEED awards in recruiting, training, and retaining teachers for hard‑to‑staff subjects and underserved districts. They cite reliance by programs in their jurisdictions—for example, UMass initiatives to license early childhood and bilingual special‑education teachers, CSU/UC programs addressing rural and special‑education needs, SUNY/CUNY residencies, Montclair State and The College of New Jersey residencies, Milwaukee Public Schools special‑education residencies through UW–Madison, and CU Denver’s rural teacher pipeline—many mid‑grant when the terminations issued.\n\nKey filings and rulings: Complaint (Mar. 6, 2025); TRO granted (Mar. 10, 2025); Department’s notice of appeal (Mar. 11, 2025); First Circuit order denying stay pending appeal (Mar. 21, 2025); Supreme Court stay of district court’s order (Apr. 4, 2025); plaintiffs’ withdrawal of preliminary‑injunction motion (Apr. 8, 2025); government’s voluntary dismissal of appeal; First Amended Complaint (June 2, 2025); motions to dismiss or transfer (May 12 and June 30, 2025). The district court’s TRO referenced Massachusetts v. National Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 702163 (D. Mass. Mar. 5, 2025), as persuasive on APA jurisdiction.\n\nRemedies sought are declaratory and injunctive relief vacating the Department’s February grant terminations and directive as applied, reinstating awards consistent with statutory authorizations, and barring re‑termination on unlawful grounds. No trial or settlement has occurred, and no monitor has been appointed. The litigation remains pending on threshold jurisdiction and venue/transfer questions following the Supreme Court’s stay.",
    "46057": "On February 6, 2025, several active-duty servicemembers who are transgender, a transgender man seeking to enlist, and a Washington‑based membership organization filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington challenging a new federal policy that excludes transgender people from military service. The suit names the United States, the Department of Defense and the military departments, and the Secretary of Defense and service secretaries in their official capacities. The individual plaintiffs include senior officers and senior enlisted personnel with lengthy, decorated careers in the Navy, Army, and Air Force; the organizational plaintiff, Gender Justice League, sues on behalf of its members. Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel (Perkins Coie LLP) together with civil‑rights organizations (Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation).\n\nThe action challenges Executive Order 14183, “Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness,” issued January 27, 2025, and the Department of Defense’s February 26, 2025 implementing memorandum and guidance (and subsequent March 21, 2025 guidance). The new policy declares that “expressing a false ‘gender identity’ divergent from an individual’s sex” is incompatible with military service, recognizes only “male” and “female” as immutable, and directs the Department to exclude from accessions and to separate servicemembers who have a current diagnosis or history of, or “exhibit symptoms consistent with,” gender dysphoria. The guidance also: (a) pauses and cancels transition‑related surgeries and prohibits funding for sex‑reassignment surgeries and newly initiated cross‑sex hormone therapy; (b) mandates pronoun and salutation use to reflect a servicemember’s birth sex; (c) limits access to berthing, bathroom, and shower facilities by sex; (d) provides only narrow, case‑by‑case waivers; and (e) directs identification of affected members and initiation of separation processes (beginning March 26, 2025), with members deemed non‑deployable, subject to “administrative absence,” and offered limited financial inducements for voluntary separation. Plaintiffs allege that, since 2016 and under the 2021 “Austin Policy,” transgender people have been permitted to serve openly, including through gender‑transition care, without adverse effects on readiness, cohesion, or costs.\n\nPlaintiffs assert constitutional claims under the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection and due process components and the First Amendment. They contend the policy facially classifies based on transgender status and sex and targets speech by forbidding expression of gender identity (including pronoun use), and that it arbitrarily breaks promises on which servicemembers relied to serve openly, causing reputational harm (“stigma‑plus”). They seek declaratory relief and preliminary and permanent injunctions barring enforcement of the Executive Order and implementing guidance. The case is before Judge Benjamin H. Settle.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. After ordering the government to file the Department’s “Action Memo,” the 2018 Mattis report, a 2021 AMSARA study, and a 2025 literature review on gender‑affirming care, and receiving supplemental briefing addressing additional February 26 and March 21 guidance, the court granted the motion on March 27, 2025. The court found plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim because the policy facially discriminates based on transgender status and sex and fails intermediate scrutiny; the court also concluded it would fail even rational‑basis review given the absence of evidence of harm from open service during the prior four years and the Department’s reliance on outdated or inapposite materials. The court additionally found likely success on plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim (viewpoint- and content‑based restrictions on expression, including compelled pronoun usage inconsistent with identity), and on procedural due process and equitable estoppel theories (a “bait and switch” that punished servicemembers for relying on prior policy and imposed a stigmatizing bar). The court determined plaintiffs faced irreparable harm (loss of careers and constitutional injuries), that the balance of equities favored maintaining the status quo, and that the public interest was served by allowing qualified servicemembers to continue serving. The resulting nationwide preliminary injunction enjoined implementation of Executive Order 14183, the February 26, 2025 “Additional Guidance on Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness,” and related memoranda, restoring the pre‑existing “Austin Policy” permitting open transgender service pending trial.\n\nThe government sought stays in the Ninth Circuit; the court of appeals denied an administrative stay on March 31, 2025 and denied a stay pending appeal on April 18, 2025. On May 6, 2025, the Supreme Court (on an application referred by Justice Kagan) stayed the district court’s March 27 injunction pending disposition of the appeal in the Ninth Circuit and of any petition for certiorari, thereby allowing the Department’s 2025 policy to take effect during the appeal. The government subsequently filed its answer on May 19, 2025. The district court referenced related litigation, including Talbott v. United States (D.D.C.), where a preliminary injunction issued and later was administratively stayed by the D.C. Circuit, and Ireland v. Hegseth (D.N.J.), where a temporary restraining order issued as to the named plaintiffs, as well as prior Ninth Circuit authority addressing transgender military policy (Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180 (9th Cir. 2019)). No class has been certified, no trial date has been set, and no settlement has been reached. The preliminary injunction (now stayed) was nationwide in scope and would have maintained the pre‑January 2025 status quo; its duration was “pending a trial on the merits.”",
    "45984": "On January 28, 2025, a group of transgender service members and prospective enlistees filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging new federal policies that exclude transgender people from military service. The suit names the United States, the Secretary of Defense Peter B. Hegseth, the service secretaries and their departments (Army, Navy/Marine Corps, Air Force/Space Force), and the Director and agency of the Defense Health Agency in their official capacities. Plaintiffs are current Army, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force personnel (including a basic trainee), and transgender applicants whose enlistments or accessions were halted. Plaintiffs are represented by civil-rights nonprofit counsel and pro bono/private counsel; the government is represented by the Department of Justice. The case is before Judge Ana C. Reyes.\n\nPlaintiffs challenge two presidential orders issued at the start of 2025 and the Department of Defense’s implementation. On January 20, 2025, the Administration issued Executive Order 14168, “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” defining “sex” exclusively by biological classification at conception. On January 27, 2025, Executive Order 14183, “Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness,” revoked the prior open-service policy (EO 14004), stated that adopting a gender identity inconsistent with birth sex is incompatible with military values (honesty, humility, integrity), directed DoD to end “identification‑based pronoun usage,” prohibited males and females from sharing sex‑segregated facilities, and required revisions to DoD medical standards. On February 7, 2025, DoD paused new accessions for individuals with a history of gender dysphoria and paused transition‑related medical procedures for service members. On February 26, 2025, DoD issued “Additional Guidance on Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness,” declaring service by people with a current or past diagnosis of, or “symptoms consistent with,” gender dysphoria incompatible with service; directing the services to identify such members within 30 days and initiate separations within 30 days thereafter; canceling transition‑related surgeries; requiring service in birth sex for purposes of pronouns, housing, facilities, and standards; and creating narrow “waivers” available only to individuals who had never attempted transition, had 36 months of “stability” in their birth sex, and agreed to serve in their birth sex. A Navy recruiting memo (Jan. 28) halted processing of applicants who identify as transgender, and service‑specific guidance followed. Plaintiffs alleged concrete harms including canceled surgeries, removal from female barracks and latrines for a basic trainee, blocked accessions and graduations, and adverse duty status changes.\n\nPlaintiffs’ operative pleadings (most recently a Fourth Amended Complaint filed March 24, 2025) assert that these actions violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause; they also plead procedural due process and estoppel claims. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctions restoring the prior open-service policy and barring enforcement of EO 14183, aspects of EO 14168 as applied to the military, and DoD’s implementing directives.\n\nKey proceedings followed rapidly. Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on February 3, 2025, and sought a temporary restraining order on February 4. The court required immediate notice of any implementing guidance and held status and scheduling conferences. Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint adding a basic trainee. The government opposed preliminary relief. After hearings on February 18 and 19, the court requested additional briefing (including on immutability) and awaited DoD’s final policy. DoD issued its February 26 implementation memo; Plaintiffs then filed a Third Amended Complaint and a renewed preliminary injunction motion on March 7. The court held further argument on March 12.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, Judge Reyes granted a preliminary injunction, enjoining EO 14183 and DoD’s February 26 implementation and “any other memorandums, guidance, policies, or actions” issued pursuant to that order, and ordering the government to maintain the pre‑January 27, 2025 status quo (the 2021–2024 “Austin” policy permitting open service under DoDI 6130.03 Vols. 1 & 2 and DoDI 1300.28). The court found Plaintiffs likely to succeed on their Fifth Amendment equal protection claim, concluding the policy facially classifies based on sex and transgender status and fails intermediate scrutiny; that the challenged actions also likely fail even rational basis review because they were animated by animus toward transgender persons; that plaintiffs face irreparable constitutional and career harms; and that the balance of equities and public interest favor injunctive relief. The court stayed its order until March 21 to allow the government to seek appellate relief.\n\nOn March 21, DoD issued “Military Department Identification” guidance clarifying that “exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria” refers to DSM‑5 criteria (marked incongruence with clinically significant distress for at least six months), required annual attestations during the Periodic Health Assessment, mandated non‑deployable status for those identified, and directed separation processing. The government moved to dissolve the injunction, arguing the policy targets a medical condition and mirrors the 2018 Mattis policy. On March 26, the district court denied dissolution and a stay pending appeal, finding the new guidance confirmed the policy’s focus on transgender people and did not alter the court’s conclusions; the court stayed its order until March 28 at 7:00 p.m. for possible emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit.\n\nMeanwhile, Plaintiffs filed a targeted TRO application on March 24 for several individuals facing immediate adverse actions (administrative absence, removal from classes, blocked graduation), seeking to preserve their status pending resolution of the government’s dissolution motion. On March 27, 2025, the D.C. Circuit issued an administrative stay of the district court’s March 18 preliminary injunction “pending further order of the court” to consider the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal. The appeal is docketed as No. 25‑5087, and briefing is underway; the government argues for military deference, contends the policy is a medical‑standards regulation requiring only rational basis review, challenges the injunction’s scope, and asserts the equities favor a stay.\n\nNo settlement has been reached. The preliminary injunction remains administratively stayed by the D.C. Circuit while it considers a stay pending appeal.",
    "45964": "On January 21, 2025, the States of Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington to stop enforcement of Executive Order 14160, issued on January 20, 2025 and titled “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.” The Order directs federal agencies, effective 30 days after issuance, not to recognize U.S. citizenship for persons born in the United States if (1) the mother was unlawfully present and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident at birth, or (2) the mother’s presence was lawful but temporary and the father was not a citizen or lawful permanent resident. It also directs agencies to align regulations and issue implementation guidance within 30 days. Plaintiffs alleged the Order violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause and 8 U.S.C. § 1401, and (in the later-consolidated action) the Administrative Procedure Act. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The States were represented by their attorneys general; individual plaintiffs (pregnant noncitizens) later joined and were represented by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The United States, the President in his official capacity, and multiple federal departments and officers were named defendants.\n\nJudge John C. Coughenour (W.D. Wash.) granted a temporary restraining order on January 23, 2025, enjoining implementation and enforcement nationwide. On January 27, 2025, the court consolidated a related individual action (No. 2:25-cv-0163) with the States’ case and set an expedited schedule. On February 6, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction, again enjoining enforcement and implementation nationwide. The court held the States had standing based on impending loss of federal reimbursements for programs like Medicaid, CHIP, Title IV‑E foster care, and SSA “Enumeration at Birth” payments, and significant administrative burdens to rework eligibility verification systems if the Order took effect. The court found the States likely to succeed on the merits because the Order conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment’s plain text and Supreme Court precedent—particularly United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898)—which affirms birthright citizenship for nearly all persons born on U.S. soil and “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States, with narrow exceptions (e.g., children of foreign diplomats, enemy occupiers, and historically, tribal members). The court also found irreparable harm, that the equities favored plaintiffs, and that a nationwide injunction was necessary to prevent piecemeal disruption and to afford complete relief to the States.\n\nThe government appealed and sought a stay. On February 19, 2025, a Ninth Circuit motions panel denied a partial stay and calendared the appeal. In parallel cases, other district courts issued similar injunctions, and on June 27, 2025, the Supreme Court addressed “universal” (nationwide) injunctions in Trump v. CASA, Inc., granting partial stays to limit such injunctions to relief necessary to provide complete relief to plaintiffs and allowing agencies to issue guidance during the injunctions. The Court left to lower courts whether broader relief was needed to afford complete relief to State plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 23, 2025, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction. It held the State plaintiffs had Article III standing because the Order would directly reduce federal reimbursements and administrative fees and impose immediate, unrecoverable administrative costs; these were not indirect or self-inflicted harms. The panel dismissed the individual plaintiffs’ claims in deference to a certified nationwide class in “Barbara v. Trump” in the District of New Hampshire, which covered their children’s claims. On the merits, the court held plaintiffs were likely to prevail because the Order contradicts the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause: the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” refers to being subject to U.S. laws and authority, not to an exclusive “primary allegiance” or parents’ permanent domicile, and Supreme Court precedent (Wong Kim Ark) and the Amendment’s history confirm that nearly all persons born in the United States are citizens at birth, except for narrow, historically recognized categories. The court likewise found a likelihood of success on the statutory claim under 8 U.S.C. § 1401, which mirrors the constitutional text. The court agreed irreparable harm was shown and the equities and public interest favored injunctive relief because the Executive Branch has no legitimate interest in enforcing an unconstitutional policy.\n\nAddressing scope after the Supreme Court’s CASA ruling, the Ninth Circuit held the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing relief that applies nationwide as necessary to provide complete relief to the State plaintiffs: births can occur across state lines and affected families may move among States, which would otherwise force States to overhaul eligibility verification systems and suffer ongoing administrative burdens. The court concluded a uniform application of the Citizenship Clause nationwide was required to prevent the harms identified.\n\nKey procedural steps: complaint filed January 21, 2025; TRO granted January 23; cases consolidated January 27; preliminary injunction granted February 6; Ninth Circuit denied stay February 19; on June 27, 2025, the Supreme Court addressed universal injunctions in related litigation and permitted agency guidance; on July 23, 2025, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction and its scope and dismissed the individual plaintiffs’ claims due to overlapping class proceedings. Related litigation included CASA, Inc. v. Trump (D. Md./4th Cir.), New Jersey v. Trump (D. Mass./1st Cir.), Doe v. Trump (D. Mass.), and “Barbara v. Trump” (D.N.H.) in which a nationwide class was certified. The case remains in a preliminary injunction posture with nationwide effect, and the district court retains jurisdiction over the States’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.",
    "45965": "On January 21, 2025, two immigrant‑rights organizations and several pregnant mothers filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Greenbelt Division) challenging Executive Order 14160, “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.” The order directs federal agencies not to recognize birthright citizenship for persons born in the United States after February 19, 2025, when the mother was either unlawfully present or lawfully but temporarily present and the father was neither a U.S. citizen nor a lawful permanent resident. The plaintiffs—CASA, Inc.; the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP); and five individual mothers (later expanded to include additional mothers and newborns)—sued the President, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of USCIS, the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, and the United States. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the order violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause and 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a). Plaintiffs are represented by nonprofit and public‑interest counsel (including CASA counsel and Georgetown University Law Center’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection), and the defendants by the Department of Justice.\n\nOn February 5, 2025, Judge Deborah L. Boardman granted a preliminary injunction, finding plaintiffs highly likely to succeed on their claim that the Executive Order contradicts the plain language of the Citizenship Clause and the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, and also conflicts with § 1401(a). The court rejected the Government’s threshold arguments (including that 8 U.S.C. § 1503 supplied the exclusive remedy), found irreparable harm to newborns and their families, and entered a nationwide injunction enjoining implementation and enforcement of the order by the State Department, DHS/USCIS, the DOJ, the SSA, and persons in active concert with them.\n\nThe Government’s motion to stay the injunction was denied in the district court and by the Fourth Circuit. On June 27, 2025, the Supreme Court granted a partial stay in Trump v. CASA, holding that “universal” injunctions likely exceed federal courts’ equitable authority and narrowing the injunction to protect only the named plaintiffs, while expressly permitting agencies to issue guidance and delaying the order’s § 2 effective date by 30 days. The Court did not address the merits of the Executive Order’s legality, and noted that class actions under Rule 23(b)(2) can supply class‑wide injunctive relief.\n\nWithin hours, plaintiffs amended their complaint to proceed as a class action on behalf of children born in the United States after February 19, 2025, and their parents. On July 29, 2025, the Fourth Circuit dismissed the interlocutory appeal and remanded to allow the district court to conform its relief to the Supreme Court’s directions and to promptly resolve the class issues. On August 7, 2025, Judge Boardman certified a Rule 23(b)(2) class defined as: “Any child who has been born or will be born in the United States after February 19, 2025, (1) whose mother was unlawfully present in the United States and whose father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) whose mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary and whose father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.” The court found numerosity easily met; identified a common question of law—whether the Executive Order violates the Citizenship Clause and § 1401(a)—capable of class‑wide resolution; and held that the named parents, acting as next friends for their newborns or future children, were typical and adequate representatives for the children’s claims. The court certified only the children’s claims (not the parents’ independent claims), and then issued a classwide preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the Executive Order against the certified class pending resolution on the merits.\n\nKey related litigation included similar district‑court injunctions in Washington v. Trump (W.D. Wash.) and Doe v. Trump (D. Mass.), with the Ninth Circuit affirming and the First Circuit denying a stay; the Supreme Court consolidated the Government’s partial‑stay applications from those cases with this one. Judge Boardman’s principal reported opinions are the February 5, 2025 preliminary‑injunction decision (763 F. Supp. 3d 723) and the February 18, 2025 decision denying a partial stay (2025 WL 545840). The Supreme Court’s partial‑stay ruling is reported at 145 S. Ct. 2540 (2025). No trial has occurred, and the case remains pending on the merits, with a classwide preliminary injunction in place enjoining enforcement of Executive Order 14160 as to all class members.",
    "VR-LA-0120": "In May 2020, during the COVID‑19 pandemic, two lawsuits challenging Louisiana’s absentee and early voting rules were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana and were later consolidated before Chief Judge Shelly D. Dick. On May 7, 2020, community organizations and voters (including Power Coalition for Equity and Justice and the Louisiana NAACP) sued the Governor and Secretary of State in Power Coalition for Equity & Justice v. Edwards. On May 19, 2020, individual voters and two civic groups (Telisa Clark, Lakeshia Barnett, Crescent City Media Group, and the League of Women Voters of Louisiana) filed a related action against the Governor, Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and two parish registrars (Lafayette and Terrebonne). The State of Louisiana, through the Attorney General, intervened. Plaintiffs were represented by public‑interest and pro bono counsel, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, Fair Elections Center, Arnold & Porter, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and Covington & Burling.\n\nPlaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, alleging that, in the context of COVID‑19, three state voting rules unconstitutionally burdened the right to vote and violated the Voting Rights Act: (1) the “Excuse Requirement,” which limits absentee‑by‑mail voting to specific categories in La. Rev. Stat. § 18:1303; (2) the absentee ballot “Witness Requirement,” which requires a witness signature on the absentee ballot certificate (La. Rev. Stat. § 18:1306(E)(2)(a)); and (3) the lack of notice and an opportunity to cure defects in absentee applications or ballots (La. Rev. Stat. § 18:1313). The Power Coalition plaintiffs also challenged limiting early voting to seven days for the November and December elections, seeking fourteen days. Plaintiffs alleged the rules, as applied during the pandemic, violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments (including Anderson‑Burdick balancing and an unconstitutional‑conditions theory) and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because the burden fell disproportionately on Black voters and those at higher risk from COVID‑19. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Excuse and Witness Requirements for all 2020 elections, extending early voting for later elections, and requiring notice‑and‑cure procedures; they also moved for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe litigation arose against the backdrop of the Secretary of State’s April 2020 emergency election planning. The Secretary’s initial proposal would have broadly expanded absentee eligibility and waived the witness requirement for the then‑postponed July and August 2020 elections, but the Legislature rejected that plan. A revised Emergency Election Plan, approved April 27, 2020, created five COVID‑related excuses for absentee voting for the July 11 and August 15 elections, extended early voting to thirteen days for those elections, but retained the witness requirement and did not cover the November and December elections. On June 11, 2020, the Governor signed SB 75, immediately limiting any one person (except an immediate family member) from witnessing more than one absentee ballot. On June 15, 2020, the Secretary, with the Attorney General’s approval, issued an emergency rule allowing limited notice‑and‑cure of absentee ballot deficiencies, but requiring voters to appear in person at the registrar’s office to cure.\n\nDefendants moved to dismiss, arguing, among other things, that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiffs lacked standing (the alleged harms were caused by the pandemic, not state action), the claims presented political questions, the Purcell principle counseled against late changes to election rules, and necessary parish entities had not been joined. The parish registrars also sought dismissal on standing and Rule 19 grounds. Plaintiffs opposed and amended their complaints in mid‑June, refining allegations and, in the Clark case, naming only the Governor, Secretary, and Attorney General; the registrar defendants were terminated on June 18, 2020.\n\nOn June 22, 2020, the Court dismissed the consolidated cases for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on standing grounds, without reaching the merits or the other defenses. Plaintiffs moved to amend the judgment to reflect a dismissal without prejudice, which the Court granted; an amended judgment issued June 30, 2020. As a result, the motions for preliminary injunction were denied as moot, and no injunctive or declaratory relief issued. No appeals are reflected in the record provided. The cases centered on the application of Louisiana’s absentee and early voting laws during a public health emergency, including the state’s Emergency Election Plan limited to the July and August 2020 elections, but concluded with dismissal for lack of standing.",
    "VR-SC-0078": "On April 22, 2020, several South Carolina voters and a nonprofit (later joined by the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP) filed this federal civil‑rights action against the Executive Director and members of the South Carolina State Election Commission and the Governor, challenging two absentee‑voting provisions in light of COVID‑19: (1) the “Excuse Requirement” limiting who may vote absentee (S.C. Code Ann. § 7‑15‑320), and (2) the “Witness Requirement” mandating a witness signature on an absentee ballot envelope (S.C. Code Ann. § 7‑15‑380). Plaintiffs alleged these provisions, during the pandemic, imposed unconstitutional burdens on the right to vote in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments (42 U.S.C. § 1983), denied or abridged the right to vote in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, constituted a prohibited “test or device” under Section 201 of the Voting Rights Act, and violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief eliminating the requirements for the 2020 elections and a public information campaign.\n\nPlaintiffs supported their claims with public‑health guidance from CDC and DHEC, evidence that many voters—disproportionately Black, elderly, or disabled—live alone or must strictly quarantine, and a March 30, 2020 letter from Executive Director Marci Andino to state leaders recommending, for safety and security, temporary no‑excuse absentee voting and removal of the witness requirement. The South Carolina Republican Party intervened (permissively) to defend the challenged provisions, and the Attorney General (amicus) and United States (Statement of Interest) opposed the Section 201 “test or device” claim, noting such claims must be heard by a three‑judge court and arguing a witness signature is not a prohibited voucher. Protection & Advocacy for People with Disabilities filed an amicus brief supporting plaintiffs. Later, the Speaker of the House and the Senate President were also allowed to intervene.\n\nAfter the General Assembly enacted S. 635 (Act 133) on May 13, 2020 temporarily allowing all qualified voters to vote absentee in the June primaries due to the state of emergency, the Excuse Requirement issue for those elections became moot. On May 25, 2020, Judge J. Michelle Childs granted in part plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining enforcement of the Witness Requirement for the June 9, 2020 primaries and any runoffs. The court found that, amid COVID‑19, requiring a witness signature forced voters—especially those living alone or at high risk—to risk exposure to vote, constituting a severe burden on the right to vote that was not justified by the State’s asserted interests, particularly given other safeguards and the SEC Director’s acknowledgment that the witness signature “offers no benefit” to election officials. The court ordered the State to inform voters that no witness was required for the June primaries.\n\nPlaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 13, 2020 seeking relief for the remaining 2020 elections. Defendants moved for summary judgment on August 10, 2020, arguing lack of standing, that absentee voting is a privilege subject to rational‑basis review under McDonald v. Board of Election Comm’rs, that the burdens were minimal given in‑person safety measures, and that neither the VRA nor ADA claims could succeed. On September 16, 2020, the General Assembly enacted H.B. 5305 (R.149), suspending the Excuse Requirement for the November general election due to the ongoing emergency. On September 18, 2020, in a related case (Middleton v. Andino), the same court enjoined the Witness Requirement for the November 2020 general election. In light of those developments, Judge Childs stayed the Thomas proceedings and held all pending motions in abeyance, noting both challenged provisions were suspended or enjoined for November 2020. The case remains stayed.",
    "JC-MD-0017": "On April 21, 2020, pretrial detainees and a post‑conviction inmate at the Prince George’s County Correctional Center filed a class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Judge Paula Xinis), alleging unconstitutional jail conditions during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Plaintiffs—represented by Civil Rights Corps and WilmerHale—seek declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 for a subclass of medically vulnerable pretrial detainees. They ask the court to remedy unsafe conditions (lack of no‑cost soap and sanitizer, poor sanitation, inadequate masking and social distancing), delays and co‑pays for medical care (including $4 sick‑call fees), failure to medically isolate and contact trace, and filthy medical isolation cells with minimal monitoring or access to hygiene. Plaintiffs also allege a policy of “overdetention” of detainees who had satisfied their release but were held solely due to COVID‑19 positivity until deemed non‑contagious. They bring class claims on behalf of pretrial and post‑conviction detainees and a medically vulnerable subclass.\n\nPlaintiffs concurrently moved for emergency relief. After ordering an expedited response and appointing, under Fed. R. Evid. 706, infectious disease specialist Dr. Carlos Franco‑Paredes to conduct an unannounced inspection (May 6–7, 2020), the court issued a May 21, 2020 Memorandum Opinion and Order granting narrowly drawn, temporary injunctive relief. The court found Plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits of their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment conditions claims based on a “triple‑threat” at the Facility: undertesting (including early test positivity of 90%), inadequate treatment and isolation of symptomatic detainees, and no plan to protect high‑risk detainees. The court ordered the Facility to, within five days, file a comprehensive plan for identifying, monitoring, treating, and housing CDC‑defined high‑risk detainees (including securing single‑cell housing when appropriate), to train and supervise staff on symptom identification and timely care, to ensure adequate supplies (soap, cleaning agents, PPE), and to expand testing (e.g., of affected housing units and new intakes). The order was expressly temporary (a TRO), set to be revisited in June 2020.\n\nDefendant noticed an appeal and moved to stay the TRO. On June 3, 2020, the court denied a stay, noting the TRO was not appealable and that the record showed plaintiffs were likely to succeed and would suffer irreparable harm absent relief. The court also observed substantial evidence that the jail’s grievance process was “hobbled, if not outright broken,” bearing on PLRA exhaustion.\n\nDefendant filed the required plans and reports. On May 26, 2020, the Facility outlined processes to identify high‑risk detainees (via Chronic Care Clinic lists, intake, and sick‑call screening), monitor and treat them, house them (favoring single‑celling where possible), and to continue training and testing. In a June 5, 2020 14‑day report, Defendant stated that by May 26, 2020, 521 of 525 detainees had been tested, with six asymptomatic positives (about 1.14%); new intakes were being tested and quarantined for 14 days.\n\nOn July 7, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint adding two claims challenging the jail’s prolonged, universal lockdown (confinement in cells for 22–23 hours per day with limited out‑of‑cell time often in the middle of the night, scarce reading materials, and curtailed mental health services). They allege these conditions create a substantial risk of serious psychological and physiological harm in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and that imposing such restrictive confinement without individualized process violates procedural due process. Defendant moved to dismiss (or for summary judgment), arguing mootness as to released named plaintiffs, PLRA non‑exhaustion, failure to plead Monell liability on overdetention, that § 2241 habeas cannot redress conditions claims, and that the lockdown claims fail on the merits and under the PLRA’s limits on injunctive relief. Plaintiffs opposed, invoking the “inherently transitory” exception to mootness, arguing the grievance system was unavailable, and maintaining the sufficiency of their constitutional claims. Class certification remains pending; the court initially held it in abeyance while addressing emergency relief and later set a schedule for discovery and further proceedings.\n\nJudge: Paula Xinis.",
    "IM-FL-0029": "On April 13, 2020, civil immigration detainees held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at three South Florida facilities—Krome Service Processing Center (Miami), Broward Transitional Center (Pompano Beach), and Glades County Detention Center (Moore Haven)—filed a class action habeas and injunctive suit (28 U.S.C. § 2241) against the ICE Miami Field Office Director and the U.S. Attorney General. Represented by a coalition of private counsel (King & Spalding and others), nonprofit legal organizations (Americans for Immigrant Justice, Southern Poverty Law Center, Legal Aid Service of Broward County), and the University of Miami School of Law Immigration Clinic, the detainees alleged that ICE’s response to COVID‑19 at the facilities violated the Fifth Amendment due process right to reasonably safe, non‑punitive civil detention and, under the Accardi doctrine, ICE’s own binding detention standards requiring compliance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including release, to address the risk of infection, the use of cohort quarantine contrary to CDC guidance, inadequate access to masks, soap, and disinfectants, and unsafe transfers that allegedly spread infection.\n\nAfter expedited proceedings before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman, District Judge Marcia G. Cooke entered a Temporary Restraining Order on April 30, 2020, requiring ICE to: (1) evaluate each named petitioner for release and report who could be promptly released; (2) describe how it would accelerate review and reduce each facility to roughly 75% of capacity within two weeks; (3) file weekly and twice‑weekly reports on releases and facility populations (including “mandatory detainees” and those with no convictions or pending charges); (4) immediately provide detainees with adequate soap, water, cleaning materials, and weekly mask replacement; and (5) provide staff and detainee education on COVID‑19. On May 2, 2020, the Court clarified that transfers were permitted only after ICE evaluated each detainee’s eligibility for release pursuant to ICE’s April 10, 2020 COVID‑19 Pandemic Response Requirements (PRR).\n\nFollowing evidentiary hearings on June 2–3, 2020, Judge Cooke issued an Omnibus Order on June 6, 2020, granting a preliminary injunction, finding record evidence that ICE failed to protect detainees from COVID‑19 and had not adhered to CDC and ICE standards, and certifying a Rule 23(b)(2) class of “all current civil immigration detainees who are held by ICE at Krome, BTC, and Glades when this action was filed, since this action was filed, or in the future.” The Court ordered ICE to stop commingling confirmed COVID‑19 cases with unconfirmed cases; provide unrestricted access to hand soap, hand sanitizer, and hand towels; provide masks and COVID‑19 education to all detainees and staff; and perform CDC‑compliant screening before any detainee transfer. The Court further held that it would retain jurisdiction over class members transferred to other facilities, regardless of location.\n\nDisputes over compliance led to Petitioners’ motion to compel. On July 17, 2020, the Court appointed Special Master Matthew C. Dates to inspect the facilities and report on compliance with the preliminary injunction. The Special Master’s February 19, 2021 report found, among other things, that cleaning supplies, masks, soap, and sanitizer were available and logged, but that the facilities’ physical layouts impeded full social distancing; he recommended partial relief. On March 25, 2021, the Court granted in part and denied in part Petitioners’ motion to compel, adopting aspects of the Special Master’s findings and continuing enforcement of the injunction.\n\nOn June 28, 2021, the parties entered a class‑wide Settlement Agreement, adopted as a final, court‑enforceable injunction with the Court retaining jurisdiction. The settlement requires the three facilities to comply with applicable detention standards, the ICE PRR, and CDC guidelines as they evolve; to implement ICE’s COVID‑19 Vaccination Guidelines and Protocol and provide free COVID‑19 vaccinations (and seasonal influenza vaccines), with multilingual educational materials and medical staff presentations; and to provide vaccine cards and information to those released after one vaccine dose. The facilities must maintain population density in each living area and overall at no more than 75% of capacity (as defined by PRR/CDC) with limited, reportable exceptions; post daily cohort/quarantine status and dates in every housing unit; test symptomatic detainees and close contacts within 24 hours and provide results within 12 hours; isolate positives and medically isolate exposed, test‑negative detainees for 14 days without mixing with confirmed cases; medically isolate those pending test results away from general population; and ensure unlimited, no‑cost access to soap and hand sanitizer with logged refills at specified locations. The facilities must provide new masks (disposable masks three times per week or clean cloth masks) with immediate replacement on request; require staff to wear masks; provide a new mask before any transfer; and perform a rapid COVID‑19 test within 24 hours before transfer, only transferring those who test negative. Transport vehicles must be sanitized before and after each trip and seat detainees with distancing when possible. Class members retain the right to pursue individual habeas petitions for release.\n\nThroughout, Judge Marcia G. Cooke presided, with Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman handling emergency and class certification proceedings, and Special Master Dates monitoring compliance. The case concluded with a court‑enforced settlement aimed at aligning facility practices with CDC and ICE standards to mitigate COVID‑19 risks for the certified class."
