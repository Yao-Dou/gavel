    "46290": "On March 5, 2025, a recognized student organization at Texas A&M University, the Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council (the student group), filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas (No. 4:25‑cv‑00992) against members of the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents, the System Chancellor, and the University President, all in their official capacities. The case arises from a February 28, 2025 Board resolution directing cancellation of “Drag Show Events” in campus “Special Event Venues,” which led to cancellation of the student group’s annual, privately funded drag performance, “Draggieland,” scheduled for March 27, 2025 at the on-campus Rudder Theatre.\n\nParties and counsel. The plaintiff is a campus student organization that hosts expressive events supporting LGBTQ+ students. The defendants are the members of the Texas A&M System Board of Regents, the System Chancellor, and the Texas A&M President, sued in their official capacities. The plaintiff is represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), a nonprofit public‑interest First Amendment organization, with counsel admitted pro hac vice.\n\nLegal foundation. The complaint asserts claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments based on viewpoint and content discrimination and prior restraint, seeks declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02, and brings a state-law claim to void the Board’s action under the Texas Open Meetings Act (Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 551.141, 551.142). The relief sought includes a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, declaratory judgments, an order voiding actions taken at the February 28, 2025 meeting, and attorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and Tex. Gov’t Code § 551.142(b).\n\nFactual basis. The University’s policies make campus facilities, including the Rudder Theatre Complex, available for student and sponsored events under content- and viewpoint‑neutral rules. Draggieland is a pageant‑style drag performance organized by the student group, historically successful and ticketed, with performers fully clothed and often discussing what drag means to them. The student group reserved Rudder Theatre on May 28, 2024 for March 27, 2025, received approval on October 23, 2024, and began ticket sales. On February 28, 2025, the Board adopted a resolution banning “Drag Show Events” from Special Event Venues, asserting such shows demean women, may contribute to a hostile environment under Title IX, and “promote gender ideology” in light of a January 20, 2025 federal executive order (Exec. Order No. 14168). The Chancellor directed campus presidents to cancel any such events, and Texas A&M officials notified the student group that Draggieland would not be permitted on campus; tickets already sold were refunded. The student group alleges the Board meeting was noticed less than 72 hours in advance in violation of the Texas Open Meetings Act.\n\nProceedings and rulings. The plaintiff moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on March 5, 2025. The court set expedited briefing and held a hearing on March 18, 2025. On March 24, 2025, Senior U.S. District Judge Lee H. Rosenthal granted a preliminary injunction, enjoining enforcement of the Board’s resolution and ordering that Draggieland be permitted to proceed as scheduled on March 27, 2025, at 7:30 p.m. at Rudder Theatre. No bond was required, and the injunction remains effective until further order. Memorandum and Opinion (S.D. Tex. Mar. 24, 2025); Order of Injunction (S.D. Tex. Mar. 24, 2025).\n\nIn granting relief, the court found:\n- Draggieland is protected speech and expressive conduct; the performance and performers’ discussions convey political, social, and cultural messages.\n- The Rudder Theatre functions as a designated public forum; even if deemed a limited public forum, the Board’s ban is unconstitutional because it is viewpoint-based.\n- The resolution is a prior restraint imposed before speech occurs and is unconstitutionally vague (undefined terms such as “lewd,” “vulgar,” and “sexualized”).\n- The Board’s reliance on Title IX and a federal executive order does not supply a compelling, narrowly tailored basis to ban a once‑a‑year, ticketed, voluntary performance for adults; there was no evidence of severe or pervasive harassment tied to Draggieland.\n- The plaintiff showed a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm to First Amendment rights, and that the equities and public interest favor the injunction.\n\nImportant filings. Key filings include the complaint (Mar. 5, 2025), the motion for TRO/preliminary injunction (Mar. 5), expedited briefing and a March 18 hearing, and the preliminary injunction and memorandum and opinion (Mar. 24). An Answer was filed May 6, 2025. The state Open Meetings Act claim remains pending; the preliminary injunction addressed the federal First Amendment claims.\n\nAppeal. The defendants noticed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on March 28, 2025 (USCA No. 25‑20108) and moved to stay the injunction pending appeal. The record reflects briefing on the stay motion; the documents provided do not include a ruling on that motion or the appeal’s disposition.\n\nDecree terms and duration. The preliminary injunction enjoins enforcement of the February 28, 2025 resolution and requires the University to permit the March 27, 2025 Draggieland performance at Rudder Theatre. No bond was required. The injunction remains in effect until further order of the court.\n\nContext. The dispute centers on whether a public university may ban a student‑organized drag performance from a campus theater based on objections to its perceived ideology and alleged demeaning content. The court held that, under the First Amendment, the University may not impose a viewpoint‑based prior restraint on protected, adult‑audience expression in a campus forum opened for a wide range of performances and events.",
    "46324": "Filing date: March 31, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nParties: A nonprofit community development finance intermediary and GGRF grantee (the nonprofit grantee) sued the federal environmental agency (the agency), its Administrator and Acting Deputy Administrator in their official capacities (the agency head and acting deputy), and the bank serving as the federal financial agent for the grant accounts (the bank). The plaintiff is an organizational, individual plaintiff (not a class action).\n\nType of counsel: The nonprofit grantee is represented by private counsel (Venable LLP). The federal defendants are represented by government counsel. The bank is represented by private counsel.\n\nFactual basis of the case: Congress, through the Inflation Reduction Act, created the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) and appropriated nearly $27 billion for three programs: National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA), and Solar for All. In April 2024, the agency awarded the nonprofit grantee $1.87 billion under CCIA; the grant period is April 1, 2024–June 30, 2030. Under a September 19, 2024 Financial Agency Agreement with Treasury, the bank serves as financial agent for all NCIF/CCIA funds. An Account Control Agreement among the agency, the bank, and the nonprofit grantee (effective November 6, 2024) governs the nonprofit grantee’s account and requires the bank to follow the grantee’s instructions absent a Notice of Exclusive Control from the agency; no such notice is alleged to have been issued.\n\nBetween November 2024 and mid‑February 2025, the nonprofit grantee pre‑qualified applicants and, after conferring weekly with the agency’s grant managers, selected 108 credit unions in 27 states and Puerto Rico for $651 million in initial subawards, notifying the agency on February 12 and 14. The complaint alleges that on February 12–13, 2025, after the first subrecipient notices, the agency head publicly announced an intent to claw back GGRF funds and return them to the Treasury, and the agency then froze GGRF funds; the bank allegedly declined to open subrecipient accounts or process drawdowns. On March 2–3, 2025, the agency referred GGRF to its Inspector General and issued a press release asserting concerns with program integrity, oversight, and potential waste, fraud, and abuse (without naming the nonprofit grantee). On March 4, 2025, the agency sent the nonprofit grantee a 35‑item information request. On March 11, 2025, the acting deputy issued a letter purporting to terminate all GGRF grant agreements, citing 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339–.340 and “misalignment with the Agency’s priorities,” among other reasons; the letter did not offer a pre‑deprivation process or identify any specific noncompliance by the nonprofit grantee. The nonprofit grantee responded to the March 4 request on March 28 with an 18‑page letter and exhibits. The complaint further alleges that the bank continued to withhold funds and account openings notwithstanding the Account Control Agreement, and that funds were briefly moved out of the nonprofit grantee’s account on April 1, 2025 before being reinvested in money market funds (per counsel communications), prompting an emergency TRO request that was later withdrawn.\n\nCause of action and legal bases: Against the federal defendants, the nonprofit grantee asserts multiple Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claims (5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706): (1) contrary to the Inflation Reduction Act’s GGRF directives (42 U.S.C. § 7434); (2) contrary to the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act’s rescission rules (2 U.S.C. § 683); (3) contrary to the Anti‑Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1512, 1517); (4) contrary to federal grant regulations (2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339–.342); and (5) arbitrary and capricious action. Constitutional claims allege separation‑of‑powers violations: Article I’s Legislative Vesting Clause, Spending Clause (Art. I, § 8, cl. 1), and Appropriations Clause (Art. I, § 9, cl. 7); Article II’s Take Care Clause (Art. II, § 3); and deprivation of due process under the Fifth Amendment. The complaint also pleads ultra vires agency action. Against the bank, the nonprofit grantee alleges breach of contract (Account Control Agreement), conversion, and replevin under New York law.\n\nRemedies sought: Declaratory relief that the March 11, 2025 termination is void and that the freeze/termination violate the APA, federal statutes, and the Constitution; injunctive relief prohibiting the agency from giving effect to the termination, interfering with access to funds, or impeding the bank’s performance; and orders requiring the bank to honor the Account Control Agreement (including opening subrecipient accounts, processing draw requests, and not transferring funds except as directed by the nonprofit grantee or the Court). The nonprofit grantee also requested emergency restoration and protection of funds following the April 1 account balance issue.\n\nJudge: U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan.\n\nFilings and proceedings:\n- March 31, 2025: Complaint filed.\n- April 1, 2025: Motion for preliminary injunction filed, with exhibits including the grant agreements, Account Control Agreement, Financial Agency Agreement, and agency letters. An emergency TRO was also filed the same day after the grantee discovered a zero balance; later that day and evening, counsel for the agency and the bank attributed the movement to month‑end money market processes; the nonprofit grantee withdrew the TRO on April 2.\n- April 7, 2025: Multiple pro hac vice motions for plaintiff’s counsel granted; appearances entered for federal defendants and the bank.\n- April 10, 2025: On a joint status report, the Court stayed briefing on the preliminary injunction motion.\n- April 15, 2025: The Court consolidated this case with Case No. 25‑cv‑698 under Rule 42(a)(2), designating 25‑cv‑698 as the lead case and directing future filings there.\n- April 16, 2025: The Court denied the nonprofit grantee’s preliminary‑injunction motion as moot in light of a Preliminary Injunction Order entered in the lead case (25‑cv‑698), with a memorandum opinion to follow.\n\nConsolidated/related cases: This case is consolidated with D.D.C. Case No. 25‑cv‑698, which involves other GGRF grantees and earlier resulted in a March 18, 2025 temporary restraining order. The Court’s April 16 order indicates that preliminary‑injunction relief in the lead case governs, mooting the separate preliminary‑injunction motion here.\n\nRelief status and monitoring: No final merits ruling has issued in this docket. Preliminary‑injunction issues are controlled by the order in the consolidated lead case; no separate decree or settlement specific to this plaintiff is recorded on this docket. There is no court‑appointed monitor in this case.\n\nStatutory and regulatory context referenced: Inflation Reduction Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7434 (GGRF); APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706; Impoundment Control Act, 2 U.S.C. § 683; Anti‑Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1512, 1517; 12 U.S.C. § 265 (financial agents of the Government); Uniform Guidance, 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339–.342; constitutional provisions cited above.\n\nCurrent posture: The case is consolidated with 25‑cv‑698. The nonprofit grantee’s request for preliminary injunctive relief was denied as moot on April 16, 2025 because of the preliminary‑injunction order entered in the lead case. No trial or appeal is noted on this docket. The complaint seeks declaratory and permanent injunctive relief against the federal defendants and injunctive and contractual relief against the bank, along with restoration of access to the grant funds and implementation of the CCIA program as awarded.",
    "46391": "On April 11, 2025, five individuals in F‑1 nonimmigrant status—two on post‑graduate Optional Practical Training (OPT) and three as current students at California universities—filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. They sued the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Acting Field Office Director for ICE’s San Francisco office, and the President, all in their official capacities. The students are represented by private counsel from Van Der Hout LLP. The case is not a class action.\n\nThe students seek declaratory and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202, and assert Fifth Amendment procedural due process claims. They challenge ICE’s termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records in early April 2025—which, according to entries visible to their schools, cited “Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked.” Plaintiffs do not challenge any Department of State visa revocations per se; they allege that visa revocation does not terminate F‑1 status and that ICE lacks authority to terminate status or SEVIS records on the grounds cited. They seek a declaration that the SEVIS terminations were unlawful; vacatur and restoration of their SEVIS records and F‑1 statuses; and injunctions barring enforcement actions—including arrest, detention, transfer, or removal—arising from the SEVIS terminations or visa revocations, as well as costs and fees.\n\nThe complaint alleges each plaintiff remained in compliance with F‑1 requirements: one has a 2018 misdemeanor DUI conviction; one has a 2024 misdemeanor disturbing-the-peace conviction; one has no criminal history but previously received a 212(d)(3) waiver after an expedited removal; one had 2021 charges dismissed; and one had a 2024 arrest with no charges filed. Plaintiffs assert none of these circumstances constitutes a “crime of violence” or other failure to maintain status under 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.1(e)–(g) or 214.2(f), and that ICE may terminate status only in the limited situations listed at 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d). Plaintiffs further allege their schools did not initiate the SEVIS terminations and that some plaintiffs received separate notices that their visas had been revoked.\n\nJudge Noël Wise initially presided and granted Plaintiffs’ administrative motion to proceed under pseudonyms. On April 16, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a TRO motion. On April 17, 2025, Judge Wise granted the TRO, finding Plaintiffs had shown at least serious questions going to the merits of their APA claims and a likelihood of success, a likelihood of irreparable harm (including risk of arrest, transfer far from their communities, loss of studies or OPT, and significant anxiety), and that the balance of equities and public interest favored relief. For 14 days, the order: (1) enjoined Defendants from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs; (2) enjoined transferring Plaintiffs outside the district; and (3) enjoined imposing any legal effect that otherwise may be caused by the SEVIS terminations or potential visa revocations; it also required confidentiality protections and waived bond. The order set briefing and a hearing schedule.\n\nOn April 22, 2025, the case was related and reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White, who coordinated it with other Northern District cases presenting similar issues (including Doe v. Trump, No. 25‑cv‑03140‑JSW; Zhuoer Chen v. Noem, No. 25‑cv‑03292‑JSW; Emma Bai v. Lyons, No. 25‑cv‑03481‑JSW; and Sky Qui v. Lyons, No. 25‑cv‑03475‑JSW). In a Notice of Questions for the April 25 hearing, Judge White asked the government to address the legal consequences of SEVIS termination (referencing DHS’s own published guidance), who initiates terminations, available process, and whether any plaintiff had in fact “failed to maintain status.”\n\nAt the April 25, 2025 hearing, Judge White extended the TRO for an additional 14 days and set a preliminary injunction hearing in May, with supplemental briefing deadlines. On April 28, 2025, Defendants filed a “Statement Regarding Reactivation of Plaintiffs’ SEVIS Records,” reflecting that Plaintiffs’ SEVIS records had been reactivated. On April 30, 2025, Defendants filed a “Notice Regarding Policy,” and Plaintiffs filed a supplemental PI brief the same day. Following further briefing and a hearing held on May 14, 2025, Judge White granted preliminary injunctions on May 22, 2025, in this and several related cases. (The record provided does not include the full text of the PI order; the court set a joint case management conference and later continued it.)\n\nJudge Wise’s TRO and Judge White’s subsequent orders relied on APA principles that termination of SEVIS status is reviewable final agency action and, on the limited record, likely exceeded DHS/ICE authority and was arbitrary and capricious under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). The court also found irreparable harm from loss of studies or employment and risk of detention or removal, and emphasized the public interest in adherence to due process and administrative law.\n\nDefendants noticed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025 (USCA No. 25‑4523) from the preliminary injunction order, and later moved in the district court to stay the injunction pending appeal (motion filed August 8, 2025; hearing set for September 12, 2025). As of the latest entries provided, no trial has occurred, no settlement has been reported, and there is no court‑appointed monitor.\n\nFactual context: Plaintiffs allege that, beginning around April 4, 2025, DHS/ICE terminated hundreds of F‑1 students’ SEVIS records nationwide using a status‑violation code tied to “criminal records check and/or visa revoked,” without school initiation, legal authority, or prior notice, and that some students were detained and transferred far from their schools and communities. Plaintiffs contend visa revocation after admission does not itself terminate F‑1 status or justify SEVIS termination, and that ICE must pursue any removability allegations through immigration court, not by unilateral SEVIS terminations. The court’s early orders preserved the status quo, barred arrests and transfers, and ultimately granted preliminary injunctive relief after Defendants reported reactivation of Plaintiffs’ SEVIS records. Judge Jeffrey S. White presides; Judge Noël Wise issued the initial TRO before reassignment.",
    "46509": "Filing date and forum. The case was filed on April 29, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia as Civil Action No. 25-1305 (RDM).\n\nParties and posture. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), its Board of Directors, and three sitting directors (suing in their official capacities) sued the President, the White House Presidential Personnel Office and its leadership, and the Office of Management and Budget and its director, all in their official capacities. This is not a class action. Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel (Saul Ewing LLP). Defendants appeared through government counsel.\n\nFactual basis. CPB is a private, nonprofit corporation created by Congress in the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (PBA), with statutory safeguards against federal direction, supervision, or control. On April 28, 2025, the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel emailed three of the five sitting CPB directors stating, “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is terminated effective immediately.” The email cited no authority. Plaintiffs allege the Executive Branch lacks power to remove CPB directors and sought court intervention, noting broader concerns about potential executive interference (including a DOGE staffer’s follow-up email proposing to “discuss getting a DOGE team assigned” to CPB and citing contemporaneous events at the U.S. Institute of Peace).\n\nClaims and legal bases. Plaintiffs assert:\n- Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202 (to declare the removal email legally ineffective).\n- Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) (agency action not in accordance with law and in excess of statutory authority).\n- Constitutional claims: separation of powers; violations of the Presentment Clause, the Appropriations Clause, and the Take Care Clause.\n- Statutory foundation: Public Broadcasting Act, principally 47 U.S.C. §§ 396 and 398, which (1) establishes CPB as a private nonprofit, not a federal agency, (2) provides that directors are not officers or employees of the United States, and (3) forbids federal direction, supervision, or control over CPB.\n\nRemedies sought. Plaintiffs seek: (1) a declaratory judgment that the April 28, 2025 removal email is of no legal effect; and (2) injunctive relief barring any steps to give effect to the email or otherwise to interfere with CPB’s governance and operations. They also seek fees and costs.\n\nJudge. U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss presides.\n\nProceedings and rulings.\n- April 29, 2025: Plaintiffs filed the complaint and a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). The court held an emergency conference, set briefing, and scheduled a hearing.\n- May 14, 2025: At the hearing, the parties agreed to treat the TRO as a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n- June 8, 2025: The court denied preliminary injunctive relief without prejudice. Memorandum Opinion and Order, ECF No. 32.\n  • Likelihood of success: On the current record, Plaintiffs had not shown a likelihood of success. The court emphasized the PBA’s incorporation of D.C. nonprofit law “to the extent consistent” with the PBA, and noted D.C. Code § 29-406.08(e) permits the appointing person to remove an appointed director unless the articles or bylaws provide otherwise. At the time of the April 28 email, CPB’s bylaws did not restrict removal; CPB amended its bylaws on May 15, 2025 to require a two‑thirds vote of the other directors to confirm any removal. The court found Plaintiffs’ arguments that PBA § 396(c)(7) (forfeiture for nonattendance) is the exclusive removal mechanism unconvincing, and concluded the PBA’s noninterference provisions did not foreclose application of the D.C. removal rule. The court also noted that federal appointment constraints (Senate advice and consent) and CPB’s bylaw “designated body” mechanism under D.C. Code § 29-406.12 mitigate risks of executive control.\n  • Irreparable harm: Plaintiffs did not show likely irreparable injury. The record did not show imminent takeover or invasion of CPB premises; CPB could continue to operate (the quorum is a majority of directors “in office” and “any vacancy … shall not affect [the Board’s] power,” 47 U.S.C. § 396(c)(6)); and CPB’s bylaws permit a “designated body” to act if the Board falls below the statutory minimum.\n  • Scope: The court denied the preliminary injunction without prejudice to renewal if defendants or those acting with them take steps to interfere with CPB’s independence.\n- June 29, 2025: The court granted a joint motion to expedite summary-judgment briefing (Plaintiffs’ motion due July 25; Defendants’ opposition and cross-motion due Aug. 29; Plaintiffs’ reply/opposition due Sept. 19; Defendants’ reply due Oct. 10).\n- July 24 and Aug. 1, 2025: Two individual director-plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims, leaving CPB, its Board, and one director-plaintiff. Plaintiffs filed their summary-judgment motion on July 25, 2025.\n\nReported opinions. Memorandum Opinion and Order denying preliminary injunction (June 8, 2025), ECF No. 32.\n\nAppeals, trials, settlements, and decrees. No appeals, trials, consent decrees, or settlements are reflected in the record provided. No monitors were appointed.\n\nContext and statutory framework. Congress created CPB as a private nonprofit under the PBA, specifying it is not a federal agency and that its directors are not federal officers or employees. The Act forbids federal direction, supervision, or control over CPB and its grantees and protects editorial independence. The President appoints CPB directors with Senate advice and consent; the PBA is silent on removal except for automatic forfeiture for insufficient attendance. The court’s preliminary ruling applied the D.C. Nonprofit Corporation Act’s default rule allowing the appointing authority to remove appointed directors unless restricted by the organization’s governing documents, and noted CPB later amended its bylaws to require a supermajority board confirmation for any removal. The court also highlighted D.C. law and CPB bylaws provisions allowing a temporary “designated body” to act if the Board falls below the statutory minimum, thereby enabling continued operations.",
    "46590": "Filing date and court. The case was filed on April 7, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, Charleston Division. It is assigned to Judge Irene C. Berger.\n\nParties and posture. A coal miner employed in West Virginia filed suit individually and on behalf of similarly situated coal miners (a putative class) against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Secretary of HHS in his official capacity. The plaintiffs are represented by a mix of private and nonprofit public‑interest counsel. The defendants are represented by government counsel.\n\nFactual background. Black lung (coal workers’ pneumoconiosis) is a progressive, incurable disease caused by mine dust exposure; early detection and limiting further dust exposure can slow or halt progression. Federal law requires HHS to administer the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) and to implement the “Part 90” job‑transfer option: when HHS determines a miner has evidence of pneumoconiosis, the miner may transfer to lower‑dust work without loss of pay. See 30 U.S.C. § 843; 42 C.F.R. Part 37; 30 C.F.R. Part 90. Within HHS, NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division (RHD) in Morgantown, West Virginia, performs these functions, including free screenings, evaluation of radiographs and spirometry, issuing Part 90 letters, certifying B‑Readers, operating a mobile clinic, and approving mine screening plans.\n\nThe named miner was diagnosed with black lung by a local clinic in November 2024 and by the West Virginia Occupational Pneumoconiosis Board in January 2025 (early‑stage disease). He submitted an application and imaging to NIOSH in November 2024; he testified he received no response despite calls. Defendants produced a December 10, 2024 letter stating an October 2023 CT scan did not show findings consistent with black lung. The miner testified he would have submitted additional evidence and sought renewed screening if the program were operating.\n\nOn or about April 1, 2025, HHS issued Reduction in Force (RIF) notices to most RHD employees, placed them on administrative leave, and paused the CWHSP. Approved facilities were told NIOSH could not accept new radiographs, spirometry, or forms and would suspend electronic submission accounts. RHD staff testified they received RIF notices (June/July effective dates), were on leave, had been told their duties were unnecessary or duplicative, and had not been asked to transition work or train replacements. HHS issued press releases describing a broader HHS restructuring but did not identify any plan to continue CWHSP or Part 90 functions elsewhere. Evidence showed CWHSP processed nearly 5,000 radiographs in FY 2024 and that its activities (including B‑Reader certification and the mobile unit) are specialized and not duplicated elsewhere in government. Witnesses emphasized that miners cannot access Part 90 rights without a NIOSH determination and that continued dust exposure accelerates disease.\n\nLegal foundation and claims. The complaint asserts:\n- Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claims to compel unlawfully withheld/unreasonably delayed agency action and to set aside arbitrary and capricious action not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706.\n- A declaratory judgment claim. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202.\n- A Fifth Amendment procedural due process claim, alleging deprivation of statutory health‑screening and transfer benefits without notice or hearing.\nThe statutory framework includes 30 U.S.C. § 843 (mandatory miner examinations and transfer rights); 30 U.S.C. § 811(a)(7), (a)(9) (examination authority; anti‑backsliding); 29 U.S.C. § 671 (establishing NIOSH and its Office of Mine Safety and Health); implementing regulations at 42 C.F.R. Part 37 and 30 C.F.R. Part 90; and appropriation statutes funding NIOSH/CWHSP. Plaintiffs also referenced the Impoundment Control Act, 2 U.S.C. §§ 682–88. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief restoring the RHD/CWHSP and compelling HHS to comply with § 843 and related duties, class certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and fees and costs.\n\nKey motions and proceedings.\n- April 21, 2025: The miner filed an amended complaint and moved for a preliminary injunction. The court set a May 7, 2025 evidentiary hearing.\n- May 1, 2025: Defendants moved to dismiss and to dismiss the jury demand; they also moved to seal exhibits and to quash a subpoena to a NIOSH physician (the subpoena was quashed).\n- May 7, 2025: The court held the preliminary‑injunction hearing, receiving testimony from miners, RHD epidemiologists, and a former RHD/CWHSP coordinator.\n- May 13, 2025: The court granted the preliminary injunction. Mem. Op. & Order, ECF No. 36 (S.D.W. Va. May 13, 2025).\n\nCourt’s preliminary‑injunction ruling. The court found the miner likely to succeed on the merits, would suffer irreparable harm absent relief, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored an injunction.\n- Standing and sovereign immunity. The miner had standing as an active miner with a black lung diagnosis who could not access CWHSP screenings or obtain a NIOSH Part 90 determination; the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity applied. The closure was final agency action with legal consequences for miners. The court rejected defendants’ characterization of the case as a personnel dispute governed exclusively by the Civil Service Reform Act, holding the claims challenge the elimination of statutory services to program beneficiaries.\n- Likelihood of success. The court found the CWHSP/RHD effectively shut down and that HHS provided no plan or reasoned basis to continue the mandated functions; miners cannot access Part 90 protections without NIOSH. The shutdown was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law because it prevented HHS from fulfilling obligations under the Mine Act and implementing regulations. Press releases about restructuring did not undermine finality or justify pausing statutorily mandated services.\n- Irreparable harm and public interest. Ongoing dust exposure causes irreversible progression of disease; cancelling CWHSP/Part 90 would cost lives. The public interest favored enforcing statutory protections; “there is no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”\n- Relief ordered. The court enjoined and rescinded the RIFs in the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division to facilitate full restoration of the RHD, including health surveillance through CWHSP and the Part 90 program. It ordered that, even in any reorganization, there be no pause, stoppage, or gap in services mandated by Congress. The Secretary was required to file written certification of compliance within 20 days. Bond was set at zero. Defendants filed a certification on June 2, 2025.\n\nSubsequent case status. A scheduling order issued on June 17, 2025 set discovery and trial dates, including a trial date of May 4, 2026. On August 14, 2025, the court granted leave for the plaintiff to file a second amended complaint and terminated as moot the defendants’ then‑pending motion to dismiss and motion to dismiss the jury demand. Class certification has not been adjudicated. No appeals are noted in the record provided.\n\nRemedies sought and obtained. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief compelling HHS to operate the CWHSP and Part 90 program consistent with 30 U.S.C. § 843 and the regulations, restoration of RHD staffing sufficient to perform those duties, and class‑wide relief under Rule 23(b)(2). The court entered preliminary injunctive relief requiring full restoration of RHD/CWHSP operations and prohibiting any gap in protections, with compliance certification required; the injunction remains in effect pending further order. No monetary damages are sought.",
    "46605": "On May 17, 2025, a detained Venezuelan asylum applicant filed a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and a class action complaint in the Central District of California against federal executive officials and agencies (the President, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Departments of Homeland Security, Defense, and State, ICE and its officials, and a private facility warden). The detainee is held at the Desert View Annex associated with ICE’s Adelanto Processing Center. He alleges that, after appearing for a scheduled ICE check‑in, he was arrested without prior notice and that, because he is a Venezuelan with tattoos, officials suspected links to Tren de Aragua. He contends he is potentially subject to Proclamation No. 10903 (Mar. 14, 2025), which invoked the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), 50 U.S.C. §§ 21 et seq., to authorize the immediate apprehension and removal of certain Venezuelan nationals. He seeks classwide declaratory and injunctive relief and a writ of habeas corpus, asserting violations of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause (among other constitutional and statutory claims), including a right to advance notice and an opportunity to challenge any AEA removal. Petitioner is represented by private counsel.\n\nOn May 19, 2025, Judge John W. Holcomb (referred to Magistrate Judge Patricia Donahue for preliminary matters) granted in part ex parte applications for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and provisional class certification. Relying on recent Supreme Court guidance that AEA detainees are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge removal in the district of confinement, the court temporarily enjoined the Government from removing the petitioner or any member of a putative class under Proclamation 10903, pending a determination of what notice is due. The TRO applied to a class of “all noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California who were, are, or will be subject to” the Proclamation and its implementation. The court set briefing and a hearing; the TRO was extended through June 2, 2025.\n\nAfter full briefing and argument, on June 2, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction and certified a Rule 23(b)(2) class for limited injunctive purposes. The certified class is: all noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Proclamation, except any noncitizen who filed an individual habeas petition before this action. The court preliminarily enjoined and restrained the Government from (a) removing any class member under the AEA or Proclamation 10903 and (b) transferring any class member out of the district, except to execute a removal order lawfully issued under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The court required a nominal $1 bond. The order permits the Government to release class members from detention and to carry out lawful INA removals.\n\nIn its June 2 order, the court held the petitioner had Article III standing because he faced an imminent risk of Proclamation-based designation and removal despite the Government’s assertion that he was detained under the INA. On the merits, the court concluded the petitioner was unlikely to succeed on his facial challenge to the Proclamation (given the breadth of the AEA and deference to the President’s findings), but was likely to succeed on his Fifth Amendment due process claim that detainees must receive adequate advance notice and an opportunity to seek habeas review before removal under the AEA. The court followed Supreme Court decisions recognizing notice and process rights for AEA detainees, including that more than 24 hours’ notice is required, and reserved the question of the precise amount of notice due for later adjudication.\n\nOn June 14, 2025, after an immigration judge granted the petitioner asylum on June 9, 2025, the petitioner sought ex parte writs of habeas corpus and mandamus (and a permanent injunction) for immediate release. On June 20, 2025, the court denied the ex parte request without prejudice. The court found that the Government’s stated intent to appeal the asylum decision meant the removal proceedings had not concluded and that detention was authorized under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A) pending resolution of the administrative appeal. The court directed the Government to file periodic status reports on the appeal (first due July 10, 2025, and every 30 days thereafter).\n\nThe case remains in the preliminary injunction posture while the court determines the amount of notice and process required before any AEA removal. Additional motions related to class certification and reconsideration were filed in late June and early July 2025. On August 1, 2025, the Government filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit from the June 2, 2025 preliminary injunction and class-certification order.\n\nLegal foundation and remedies:\n- Causes of action: habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and class claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.\n- Statutory/constitutional bases: Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause; AEA, 50 U.S.C. §§ 21 et seq.; INA provisions relevant to detention and removal.\n- Remedies sought: declaratory and injunctive relief (including classwide notice and process before AEA removals), orders restraining removal and transfer, preservation of evidence, notice to counsel, and petitioner’s release via writs. The court has issued a classwide preliminary injunction and required a nominal bond; the release request was denied without prejudice.\n\nClass action:\n- This is a class action on behalf of noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California subject to Proclamation 10903 (with the noted exception). The class was certified under Rule 23(b)(2) for injunctive relief to determine and enforce notice and process requirements before AEA removals.\n\nJudge:\n- U.S. District Judge John W. Holcomb (C.D. Cal.); Magistrate Judge Patricia Donahue handled preliminary matters.\n\nImportant filings and rulings:\n- May 19, 2025: TRO granted in part; provisional class certification for TRO; removal under Proclamation 10903 enjoined.\n- May 30, 2025: TRO extended to June 2, 2025; hearing held.\n- June 2, 2025: Preliminary injunction granted; Rule 23(b)(2) class certified (limited purpose); $1 bond ordered; transfers out of district barred except to execute lawful INA removal; court to determine adequate notice/process in later proceedings.\n- June 20, 2025: Ex parte habeas/mandamus application for petitioner’s release denied without prejudice; status reports on IJ appeal ordered.\n- August 1, 2025: Government appealed the preliminary injunction/class certification to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nReported opinions and related cases:\n- The court relied on Supreme Court decisions recognizing notice rights for AEA detainees and requiring more than 24 hours’ notice and litigation in the district of confinement: Trump v. J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. 1003 (2025) (per curiam); A.A.R.P. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1417281 (S. Ct. May 16, 2025) (per curiam). The court also discussed recent district and circuit decisions interpreting the AEA (e.g., 2025 WL 1163530; 2025 WL 1257450; 2025 WL 1301052; 2025 WL 1378784; 2025 WL 1400402; 2025 WL 1431263), but issued no published opinion in this case.\n\nDecree terms and duration:\n- TRO (May 19–June 2, 2025) and preliminary injunction (entered June 2, 2025) restrain AEA/Proclamation 10903 removals and transfers out of district for the certified class. The preliminary injunction remains in effect until further order while the court adjudicates the notice and process due. A $1 bond was posted.\n\nMonitoring:\n- No monitor appointed. The Government must file recurring status reports on the administrative appeal of the petitioner’s immigration case.\n\nFactual context:\n- The petitioner is a Venezuelan dissident asylum applicant who previously received parole and work authorization. He was arrested at an ICE check-in and detained without prior notice or a warrant and told his detention related to being a Venezuelan with tattoos that could be construed as gang affiliated. He and the class challenge removals under Proclamation 10903 unless sufficient advance notice and an opportunity to seek habeas relief are provided. The court found due process claims likely to succeed and entered classwide preliminary relief to ensure notice and process before any AEA removals while the amount of notice required is determined.",
    "46635": "Filed May 22, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, this case challenges attempts by the President to remove the head of the U.S. Copyright Office and to install an acting Librarian of Congress. The plaintiff is the Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office, suing individually. The defendants are: the person claiming to be acting Librarian of Congress (also serving as Deputy Attorney General), the person claiming to be acting Register of Copyrights (a Justice Department official), the Executive Office of the President, the Director and Deputy Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, and the President in his official capacity. The plaintiff is represented by Democracy Forward Foundation (public-interest counsel) and Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP (private counsel). This is not a class action.\n\nThe complaint alleges that on May 8, 2025, the President removed the sitting Librarian of Congress. Two days later, a White House official emailed the Register that her position was terminated “effective immediately,” and the President amplified a media report of her firing. The next day, the Deputy Attorney General—whom the President had directed to perform the duties of the Librarian—designated a Justice Department official as acting Register and another as acting Deputy Librarian; those officials attempted to assume their posts at the Library of Congress but left after Library staff contacted the U.S. Capitol Police. The Register maintains she remains in office because only the Librarian of Congress may appoint and remove the Register, and, under Library rules, the Principal Deputy Librarian became the acting Librarian upon the Librarian’s removal.\n\nLegal foundation. The plaintiff brings two counts seeking declaratory and injunctive relief: (1) an ultra vires claim that the President’s designation of an acting Librarian of Congress is unauthorized by the Constitution or statute, because the Federal Vacancies Reform Act applies only to “Executive agency” positions and not to the Library of Congress, and (2) a constitutional claim that removing the Register violated the Appointments Clause and separation of powers because Congress vested appointment—and thus removal—of the Register in the Librarian of Congress under 17 U.S.C. § 701(a). She seeks declarations that the Vacancies Reform Act does not authorize an acting Librarian of Congress; that she remains the Register; that the Deputy Attorney General was not lawfully appointed as acting Librarian; and that the Principal Deputy Librarian remains the acting Librarian. She also seeks to enjoin the claimed acting Librarian and claimed acting Register from exercising those offices and to bar interference with her access to the Copyright Office absent action by a lawfully appointed Librarian. Jurisdiction is invoked under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1361, 1651, 2201, and 2202.\n\nJudge. U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly is presiding.\n\nFilings and proceedings. On May 22, 2025, the plaintiff moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO). After briefing and a May 28 hearing, the Court denied the TRO, finding she had not shown irreparable harm. The Court then set an expedited briefing schedule for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff filed her motion on June 10; defendants opposed on June 24; the plaintiff replied on July 1. Following a July 23 hearing, the Court denied the preliminary injunction on July 30, 2025, again concluding the plaintiff failed to establish irreparable harm as required by Winter v. NRDC. The Court held that a temporary loss of a “statutory right to function” in office and the temporary inability to discharge statutory duties do not, without more, constitute the “genuinely extraordinary” irreparable injury required in government-personnel cases under Sampson v. Murray. The Court also held the plaintiff could not rely on alleged harms to the Library of Congress or the Copyright Office to establish her own irreparable harm, and noted there was no showing the Copyright Office would be shuttered or unable to operate during the litigation. See Mem. Op., ECF No. 40 (D.D.C. July 30, 2025). On July 31, 2025, the plaintiff noticed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit (No. 25-5285). She then sought an injunction pending appeal; the Court denied that motion on August 20, 2025, for the same irreparable-harm reasons. See Mem., ECF No. 48 (D.D.C. Aug. 20, 2025). The Court has set a merits schedule for cross-motions for summary judgment (opening September 8, 2025; hearing November 4, 2025). No trial has been held.\n\nContext. The case arises from the President’s removal of the Librarian of Congress and subsequent steps to remove the Register and install interim leadership at the Library and the Copyright Office. The plaintiff contends the Federal Vacancies Reform Act does not authorize an acting Librarian of Congress and that only the Librarian may appoint or remove the Register under 17 U.S.C. § 701(a). The Court’s rulings to date address only preliminary relief; the merits of those statutory and constitutional questions remain pending on summary judgment and on appeal. No cases have been consolidated, no decrees or settlements have been entered, and there is no court-appointed monitor.",
    "45143": "Filing date and parties. The case was filed on April 20, 2023, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming. The plaintiffs are parents of several students in the district; the mother is also a district teacher. They sued the school district’s board of trustees and four district administrators (the superintendent, assistant superintendent/human resources director, director of student services, and a high school principal). The presiding judge is U.S. District Judge Scott W. Skavdahl.\n\nCounsel. The parents are represented by private counsel with local Wyoming counsel and attorneys from the Child & Parental Rights Campaign (admitted pro hac vice). The district and individual administrators are represented by private counsel (Lambdin & Chaney, LLP). This is not a class action.\n\nFactual basis of the case. The parents allege the district adopted and enforced procedures that: (1) require staff to use a student’s preferred/chosen name and pronouns (including those not matching the student’s sex), and (2) direct staff to keep the student’s asserted gender identity and related requests confidential from parents unless the student consents. Plaintiffs point to district guidance titled “SCSD #1 Special Services Non‑Negotiables” (stating staff “must use a student’s preferred/chosen name or pronoun” and “must respect the privacy of all students regarding such choice”) and a districtwide email from the assistant superintendent (stating the district “will honor a student’s request for confidentiality” until the student consents or an individualized assessment rules out particularized concerns of real harm). The parents allege that staff implemented these directives with their minor daughter, used a male name/pronouns for her at school for months without telling them, and, when the mother objected, administrators said the district would follow the student’s wishes and not notify the parents absent the student’s consent. The mother, a teacher, alleges she was told she must use preferred names/pronouns, keep information from parents, and could face discipline if she did not comply, and that her request for a religious accommodation was denied.\n\nLegal foundation and remedies sought. The suit is brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The parents assert violations of:\n- Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process (parental rights to direct the upbringing and medical/mental‑health decision‑making for their children).\n- First Amendment Free Exercise (parents).\n- First Amendment Free Exercise (mother as a public‑school employee).\n- First Amendment Free Speech (mother, alleging compelled speech and compelled deceit).\nThe amended complaint also cites Wyoming parental‑consent statutes (Wyo. Stat. § 14‑1‑101) as context. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, nominal and compensatory damages, and attorney’s fees.\n\nKey filings and rulings.\n- Preliminary injunction (June 30, 2023). Judge Skavdahl granted in part and denied in part the parents’ motion. The court enjoined the district, absent a reasonable concern of physical abuse or harm, from (a) precluding a district employee from responding to a parent’s inquiry about the student’s requested name or pronoun, and (b) requiring an employee to lie to a parent about such a request. The motion was denied in all other respects.\n- Amended complaint (July 20, 2023). Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint; the court denied the then‑pending motion to dismiss as moot without prejudice.\n- Motion to dismiss the amended complaint (Aug. 17, 2023). On December 18, 2023, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion: (a) as to Counts One (parental rights) and Two (parents’ free exercise), plaintiffs could not proceed with declaratory or injunctive relief but could proceed on claims for nominal and compensatory damages; (b) Count Three (mother’s free exercise as employee) survived; and (c) Count Four (mother’s free speech) was dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).\n- Answer and scheduling. Defendants answered on December 29, 2023. The court set discovery and trial deadlines.\n- Summary judgment (April 28, 2025). The court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims, dismissed the father as a plaintiff, and entered final judgment for defendants. All pending motions were denied as moot.\n- Appeal (May 23, 2025). Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (No. 25‑8027). The appeal is pending.\n\nRelief ultimately ordered (injunctive/declaratory/decrees). The only injunctive relief issued was the preliminary injunction of June 30, 2023, limited to prohibiting the district from barring staff from answering parental inquiries about name/pronouns and from requiring staff to lie to parents about a student’s request, absent a reasonable concern of physical abuse or harm. No permanent injunction or decree was entered; final judgment was entered for defendants on summary judgment.\n\nProceedings and trial. The case did not go to trial; it was resolved on summary judgment for defendants. There are no consolidated or related cases noted.\n\nContext—allegations versus rulings. Plaintiffs alleged the district’s directives infringed their parental rights and the mother’s First Amendment rights by facilitating social transition at school without parental notice/consent, compelling speech, and compelling concealment from parents, and by denying the mother a religious accommodation. The court’s preliminary injunction addressed only whether employees could be required to lie or be barred from responding to parental inquiries. On the motion to dismiss, the court limited the forms of relief available on the parents’ parental‑rights and free‑exercise claims to damages only, dismissed the teacher’s free‑speech claim, and allowed the teacher’s free‑exercise claim to proceed. The court later granted summary judgment for defendants on the remaining claims and entered final judgment, which plaintiffs have appealed.",
    "PH-IL-0002": "Filed on May 10, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois (East St. Louis), this case was brought as a putative class action by current and former public housing residents of the Alexander County Housing Authority (the housing authority) challenging alleged race and familial status discrimination and, initially, rent overcharges. The plaintiffs—residents and families from the McBride and Elmwood developments in Cairo, Illinois—were represented by private counsel (Hughes Socol Piers Resnick & Dym, Ltd.) and a legal services nonprofit (Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law). The defendants were the housing authority and several of its leaders, including its then- and former executive directors. Two individual defendants (Thomas Upchurch and Joanne Pink) were later dismissed by stipulation, and the case proceeded against the housing authority and two former executive directors.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged violations of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604 (disparate treatment, disparate impact, and perpetuation of racial segregation; and discrimination based on familial status), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, and the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003, 740 ILCS 23/5. They also alleged a failure to affirmatively further fair housing under 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5) enforceable via 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (against the housing authority). The original complaint additionally asserted a rent overcharge claim under the Brooke Amendment to the U.S. Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1437a, via § 1983, and a state-law breach of lease claim tied to HUD-required lease provisions. By the third amended complaint (filed February 13, 2017), the plaintiffs framed their class allegations for injunctive relief only (race and familial status subclasses) and added individual claims for breach of the residential lease, negligence, and willful and wanton conduct. Across pleadings, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief (including orders to cease discriminatory practices and to take affirmative steps to remedy them), class certification, compensatory and punitive damages (including rent abatement/overcharge repayment in the earlier pleading), prejudgment interest, and attorneys’ fees.\n\nThe factual allegations centered on a long history of racial segregation in the housing authority’s developments. Plaintiffs alleged that nearly all households in McBride and Elmwood were African-American, that the housing authority reserved other developments (such as Connell Smith, Shoemaker, and scattered sites) for seniors/people with disabilities without meeting the Fair Housing Act’s “housing for older persons” requirements, and that this policy disproportionately excluded families with children and African-American families from those properties. They alleged the housing authority failed to maintain McBride and Elmwood—citing pervasive infestations (mice, roaches, bedbugs), mold, broken plumbing/electrical systems, inadequate heat, and security deficiencies—while providing better maintenance and security at developments with more white or older residents. Plaintiffs referenced a September 30, 2014 HUD letter finding intentional racial segregation and resource allocation disparities in violation of Title VI, and noted HUD’s February 2016 administrative takeover of the housing authority’s operations.\n\nChief Judge Michael J. Reagan presided, with discovery and settlement matters handled by Magistrate Judges Philip M. Frazier (initially) and Reona J. Daly (after reassignment). Early on, the Court denied a joint motion to stay while allowing settlement discussions to proceed. The Court entered a protective order. In discovery, Magistrate Judge Daly ordered targeted searches of two former executives’ Yahoo email accounts and an in camera submission of executive session minutes; she later denied the plaintiffs’ request to overcome the housing authority’s assertion of deliberative process privilege as to those minutes. Multiple settlement conferences were convened. Several plaintiffs’ counsel withdrew from representing three individual plaintiffs who did not participate; those three plaintiffs were ordered to advise whether they wished to proceed. Two of them failed to respond and their claims were dismissed for failure to prosecute; the third later failed to appear and was likewise dismissed.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the represented parties filed a stipulation to dismiss the represented plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice, each side to bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. Because not all appearing parties had signed at the time of filing, the Court entered an order on September 12, 2017 dismissing the represented plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice under Rule 41(a)(2) on those same terms, dismissing the remaining pro se plaintiff’s claims for failure to prosecute under Rule 41(b), and directing the Clerk to close the case. No class was certified, no trial was held, and there were no appeals or reported opinions. The record does not contain settlement terms beyond the dismissal with prejudice and agreement that each party would bear its own fees and costs, and the Court did not retain jurisdiction to enforce any settlement. The case was closed on September 12, 2017.",
    "16518": "On April 14, 2022, the United States filed a civil action in the District of South Carolina against the state juvenile justice department over conditions at its long‑term juvenile commitment facility, the Broad River Road Complex in Columbia. The United States alleged a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives confined youth of federal rights, in violation of 34 U.S.C. § 12601, grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The United States sought declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe suit followed a multi‑year federal investigation. In a February 5, 2020 findings report, the Department of Justice concluded there was reasonable cause to believe BRRC failed to keep youth reasonably safe from youth‑on‑youth violence and used prolonged, punitive isolation, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Contributing factors included inadequate staffing and supervision, insufficient training and behavior management tools, serious safety blind spots and weak surveillance coverage, and physical plant design that impeded supervision. DOJ documented frequent fights and assaults with injuries; extensive use of isolation for non‑dangerous behaviors (e.g., profanity, “disrespect,” being “out of place”); lengthy isolation in small, dark 8-by‑8 cells for 23 hours a day without meaningful schooling or programs; and deterioration in mental health and self‑harm while in isolation. DOJ also noted that its ADA inquiry into secure evaluation centers did not reveal a violation. A prior federal case in the 1990s had resulted in injunctive relief to remedy unconstitutional juvenile conditions statewide, but concerns reemerged at BRRC in recent years.\n\nIn a second report dated April 14, 2022, DOJ found a pattern of unreasonable force by staff. Examples included choking, punching, kicking, twisting arms, dragging youth in restraints, applying body weight to prone youth, and restraining youth for verbal non‑compliance. Some incidents occurred off camera and went unreported by staff. DOJ found investigations were inadequately initiated, delayed, hampered by short video‑retention and blind spots, and too often declined in the absence of a formal complaint, leading to undercounting of excessive‑force events.\n\nSimultaneous with filing the complaint, the parties executed a comprehensive Settlement Agreement dated April 13, 2022. The agreement requires the juvenile justice department to:\n- Protection from harm: conduct an independent staffing study within nine months and implement recommended staffing pattern changes within 18 months of receiving the study; expand surveillance to cover blind spots on a DOJ‑approved timeline and retain video long enough for investigations and oversight; provide structured rehabilitative programming after school and on weekends; implement a positive behavior management system with incentives and de‑escalation strategies; and revise and implement a use‑of‑force policy that limits force and restraints to imminent, serious danger, requires exhaustion of lesser interventions, mandates prompt medical evaluation, complete reporting, and swift supervisory review and corrective action.\n- Investigations: adopt policies within nine months (implemented within 18 months) mandating initial reviews of all force, youth‑on‑youth harm, and isolation incidents; full, timely investigations (generally within ten business days) of specified incidents by trained, uninvolved investigators; early video preservation; continuation of investigations even if a youth declines to pursue charges; and appropriate corrective discipline.\n- Isolation: revise policies within nine months (implemented within 18 months) to bar isolation for punishment, retaliation, protective custody, suicide intervention, or as temporary housing; allow isolation only when the youth poses a serious and immediate danger and lesser measures have failed; require leadership approval to extend isolation beyond four hours, daily in‑person mental‑health and leadership reviews for any extension, and multidisciplinary team reviews within 48 hours and at least every three days thereafter; stop using the Laurel Building for isolation per a DOJ‑approved plan; ensure humane conditions and timely, meaningful education in isolation; screen and house vulnerable youth appropriately with equal access to services; ensure suicidal youth are not placed in isolation; and coordinate with the state mental health department to expedite transfers of youth with serious mental illness or suicidal youth to appropriate treatment placements.\n- Training and quality assurance: develop competency‑based training on behavior management, de‑escalation, and the revised use‑of‑force and investigation policies; retrain and, if necessary, discipline staff for failures; and build a quality‑assurance system within 24 months to track key safety and isolation metrics monthly, review samples of incidents and investigations, and operate a Quality Improvement Committee to identify trends and corrective actions.\n\nImplementation and monitoring provisions include appointment (within 60 days) of a jointly selected Subject Matter Expert to provide technical assistance and assess compliance, with semiannual public compliance reports and a defined budget; designation of a Director of Settlement Compliance within the agency (Wendy Leach); DOJ‑approved annual Implementation Plans; and monthly and quarterly/sem iannual meetings between the parties. The parties stipulated the relief complies with the Prison Litigation Reform Act.\n\nProceedings and court rulings: The case was assigned to Judge Mary Geiger Lewis. On April 20, 2022, the court granted the parties’ joint motion and dismissed the action without prejudice, retaining jurisdiction to reinstate the case upon a DOJ motion alleging a material breach of the Agreement. There were no trials or appeals and no reported opinions.\n\nSettlement duration and enforcement: The agency must implement all provisions within four years. The Agreement may terminate after five years if the parties agree the agency has attained substantial compliance with all provisions and maintained it for one year, or upon a court finding of durable constitutional compliance. The United States may seek to restore the case to the active docket to address material breaches, and the court retains jurisdiction to resolve disputes. Counsel: The United States was represented by the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of South Carolina; the state juvenile justice department was represented by private counsel. The plaintiffs are not a class; the case was brought by the United States pursuant to statute.\n\nFactual basis: DOJ documented frequent youth‑on‑youth assaults and injuries, staff use of excessive and disproportionate force, inadequate staffing and training, blind spots and poor video retention impeding supervision and investigations, punitive and prolonged isolation in harsh conditions with minimal services, and worsening mental health and self‑harm among youth subjected to isolation. The Agreement addresses these conditions with mandated reforms, training, monitoring, and timelines.",
    "46815": "Filing date and parties. The case began with a sealed federal indictment filed on May 21, 2025, later unsealed, charging a noncitizen resident of Maryland with two counts arising from alleged human smuggling. The federal government is the prosecuting party; the accused is an individual defendant (not a class). The defense was initially represented by the Federal Public Defender and later by private counsel; the government is represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nCharges and legal basis. The grand jury charged one count of conspiracy to unlawfully transport noncitizens for financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v) and (B)(i), and one count of unlawful transportation of noncitizens for financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) and (B)(i). The second count stems from a November 30, 2022 Tennessee Highway Patrol traffic stop. The case’s pretrial release issues are governed by the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3142. On June 6, 2025, the court issued a Due Process Protections Act order reminding the government of its disclosure obligations under Brady v. Maryland.\n\nJudges. Key rulings were issued by Magistrate Judge Barbara D. Holmes and District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. An earlier sealing order was issued by Magistrate Judge Alistair Newbern.\n\nProcedural history and key filings. After the indictment, an arrest warrant issued and the accused was arrested in Nashville on June 6, 2025. At the initial appearance that day, the government moved for pretrial detention. Arraignment and a detention hearing were held June 13, 2025, with testimony from a Homeland Security Investigations agent and exhibits including body camera footage from the November 2022 stop, a passenger roster, and protective order records. On June 22, 2025, the Magistrate Judge denied the motion for detention, finding the government had not established grounds to hold a detention hearing under § 3142(f)—specifically, that the case (i) did not “involve a minor victim” within § 3142(f)(1)(E) based on the evidentiary record presented, (ii) did not present a “serious risk” of flight within § 3142(f)(2)(A), and (iii) did not present a “serious risk” of obstruction or intimidation within § 3142(f)(2)(B). The Magistrate Judge further found that, even if a hearing were authorized, conditions could reasonably assure appearance and community safety under § 3142(g). The Magistrate Judge set a hearing to review release conditions.\n\nGovernment review and stay requests. The government appealed the release ruling under 18 U.S.C. § 3145 and sought a stay. On June 25, 2025, the District Judge denied the government’s motion to stay and set an evidentiary hearing on the government’s appeal. After a de novo evidentiary hearing on July 16, 2025—where the government supplemented with phone records, vehicle registration, and a CAST analysis—the District Judge on July 23, 2025 denied the government’s motion to revoke the release order. The District Judge held the government had shown it was entitled to a detention hearing under § 3142(f)(1)(E) because, applying the Second Circuit’s approach to the term “involves,” the charged conduct more likely than not involved minor victims, but nonetheless concluded that the government had not shown by clear and convincing evidence that no combination of conditions could reasonably assure community safety or, by a preponderance, the defendant’s appearance. The matter was remanded for entry of conditions.\n\nRelease and conditions. On August 22, 2025, the Magistrate Judge issued an order for pretrial release on conditions (after canceling a set hearing based on the parties’ filings). The release order provides for standard and additional conditions; the record reflects contemplated restrictions that include supervision by Pretrial Services, travel limitations, prohibition on firearms, and no-contact provisions tailored to the case. A joint protective order governing discovery was entered on July 8, 2025.\n\nContext and factual basis. The government alleges a transportation-based smuggling scheme in which undocumented persons were moved from Texas to other states for money, with the November 30, 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee featuring nine passengers as a focal event. The government presented evidence including body camera footage, a passenger roster (which it argued showed a minor), phone records linking the driver to an organizer, and agent testimony recounting statements by cooperators about the presence of minors and other alleged conduct. The Magistrate Judge questioned the reliability and weight of several hearsay layers and exhibits, particularly as to the alleged minor on November 30, 2022 and other assertions (such as firearms and drug transport), and found no § 3142(f) gateway was proven. The District Judge later concluded the government had carried its lighter burden to obtain a detention hearing on the “minor victim” ground but agreed with the Magistrate Judge that the § 3142(g) factors supported release on conditions.\n\nImmigration-custody backdrop. The courts noted the accused’s concurrent immigration issues, including an ICE detainer and prior removal to El Salvador; related cases directed the federal government to facilitate the accused’s return to the United States. The Magistrate Judge found the ICE detainer undermined the government’s “serious risk of flight” argument under § 3142(f)(2)(A), and both courts emphasized that the Bail Reform Act’s individualized analysis applies regardless of immigration status.\n\nRelated cases. The bail opinions referenced federal litigation concerning the accused’s return from El Salvador: district court and Fourth Circuit orders declining to stay an order requiring facilitation of return (2025 WL 1024654; amended, 2025 WL 1085601; further opinion, 2025 WL 1014261; and 2025 WL 1021113), and a Supreme Court decision describing the return order and circumstances (145 S. Ct. 1017 (2025)).\n\nScheduling and subsequent motions. A jury trial is set for January 27, 2026, with interim status conferences and a pretrial conference scheduled; the defendant waived Speedy Trial on August 7, 2025. On August 19, 2025, the defense moved to dismiss for vindictive and selective prosecution; briefing was extended, with the government’s response due September 15, 2025 and an optional reply due September 22, 2025. The court also issued guidance on compliance with local rules governing extrajudicial statements to ensure a fair trial.\n\nRemedies sought and outcomes. The government sought pretrial detention and later a stay and revocation of the release order; those requests were denied. The current remedy in effect is pretrial release on conditions supervised by Pretrial Services.\n\nBrady/Due Process. On June 6, 2025, the court issued a Due Process Protections Act order directing timely disclosure of exculpatory and impeachment evidence in accordance with Brady v. Maryland and warning of potential sanctions for noncompliance.",
    "46755": "On July 1, 2025, three city governments (Columbus, Baltimore, and Chicago), a nationwide association of physicians and trainees, and a national small‑business network filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland challenging the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) over a final regulation titled “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability,” 90 Fed. Reg. 27,074 (June 25, 2025). The federal health department and its leadership (HHS, CMS, the HHS Secretary, and CMS Administrator) promulgated the rule with an August 25, 2025 effective date. Plaintiffs are represented by the Democracy Forward Foundation (public‑interest nonprofit counsel).\n\nThe suit proceeds under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., alleging several provisions of the rule are contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious. Plaintiffs contend the rule conflicts with and undermines the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including the guaranteed‑issue and renewability requirements (42 U.S.C. §§ 300gg‑1, 300gg‑2), the premium‑tax‑credit scheme (26 U.S.C. § 36B; 42 U.S.C. §§ 18081, 18082), and ACA § 1554’s bar on unreasonable barriers to care (42 U.S.C. § 18114). They seek declaratory relief, vacatur, a stay of the effective date under APA § 705, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and fees.\n\nFactual context: Plaintiffs assert the rule will raise net premiums and out‑of‑pocket limits, erode plan value, add documentation hurdles, and narrow eligibility, causing widespread loss of ACA marketplace coverage (CMS and CBO estimates noted up to 1.8 million in 2026) and shifting uncompensated care costs to safety‑net providers and municipalities. Challenged elements include: a $5 monthly charge for auto‑reenrolled zero‑premium enrollees pending eligibility reconfirmation; a new premium‑nonpayment policy allowing issuers to refuse new coverage until past‑due premiums are paid; restoration of a one‑year “failure‑to‑reconcile” tax rule cutting off APTCs; expansion of pre‑enrollment verification for special enrollment periods (SEPs); revised data‑matching/income‑verification rules (including removal of a 60‑day extension and rejection of self‑attestation when no IRS data); broader “de minimis” ranges for actuarial value; and a permanent change to the premium‑adjustment‑percentage methodology that incorporates individual‑market data. Plaintiffs later narrowed their immediate request and did not seek a stay of the low‑income SEP elimination in light of subsequent legislation.\n\nProcedural history and rulings: Plaintiffs moved on July 2, 2025 for a § 705 stay or, alternatively, a preliminary injunction. After briefing and an August 14, 2025 hearing, Judge Brendan A. Hurson issued a memorandum opinion on August 22, 2025, granting in part and denying in part a stay under § 705 and finding standing for the small‑business association (through a member facing premium‑driven business closure) and for the city governments (predictable uncompensated‑care costs). The court found irreparable harm (no monetary remedy under the APA; imminent market effects before open enrollment) and that the balance of equities and public interest favored relief.\n\nLikelihood of success and stayed provisions: The court concluded Plaintiffs showed a strong likelihood of success on seven provisions. It stayed their effective dates pending final judgment:\n- $5 “junk fee” on auto‑reenrolled zero‑premium enrollees (contrary to law; HHS lacks authority to alter the statutory APTC formula).\n- Revocation of guaranteed issue for applicants with past‑due premiums (contrary to the ACA’s guaranteed‑issue mandate, which does not include this exception).\n- One‑year “failure‑to‑reconcile” (FTR) bar on APTCs (contrary to law; cannot add a reconciliation condition to statutory credit eligibility; the agency’s reopening of the issue allowed review).\n- Expansion of pre‑enrollment eligibility verification to at least 75% of SEP enrollments on the federal platform (arbitrary and capricious; mismatch between asserted fraud concerns and evidence; undue enrollment barriers).\n- Mandatory income verification when an attested income (100–400% FPL) exceeds IRS data showing below 100% FPL (arbitrary and capricious; reliance on flawed studies; inadequate response to comments).\n- Expansion of “de minimis” actuarial value ranges (arbitrary and capricious; conclusory reasoning and consideration of improper factors without evidentiary support).\n- Elimination of self‑attestation when IRS tax data are unavailable (arbitrary and capricious; unsupported assumptions, insufficient explanation of burdens versus program‑integrity gains).\n\nProvisions not stayed: The court declined to stay two items, finding Plaintiffs had not shown a likelihood of success: (1) the change to the premium‑adjustment‑percentage methodology (reasoned policy shift aligned with statute despite cost impacts), and (2) removal of the automatic 60‑day extension to resolve income inconsistencies (Plaintiffs unlikely to show the agency exceeded its authority).\n\nRelief and scope: By order dated August 25, 2025, the court clarified and enumerated the stayed provisions. It issued a § 705 stay of their effective dates “pending a final ruling on the merits,” declined to require a bond, and explained the APA permits postponing an agency rule’s effective date; the stay was not limited to the named Plaintiffs. No trial has occurred and no appeal is noted. The principal reported decision is the court’s Memorandum Opinion (Aug. 22, 2025) (ECF 35). The court referenced, among other authorities, City of Columbus v. Cochran, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731 (D. Md. 2021), which vacated a similar income‑verification policy, and Loper Bright, which guides courts’ independent review of agency statutory interpretations.\n\nRelated matters: The case is not consolidated with others. Plaintiffs abandoned their request to stay the rule’s elimination of a monthly SEP for certain low‑income consumers after intervening legislation. The stay of seven provisions remains in effect pending final judgment.",
    "46576": "On April 10, 2025, sixteen states, the District of Columbia, and the Governor of Pennsylvania (in his official capacity) sued the U.S. Department of Education and the Secretary of Education in the Southern District of New York (Judge Edgardo Ramos). The states—represented by their Attorneys General (public counsel)—challenge, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Department’s sudden rescission of previously granted extensions of time to liquidate Education Stabilization Fund grants made under COVID‑19 relief laws, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2020 (CRRSA). The Department is represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nBackground. During the pandemic, Congress appropriated substantial K‑12 funds through the Education Stabilization Fund, including ESSER (elementary/secondary), HCY (homeless children and youth), and EANS (nonpublic schools). Statutes required obligations by specified dates (extended one year by GEPA’s “Tydings” provision). Regulations allowed liquidation within 120 days after the period of performance, and authorized the Department to extend liquidation “when justified.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.344(c). In 2023–2025, after inviting applications, the Department approved states’ requests for late liquidation, commonly through March 28, 2026 (ARP programs) and to March 31, 2025 (some CRRSA awards). States and their school districts obligated funds by the statutory deadlines and relied on the extensions to continue projects such as tutoring, mental‑health services, and HVAC and facility upgrades.\n\nAgency action. On March 28, 2025, at 5:03 p.m. ET, the Department emailed a letter from the Secretary rescinding those extensions effective 5:00 p.m. that same day and declaring the liquidation periods expired. The letter asserted that extending COVID‑related grants years after the pandemic’s end was inconsistent with Department priorities and that any reliance interests were minimal and unreasonable. On April 3, 2025, and again on May 11, 2025, the Department issued “Dear Colleague” letters announcing a new, project‑specific extension process and stating that any previously extended liquidation periods would terminate on May 25, 2025, while providing a 14‑day wind‑down. The May 11 letter characterized the earlier approvals as unprecedented and inadequately justified and stated that no valid reliance interests existed.\n\nClaims and relief. The states assert APA violations, alleging the rescission was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law: it reversed prior approvals without a reasoned explanation, failed to consider substantial reliance interests, misapplied the extension criteria, and treated grant availability as tied to the public health emergency despite statute allowing post‑emergency use. They seek declaratory relief, vacatur of the rescission, reinstatement of the extensions through March 28, 2026, and injunctive relief. No damages are sought.\n\nProceedings and rulings. On April 11, 2025, the states moved for a preliminary injunction. After argument, on May 6, 2025, Judge Ramos preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the March 28 rescission and required at least 14 days’ advance notice before modifying previously approved liquidation periods; he also directed the Department to notify personnel and file a status report. The Department then issued the May 11 letter. The states sought emergency relief; on May 20, 2025, the court issued a TRO enjoining the May 11 letter and set a June 3 hearing. On June 3, 2025, the court entered a second preliminary injunction (bond: $1,000): (1) enjoining enforcement of the March 28 and May 11 letters; (2) prohibiting any attempt to modify the previously approved liquidation periods without at least 30 days’ notice; and (3) directing the Department to process outstanding and future liquidation requests without delay and to file a status report listing pending requests and processing timelines.\n\nAppeal. The government noticed an interlocutory appeal (2d Cir. No. 25‑1424) and sought an immediate administrative stay and a stay pending appeal. On June 10, 2025, the Second Circuit denied an administrative stay and expedited the motion. On June 20, 2025, a motions panel denied a stay pending appeal. The panel concluded the district court likely had jurisdiction under the APA (analogizing to Bowen v. Massachusetts) rather than the Tucker Act, and that the states had shown a likelihood of success on their APA claims because the Department’s blanket rescission lacked a reasoned explanation and failed to consider reliance interests. The panel also found no showing of irreparable harm to the government and substantial injury to the states without relief; one judge dissented, favoring a stay. On August 11, 2025, the Second Circuit issued a mandate noting the parties’ stipulation withdrawing the appeal (FRAP 42). The district court later required the Department to continue status reporting; the Department has obtained extensions of time to answer, with the case proceeding on the merits.\n\nContext and factual basis. The complaint details state‑level reliance on the extensions for ongoing, obligated projects, including tutoring and academic recovery services, mental‑health supports, homeless student services, and facility/HVAC projects. The states alleged immediate harms from the rescission, such as contractor layoffs, program shutdowns, and budget gaps, and asserted that Congress did not tie ESF availability to the duration of the public health emergency. The Department’s May 11 letter cited the end of the pandemic, concern that funds were being used less directly for student academic services, and a need for individualized review; it asserted no valid reliance interests existed but provided a brief wind‑down and a case‑by‑case extension process.\n\nKey legal foundation.\n- Cause of action: APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706 (arbitrary and capricious; contrary to law).\n- Statutory/regulatory context: ARP and CRRSA appropriations; GEPA § 421 (Tydings); 2 C.F.R. § 200.344(c) (late liquidation authority).\n- Remedy sought: declaratory judgment, vacatur, reinstatement of extensions through March 28, 2026, and injunctive relief.\n\nJudge: District Judge Edgardo Ramos; Magistrate Judge Barbara C. Moses.\n\nDecrees (preliminary injunctions).\n- May 6, 2025: Enjoined the March 28 rescission; required 14‑day notice before any modification; Department to notify personnel and file a status report.\n- June 3, 2025: Enjoined the March 28 and May 11 letters; barred modifications without 30‑day notice; ordered processing of liquidation requests without delay and a status report; $1,000 security; operative during the litigation.\n\nAppeals: Second Circuit stay pending appeal denied June 20, 2025; appeal withdrawn August 11, 2025.\n\nCounsel type: Plaintiffs by state Attorneys General; defendants by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Southern District of New York.\n\nCurrent posture: The preliminary injunction remains in place; the Department is processing liquidation requests under the injunction and filing status reports; defendants’ time to answer has been extended, and the case continues on the merits in the district court.",
    "46637": "On May 27, 2025, National Public Radio, Inc. and three Colorado public radio stations (Roaring Fork Public Radio d/b/a Aspen Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio, and KUTE, Inc. d/b/a KSUT Public Radio) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging Executive Order 14290, “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,” issued by the President on May 1, 2025. The suit names as defendants the President (official capacity), the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts (substituted as Acting Chair Mary Anne Carter), OMB, the Department of the Treasury, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (named solely to obtain complete relief). The case is before Judge Randolph D. Moss. Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel (Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Zansberg Beylkin LLC), with NPR also represented by in‑house counsel; the Federal Defendants are represented by the Department of Justice.\n\nThe case concerns Congress’s Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) as a private, nonprofit entity to distribute federal funds for public broadcasting while insulating programming and CPB from government “direction, supervision, or control.” See 47 U.S.C. §§ 396, 398. By statute, CPB allocates most radio funds to local stations via Community Service Grants under neutral eligibility criteria (47 U.S.C. § 396(k)(6)(B)) and administers a separate Satellite Interconnection Fund to support national interconnection systems such as the Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS) (47 U.S.C. § 396(k)(10)). NPR manages and operates the PRSS as the national entity designated by interconnected public radio stations. Congress appropriated CPB general funding for FY 2025–2027 and interconnection funds for FY 2025 in recent appropriations laws. Separately, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) awards arts grants based on “artistic excellence and artistic merit,” considering “decency and respect.” 20 U.S.C. § 954(d)(1).\n\nPlaintiffs allege the Executive Order directs CPB and all federal agencies to cease direct and indirect funding of NPR and PBS, to require CPB to prohibit local stations from using CPB funds to acquire NPR/PBS programming, and to revise CPB grant criteria accordingly. They contend the Order was issued to punish and deter NPR’s speech the Administration deems “biased,” citing the Order’s text and accompanying White House “Fact Sheet” and press release. Plaintiffs also recount prior public statements by the President criticizing NPR/PBS and an April 28, 2025 attempt to remove three CPB board members, which led CPB and others to file related litigation (Corporation for Public Broadcasting v. Trump, No. 25‑cv‑1305 (D.D.C.)). After the Order, NEA terminated an NPR grant the next day; Federal Defendants respond that NEA had two NPR grants that were fully paid in February 2025 and scheduled to expire May 31, 2025, and that termination effective May 31 did not withhold funds. Plaintiffs assert the Order chills their speech and interferes with member stations’ editorial choices and association with NPR. They also note subsequent developments, including CPB issuing a July 14, 2025 request for proposals seeking a new entity to manage and govern public radio content distribution and a quo warranto action filed by the government to oust CPB board members the President had purported to remove. Plaintiffs further represent that Congress later enacted a rescission of CPB appropriations for FY 2026 and FY 2027 at the President’s request.\n\nClaims and legal basis. Plaintiffs bring constitutional and statutory claims, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and vacatur of any agency actions implementing the Order:\n- Cause of action and remedies: Equitable claims to enjoin unconstitutional and ultra vires actions by federal officials; Administrative Procedure Act (APA) review of any final agency actions implementing the Order (e.g., NEA terminations). Relief sought includes declaratory judgment that the Order and implementing actions are unlawful; preliminary and permanent injunctions barring implementation (with plaintiffs’ motion seeking an injunction against all defendants except the President); and vacatur of any final agency actions implementing the Order; plus fees and costs.\n- Constitutional claims: First Amendment retaliation (punishment for protected speech), viewpoint-based discrimination (conditioning/denying public funding because of viewpoint), and infringement of freedom of expressive association (pressuring stations not to affiliate with or license NPR content). Plaintiffs also assert Fifth Amendment due process violations (deprivation of statutory entitlements and eligibility without notice and opportunity to be heard; and vagueness because the Order turns on “fair” or “unbiased” content).\n- Statutory and separation-of-powers claims: Ultra vires actions contrary to the Public Broadcasting Act, including the non-interference mandate (47 U.S.C. § 398(a)), CPB’s funding criteria and required allocations (47 U.S.C. § 396(k)(6)(B), (k)(3)), and mandatory PRSS interconnection funding to the designated national entity (47 U.S.C. § 396(k)(10)(D)(i)); violation of the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act’s grant criteria (20 U.S.C. § 954(d)(1)); violation of appropriations laws and the Spending Clause by directing agencies to withhold duly appropriated funds; and separation-of-powers concerns.\n\nFederal Defendants oppose on jurisdictional and merits grounds. They argue the case is unripe and there is no final agency action: CPB disputes presidential control and has not terminated funding; Treasury has not withheld CPB funds; NEA’s two NPR grants were fully paid before the Order and terminated effective their original expiration date; and there is no current Article III injury. They contend the President is not subject to APA review and that neither APA nor nonstatutory ultra vires review applies absent final agency action. On the merits, they assert that when government acts as a patron rather than regulator it may choose not to subsidize speech (citing Rust v. Sullivan, Agency for Int’l Development v. AOSI, NEA v. Finley, Ysursa v. Pocatello), that denial of funding is not First Amendment retaliation or viewpoint discrimination in this context, and that the Order does not infringe association rights because entities remain free to associate using non-federal funds. They also argue plaintiffs lack any cognizable property interest in grants or continued eligibility and that void-for-vagueness doctrine does not apply to funding choices. Statutorily, they argue the Order must be implemented “to the maximum extent allowed by law” and “consistent with applicable law,” that the PBA’s interconnection provision permits distribution to stations or a designated national entity, that NEA may consider the President’s policy direction within its statutory standards, and that appropriations to CPB are lump-sum without line-item mandates.\n\nPlaintiffs moved for summary judgment on June 13, 2025, seeking a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction against implementation of the Order. The Court entered an expedited briefing schedule. Multiple amici supported plaintiffs, including a coalition of states, the ACLU, and press organizations; the Court granted leave to file their briefs. Federal Defendants cross-moved for summary judgment on July 12, 2025. Plaintiffs filed a combined opposition and reply on July 25, 2025. CPB answered the complaint on July 31, 2025. No merits ruling has issued, and there are no reported opinions in this case to date.\n\nContext and factual basis. Plaintiffs assert the Order was issued to punish and deter NPR’s reporting and programming the Administration deems “biased,” noting the Order’s text and White House materials criticizing specific NPR/PBS content and the President’s public calls to “defund” NPR and PBS. They allege the Order unlawfully directs CPB to stop funding NPR and to bar local public stations from using CPB grants to acquire NPR programming, compels revision of CPB grant criteria, and instructs federal agencies to terminate direct or indirect NPR/PBS funding. Plaintiffs contend this contravenes Congress’s design in the Public Broadcasting Act to fund private, editorially independent public media, and that cutting off CPB support and station payments would harm NPR’s operations (including PRSS management and emergency alerting) and local stations’ ability to deliver national programming, while chilling speech and association. Federal Defendants dispute ripeness and injury, emphasize that CPB has not implemented the Order, that Treasury has continued funding CPB, and that NEA’s terminations did not claw back funds; they argue the Order lawfully aligns federal subsidies with policy priorities without regulating private speech. Related litigation over CPB board removals (Corporation for Public Broadcasting v. Trump, No. 25‑cv‑1305) and subsequent government actions regarding CPB’s governance are referenced as context.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory and permanent injunctive relief against implementation of the Executive Order, a declaration that NEA and CPB may not withhold funding on the basis of the Order, and vacatur of any agency action implementing it. A hearing on summary judgment was requested after briefing concluded on August 8, 2025. No trial has been set, and there have been no appeals.",
    "46340": "On April 3, 2025, six national labor unions representing federal employees sued in the Northern District of California to stop enforcement of a March 27, 2025 executive order entitled “Exclusions from Federal Labor‑Management Relations Programs” (Executive Order 14251). The plaintiffs are national unions for federal workers; the defendants are the President, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and its acting director, and numerous federal departments and agencies and their heads (including State, Defense, Treasury, Veterans Affairs, Justice, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Interior, Energy, Agriculture, EPA, NSF, the International Trade Commission, GSA, Social Security, Labor, HUD, Transportation, and Education). Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel and union counsel.\n\nThe suit is not a class action. Plaintiffs bring federal‑question claims seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. They allege: (1) First Amendment retaliation and viewpoint discrimination; (2) ultra vires action exceeding the limits of 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) (part of the Federal Service Labor‑Management Relations Statute in Chapter 71 of Title 5) and violating separation of powers; (3) Fifth Amendment procedural due process violations in abrogating contractual rights without notice and opportunity to respond; (4) Fifth Amendment deprivation of property rights in federal collective bargaining agreements; and (5) Fifth Amendment equal protection (arbitrary and irrational classifications). They seek to enjoin the Executive Order and OPM guidance, prevent termination of collective bargaining agreements and grievance/arbitration processes, maintain dues deductions under 5 U.S.C. § 7115, stop further exclusions (including by Transportation), and bar agencies from proposing additional exclusions.\n\nPlaintiffs assert that EO 14251 invoked 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) to exclude more than 40 departments, agencies, and subdivisions from Chapter 71 on national security grounds, and that an accompanying White House Fact Sheet targeted “hostile Federal unions” that had “declared war on President Trump’s agenda.” Plaintiffs also cite OPM’s March 27, 2025 memorandum directing covered agencies to cease bargaining, end grievance/arbitration participation, terminate dues allotments, reclaim union space and official time, and disregard contractual RIF provisions. Although OPM later issued FAQs telling agencies not to terminate CBAs pending litigation, plaintiffs provided evidence that some agencies began terminating CBAs and other rights, and that unions suffered severe dues losses and loss of representational capacity, which they say chills their protected speech.\n\nKey filings and rulings:\n- April 7, 2025: Plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and order to show cause for a preliminary injunction. The Court denied ex parte TRO relief but treated the motion as a preliminary‑injunction request and set briefing. Amici (former senior national security officials and advisors and the Bar Association of the District of Columbia) were allowed to file.\n- June 24, 2025: Judge James Donato granted a preliminary injunction enjoining implementation of Section 2 of EO 14251 against plaintiffs and their members, and required a $60,000 bond ($10,000 per plaintiff). American Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL‑CIO v. Trump, 2025 WL 1755442 (N.D. Cal. June 24, 2025). The Court rejected the government’s argument that the Federal Labor Relations Authority had exclusive jurisdiction because the Order excluded the agencies from Chapter 71. On the merits, the Court found serious questions on the First Amendment claim based on the White House Fact Sheet’s statements about “hostile” unions and the scope of the exclusions, concluded plaintiffs showed likely irreparable harm (loss of dues, collective bargaining and grievance rights, office space, official time, and chilled speech), and held the balance of hardships and public interest favored preserving the status quo. The injunction was limited to Section 2 (domestic agency exclusions) and did not cover the Order’s separate foreign service exclusions.\n- July 8, 2025: The district court denied the government’s motion to stay the injunction pending appeal.\n- Appeal: Defendants noticed an appeal on June 26, 2025 (Ninth Circuit No. 25‑4014). The Ninth Circuit granted an administrative stay on July 10, 2025, and on August 1, 2025, granted a stay pending appeal (per curiam; Judges Owens, Bade, and Bress). The panel concluded the government made a strong showing of likely success on the First Amendment retaliation claim under the Mt. Healthy defense (that the same action would have been taken absent protected conduct), found irreparable harm from tying the government’s hands in the national security context, and held the equities and public interest favored a stay. Order, No. 25‑4014 (9th Cir. Aug. 1, 2025) (published). The stay leaves the preliminary injunction suspended pending appeal.\n\nJudge:\n- District Judge: James Donato (N.D. Cal.).\n\nLegal foundation and context:\n- Statutory framework: The Federal Service Labor‑Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), 5 U.S.C. §§ 7101–7135 (Chapter 71), guarantees federal employees the right to organize and bargain, with limits and management rights. Section 7103(b)(1) allows the President to exclude agencies or subdivisions upon specific national security determinations.\n- Executive action at issue: EO 14251 (Mar. 27, 2025) excluded entire departments and numerous agencies or subdivisions from Chapter 71; OPM guidance directed immediate cessation of bargaining and related practices; a White House Fact Sheet criticized “hostile Federal unions.” Plaintiffs allege retaliatory motive, due process violations, and ultra vires overreach. Defendants maintain the Order rests on national security assessments authorized by § 7103(b)(1).\n\nRelated cases (not consolidated):\n- The government filed suit the same night in the Western District of Texas (Waco) against several local unions to declare that CBAs may be terminated under the Order.\n- Other challenges to EO 14251 proceeded in the District of Columbia; the D.C. Circuit stayed two preliminary injunctions in related cases. The district court here took judicial notice of those proceedings but ruled independently.\n\nCurrent status:\n- No trial has occurred. The district court’s preliminary injunction (enjoining Section 2 of EO 14251 as to plaintiffs and their members) is stayed by the Ninth Circuit pending appeal. The district court vacated near‑term case management dates in light of the appeal. No settlement, decree, or monitor has been ordered.",
    "46805": "Filing date and parties. The case was filed on July 21, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations that include statewide domestic- and sexual-violence coalitions from numerous states and Rhode Island-based homeless and youth-service providers. They receive and depend on federal grants to operate shelters, prevention programs, and housing services. The defendants are federal officials and agencies—specifically the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the heads of those departments and certain HHS components—sued in their official capacities. The plaintiffs are represented by a mix of public-interest and private counsel, including Democracy Forward Foundation, Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC, the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island (as cooperating counsel), the National Women’s Law Center, and local private counsel. This is not a class action.\n\nFactual basis and challenged policies. After several executive orders issued in January 2025, the agencies added new conditions to a range of federal grants. The plaintiffs allege that, to implement the executive orders, HUD and HHS imposed unlawful terms requiring, among other things: (1) that grantees not “use grant funds to promote ‘gender ideology’” as defined in Executive Order 14168; (2) that grantees certify that compliance with all federal anti‑discrimination laws is “material” to payment decisions for False Claims Act purposes and certify they operate no programs that violate those laws; (3) that grantees not use funds to “fund or promote elective abortions,” citing Executive Order 14182; (4) that grantees’ funded activities are governed by “all current Executive Orders”; and (5) for HHS/ACF awards, that grantees certify they do not, and will not, operate programs that “advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology.” The plaintiffs assert these conditions were applied across HUD’s Continuum of Care (CoC) program and, via HUD’s Office of Community Planning and Development, to other programs including Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), and across HHS components through HHS’s Grants Policy Statement and component-specific terms (including ACF and HRSA). The plaintiffs contend these conditions are vague, conflict with statutes and regulations that require serving “underserved” populations (including LGBTQ+ survivors) and HUD’s Equal Access Rule (24 C.F.R. § 5.106), and expose grantees to civil and criminal liability under the False Claims Act.\n\nLegal foundation and claims. The plaintiffs bring claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706, alleging the conditions exceed statutory authority, are contrary to law, conflict with existing regulations, are arbitrary and capricious, and were adopted without required procedure (including HUD’s own rulemaking procedures at 24 C.F.R. pt. 10). They also bring constitutional claims asserting violations of separation of powers and the Spending Clause, First Amendment compelled speech and viewpoint discrimination, and Fifth Amendment due process vagueness, and an ultra vires claim. The statutory and regulatory backdrop the plaintiffs invoke includes the McKinney‑Vento/CoC provisions, the ESG and CDBG statutes, HHS’s Rape Prevention and Education program (42 U.S.C. § 280b‑1b), the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) and its implementing regulation barring gender-identity discrimination (45 C.F.R. § 1370.5), and the DELTA program, all of which, they argue, protect or require services for underserved and culturally specific populations. The plaintiffs seek declaratory relief, vacatur, and injunctive relief, including stays under 5 U.S.C. § 705, to prevent imposition or enforcement of the conditions and to nullify any already-included terms.\n\nJudge. The case is before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose (Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan is also assigned).\n\nFilings and proceedings; rulings to date. On July 21, 2025, the coalitions and service providers moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO). After a July 24 hearing, the court granted a TRO on July 28, 2025, finding a likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm. The order enjoined HUD and the HUD Secretary from requiring certain named organizations and their members, in connection with CoC grants, to agree to or be subject to four conditions: (1) the “gender ideology” funding ban; (2) the certification making anti-discrimination compliance “material” to payment decisions; (3) the “elective abortion” funding ban; and (4) the clause stating the grantee’s funded operations are governed by “all current Executive Orders.” The order also enjoined HHS, ACF, and their officials from requiring certain coalitions to accept the ACF “anti‑DEI” certification for FVPSA Coalition grants. The court required the agencies to notify their staffs and file compliance status reports.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the court issued a Revised TRO expanding the covered HUD plaintiffs and again enjoining the same four HUD CoC conditions and the ACF anti‑DEI certification for FVPSA Coalition grants. Later that day, the court issued a Second Revised TRO that also applied the HUD injunction to Community Development Block Grants and added additional organizations to the covered HUD group. On August 20, 2025, the court entered a Third Revised TRO (HUD filed further compliance notices). The TRO, as amended, remains in effect pending further order to accommodate the briefing on preliminary relief. In all TRO orders, the court deferred ruling on challenges to HHS’s Grants Policy Statement because HHS issued a revised Grants Policy Statement on July 24, 2025, removing references to “DEI,” “DEIA+,” and “discriminatory gender ideology,” and the court requested an administrative record before addressing that issue.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, the coalitions moved for preliminary relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705 and for a preliminary injunction that would stay and enjoin broader sets of HUD and HHS policies (including HUD’s agency‑wide “executive orders” compliance clause and HUD Form 424‑B anti‑DEI certification, ACF’s anti‑DEI and Title IX certifications, and HRSA’s Title IX certification). Defendants opposed on August 18, 2025. The court set a preliminary‑injunction hearing for September 4, 2025. No reported opinions have issued.\n\nRemedy sought. The coalitions ask the court to declare the conditions unlawful, vacate and set them aside, stay their operation under § 705, and permanently enjoin the agencies from including or enforcing them (or substantially similar terms) in notices of funding opportunity, grant agreements, and subawards.\n\nRelated matters. The complaint references other litigation and decisions, including Colorado v. HHS, 2025 WL 1426226 (D.R.I. May 16, 2025), and filings in King County v. Turner, No. 2:25‑cv‑00814 (W.D. Wash.), but this case has not been consolidated with any other case.\n\nContext and impact. The coalitions and service providers allege that the challenged conditions, added to HUD and HHS grant programs they rely on (including CoC, CDBG, FVPSA, and CDC’s Rape Prevention and Education grants), force them to choose between abandoning lawful, often required, inclusive practices and messaging—or losing essential funding for shelters, prevention programs, and housing assistance. They further allege the conditions are vague and coupled with False Claims Act “materiality” language designed to expose them to civil and criminal liability, producing an immediate chilling effect on protected activities. The court’s TROs presently allow the named organizations and their members to access awarded CoC, CDBG, and FVPSA Coalition grant funds without the enjoined conditions while the merits are litigated.",
    "46375": "On April 9, 2025, a nonprofit education foundation filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Education, the Secretary of Education in her official capacity, and the President in his official capacity. The nonprofit—represented by private counsel—challenged the Department’s February 13, 2025 termination of its five‑year, Title IV Equity Assistance Center grant for the southern region (Region II), originally awarded in October 2022 for approximately $8.6 million. The grant funded technical assistance to public schools on desegregation and equal educational opportunity in states with most of the nation’s remaining federal school desegregation orders.\n\nFactual context and agency action: The President issued Executive Orders 14151 (Jan. 20, 2025) and 14173 (Jan. 21, 2025) directing termination of “equity-related” programs. On February 13, 2025, the Department issued press releases announcing terminations and sent the nonprofit a termination letter citing 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 and 34 C.F.R. § 75.253, asserting the grant promoted DEI or otherwise conflicted with Department priorities. The letter did not identify specific violations, invoke GEPA standards, or offer a pre‑termination hearing. The Department also imposed a post‑termination “route pay” special condition requiring prior approval for drawdowns. On May 14, 2025, the Department remitted $293,681.78 for pre‑termination expenses; the nonprofit withdrew its administrative appeal on May 16, 2025. The nonprofit alleged immediate cessation of services, program closure risk, loss of staff, reputational harm, and unreimbursed costs, and sought to continue serving districts (including those under active desegregation orders).\n\nClaims and legal bases: The suit asserts APA violations (arbitrary and capricious termination; failure to use notice‑and‑comment to change grant priorities required by 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d); failure to follow GEPA procedures and standards, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1234c–d), a Fifth Amendment vagueness challenge to Executive Order 14151 as applied, a Title VI procedural claim under 42 U.S.C. § 2000d‑1 (failure to provide notice/voluntary compliance and report to Congress before terminating assistance), an ultra vires/Impoundment Control Act claim, and a First Amendment viewpoint‑discrimination claim. The nonprofit sought declaratory and injunctive relief, reinstatement of the grant on pre‑termination terms, reimbursement of allowable costs, and to set aside the “route pay” condition.\n\nKey proceedings and rulings: The nonprofit moved for a TRO/preliminary injunction on April 23, 2025. After a May 12, 2025 hearing, Judge Paul L. Friedman granted a preliminary injunction on May 21, 2025. The Court held it had jurisdiction notwithstanding the Tucker Act because the claims were not “in essence” contract claims and sought equitable APA relief; the termination was a final agency action and the case was ripe (the administrative appeal had been withdrawn). On the merits, the Court found the nonprofit likely to succeed on its APA arbitrary‑and‑capricious claim: the Department provided a boilerplate, non‑specific termination letter, identified no individualized facts, and failed to articulate a rational explanation linking any findings to termination. The Court also found irreparable harm (loss of the grant—the sole funding source for the center—forced program shutdown, staff loss, and reputational injury), that the equities favored the nonprofit, and that the public interest supported lawful agency action and continuity of congressionally supported desegregation assistance.\n\nPreliminary injunction terms (May 21, 2025): The Court ordered the Department and the Secretary to reinstate the Region II Equity Assistance Center grant (Award S004D220011) within five business days “in accordance with the [grant’s] terms and conditions in place immediately prior” to the February 13 termination; to reimburse the nonprofit for outstanding and otherwise allowable expenditures incurred between February 13 and the order; and enjoined terminating the grant “in a manner this Court has determined is likely unlawful” under the APA. The Court required only a minimal security; the docket reflects a $100 bond posted on June 6, 2025.\n\nSubsequent events: Defendants noticed an appeal of the preliminary injunction on July 18, 2025 to the D.C. Circuit (No. 25‑5262). The case otherwise remains pending in the district court; no consolidation or settlement has been reported.\n\nStatutes, constitutional provisions, and authorities invoked: Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000c–2000c‑9); 20 U.S.C. §§ 1232(d), 1234c–d; 34 C.F.R. Part 270; 34 C.F.R. § 75.253; 2 C.F.R. § 200.340; APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704, 706; Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d‑1; Impoundment Control Act, 2 U.S.C. §§ 681–84; Appropriations Clause; Take Care Clause; First and Fifth Amendments; Executive Orders 14151 and 14173.\n\nRelief sought in the pleadings: declaratory and injunctive relief setting aside the termination, reinstatement of the grant on pre‑termination terms, reimbursement of allowable costs, vacatur of the “route pay” condition, and an order enjoining enforcement of the Executive Order termination provision as applied.\n\nJudge: U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman.\n\nRelated matters (not consolidated): The Court’s opinion referenced other contemporaneous grant‑termination litigation, including Department of Education v. California, Widakuswara v. Lake, and American Ass’n of Colleges for Teacher Education v. McMahon, as contextual authority. No formal consolidation occurred in this case.",
    "46284": "Filed March 24, 2025 in the Southern District of New York, this case is brought by a 21‑year‑old lawful permanent resident and Columbia University student who challenges threatened immigration enforcement that she alleges is retaliation for her speech and protest activity. The defendants are federal officials in their official capacities: the President, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, ICE’s Acting Director, and ICE’s New York Field Office Director. The matter is before Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, with Magistrate Judge Jennifer Willis designated for referrals. Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger handled a related unsealing request for a search‑warrant application.\n\nThe plaintiff alleges she has lived in the United States since age seven and became a lawful permanent resident in 2021. She participated in campus events concerning Palestinian human rights and, on March 5, 2025, was among individuals arrested outside a Barnard College building during a protest about university discipline; she received a desk appearance ticket for obstructing governmental administration. Within days, according to the complaint, ICE signed an administrative arrest warrant for her, agents visited her parents’ home seeking her, and a federal prosecutor and an ICE agent told her counsel that the Secretary of State had “revoked” her status. On March 13, agents executed judicial search warrants at Columbia‑owned residences, including her dormitory, seeking occupancy, travel, and immigration records; the warrants cited 8 U.S.C. § 1324 (harboring). The government later moved to unseal the search‑warrant application; Magistrate Judge Lehrburger ordered it unsealed with redactions on May 13–14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiff contends these actions are part of a broader policy to target noncitizen students engaged in pro‑Palestinian advocacy by invoking the “foreign policy” deportability ground, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(4)(C) (incorporating 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(C)), and alleges the Secretary of State made a determination about her presence or activities (the “Rubio Determination”) based on her protected speech. She alleges DHS intended to arrest, detain, and initiate removal using that provision. The complaint references contemporaneous immigration actions against other students and public statements by senior officials, and it cites Executive Orders 14161 and 14188 as contextual background.\n\nThis is an individual action seeking habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and injunctive and declaratory relief. The causes of action are: (1) First Amendment retaliation, viewpoint discrimination, and prior restraint; (2) Fifth Amendment due process (vagueness, substantive and procedural); (3) violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the INA (including the Accardi doctrine) relating to the alleged policy and the Secretary’s determination; and (4) a non‑delegation claim. Statutory bases for review include 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 2241, 2201–02, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706, and 28 U.S.C. § 1651. The plaintiff seeks vacatur of the policy and the Secretary’s determination as applied to her, a declaration that the actions are unlawful, and injunctions barring her detention, transfer, or removal (and requiring notice before any detention on other asserted grounds), plus fees.\n\nCounsel for the plaintiff are a team of private and public‑interest lawyers serving pro bono, including Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel LLP, the CLEAR Project (CUNY School of Law), Human Rights First, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, and individual counsel. The defendants are represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\nKey proceedings and rulings:\n- March 25, 2025: The court granted a temporary restraining order (ECF 19) enjoining the government from detaining or transferring the plaintiff and requiring advance notice if detention were sought on any basis other than removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(4)(C); bond was waived. The court set a briefing schedule and a show‑cause hearing. The court also granted a motion to seal certain exhibits (ECF 21) and later granted an amicus filing by more than 110 immigration lawyers and scholars (ECF 29).\n- April 11, 2025: Defendants moved to dismiss and opposed preliminary injunctive relief (ECF 32–35). Plaintiff opposed and filed a reply on the preliminary injunction (ECF 39–42).\n- May 13–14, 2025: Magistrate Judge Lehrburger ordered unsealing (with redactions) of the search‑warrant application supporting the March 13 warrants (ECF 49).\n- June 5, 2025: After hearings on May 29 and June 5, the court granted a preliminary injunction (ECF 57), continuing to enjoin detention and transfer and requiring 72 hours’ advance notice before any other asserted basis for detention, with bond waived. The court denied the motion to dismiss in part and granted it in part (see minute entry; the order itself does not detail which parts were granted or denied). The TRO remained in effect until superseded by the preliminary injunction.\n- July 3, 2025: Defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the Second Circuit from the preliminary injunction, stating the appeal challenges subject‑matter jurisdiction (ECF 61–62). They did not seek to expedite or to stay the injunction. In light of the appeal, the district court noted it was divested of control over aspects of the case involved in the appeal and declined to supervise discovery while the appeal is pending (ECF 64).\n\nThere are no trials or settlements. No class has been sought. No court‑appointed monitor has been designated.\n\nFactual basis as alleged: The plaintiff, a long‑time U.S. resident and LPR, engaged in campus advocacy. After a March 5, 2025 protest and misdemeanor desk appearance ticket, federal agents sought her arrest under an administrative warrant, officials told counsel her status had been “revoked,” and search warrants were executed at university residences seeking her records. She alleges the government, pursuant to a policy relying on the INA’s “foreign policy” ground and publicized by senior officials, is attempting to punish and deter speech by initiating immigration enforcement against student protesters, and that the Secretary of State made a determination about her presence/activities based on her protected speech. She seeks to halt any detention, transfer, or removal and to invalidate the alleged policy and determination. The court has preliminarily enjoined detention and transfer and required notice before any other asserted detention while the case proceeds and the appeal is pending.",
    "46735": "On June 20, 2025, the Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools (a New Mexico public school district) filed a verified complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico against the Secretary of Education (in her official capacity), the U.S. Department of Education, and the President (in his official capacity). The school district is represented by private counsel (Himes, Petrarca & Fester, Chtd.); the federal defendants are represented by the U.S. Department of Justice. This is not a class action.\n\nThe dispute arises from a five‑year, $6 million federal grant for school‑based mental health services awarded to the district under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), which amended 42 U.S.C. § 254c‑19 and authorized pediatric behavioral health integration funding through 2027. The district alleges that, following several 2025 Executive Orders addressing “DEI,” the Department of Education issued a February 14, 2025 Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) stating that “DEI programs” can violate civil rights laws and warned of potential funding consequences, and then on April 29, 2025 issued a Notice of Non‑Continuation of the district’s grant at the end of the current budget period. The Department’s notice stated, in substance, that continuation was not in the federal government’s interest and that the programs either conflicted with agency policy or misused federal funds. The notice did not cancel funds owed for already‑completed work.\n\nThe district alleges that: (1) the DCL and the grant action violate the First Amendment (free speech/association) by chilling or penalizing protected expression; (2) the DCL is void for vagueness under the Fifth Amendment due process clause; (3) the agency action violates the Spending Clause by retroactively imposing ambiguous, unrelated conditions; (4) the Department acted ultra vires; and (5) the Department’s actions are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), including violations of 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 and 34 C.F.R. § 75.105, § 75.253. The district also cites GEPA, ESSA, and the Department of Education Organization Act to argue federal non‑interference in local curriculum. The district seeks declaratory relief (28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202) and injunctive relief, including: vacatur of the DCL, the “End DEI” portal, and FAQs; reinstatement of grant funding; reimbursement of allowable expenditures incurred after the non‑continuation; and an order barring further inconsistent terminations. The district alleges substantial operational harms from the loss of funding, including elimination of added mental health staff, closure of school “wellness rooms,” loss of a student mental‑health app, reductions in school safety and behavioral improvements, and discontinuation of family outreach.\n\nKey proceedings: On June 23, 2025, the district moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The court granted leave for excess briefing and accepted an amicus brief from several States. Judge William P. Johnson held a hearing on July 16, 2025. On July 18, 2025, the court denied preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction (Memorandum Opinion and Order, Doc. 27).\n\nJudge William P. Johnson concluded that, in essence, the case seeks to compel payment or continuation of federal grant funds and therefore falls within the Tucker Act’s contract‑claims regime, placing jurisdiction in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, not a district court under the APA. The court relied on recent Supreme Court guidance indicating that district courts lack jurisdiction to order payment of money under the APA where the claim is contractual in nature and that such claims belong in the Court of Federal Claims. The court characterized the Department’s April 29, 2025 action as a non‑continuation for the next budget period under 34 C.F.R. § 75.253 (best‑interest determination), not a termination under 2 C.F.R. § 200.340, and noted the district had not sought reconsideration under § 75.253(g). The court also observed that the notice did not cancel funds owed for completed work.\n\nAlthough dismissing for lack of jurisdiction, the court addressed preliminary‑injunction factors and found the district had not shown a likelihood of success on its constitutional or APA claims or irreparable harm. On the First Amendment claim, the court concluded the non‑continuation did not prohibit or compel speech, and that the government has broader latitude in funding decisions than in regulation. On the Fifth Amendment vagueness claim, the court found no protected property interest in continued grant funding and questioned whether the DCL was impermissibly vague. On the Spending Clause claim, the court held the challenge failed because the grant was awarded in annual budget periods subject to continuation decisions, not retroactive conditions imposed by Congress. On the APA claims, the court noted that non‑continuation decisions tied to lump‑sum appropriations and best‑interest determinations may be committed to agency discretion and that the FAQs and portal did not constitute final agency action. As to irreparable harm, the court found harms compensable by money in the proper forum and stressed potential injury to executive policy execution if an injunction issued. The court denied the motion and dismissed the complaint without prejudice, noting the district may pursue relief in the Court of Federal Claims.\n\nThere are no consolidated cases, trials, decrees, settlements, monitors, or appeals reflected on the docket. Reported opinions are not listed; the key ruling is the district court’s Memorandum Opinion and Order (Doc. 27, July 18, 2025).",
    "46342": "On April 4, 2025, two nonprofit organizations—the Association for Education Finance and Policy (an association of scholars and practitioners) and the Institute for Higher Education Policy (a nonpartisan higher‑education research group)—filed this non‑class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Secretary of Education, in her official capacity, and the U.S. Department of Education. Plaintiffs are represented by the Public Citizen Litigation Group (public‑interest counsel). The case is before Judge Trevor N. McFadden.\n\nThe case arises from Department of Education decisions beginning in February 2025 affecting the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). Plaintiffs allege that the Department, after urging from an internal “Department of Government Efficiency,” canceled scores of IES contracts around February 10–11, 2025; announced a reduction‑in‑force on March 11, 2025 that would eliminate roughly 90% of IES positions (placing affected staff on administrative leave as of March 21); and ended or curtailed researchers’ access to IES restricted‑use datasets by terminating the remote access program effective June 1, later extended to June 30, and pausing processing of new restricted‑data license applications and disclosure‑risk reviews. Cancellations alleged in the pleadings include major statistics and longitudinal studies (e.g., National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, High School and Beyond 2022, High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 third follow‑up, and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study‑Kindergarten:2024), technical assistance and dissemination activities (e.g., Regional Educational Laboratories, What Works Clearinghouse work in progress), and support functions (e.g., DataLab platform maintenance, peer review of grants, National Library of Education services, NCES mail center). Plaintiffs contend these actions halt ongoing research, risk destruction or inaccessibility of data collected with federal funds, and prevent IES from performing statutory duties under the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (ESRA) and other statutes. Plaintiffs also point to delays or stoppages in disclosure‑risk reviews needed to publish research using restricted‑use data.\n\nThe original complaint asserted claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706, including: actions contrary to law (citing ESRA provisions such as 20 U.S.C. §§ 9511–12, 9531–33, 9541–46, 9561–64, 9567, 9574–76; the Higher Education Opportunity Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(k); and other program‑specific statutes), arbitrary‑and‑capricious decisionmaking, violations of the Impoundment Control Act and Anti‑Deficiency Act, and a nonstatutory ultra vires/separation‑of‑powers claim. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to set aside the cancellations and RIF, prevent destruction of records, reinstate staff and programs necessary to carry out IES’s mandates, and halt termination of restricted‑data access.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to stop the Department from terminating IES functions, to reinstate programs and employees necessary to perform statutory duties, to suspend the planned end of remote restricted‑data access, and to rescind contract termination notices. The Court held a joint hearing on May 16, 2025, together with a related case filed by the National Academy of Education and the National Council on Measurement in Education (No. 1:25‑cv‑01266); the Court did not formally consolidate the cases but heard them together under Rule 42(a).\n\nOn June 3, 2025, Judge McFadden denied preliminary‑injunction motions in both cases. The Court held that plaintiffs had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits because their claims, as presented for preliminary relief, amounted to an impermissible programmatic challenge under the APA. Relying on Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation and Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, the Court concluded that plaintiffs bundled many discrete actions (contract cancellations, staffing reductions, and access changes) into a request for wholesale judicial modification of IES operations and ongoing statutory compliance, relief the APA does not provide. The Court also rejected the constitutional/separation‑of‑powers framing as a repackaged statutory challenge barred by Dalton v. Specter. Because likelihood of success was not shown, the Court did not need to reach the remaining preliminary‑injunction factors.\n\nAfter that ruling, plaintiffs narrowed their claims. On June 18, 2025, they filed a First Amended Complaint focusing on eight discrete terminations: NPSAS 2024; BPS:20/25; HSLS:09 third follow‑up; HS&B:22; ECLS‑K:2024; IES’s peer‑review program for new grant funding; the remote‑access program for restricted‑use data; and the processing of new applications for access to restricted‑use data. They also added an APA § 706(1) claim by IHEP for unreasonable delay in three disclosure‑risk review submissions (filed February 7, March 4, and March 14, 2025). On July 16, 2025, plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint further narrowing to six challenged actions: termination of BPS:20/25 (APA arbitrary‑and‑capricious); termination of HSLS:09 third follow‑up (arbitrary‑and‑capricious); termination of HS&B:22 (arbitrary‑and‑capricious); termination of ECLS‑K:2024 (arbitrary‑and‑capricious); termination of IES’s peer‑review program for new grants (contrary to 20 U.S.C. §§ 9534(b)(1), 9520, and arbitrary‑and‑capricious); and termination (pause) of processing applications for restricted‑use data (contrary to 20 U.S.C. §§ 9574, 9575(2)–(3), 9546(e)(2), and arbitrary‑and‑capricious). IHEP’s unreasonable‑delay claim regarding disclosure‑risk reviews remains. Plaintiffs continue to seek declaratory relief, orders setting aside the terminations, injunctions requiring resumption of the specified studies and the peer‑review program, resumption of processing restricted‑data applications, and an order compelling resolution of IHEP’s pending disclosure‑risk review requests within 14 days, along with fees and costs.\n\nSignificant proceedings include: the preliminary‑injunction denial (Memorandum Opinion, June 3, 2025); plaintiffs’ amendments narrowing to discrete actions (June 18 and July 16, 2025); and the government’s motion to dismiss the first amended complaint (mooted by the second amendment). The Court set a briefing schedule for a renewed motion to dismiss: government motion due August 19, 2025; plaintiffs’ opposition due September 18, 2025; and reply due October 9, 2025. As reflected on the docket, the renewed motion was filed on August 19, 2025. No appeals, trials, settlements, monitors, or decrees have been entered.\n\nFactual context offered in the pleadings and declaration explains IES’s statutory role under ESRA to lead federal education research and statistics through four centers (NCER, NCES, NCEE, NCSER), the statutory requirements to collect and disseminate specified data (including longitudinal surveys and NAEP), to maintain peer review for grants and publications, and to make data public while safeguarding confidentiality. Plaintiffs allege that contract cancellations and staff reductions halted multi‑year, congressionally funded studies midstream, jeopardized existing datasets and public dissemination tools (e.g., DataLab), and cut off or delayed researcher access to restricted‑use data and necessary disclosure approvals, harming their ability—and their members’ ability—to conduct and publish evidence‑based research relied upon by policymakers and the public.",
    "46322": "On March 31, 2025, civil‑rights and voter‑advocacy organizations filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging President Trump’s March 25, 2025 Executive Order 14,248, “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections.” Two related cases—one by national Democratic Party entities and congressional leaders and one by additional nonpartisan voter organizations—were filed March 31 and April 1, 2025. On April 3, 2025, Judge Colleen Kollar‑Kotelly consolidated the three cases.\n\nThe plaintiffs are nonpartisan organizations engaged in voter registration and voter assistance (including the League of United Latin American Citizens, Secure Families Initiative, Arizona Students’ Association, League of Women Voters entities, Hispanic Federation, NAACP, OCA–Asian Pacific American Advocates, and Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote) and political organizations and leaders (the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Governors Association, DSCC, DCCC, and the U.S. House and Senate Democratic leaders). They sued the Executive Office of the President; the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), its executive director, and four commissioners; the U.S. Departments of Justice and Defense and their leaders; the Federal Voting Assistance Program and its director; and, in the Democratic Party action, additional federal departments and agency heads involved in implementing the order (including Homeland Security and State). Plaintiffs are represented by nonprofit public‑interest counsel (including Campaign Legal Center, State Democracy Defenders Fund, ACLU, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Brennan Center). Defendants are represented by the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division.\n\nThe Executive Order directed, among other things: (1) the EAC to add a documentary‑proof‑of‑citizenship requirement to the national mail voter registration form (the NVRA “Federal Form”), dictate the acceptable documents, and require states to record document details; (2) agencies to open federal databases to aid citizenship verification and to review state voter rolls and list‑maintenance records against federal immigration databases; (3) the Secretary of Defense to add proof‑of‑citizenship and “proof of eligibility” requirements to the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) Federal Post Card Application; (4) the Attorney General to “enforce” federal Election Day statutes “against States” that count mail ballots received after Election Day; and (5) the EAC to condition federal election funding on states’ adoption of an Election Day ballot‑receipt deadline (with a UOCAVA carve‑out).\n\nPlaintiffs brought ultra vires separation‑of‑powers and federalism claims and statutory claims under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Paperwork Reduction Act, UOCAVA, and (for the Democratic Party plaintiffs) the Privacy Act. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief barring implementation of the order’s contested provisions and ancillary agency actions.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, both plaintiff groups moved for preliminary injunctions. After expedited briefing and a hearing on April 17, 2025, the court issued a detailed memorandum opinion and order on April 24, 2025. The court held that plaintiffs had standing to challenge the order’s directive that the EAC require documentary proof of citizenship on the Federal Form and that they were likely to succeed on the merits because the Constitution vests election regulation with the states, subject to congressional—not presidential—oversight, and Congress expressly delegated the Federal Form’s content and rulemaking to the independent, bipartisan EAC, operating through consultation with state election officials and APA/PRA procedures. The court preliminarily enjoined the EAC, its commissioners, and its executive director from taking any action to implement Section 2(a) of the order, including any change to require documentary proof of citizenship on the Federal Form. The court also enjoined implementation of Section 2(d), holding that ordering federal voter‑registration agencies to “assess citizenship” before providing the Federal Form to public‑assistance enrollees conflicts with the NVRA’s mandate that designated agencies “shall” distribute and accept the Federal Form with each application for service or assistance (unless the applicant declines in writing). The court enjoined the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and the Interior, the Small Business Administration, and their leaders from implementing Section 2(d). No bond was required.\n\nThe court denied preliminary relief as to three other provisions. It declined to enjoin Section 2(b) (inter‑agency and state/federal data‑sharing to identify “unqualified voters”), finding the claims unripe because the order’s savings clauses require lawful implementation and it was unclear which, if any, Privacy Act‑implicating disclosures would occur. It denied an injunction against Section 7(a) (directing the Attorney General to “enforce” Election Day statutes against states that count ballots received after Election Day), reasoning that how, and whether, enforcement might proceed remained unclear and any enforcement would be against states, not the organizational or party plaintiffs. It denied relief against Section 7(b) (directing the EAC to condition funding on states’ adoption of an Election Day receipt rule) for lack of a substantial likelihood of standing on the present record; the court noted that any direct claim about state funding conditions would more naturally be brought by states and referenced state actions already pending elsewhere (California v. Trump, D. Mass.; Washington v. Trump, W.D. Wash.).\n\nThe preliminary injunction maintains the status quo for federal voter registration pending further proceedings. The court rejected the government’s Purcell‑based arguments about timing, finding that preserving long‑standing federal registration practices avoided voter confusion ahead of approaching election deadlines.\n\nSubsequently, on June 12, 2025, the court granted in part a motion by the Republican National Committee to intervene as a defendant‑intervenor on claims regarding Sections 2(a), 2(b), 2(d), 3(a), and 7(a). The court set a discovery and briefing schedule. Plaintiffs and defendants later filed cross‑motions for partial summary judgment (beginning July–August 2025); those motions remain pending.\n\nLegal bases: Plaintiffs’ claims rest on the Elections Clause and related constitutional provisions (U.S. Const. art. I, § 4, cl. 1; art. II), NVRA (52 U.S.C. § 20501 et seq.), HAVA (52 U.S.C. § 20901 et seq., §§ 21001–21003, § 21081(a)(6)), UOCAVA (52 U.S.C. § 20301 et seq.), the APA (5 U.S.C. § 706), the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. §§ 3501–3521), and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a). The remedies sought and granted to date are declaratory relief and preliminary injunctive relief (no bond), enjoining the EAC from implementing Section 2(a) and enjoining specified agencies from implementing Section 2(d). The court denied preliminary relief as to Sections 2(b), 7(a), and 7(b). The April 24, 2025 memorandum opinion and order govern (no separate reporter citation provided in the record). No appeals have been noted, and no settlement or monitoring regime has been established. The cases proceed before Judge Kollar‑Kotelly under a scheduling order with summary‑judgment briefing underway.",
    "46510": "Filed on April 28, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, this non‑class civil action challenges recent federal actions affecting the Head Start program. The plaintiffs are four state Head Start associations (Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) and two parent‑led organizations (Family Forward Oregon and Parent Voices Oakland). They are represented by civil‑rights and private counsel, including the ACLU of Washington and ACLU Foundation, the Roger Baldwin Foundation of the ACLU of Illinois, the Impact Fund, and private firms (Crowell & Moring LLP, Hoq Law APC, Feldesman Leifer LLP). The defendants are federal health officials and agencies: the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.; HHS; the Acting Assistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Andrew Gradison; ACF; the Office of Head Start (OHS); and the Acting OHS Director Tala Hooban. The case is before Judge Ricardo S. Martinez.\n\nPlaintiffs bring constitutional claims (Separation of Powers; Appropriations/Spending Clause; First Amendment; Fifth Amendment Due Process vagueness), Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claims (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (B), (C), (D) and § 706(1)), a claim under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794), and an ultra vires claim. The legal dispute centers on: (1) a March 14, 2025 ACF “DEI” letter stating OHS “will not approve” federal funding for training, technical assistance, or other program expenses that “promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives”; and (2) an April 16, 2025 amendment to HHS’s Grants Policy Statement requiring recipients, as a condition of award, to certify they “do not, and will not during the term” of the award, operate any programs that “advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology,” with potential clawback and False Claims Act exposure. Plaintiffs also challenge April 1, 2025 mass closures of five of ten regional Head Start offices and large OHS staff layoffs, alleged payment‑management hurdles (including new “DOGE” draw‑down justifications), and delays in continuation grants and designation renewals. They contend these actions conflict with the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. § 9831 et seq.) and its performance standards, the Rehabilitation Act, and congressional appropriations (FY 2024 and continuing FY 2025 funding), and are part of a policy to dismantle Head Start (citing an April 10, 2025 OMB memorandum indicating the FY 2026 budget does not fund Head Start and directing use of FY 2025 funds to “close out” the program). Plaintiffs allege material funding delays and communications breakdowns with OHS, including one provider in Sunnyside, Washington that suspended services—affecting about 400 children and 70 staff—during a renewal period.\n\nPlaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief: to set aside and enjoin enforcement of the March 14 DEI letter and the April 16 DEIA certification; to enjoin or reverse the regional office closures and layoffs and require staffing sufficient to meet OHS’s statutory duties; to compel timely continuation grants, designation renewals, and payment draws; to postpone the effective date of the challenged actions under 5 U.S.C. § 705; and to bar negative consequences tied to compliance issues caused by the alleged dismantling. They also seek attorneys’ fees.\n\nProcedurally, the complaint was filed April 28, 2025; an amended complaint was filed May 13, 2025 (naming Tala Hooban), and a second amended complaint on August 19, 2025. Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on May 16, 2025, supported by declarations; defendants filed an over‑length opposition (granted up to 10,000 words) on June 6, 2025; plaintiffs replied June 13, 2025. The Court granted plaintiffs’ motion to file certain declarations under pseudonym on June 16, 2025. Plaintiffs later moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on July 21, 2025; defendants opposed. The Court held oral argument on August 5, 2025 on both the PI and TRO and took the matter under advisement. On August 8, 2025, the Court noted defendants’ stipulation rendering the TRO request moot, converted that motion to a second motion for preliminary injunction, set supplemental briefing (filed August 15, 2025), re‑noted consideration for September 5, 2025, and set a further preliminary‑injunction hearing for September 9, 2025. Plaintiffs filed notice of supplemental authority on July 3, 2025 (New York v. Kennedy). No reported opinions on the merits have issued, no trial has been held, and no appeals have been taken as of the latest docket entries.\n\nFactually, plaintiffs allege: (a) the January 27, 2025 OMB funding pause implementing anti‑DEI and related executive orders caused temporary loss of access to payment systems; (b) the March 14 DEI letter and April 16 DEIA certification are vague, conflict with the Head Start Act’s requirements to meet the “diverse needs” of communities with linguistically and culturally appropriate services and inclusion of children with disabilities, and chill speech; (c) April 1, 2025 OHS regional office closures and layoffs sharply reduced program specialist support, communications, training/TA, and grant administration; (d) new payment‑draw requirements and delays hindered agencies’ ability to meet the three‑day cash‑on‑hand rule; and (e) delays in continuation awards and designation renewals (including for agencies in the Designation Renewal System) created risks of layoffs, service suspensions, and closures. Plaintiffs assert these actions have caused and threaten irreparable harm to providers, children, and families—especially those with disabilities, experiencing homelessness, dual‑language learners, and migrant and tribal communities—and seek court intervention to preserve Head Start’s operations in accordance with congressional mandates.",
    "46734": "Filing Date: The case was filed on May 29, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington (Tacoma).\n\nParties and Counsel: The suit was brought by Roman Catholic leadership and clergy in Washington—the Archbishop of Seattle, the Bishops of Yakima and Spokane, and several priests—against the State’s chief executives (the Governor and Attorney General) and all county prosecutors in their official capacities. The bishops and priests are represented by private and public‑interest counsel: Crowley Law Offices (local counsel), Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, and First Liberty Institute. The United States, through the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, was allowed to intervene.\n\nBackground and Factual Basis: On May 2, 2025, Washington enacted Senate Bill 5375 (effective July 27, 2025) adding “any member of the clergy” to the list of mandatory reporters of suspected child abuse or neglect and eliminating the ability of clergy to rely on state‑law privileges when learning such information, including in confessional communications. It also amends the supervisory reporting provision so that clergy alone cannot invoke any privilege recognized by state law. At nearly the same time, Substitute House Bill 1171 narrowed reporting obligations by preserving attorney‑client confidentiality for attorneys employed by institutions of higher education (and their supervised staff) when information relates to representation, subject to a limited exception. The bishops and priests allege SB 5375 compels them to violate the Catholic Church’s sacramental seal of Confession, under threat of criminal prosecution (a gross misdemeanor punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a $5,000 fine) and civil liability, and that their dioceses already require reporting suspected abuse and neglect learned outside Confession.\n\nCause of Action and Legal Theories: Proceeding under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Ex parte Young, the bishops and priests assert violations of the First Amendment’s Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses, the church‑autonomy doctrine (matters of internal governance and discipline), the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, and Article I, § 11 of the Washington Constitution. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. The United States intervened (42 U.S.C. § 2000h‑2, with the Attorney General certifying general public importance) and pressed an Equal Protection theory predicated on infringement of fundamental religious exercise and facial religious classification.\n\nJudge: Chief U.S. District Judge David G. Estudillo.\n\nKey Filings and Rulings:  \n- June 5, 2025: The bishops and priests moved for a preliminary injunction to bar enforcement of SB 5375 as applied to information learned solely through the Sacrament of Confession.  \n- June 23, 2025: The United States moved to intervene; the court granted intervention on July 15, 2025. The United States separately moved for a preliminary injunction on June 25, 2025, and later withdrew that motion after the court ruled on the plaintiffs’ motion.  \n- July 18, 2025: The court granted a preliminary injunction. It held the bishops and priests had standing and that their claims were ripe. On the merits, the court found a likelihood of success on the Free Exercise claim: SB 5375 burdens religious practice and is not neutral or generally applicable because it treats comparable secular activity more favorably (e.g., preserves attorney‑client confidentiality for university attorneys under SHB 1171 while denying religious confidentiality to clergy). Applying strict scrutiny, the court concluded the State had not shown narrow tailoring. The court found irreparable harm (loss of First Amendment freedoms), the balance of equities favored the bishops and priests, and the injunction served the public interest. The court did not reach the church‑autonomy or Establishment Clause claims at this stage.\n\nScope and Terms of the Preliminary Injunction: In light of the Supreme Court’s guidance on injunction breadth, the court enjoined enforcement of SB 5375 “as to the Sacrament of Confession” against the bishops, priests, and all Roman Catholic priests in Washington who fall directly under the administration of the Archbishop of Seattle and the Bishops of Yakima and Spokane. Many county prosecutors stipulated to be bound by a preliminary injunction and to a stay of proceedings against them; they agreed not to appeal interlocutory rulings and to consent to final judgment against the remaining defendants. The case proceeds against the Governor and Attorney General.\n\nRelated Proceedings: After the preliminary‑injunction hearing, the court issued a minute order in another matter (Orthodox Church in America et al. v. Ferguson et al., No. 2:25‑cv‑01537) directing these bishops and priests to show cause why the cases should not be consolidated; no consolidation order has issued in this case. There are no reported opinions or appeals noted in the record to date.\n\nRelief Sought/Ongoing Status: The bishops and priests seek a declaration that SB 5375 is unconstitutional and a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement insofar as it compels disclosure of confessional communications or denies clergy the benefit of privileges available to secular counterparts, plus attorneys’ fees and costs. The preliminary injunction remains in effect pending final judgment.",
    "46678": "On June 9, 2025, the Governor of California and the State of California filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and the U.S. Department of Defense. Represented by the California Attorney General’s Office (public counsel), the plaintiffs challenged the federalization and deployment of California National Guard units and Marines in Los Angeles that followed federal immigration enforcement operations and public protests beginning June 6, 2025. The defendants are represented by the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Division (Federal Programs Branch).\n\nThe complaint alleges ultra vires action, violations of the Tenth Amendment, and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, arising from the President’s June 7 memorandum invoking 10 U.S.C. § 12406 to call “at least 2,000” National Guard troops into federal service to protect federal personnel and property at sites where protests were occurring or likely to occur, followed by Department of Defense orders on June 7 and June 9 federalizing a total of 4,000 California National Guard members for 60 days, and the deployment of approximately 700 active-duty Marines from Camp Pendleton. Plaintiffs assert the statutory predicates for § 12406 were not met (no “rebellion” or “invasion,” and the President was not “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws”), that the statute’s directive that orders be issued “through the governors” was not followed, that use of federalized forces for civilian law enforcement would violate the Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. § 1385), and that diverting the Guard intrudes on the State’s police powers during wildfire season and drug interdiction operations. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and injunctions prohibiting federalization and deployment absent statutory predicates and process, and barring use of federalized forces to patrol communities or engage in general law enforcement beyond federal property, plus costs and fees.\n\nJudge Charles R. Breyer granted a temporary restraining order on June 12, 2025, enjoining deployment of federalized California National Guard members in Los Angeles and directing that control of the Guard be returned to the Governor, finding a likelihood of success on the ultra vires and Tenth Amendment claims and noting the risk of Posse Comitatus violations (Order Granting TRO, No. 3:25‑cv‑04870‑CRB). The court required a $100 bond and set an order to show cause hearing on June 20. The defendants immediately appealed and sought a stay.\n\nOn June 19, 2025, the Ninth Circuit (Judges Bennett, Miller, and Sung) granted a stay pending appeal, concluding defendants had made a strong showing of likely success. The court held the President’s § 12406 federalization decision is reviewable but subject to highly deferential review, and that the record likely satisfied § 12406(3) (“unable with the regular forces to execute the laws”), given evidence that protesters impeded ICE and other federal officers and damaged federal property. It also found that transmission of the order to the Adjutant General—who under California law issues orders in the Governor’s name—likely satisfied the statute’s “through the governors” requirement; in any event, any procedural defect would not warrant the breadth of the TRO. The panel emphasized that its decision did not address the nature of any activities that could implicate the Posse Comitatus Act, which plaintiffs had not pressed on appeal (Order granting stay pending appeal, No. 25‑3727 (9th Cir. June 19, 2025) (for publication)).\n\nMeanwhile, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction (filed June 16), seeking to enjoin enforcement of the June 7 and 9 orders and to bar use of federal troops for law enforcement away from federal property. Defendants opposed on June 18; plaintiffs replied June 19. The district court held a June 20 show‑cause hearing and ordered supplemental briefing on June 23. The court permitted limited expedited discovery, entered a stipulated protective order, and, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2), set a consolidated bench trial on the merits for August 11–13, 2025, with public Zoom access. Multiple amici appeared, including coalitions of states, the City and County of Los Angeles, former service secretaries and retired flag officers, and academic organizations. As of the dates reflected, no final judgment or settlement had issued.\n\nFactual context in the record reflects that on June 6, 2025, ICE conducted enforcement operations in multiple Los Angeles locations, leading to protests at the Roybal Federal Building and other sites. The record shows largely peaceful demonstrations with some incidents of violence and property damage; local law enforcement (LAPD, LASD, CHP) responded, declared unlawful assemblies, and made arrests. On June 7, the President invoked § 12406 to federalize National Guard units “to temporarily protect” federal personnel and property at locations of protests; on June 7 and June 9, the Secretary of Defense ordered a total of 4,000 California National Guard members into federal service for 60 days, and announced deployment of Marines. Plaintiffs contend the orders bypassed the Governor and diverted critical Guard resources (including wildfire and counter‑drug teams), and that statements by federal officials suggested an intent to embed troops alongside ICE operations in the community, raising Posse Comitatus concerns. Defendants assert the measures were needed to protect federal personnel and property and to ensure execution of federal law.",
    "46287": "On March 25, 2025, two national unions that represent higher‑education faculty and academic staff—the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers—filed suit in the Southern District of New York against several federal agencies and officials, including the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Education (ED), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the General Services Administration (GSA). The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel (Protect Democracy Project and Altshuler Berzon LLP). The Government is represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the Civil Division of the Department of Justice. The case was assigned to Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil.\n\nThe suit arises from a series of federal actions taken in early March 2025 following a DOJ‑led “Task Force to Combat Anti‑Semitism” and ED’s announcement of Title VI investigations. On March 7, 2025, DOJ, HHS, ED, and GSA announced the immediate cancellation of approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts with Columbia University, citing the University’s continued inaction in the face of harassment of Jewish students. NIH, citing 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) and the NIH Grants Policy Statement, notified Columbia that more than 400 NIH awards totaling over $250 million were terminated because the awards no longer effectuated agency priorities. HHS invoked the Federal Acquisition Regulation clause permitting termination for the government’s convenience (FAR 52.249‑5) on certain contracts. On March 13, 2025, HHS, ED, and GSA sent Columbia a letter describing nine “preconditions” for negotiations about “continued” federal funding, including: completing discipline for encampments and the Hamilton Hall occupation (with expulsions or multi‑year suspensions); abolishing the University Judicial Board; adopting time, place, and manner rules and a mask policy; holding student groups accountable; adopting a definition of antisemitism; empowering campus security to remove or arrest agitators; placing Columbia’s Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies department in academic receivership; and delivering a plan for comprehensive admissions reform. On March 21, Columbia announced an 18‑point set of measures to combat discrimination and antisemitism; the University represented in separate litigation that these measures had been under development for months and did not match the federal “preconditions” point‑for‑point.\n\nThe unions sued to stop what they characterized as unconstitutional coercion of a private university and a circumvention of Title VI’s procedural safeguards. Their complaint alleged: (1) First Amendment violations of academic freedom and free speech, including impermissible coercion of a private party to suppress disfavored speech; (2) unconstitutional conditions on federal funding; (3) Administrative Procedure Act (APA) procedural and substantive violations, asserting that the government terminated or refused to continue assistance without the notice, opportunity for hearing, congressional reporting, and program‑specific tailoring required by Title VI (42 U.S.C. § 2000d‑1) and agency regulations; (4) separation‑of‑powers/ultra vires violations; (5) Fifth Amendment due‑process violations, claiming protected property interests in grant‑funded salaries and research; and (6) Tenth Amendment and Spending Clause violations, arguing that the government’s threats and conditions amounted to coercion beyond federal authority. The unions sought declaratory relief, a preliminary and permanent injunction restoring the approximately $400 million and barring any further termination, pausing, or conditioning of funds without Title VI procedures, monetary damages (including compensatory and nominal), and attorneys’ fees.\n\nOn April 3, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to restore the terminated funds and bar future cuts absent Title VI processes. Multiple amici supported the motion (including the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression; the Center for Constitutional Governance and legal academics; UAW; a group of law professors and First Amendment scholars; and the Center for Constitutional Rights with Palestine Legal). The Government opposed, arguing principally that (i) plaintiffs lacked Article III standing; (ii) the unions were seeking to enforce payment obligations under grants and contracts to a non-party (Columbia), placing the dispute within the Court of Federal Claims’ Tucker Act jurisdiction; and (iii) the terminations were not Title VI enforcement actions but instead were discretionary grant terminations under 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) and contract terminations for convenience under the FAR, committed to agency discretion.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Vyskocil denied the preliminary‑injunction motion and dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of standing. The court held that the unions could not force the Executive Branch to pay funds to a non‑party (Columbia) and failed to show any injury‑in‑fact to themselves or to members that was fairly traceable to defendants rather than to Columbia’s independent actions. The court found the unions’ alleged First Amendment chilling effects to be subjective and speculative, noted Columbia had represented it had planned its March 21 measures for months and did not simply implement the agencies’ demands, and observed that Columbia had committed to cover certain salaries previously supported by grants. The court also flagged that the Supreme Court’s recent stay in Department of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025), suggests APA suits cannot be used to enforce contractual payment obligations, which are governed by the Tucker Act in the Court of Federal Claims, and remarked that money losses are ordinarily reparable and thus do not support preliminary injunctive relief. Because the case was dismissed on standing grounds, the court did not reach the merits of the APA, constitutional, or Spending Clause claims. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit on June 16, 2025.\n\nJudge: Mary Kay Vyskocil, U.S. District Judge (S.D.N.Y.).  \n\nKey filings and rulings: Complaint filed March 25, 2025; preliminary‑injunction motion filed April 3, 2025; multiple amicus briefs granted May 16, 2025; Opinion & Order denying preliminary injunction and dismissing for lack of standing issued June 16, 2025 (ECF No. 148).  \n\nLegal framework cited: Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d‑1; APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704, 706; OMB Uniform Guidance, 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4); FAR 52.249‑5; and Executive Order 14188 (Additional Measures to Combat Anti‑Semitism).  \n\nRelief sought: Declaratory and injunctive relief restoring federal funds and restricting future terminations absent Title VI procedures; damages; attorneys’ fees.  \n\nAppeal: Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on June 16, 2025.",
    "46580": "On May 7, 2025, sixteen states and the District of Columbia filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington challenging the U.S. Department of Transportation’s and the Federal Highway Administration’s actions that halted the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. The plaintiffs are the States of Washington, Colorado, California, Arizona, Delaware, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. The defendants are the U.S. Department of Transportation; its Secretary, Sean Duffy; the Federal Highway Administration; and its Acting Administrator, Gloria M. Shepherd, all sued in their official capacities. The plaintiff states are represented by their respective attorneys general. Several nonprofit organizations—Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, Climate Solutions, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, CleanAIRE NC, West End Revitalization Association, and Plug In America—moved to intervene as party plaintiffs (represented by Earthjustice and the Southern Environmental Law Center); the Court granted intervention on July 23, 2025.\n\nCongress created the NEVI Formula Program in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Pub. L. 117-58, appropriating $5 billion (FY 2022–2026), to “remain available until expended,” to fund states’ deployment and maintenance of EV charging infrastructure via a mandatory formula tied to Federal-Aid Highway apportionments. IIJA requires the Secretary to distribute funds by formula and directs states to submit State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans; it enumerates limited, procedural preconditions for withholding or withdrawing funds (e.g., failure to submit a plan or failure to carry out a plan, with notice, consultation, cure periods, and appeal). FHWA issued NEVI program guidance in 2022 and updated it in 2023 and 2024; it approved state plans for FY 2022–2025 and advised that funds were “available for obligation.”\n\nOn January 20, 2025, the President issued Executive Order No. 14154 (“Unleashing American Energy”), directing agencies to immediately pause disbursement of IIJA and IRA funds, including NEVI. On January 29, 2025, DOT issued Order 2100.7 setting new departmental policy priorities. On February 6, 2025, FHWA sent states a letter rescinding current and prior NEVI guidance, “suspending” approval of all state plans for all fiscal years, and barring any new obligations until new guidance issued and new plans were submitted and approved. The states allege this action effectively froze approximately $2.74 billion in unobligated NEVI funds and derailed state projects and procurements that had relied on prior approvals.\n\nThe plaintiff states brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), alleging agency action in excess of statutory authority, arbitrary and capricious action, and action not in accordance with law and without observance of procedures required by law; constitutional claims alleging violation of the separation of powers and the Take Care Clause; and a common law ultra vires claim. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including vacatur, to restore plan approvals and prevent withholding of NEVI funds except as permitted by IIJA; they also sought fees under 28 U.S.C. § 2412.\n\nThe case is before Judge Tana Lin. The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on May 7, 2025; the Court heard argument on June 17, 2025. On June 24, 2025, the Court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The Court held the claims were ripe and challenged final agency action. On the merits, the Court found plaintiffs likely to succeed on their APA claims because DOT/FHWA exceeded IIJA’s statutory limits by categorically revoking state plan approvals and withholding funds without following IIJA’s procedures, and acted arbitrarily and capriciously by offering no reasoned explanation or consideration of alternatives and reliance interests. The Court also found a likely separation-of-powers violation, holding the Executive cannot refuse to distribute congressionally appropriated, formula-based funds to pursue policy preferences expressed in an executive order. The Court found irreparable harm in halted procurements, lost site hosts, delayed construction, administrative disruption, and budgeting uncertainty, and found the balance of equities and public interest favored enforcing the statute.\n\nRelief: The Court enjoined DOT and FHWA from (a) suspending or revoking— or maintaining any suspension or revocation of—previously approved State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans of the following plaintiffs: Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin; and (b) withholding or withdrawing NEVI Formula Program funds for any such previously approved plans for any reason not set forth in IIJA or applicable FHWA regulations, or without following IIJA’s substantive and procedural requirements, including by refusing to review or process authorization requests to obligate funds. The injunction was stayed for seven days to allow an appeal; defendants did not appeal, and the stay was lifted on July 2, 2025. The injunction remains in effect pending further order. The motion was denied as to the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont for lack of a sufficient evidentiary showing of irreparable harm at the preliminary injunction stage.\n\nSubsequent proceedings: Defendants filed the administrative record on July 7, 2025. The Court set a dispositive motions schedule (as amended, cross-motions beginning August–September 2025). The intervenors’ motion to intervene was granted on July 23, 2025. The case remains pending on the merits.\n\nFactual context: The plaintiffs allege FHWA’s February 6, 2025 letter rescinded NEVI guidance and retroactively canceled all states’ plan approvals, blocking obligation of formula funds previously “made available.” States report canceled solicitations and contracts, inability to obligate or draw funds in the federal portal (codes marked “expired”), lost private partners and site hosts, and project delays that undermine state clean transportation, public health, and economic programs that Congress intended to support through NEVI.\n\nLegal foundation: The action is primarily under the APA (5 U.S.C. § 706) to enforce the IIJA’s NEVI provisions (Pub. L. 117-58), with constitutional claims grounded in the separation of powers (Article I spending/appropriations authority) and Article II’s Take Care Clause. Remedies sought are declaratory judgments, injunctive relief (preliminary and permanent), and vacatur of the suspension, with the Court retaining jurisdiction to enforce compliance.",
    "46259": "Filed March 13, 2025, this suit in the Southern District of New York is brought by eight Columbia University and Barnard College students proceeding under pseudonyms. They sue Columbia University and its trustees (including Columbia’s interim/acting president in her official capacity), the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce and its chair in his official capacity, and several federal officials in their official capacities. Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR National Legal Defense Fund and CAIR–New York). Columbia is represented by private counsel; the Congressional defendants are represented by the House Office of General Counsel; and the federal agency officials are represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nPlaintiffs challenge two sets of government actions they say unlawfully chill their speech and associational rights regarding Palestine-related campus advocacy. First, they target a February 13, 2025 letter from the House Committee requesting “all disciplinary records” concerning eleven specified Columbia incidents, asserting that, in context, it is an overbroad, viewpoint-based demand intended to expose and deter student speech (citing prior disclosures and an October 31, 2024 House report). Second, they challenge Executive Branch actions, including March 2025 announcements pausing or canceling federal funding to Columbia and a March 13, 2025 joint letter from federal agencies setting “preconditions” for continued funding (expulsions or multi‑year suspensions for encampment/Hamilton Hall cases; eliminating Columbia’s University Judicial Board and centralizing discipline; a mask ban; “academic receivership” of the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies department; empowering campus law enforcement; and adopting an IHRA-aligned definition of antisemitism). Plaintiffs allege these acts “jawbone” Columbia to punish and suppress disfavored viewpoints and compel disclosure of protected associations, violating the First Amendment. They also assert that the federal funding measures violate the Administrative Procedure Act and Title VI’s procedures, and that Columbia breached contractual obligations to protect free expression and student privacy under its rules and policies.\n\nThe constitutional and statutory bases include the First Amendment’s Free Speech and Association protections (including associational privacy), the APA, and Title VI; state-law breach of contract claims are asserted against Columbia. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief (including to bar disclosure of student disciplinary records to Congress, to enjoin enforcement of the federal agencies’ March 13 measures and funding pauses, and to restrain Columbia from complying with the congressional and agency demands) and damages for harms allegedly caused by prior disclosures. The suit is not a class action.\n\nJudge Arun Subramanian initially entered a temporary order on March 20, 2025, enjoining Columbia from producing the specified student records pending a March 25 hearing. On April 4, 2025, the Court denied the motion for a temporary restraining order without prejudice, vacated the temporary injunction, and required Columbia to give plaintiffs and the Court at least 30 days’ notice before furnishing to Congress any student records or student identities in records already produced. The Court observed that plaintiffs had not adequately addressed standing and irreparable harm as to the federal agencies’ March 13 letter and Columbia’s announced measures, and held that the Speech or Debate Clause barred the specific interim relief sought against the Congressional defendants. The Court granted leave to amend.\n\nPlaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint on April 18, 2025, expanding allegations to include the March 13 agency letter and ensuing Columbia announcements. On May 14, 2025, the Court entered a protective order safeguarding the pseudonymous plaintiffs’ personally identifying information in filings and discovery. Plaintiffs later voluntarily dismissed, without prejudice, the individual-capacity claims against the federal officials while maintaining official-capacity claims.\n\nThree motions to dismiss are pending: by the Congressional defendants (asserting Speech or Debate Clause immunity, Rule 19 issues, sovereign immunity, standing, and failure to state a First Amendment claim), by the federal agency officials (addressing APA/Title VI and First Amendment issues), and by Columbia (contesting state action, First Amendment and contract claims). Plaintiffs have opposed; replies were filed July 11, 2025. Plaintiffs also moved for a preliminary injunction on June 20, 2025; briefing (including sur-replies) concluded in August 2025. Amicus briefs in support of plaintiffs were permitted (Palestine Legal; Defending Rights & Dissent).\n\nKey factual allegations include: prior House subpoenas to Columbia in 2024; a House staff report on October 31, 2024 summarizing disciplinary matters; doxing and harassment plaintiffs link to earlier disclosures; the February 13, 2025 House Committee letter requesting disciplinary records tied to eleven incidents (including the Hamilton Hall occupation); March 2025 announcements pausing/canceling Columbia’s federal funds; and a March 13, 2025 agency letter listing policy “preconditions” for continued funding. Plaintiffs allege Columbia has taken steps consistent with those demands (including discipline announcements, disciplinary system changes, a mask policy, and increased public safety authority), which they assert chills their speech and threatens associational privacy.\n\nThere are no reported opinions, trials, or final judgments to date. No appeals have been taken. The Court’s principal rulings so far are the April 4, 2025 order denying TRO (without prejudice), imposing a 30‑day notice requirement before further student‑record disclosures to Congress, granting leave to amend, and the protective order governing plaintiffs’ identities and related material. The case remains in the motion‑to‑dismiss and preliminary‑injunction posture before Judge Subramanian.",
    "46557": "On May 5, 2025, a coalition of nineteen states and the District of Columbia sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), its Secretary, and leaders of several HHS components in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The plaintiff States—represented by their state attorneys general—challenge HHS’s March 27, 2025 announcement to terminate approximately 10,000 HHS employees and reorganize the Department’s sub‑agencies and regional offices (the “March 27 Communiqué”). The defendants are the agency heads and their agencies, including HHS and its Secretary; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its Acting Director; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and its Commissioner; the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and its Acting Assistant Secretary; the Administration for Community Living (ACL) and its Principal Deputy Administrator; and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and its Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary. This is not a class action.\n\nThe States allege that HHS’s mass reduction‑in‑force (RIF) and reorganization unlawfully disable congressionally mandated programs and disregard appropriations. They bring claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), asserting the March 27 actions are final agency action that is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, and seek equitable relief for ultra vires conduct. They also allege constitutional violations of the separation of powers and the Appropriations Clause. Jurisdiction is invoked under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and the APA (5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704), with requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, vacatur under 5 U.S.C. § 706, a stay under § 705, and fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act. The case was assigned to Judge Melissa R. DuBose.\n\nFactual context centers on the administration’s workforce actions culminating in HHS’s March 27 plan to terminate about 10,000 employees, consolidate HHS’s divisions from 28 to 15, close five of ten regional offices, and create a new “Administration for a Healthy America.” On April 1, 2025, termination notices placed affected employees on administrative leave with terminations to take effect in June. The States assert the RIF and reorganization halted or impaired CDC infectious‑disease labs, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health (OSH), the FDA Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), the Office of Head Start (including regional support), and ASPE’s federal poverty guidelines work, among others. They cite Secretary statements acknowledging anticipated “mistakes” and a deliberate decision to avoid “line‑by‑line” review due to speed and “political momentum.”\n\nOn May 9, 2025, the States moved for a preliminary injunction aimed at halting implementation of the RIF and reorganization as to specific programs. After expedited briefing and a May 20 hearing, the court granted the motion on July 1, 2025. Judge DuBose held that: (1) the States have standing; (2) the claims are not channeled to the MSPB/FLRA under the Civil Service Reform Act; (3) the Tucker Act does not deprive the court of jurisdiction; and (4) the March 27 Communiqué is reviewable final agency action. On the merits, the court found a strong likelihood of success on the APA claims: the Department failed to offer a reasoned explanation, failed to consider important aspects and reliance interests, and acted contrary to law by disabling programs Congress mandated and funded. The court found irreparable harm (loss of critical health services, data, technical support, and program funding/oversight), and that the balance of equities and public interest favored relief. The court set a $100 bond.\n\nThe injunction initially enjoined HHS from implementing or enforcing the March 27 RIFs or reorganization for the targeted programs, including prohibiting further execution or issuance of RIF notices or additional administrative leave placements, and required a status report. On July 18, 2025, the court denied defendants’ motion to vacate the injunction or stay it pending appeal, noting Supreme Court stay orders in other cases did not control this case, which challenges the HHS Communiqué itself. On August 12, 2025, the court clarified the injunction’s scope to these components and programs: FDA’s CTP; the Office of Head Start and Head Start regional office staff; CDC’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention (NCHHSTP), Division of Reproductive Health (DRH), NIOSH, OSH, National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), and National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD); and ASPE’s Division of Data and Technical Analysis (which updates the Federal Poverty Guidelines). The court reiterated the prohibition on further executing existing RIFs, issuing new RIFs, or placing additional employees on administrative leave within those identified components and programs, pending further order.\n\nNo trial has been held and no settlement has been reached. On August 12, 2025, the defendants noticed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (No. 25‑1780). A motion to dismiss was filed in the district court on August 15, 2025; briefing schedules were set, and a status report was filed regarding injunction compliance.\n\nJudge: Melissa R. DuBose.\n\nCause of Action and Legal Bases: APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (arbitrary and capricious; contrary to law); equitable ultra vires; constitutional claims under Article I (Separation of Powers; Appropriations Clause, art. I, § 9, cl. 7) and Article II (Take Care Clause).\n\nRemedy Sought: Declaratory and injunctive relief, vacatur of the March 27 action, a stay of agency action pending review, and attorneys’ fees.\n\nImportant Filings and Rulings:\n- Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (May 9, 2025).\n- Memorandum and Order granting preliminary injunction (July 1, 2025) (ECF No. 73): enjoined implementation of the March 27 RIF/reorganization as to specified programs; $100 bond.\n- Order denying defendants’ motion to vacate or stay pending appeal (July 18, 2025) (ECF No. 81).\n- Order clarifying scope of injunction (Aug. 12, 2025) (ECF No. 89): enumerated covered CDC components, CTP, OHS and regional staff, and ASPE’s Division of Data and Technical Analysis; reiterated prohibition on executing/issuing RIFs or placing additional employees on leave within those programs.\n- Notice of Appeal to the First Circuit (Aug. 12, 2025) (No. 25‑1780).\n- Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Aug. 15, 2025) (pending).\n\nDecree Terms and Duration: The preliminary injunction (as clarified on Aug. 12, 2025) enjoins HHS from (a) any further execution of any existing RIF notices (including final separations), (b) issuance of any further RIF notices, and (c) placing additional employees on administrative leave, with respect to FDA’s CTP; OHS and Head Start regional office staff; CDC’s NCHHSTP, DRH, NIOSH, OSH, NCEH, and NCBDDD; and ASPE’s Division of Data and Technical Analysis. The injunction remains in effect “until further order of the Court,” and the court directed status reporting on compliance.\n\nRelated Proceedings: The court referenced other contemporaneous cases concerning similar federal workforce and reorganization actions, including Somerville Public Schools v. McMahon (D. Mass.), Rhode Island v. Trump (D.R.I.), American Federation of Government Employees v. Trump (N.D. Cal.), Wiley v. Kennedy (S.D.W. Va.), and Widakuswara v. Lake (D.D.C.), but none were consolidated with this case.\n\nFactual Basis: The States contend HHS’s March 27 plan and April 1 RIF notices abruptly removed thousands of personnel and curtailed or halted operations across multiple public‑health programs—such as CDC infectious‑disease laboratories, NIOSH’s statutory safety programs (including respirator approvals and coal miner health surveillance), OSH’s tobacco‑control functions, FDA CTP’s compliance and product review, ACF’s Head Start oversight and regional technical assistance, and ASPE’s poverty‑guideline work—making it impossible to carry out statutory mandates and to spend appropriated funds. The court found a likelihood that the March 27 action is final agency action that is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, causing ongoing irreparable harm to the States and their residents.",
    "46511": "Filed April 29, 2025 in the District of Maryland, this suit is brought by twenty‑four states and the District of Columbia, together with the Governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania in their official capacities, against the federal national‑service agency (the Corporation for National and Community Service, operating as AmeriCorps) and the agency’s interim head. The states are represented by their Attorneys General; the defendants are represented by the U.S. Department of Justice. This is not a class action.\n\nThe case challenges an April 2025 sequence of agency actions undertaken after presidential executive orders directing “workforce optimization” and grant “cost efficiency” reviews. According to the complaint and record, AmeriCorps: (1) on April 15 ordered all National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) members off assignment and onto administrative hold through April 30, to be exited from the program; (2) on April 16 placed about 85% of agency staff on administrative leave and, on April 24, began issuing reduction‑in‑force notices; and (3) on April 25 issued after‑hours termination letters to grant recipients nationwide, ending roughly 1,031 programs and about $396.5 million in funding, instructing immediate cessation of activities and directing that AmeriCorps members be exited for “compelling personal circumstances.” The termination notices cited 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). The states allege these steps abruptly halted state‑administered service programs, removed AmeriCorps and VISTA members from service, and disrupted disaster relief, public health, education, veterans’ support, and conservation projects.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert: (i) claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706, that the actions were contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and taken without procedures required by law; (ii) a constitutional separation‑of‑powers claim (Article I’s power of the purse and the Article II Take Care Clause); and (iii) ultra vires action. Central to the APA claims, the states rely on a rider Congress placed in AmeriCorps’s appropriation—incorporated for FY 2025—that “[the agency] shall make any significant changes to program requirements, service delivery or policy only through public notice and comment rulemaking.” They also point to statutory safeguards for grant terminations, including notice and an opportunity to be heard, 42 U.S.C. § 12636.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, the states moved for a stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 and a preliminary injunction seeking to vacate the NCCC demobilization, staff actions, and the mass grant terminations, and to restore programs and members. After a May 19 hearing, Judge Deborah L. Boardman issued a June 5, 2025 memorandum opinion and order granting a preliminary injunction in part. The court held that the April 25 mass closure of programs and the April 15 removal of all NCCC members were discrete, final agency actions reviewable under the APA, and that the NCCC action was not “committed to agency discretion” (distinguishing Lincoln v. Vigil). The court found the states had standing to challenge the program closures and NCCC removals, but not the internal staffing reductions (administrative leave and RIF). It rejected the argument that the Tucker Act required the case to proceed in the Court of Federal Claims, distinguishing cases in which plaintiffs sought contract damages rather than equitable relief for statutory violations.\n\nOn the merits, the court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on their claim that the agency failed to use notice‑and‑comment rulemaking as Congress required before making “significant changes” to service delivery; the mass program closures and removal of all NCCC members qualified as such changes. The court also found irreparable harm to the states and their programs, and that the equities and public interest favored relief. The court therefore: (1) enjoined enforcement in the plaintiff states of the April 25 grant terminations, the instruction to cease award activities, the removal of VISTA members, and the exiting of AmeriCorps members; (2) ordered restoration of the affected programs in the plaintiff states by reinstating the terminated grants and returning AmeriCorps and VISTA members to service if willing and able; (3) enjoined the April 15 removal of NCCC members and ordered their return to service (recognizing the national structure of NCCC deployments); and (4) required the agency to comply with the appropriations‑rider notice‑and‑comment requirement before making significant changes in service delivery. The court denied relief as to the internal staffing actions. It set a nominal bond of $100 per plaintiff and directed status reporting. The court denied as moot the request for a § 705 stay.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s June 27, 2025 decision in Trump v. CASA limiting universal injunctions, the court modified its injunction on July 10, 2025 to clarify that the notice‑and‑comment compliance requirement applies to significant service‑delivery changes that harm the plaintiff states. Other terms (restoration of programs in the plaintiff states and return of NCCC members to service) remained in effect. The injunction expressly preserves the agency’s ability to suspend or terminate individual grants for cause under applicable law and to discharge individual AmeriCorps, VISTA, or NCCC members consistent with governing statutes and regulations.\n\nProcedurally, the court held an on‑the‑record status conference on July 14, 2025, and directed periodic status reports. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 24, 2025, and a second motion for preliminary injunction on August 7, 2025. No trial has occurred, and no appeal is reflected on the docket. The case remains pending, with the modified preliminary injunction in place until further order.\n\nLegal foundation and relief sought: The plaintiffs proceed under the APA, citing the FY 2024 Appropriations Act § 401 (as incorporated for FY 2025), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12501 et seq., 4950 et seq., and procedural protections in 42 U.S.C. § 12636; they also allege violations of the separation of powers and ultra vires action. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief, vacatur of the challenged actions, and restoration of programs and members. Judge: Deborah L. Boardman. No cases were consolidated; the opinion noted related executive‑branch litigation elsewhere but none was joined here.",
    "46350": "On April 7, 2025, two organizations—the American Library Association (a nonprofit membership association of libraries and librarians) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (a labor union representing library workers)—filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), its Acting Director, the President, the Office of Management and Budget and its Director, and entities and officials associated with the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The case challenges implementation of a March 14, 2025 Executive Order entitled “Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,” which directs IMLS and other identified entities to be “eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law,” to reduce their statutory functions and personnel to the minimum required by law, and to report to OMB what functions are statutorily required. Plaintiffs are represented by Democracy Forward Foundation and private counsel.\n\nIMLS is an independent agency created by statute to support museum and library services nationwide, including mandatory duties to conduct research and data collection and to award specified grants, such as state formula grants, tribal and Native Hawaiian grants, and national leadership grants. Congress appropriated nearly $300 million to IMLS through September 30, 2025.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that, following the Executive Order, DOGE personnel entered IMLS; on March 31, 2025, nearly all IMLS staff were placed on administrative leave and cut off from agency systems; on April 3, 2025, termination notices were issued to virtually all staff, retaining about a dozen; and on April 4, 2025, all 23 members of the National Museum and Library Services Board were removed. Beginning April 1, 2025, IMLS began terminating grants, including state grants and two ALA grants, stating they were “no longer consistent with the agency’s priorities,” and citing the Executive Order. Plaintiffs cite resulting harms, including service disruptions, temporary closure and layoffs at the Maine State Library, and cancellation of contracts for nationwide library data collection.\n\nThe complaint asserts six causes of action: (1) separation-of-powers (nonstatutory ultra vires) for unilaterally dismantling a congressionally created agency; (2) violation of the Take Care Clause; (3) Administrative Procedure Act (APA) § 706(2) claims that the actions are arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law (including alleged conflicts with the MLSA, appropriations, the Impoundment Control Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act), and in excess of statutory authority; (4) APA § 706(1) to compel unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed mandatory action (e.g., awarding and disbursing grants and maintaining required data collections); (5) ultra vires; and (6) First Amendment (viewpoint discrimination tied to stated “patriotism” priorities). Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders to halt dissolution efforts, reinstate staff and the Board, reopen the agency and systems, restore grants and contracts, and require compliance with statutory mandates.\n\nJudge Richard J. Leon presides. Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on April 10, 2025. After an April 30 hearing, the Court converted the motion to a TRO and, on May 1, 2025, entered a temporary restraining order (partly granting and partly denying relief) and later extended it to May 29, 2025 while supplemental briefing proceeded. Defendants moved for reconsideration and submitted supplemental authority, including a D.C. Circuit stay order in a related USAGM case and a Supreme Court per curiam decision.\n\nOn June 6, 2025, the Court denied plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction without prejudice and denied defendants’ reconsideration motion as moot. In its memorandum opinion, the Court concluded plaintiffs had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits principally because the Court likely lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over core aspects of the requested relief. Relying on Department of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025) (per curiam), and the D.C. Circuit’s ruling in Widakuswara v. Lake (USAGM), the Court held that claims effectively seeking specific performance of government grant agreements sound in contract and fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, rather than the APA. The Court also emphasized that plaintiffs’ request for broad, “wholesale” programmatic relief under the APA (to undo alleged agency dismantling) is not cognizable under APA review. The Court therefore declined preliminary injunctive relief and denied a subsequent, narrower TRO motion as moot.\n\nNo trial has occurred, and no appeal is reflected on the docket. On June 17, 2025, the Court set a merits schedule: defendants to produce the administrative record (filed July 15, 2025); plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion (extended to September 5, 2025); defendants’ combined opposition, cross-motion, and motion to dismiss (due October 3, 2025); plaintiffs’ combined reply/response (due October 24, 2025); and defendants’ reply (due November 7, 2025). The case remains pending on the merits.\n\nRelated proceedings referenced by the parties and the Court include Widakuswara v. Lake (D.C. Cir. orders addressing USAGM grant and personnel actions), Department of Education v. California (Supreme Court stay addressing grant terminations), and Rhode Island v. Trump (D.R.I. preliminary injunction addressing IMLS grants). The record reflects plaintiffs’ factual allegations that IMLS staff were placed on administrative leave and later terminated, that the Board was removed, that multiple grants and contracts were terminated citing the Executive Order and “agency priorities,” and that libraries and grantees began experiencing immediate operational impacts.",
    "46746": "Filed June 27, 2025, in the Southern District of Florida by two environmental nonprofits—Friends of the Everglades (a Florida 501(c)(3)) and the Center for Biological Diversity (a national 501(c)(3))—this suit challenges the rapid construction and use of a large immigration detention facility at the Dade‑Collier Training and Transition Airport (the “TNT” site) within the Big Cypress National Preserve. The defendants are the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary and ICE Acting Director (federal defendants), the Executive Director of Florida’s Division of Emergency Management (FDEM), and Miami‑Dade County (the airport owner). Plaintiffs are represented by Earthjustice (public‑interest counsel), private counsel (Coffey Burlington, P.L.), and CBD’s in‑house counsel; the federal defendants are represented by the U.S. Department of Justice (ENRD), the State is represented by the Florida Attorney General and private counsel, and Miami‑Dade by the County Attorney.\n\nPlaintiffs allege the defendants approved, funded, constructed, and are operating a detention and deportation center—publicly dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz”—for up to several thousand detainees at the TNT site without complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq., and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. They assert the project’s location inside or adjacent to protected Everglades resources (including habitat for the Florida panther, Florida bonneted bat, Everglade snail kite, and wood stork) and within the footprint of the Western Everglades Restoration Plan creates significant environmental risks. The complaint also pleads state‑law claims (ultra vires under Florida law against FDEM and violations of Miami‑Dade County code), and Plaintiffs provided notice of intent to add Endangered Species Act claims after the 60‑day notice period. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief halting construction and use of the TNT site for immigration detention unless and until NEPA and related laws are satisfied, plus fees and costs.\n\nOn the day of filing, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO and preliminary injunction. After reassignment, the district court (Judge Kathleen M. Williams) set expedited proceedings and, on July 28, 2025, granted limited expedited discovery. The court ordered production by August 4, 2025 of agreements among DHS/ICE/FEMA and FDEM or other state/local agencies applicable to use of the TNT site (including any 287(g) agreements, IGSAs, MOUs, and basic ordering agreements) and any environmental study in Defendants’ possession.\n\nFollowing two days of testimony on August 6–7, 2025, the court entered a narrow TRO (August 7) prohibiting additional industrial lighting, paving, filling, excavating, fencing, or site expansion through the TRO period, based on a preliminary record showing DHS/ICE oversight under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g) and lack of any NEPA review. The court continued the evidentiary hearing on August 12–13, 2025. Witnesses included Friends’ members, a state legislator who toured the site, Tribe environmental officials, ecology and hydrology experts, and the head of the Florida Highway Patrol. Evidence showed approximately 800,000 square feet of newly paved surfaces, installation of industrial‑style lighting, generator and waste systems, detainee housing and support facilities, ongoing ICE presence and inspections, and detainee transport and deportation activity at the site. The court received testimony on risks to wetlands hydrology and low‑nutrient Everglades systems from increased runoff, light impacts to nocturnal species, traffic‑related panther mortality risks, loss or impairment of recreation and access in adjacent preserve lands, and asserted federal funding commitments (including a FEMA program for detention support) alongside existing 287(g) agreements that place immigration enforcement under DHS/ICE direction and supervision.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, the court issued an 82‑page Omnibus Order granting in part and denying in part preliminary injunctive relief and denying the State and Federal Defendants’ venue challenges. The court held venue proper in the Southern District of Florida under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C) (plaintiff‑residence venue where “no real property is involved,” because the action challenged NEPA compliance rather than title or possessory interests), and alternatively under § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1)(B) because a substantial part of the events and omissions occurred in this district (Miami‑Dade ownership; ICE Miami field office supervision of 287(g) operations; detainee movement between Miami‑Dade facilities and TNT; localized impacts and Tribe activities within Miami‑Dade). The court declined to transfer the case.\n\nOn the merits, the court concluded Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their APA‑based NEPA claims. It found “major Federal action” because immigration enforcement at the TNT facility operates under 287(g) agreements that require ICE direction and supervision, use ICE policies and detention standards, and involve federal custody decisions and site inspections, together with evidence of DHS/FEMA funding commitments specific to the project. The court further held the absence of any NEPA Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement—coupled with the project’s rapid construction and operation—constituted final agency action reviewable under the APA. The court rejected arguments that INA § 1252 or § 1226(e) barred jurisdiction, noting Plaintiffs sought NEPA compliance and environmental process, not to halt immigration enforcement or individual removal decisions.\n\nAs to irreparable harm, the court found ongoing and likely environmental harms—runoff and stormwater concerns from extensive new impervious surfaces in an interconnected, low‑nutrient wetland; increased sky brightness and noise affecting wildlife and recreation; impeded Tribe access; and species‑specific risks (e.g., to panthers and bonneted bats)—that cannot be redressed by money damages if the project expands pending review. Balancing harms and the public interest, the court limited relief to preserve the status quo and allow a safe transition while NEPA compliance proceeds.\n\nPreliminary Injunction (August 21, 2025):  \n- Prohibits the State and Federal Defendants, and those acting in concert with them (including contractors), from installing any additional industrial‑style lighting, or doing any paving, filling, excavating, fencing, or other site expansion (including new buildings, tents, dormitories, or administrative facilities) at TNT.  \n- Prohibits bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already detained there when the order took effect.  \n- Permits modifications or repairs to existing facilities solely to increase safety or mitigate environmental or other risks.  \n- Requires removal, within 60 days (as population attrition allows safe implementation), of temporary fencing installed for the detention project, the industrial “Sunbelt” lighting and any additional lighting installed for detention use, and generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and receptacles installed to support the project.  \n- Sets a $100 bond.  \n\nThe court denied Plaintiffs’ broader request to fully close the site or order detainee release, and it withdrew earlier TRO relief as moot.\n\nAppeals and Stay Requests: The State and Federal Defendants filed interlocutory appeals (notices filed August 21 and 23, 2025) and moved to stay the injunction pending appeal in the district court (denied August 27, 2025) and in the Eleventh Circuit (No. 25‑12873). In those filings, they argue improper venue, no reviewable final or major federal action, statutory bars under the INA, lack of irreparable harm, and inequitable public‑interest impacts. As of the materials provided, the appeals and stay motions are pending.\n\nOther Proceedings: On July 28, 2025, the court granted limited expedited discovery focused on intergovernmental agreements and any existing environmental studies; it reserved on broader discovery and denied other interim motions as moot after ruling on the preliminary injunction. The Miccosukee Tribe was granted intervention (July 30, 2025) and joined in the request for injunctive relief based on environmental impacts to Tribal resources.\n\nCounsel of Record: Plaintiffs—Earthjustice (public‑interest counsel) and Coffey Burlington, P.L.; CBD’s in‑house counsel. Federal Defendants—U.S. Department of Justice, Environment & Natural Resources Division. State—Florida Attorney General’s Office and Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. Miami‑Dade County—County Attorney’s Office.\n\nJudge: Hon. Kathleen M. Williams, U.S. District Judge, Southern District of Florida.\n\nRelief Sought and Status: Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and an injunction halting construction and use of the TNT site for immigration detention unless and until NEPA/APA compliance occurs, along with state‑law declarations, and fees. The court granted a tailored preliminary injunction preserving the status quo, limiting site expansion and intake, and ordering removal of certain temporary infrastructure within 60 days, while allowing necessary safety measures. The case remains pending; appeals and stay requests are in progress. Related litigation by detainees (C.M. v. Noem) is noted in the record but proceeds separately.",
    "46388": "On April 11, 2025, two faculty organizations sued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts—later joined by a labor union representing Harvard academic workers—challenging federal actions that threatened and then cut off billions in federal research funds to Harvard University. The case is before Judge Allison D. Burroughs. Plaintiffs are: (1) a Harvard faculty chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP‑Harvard), (2) the national AAUP, and (3) the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), which represents graduate student workers and non‑student academic workers at Harvard. They are represented by private counsel at Selendy Gay PLLC and Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC. Defendants are multiple federal agencies and officials, including the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Education (ED), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Energy (DOE), National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Defense (DOD), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), along with agency heads and senior officials in their official capacities.\n\nThe suit arises from a series of federal actions in 2025 following Executive Order 14188 (“Additional Measures to Combat Anti‑Semitism”) and the DOJ’s creation of a multi‑agency “Task Force to Combat Anti‑Semitism.” On March 31, 2025, HHS, ED, and GSA announced a “comprehensive review” of Harvard’s federal contracts and grants because of alleged failures to protect Jewish students, referencing more than $255.6 million in grants and $8.7 billion in multi‑year commitments. On April 3, 2025, the Task Force sent Harvard a letter outlining “preconditions” to remain a federal grantee, including: overhauling student discipline with senior‑leader control; a “comprehensive mask ban”; shuttering all DEI programs; adopting “merit‑based” admissions and hiring; auditing and expanding “viewpoint diversity” department‑by‑department; and governance and leadership changes. A second letter on April 11 demanded further measures, such as federal audits of admissions and hiring through at least 2028, immediate reporting to DHS of foreign students who commit conduct violations, sanctions for faculty found to have discriminated, annual “viewpoint diversity” audits and hiring or admissions to create a “critical mass” of diverse viewpoints, and periodic certified reports to the government. Neither letter identified specific Title VI findings or explained how the demands were tailored to any violation.\n\nHarvard responded on April 14, 2025, stating it would not accept the government’s conditions, asserting they contravened the First Amendment and statutory procedures. Hours later, HHS/ED/GSA announced a freeze of $2.2 billion in multi‑year grants and $60 million in contracts to Harvard. On May 5, 2025, the Secretary of Education sent Harvard a letter declaring Harvard should “no longer seek GRANTS” because “none will be provided,” citing generalized concerns about discrimination and governance and referencing the earlier demands. Then, on May 6, 2025, NIH notified Harvard of the termination of roughly $2.2 billion in NIH awards (658 grants). Between May 9 and May 12, 2025, USDA, DOE, DOD, NSF, and HUD sent additional letters terminating awards (collectively totaling approximately $2.7 billion, including the NIH terminations). Many of these termination letters cited 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) (asserting the awards no longer effectuated agency priorities), while also invoking allegations of antisemitism and race discrimination and Harvard’s refusal to adopt the Task Force’s demands. NASA on May 9 terminated several grants as “not mission essential.” The agencies’ administrative records, as described by Plaintiffs, do not include formal Title VI findings, pre‑termination notices or hearings, or congressional reports tied to termination, and several letters do not explain how specific awards failed to further agency program goals beyond the generalized civil‑rights allegations.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that these actions violate: (1) the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as contrary to law and without required procedure under Title VI (42 U.S.C. § 2000d‑1) and implementing regulations (requiring notice, findings, voluntary compliance efforts, hearing on the record, and congressional notice before termination, and limiting termination to affected programs); and (2) the APA’s arbitrary‑and‑capricious standard because the agencies failed to provide a reasoned explanation, relied on conclusory assertions, ignored reliance interests, and did not link terminations to particular programs. Plaintiffs also assert (3) First Amendment violations (coercion to suppress protected speech and academic freedom; viewpoint and content discrimination; and retaliation tied to Harvard’s refusal to accept the demands), (4) constitutional separation‑of‑powers/Spending Clause violations (imposing non‑statutory conditions and usurping Congress’s appropriations authority), and (5) Fifth Amendment due process violations (lack of fair notice, vague standards, deprivation without hearing). They seek declaratory relief setting aside the funding review, freezes, terminations, and conditions, and permanent injunctions barring further funding conditions or terminations absent lawful procedures and prohibiting the use of funding leverage to coerce suppression of speech. They also seek fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.\n\nProcedurally, Plaintiffs filed their complaint on April 11, 2025, and a TRO motion the same day (later withdrawn). An Amended Complaint (May 5, 2025) added UAW and later federal‑agency defendants; a Second Amended Complaint (filed with leave on May 20, 2025) captured the May terminations and added DOE, NSF, DOD, NASA, USDA, and HUD defendants. The Court set an expedited schedule (shared with a related case brought by Harvard University, President & Fellows of Harvard College v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Services, No. 1:25‑cv‑11048). The government produced administrative records in mid‑to‑late May 2025. Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on June 2, 2025; multiple amici filed in support (e.g., Leadership Now Project, Public Citizen, A Jewish Voice for Peace, Muslim Legal Fund of America). Defendants filed a cross‑motion for summary judgment and opposition on June 16, 2025. The Court held oral argument on the cross‑motions on July 21–22, 2025 and took the matter under advisement. No ruling has issued yet.\n\nPlaintiffs’ factual submissions describe widespread research disruptions and layoffs at Harvard following the freeze and terminations, including halted clinical studies, loss of unique data and biospecimens, layoffs or furloughs, and student and postdoctoral funding losses. They also recount instances where Harvard altered campus policies after the government demands (e.g., centralized student discipline for cross‑school cases; the closing or renaming of DEI offices and withdrawal of funding for certain affinity celebrations), and attest to a chilling effect on faculty and student speech and research in areas perceived as disfavored by the government.\n\nRelated proceedings include the Harvard University suit challenging the NIH payment freeze (No. 1:25‑cv‑11048) with coordinated briefing, and a separate case in which Harvard obtained a TRO against DHS’s revocation of its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification (No. 1:25‑cv‑11472). There are no trials, decrees, or settlements in this case to date. The Court has granted leave for several amicus briefs and held a summary‑judgment hearing; appeals have not been filed. Plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief to restore lawfully awarded funds, set aside grant terminations and the prospective grant “ineligibility” policy, and bar further use of federal funding to coerce changes affecting academic freedom and speech.",
    "46625": "Filed May 21, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (No. 1:25‑cv‑01643‑APM), this class action was brought by five nonprofit organizations—Vera Institute of Justice (NY), Center for Children & Youth Justice (WA), Chinese for Affirmative Action d/b/a Stop AAPI Hate (CA), FORCE Detroit (MI), and Health Resources in Action (MA)—against the U.S. Department of Justice, the Attorney General (Pamela J. Bondi), the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), and OJP’s Acting Head (Maureen A. Henneberg). Plaintiffs are represented by the Democracy Forward Foundation (public-interest counsel) and Perry Law (private counsel). The DOJ Civil Division, Federal Programs Branch, represents Defendants.\n\nPlaintiffs challenge OJP’s April 2025 termination—via identical email notices—of more than 370 multi‑year DOJ/OJP grants and cooperative agreements totaling over $820 million. OJP invoked 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4), stating each award “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” and asserted changed Department priorities (e.g., directly supporting law enforcement, combatting violent crime, protecting children, supporting victims of trafficking/sexual assault, and improving law enforcement coordination). The notices directed immediate cessation of work, limited reimbursement to pre‑termination costs, and allowed a 30‑day administrative appeal. Plaintiffs alleged no prior individualized notice or explanation, unreimbursed expenses at the time of cut‑off, and abrupt program shutdowns affecting, among others, community violence intervention, victim services (including sign language interpretation for Deaf victims), behavioral health crisis response planning, and prosecutor diversion initiatives.\n\nPlaintiffs asserted claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. § 706): (1) arbitrary and capricious agency action for en masse terminations with only boilerplate justifications and (2) action contrary to law because § 200.340 requires termination authority to be clearly specified in the award’s terms and (they contend) does not permit post‑award priority changes to justify termination. Constitutional claims alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause (lack of pre‑deprivation process; vagueness) and violations of the separation of powers, the Spending and Appropriations Clauses, and the Take Care Clause (asserting an Executive refusal to spend appropriated funds). Plaintiffs also pleaded an equitable ultra vires claim. They sought declaratory relief; to vacate and set aside the terminations; preliminary and permanent injunctions halting terminations and re‑obligations; a stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705; and an order directing OJP to resume customary disbursements.\n\nKey proceedings and rulings:  \n- May 22, 2025: Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction and for class certification (proposed class: all entities whose OJP awards were terminated in April 2025 under § 200.340(a)(4)). Multiple amici supported Plaintiffs, including 18 States and the District of Columbia; other amici also appeared.  \n- June 9, 2025: Defendants opposed, moved to dismiss, and opposed class certification. OJP’s declaration stated DOJ/OJP leadership conducted a multi‑month, individualized review of awards and terminated 376 awards out of more than 11,000 open awards; 139 appeals were filed, and some terminations had been reversed on appeal.  \n- June 26, 2025: The Court (Judge Amit P. Mehta) held a hearing.  \n- July 7, 2025: The Court denied the preliminary injunction, granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss, and denied class certification as moot. Mem. Op., ECF No. 47; Order, ECF No. 48. Although characterizing OJP’s conduct as “unquestionably arbitrary” in lay terms and “shameful,” the Court concluded it lacked jurisdiction over the APA claims because, under the Tucker Act, the essence of the claims and the relief sought (reinstatement/specific performance of grants) are contractual and belong in the Court of Federal Claims. For the APA arbitrary‑and‑capricious claim, the Court relied on Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025) (staying a district court TRO ordering payment on terminated grants) to find a lack of APA jurisdiction. For the APA contrary‑to‑law claim, the Court applied D.C. Circuit precedent (Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891; Ingersoll‑Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74) to hold the claim essentially contractual. The Due Process claims were dismissed for failure to state a claim (no protected property interest in continued grant funding; § 200.340(a) does not impose mandatory limits on agency discretion). The separation‑of‑powers/Spending‑Appropriations/Take Care claims were dismissed because Plaintiffs did not plausibly allege DOJ would not re‑obligate “no‑year” funds or otherwise refuse to spend appropriations. The ultra vires claim was dismissed (no action clearly beyond statutory limits and adequate review available elsewhere).  \n- July 8, 2025: Plaintiffs noticed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit (No. 25‑5248) and sought an injunction pending appeal in district court.  \n- July 21, 2025: The Court granted limited relief pending appeal, enjoining Defendants from re‑obligating or otherwise diminishing the sums awarded but terminated under the five named Plaintiffs’ awards through October 1, 2025, and requiring a joint status report by September 29, 2025, on appeal status. No bond was required. Order, ECF No. 57.\n\nLegal foundation and remedies: Plaintiffs’ causes of action were under the APA (5 U.S.C. § 706) and the U.S. Constitution (Fifth Amendment Due Process; separation of powers, Spending Clause, Appropriations Clause, Take Care Clause). Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief (including vacatur of terminations), and a stay of agency action (5 U.S.C. § 705). The district court dismissed the APA and constitutional claims and declined to certify the class because it found no jurisdiction over the APA claims and no viable constitutional claims, though it preserved the named Plaintiffs’ terminated grant funds pending appeal.\n\nJudge: U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta (D.D.C.).\n\nAppeal: Plaintiffs’ appeal is pending in the D.C. Circuit (No. 25‑5248). Plaintiffs also sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit.\n\nDecrees/Orders: On July 21, 2025, the district court entered a limited injunction pending appeal prohibiting re‑obligation of the five named Plaintiffs’ terminated grant funds through October 1, 2025, with a status report due September 29, 2025. No monitor was appointed.\n\nContext/Factual basis: Plaintiffs allege OJP summarily terminated hundreds of multi‑year public‑safety awards across domains (violence prevention/intervention, victims’ services, juvenile justice, substance use and mental health, reentry, and research), using one boilerplate rationale tied to changed agency priorities, without individualized reasoning or pre‑deprivation process. They assert immediate and irreparable harms: layoffs; shuttered or curtailed services (e.g., hospital‑based violence intervention; Deaf victim interpretation services; behavioral‑health 911 alternatives; prosecutor diversion; community‑based CVI initiatives); unreimbursed costs; and damage to community trust. The government maintains OJP exercised termination authority under 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) after individualized review and that terminated funds will be re‑obligated consistent with applicable appropriations.",
    "46387": "On April 9, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14,263, “Addressing Risks from Susman Godfrey,” targeting a private litigation firm based on its clients and advocacy—especially work defending the integrity of the 2020 election and alleged “DEI” practices. The order (1) condemned the firm’s supposed “weaponiz[ation]” of the legal system and “degrad[ation]” of elections; (2) directed immediate suspension and review of any security clearances held by its personnel and withdrawal of any government-provided facilities or services to the firm; (3) required all federal contractors to disclose any business with the firm and called for review and termination of contracts “for which Susman has been hired to perform any service”; (4) cross-referenced a prior order directing civil-rights reviews of large law firms’ employment practices; and (5) instructed agencies to limit the firm’s personnel from entering federal buildings or engaging with federal employees and to refrain from hiring the firm’s employees absent a waiver.\n\nThe firm filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on April 11, 2025, against the United States, the Executive Office of the President, numerous federal departments and agencies, and their heads (all in their official capacities). It brought constitutional claims under the First and Fifth Amendments and a separation-of-powers/ultra vires claim, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The firm was represented by private counsel (Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP). On April 14, it moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO). On April 15, Judge Loren L. AliKhan granted a TRO enjoining enforcement of Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the order, and on April 16 extended the TRO by agreement through final judgment. The firm moved for summary judgment on April 23; the government moved to dismiss the same day. The court held argument on May 8. An amended complaint filed on May 9 added additional federal defendants; the government renewed its motion to dismiss on May 12; the firm renewed its summary-judgment motion.\n\nOn June 27, 2025, the court denied the government’s motion to dismiss, granted the firm’s motion for summary judgment on Counts I–IV and VI–IX, declared Executive Order 14,263 unconstitutional and “null and void,” and entered a permanent injunction. The court held that the order violated the First Amendment by retaliating against the firm for protected advocacy and by engaging in viewpoint discrimination; violated the Petition Clause by restricting the firm’s ability to access courts and agencies; infringed freedom of association by compelling contractor disclosures designed to chill association; and violated the Fifth Amendment by depriving the firm of protected liberty and property interests without due process, by being impermissibly vague (especially through standardless “national interest” and “interests of the United States” triggers), by denying clients’ due-process right to counsel of choice, and by denying equal protection as a class-of-one with no rational basis. The court also concluded the order lacked statutory or constitutional authority and intruded on judicial functions, but it entered judgment on Counts I–IV and VI–IX. See Mem. Op. (D.D.C. June 27, 2025) (ECF No. 206); Order (ECF No. 207).\n\nThe permanent injunction: (1) bars implementation or enforcement of Executive Order 14,263 in any manner; (2) prohibits reliance on Section 1’s statements; (3) directs DOJ and the Attorney General to circulate the order to all affected agencies and certify compliance; (4) requires rescission of all formal or informal guidance implementing the order; (5) requires withdrawal of any disclosure requests issued under Section 3(a) and cessation of any future requests; (6) requires cessation of any security-clearance reviews undertaken pursuant to the order and reversal of any suspensions; (7) orders OMB to reverse any cessation of material or services previously provided to the firm under Section 2(b); (8) requires DOJ and EEOC to cease any investigations of the firm made pursuant to Section 4 and to withdraw any information requests; and (9) directs all agencies to take any additional steps necessary to unwind or prevent implementation of the order. The judgment is final; no trial occurred and no appeal is noted in the record.\n\nThe court’s ruling followed similar outcomes in related cases enjoining materially similar executive orders against other law firms: Perkins Coie LLP v. U.S. Department of Justice, 2025 WL 1276857 (D.D.C. May 2, 2025); Jenner & Block LLP v. U.S. Department of Justice, 2025 WL 1482021 (D.D.C.

    "46245": "Filed March 18, 2025 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, this case arises from the Administration’s effort to dismantle the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), a congressionally established “independent nonprofit corporation.” The plaintiffs—the Institute and, later, six Senate‑confirmed, presidentially appointed Board members and USIP’s Acting President—challenged (1) the President’s March 14, 2025 mass removal of all twelve appointed Board members without meeting the statutory conditions in 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f); (2) actions by the three ex officio Board members (the Secretaries of State and Defense and the President of the National Defense University) to remove Acting President Ambassador George E. Moose and install first Kenneth Jackson and then Nate Cavanaugh as USIP president; (3) a forcible takeover of USIP’s headquarters orchestrated by personnel from the U.S. “DOGE” Service and law enforcement; (4) the subsequent firing of nearly all USIP staff; and (5) transfers of USIP’s building and other assets to the General Services Administration (GSA). Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel (Zuckerman Spaeder LLP and Picard Kentz & Rowe LLP). The government was represented by the U.S. Attorney’s Office/Civil Division and DOJ appellate staff.\n\nPlaintiffs asserted federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1361, 1651, 2201–02, and the USIP Act, and brought claims for ultra vires action and violation of the USIP Act’s removal protections (22 U.S.C. § 4605(f)), separation‑of‑powers violations, APA violations (against the cabinet‑level ex officio officials in their agency capacities), common‑law trespass/ejectment (with D.C. Code § 16‑1101 referenced), and declaratory relief. They sought declarations that the Board removals and Moose’s removal were unlawful and void; restoration of the lawfully appointed Board and President; an injunction barring defendants from entering or controlling USIP property, systems, or name/marks; and an order ejecting defendants from USIP premises.\n\nAn emergency TRO (filed March 18) was denied on March 19, 2025; the court later denied an All Writs Act motion (April 1) seeking to halt imminent asset transfer after GSA had already accepted the headquarters building. On an expedited merits schedule, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on April 5; defendants cross‑moved April 11. After a May 14 hearing, the court (Judge Beryl A. Howell) issued a detailed memorandum opinion and order on May 19, 2025, granting plaintiffs’ motion and denying defendants’ cross‑motion. Reported at 2025 WL 1428641, the opinion held: (1) USIP is part of the federal government for separation‑of‑powers purposes but is not part of the Executive Branch and does not wield Article II executive power; (2) the President therefore lacked constitutional authority to ignore 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f)’s limited removal mechanisms for appointed Board members; and (3) even if USIP were within the Executive Branch, the Board’s multimember, bipartisan, expert structure and its de minimis, if any, executive power brought it within Humphrey’s Executor and its progeny, so the USIP Act’s removal protections were constitutional. The court declared the President’s removal of the twelve appointed Board members unlawful, null, and void; declared the ex officio members’ removal of Moose and the appointments of Jackson and Cavanaugh as USIP president invalid; declared that Moose remains USIP’s president and may be removed only by a duly constituted Board under § 4606; declared all actions taken or authorized by Jackson or Cavanaugh as acting presidents invalid; and declared void the transfer of USIP’s headquarters and other assets to GSA and the appointment of an Endowment officer to move Endowment funds. The court permanently enjoined defendants (other than ex officio Board members acting within their board roles) from trespassing on USIP property; from maintaining, gaining, or exercising access or control over USIP offices, facilities, systems, records, or resources; from acting or purporting to act in USIP’s name; and from using USIP’s name, emblem, seal, or other marks. It further enjoined the ex officio Board members from unilaterally transferring any USIP assets without Board majority consent. No bond was required.\n\nDefendants noticed an appeal on May 21, 2025, and moved for a stay pending appeal in district court, which was denied May 23. On June 27, 2025, a D.C. Circuit motions panel granted a stay pending appeal, concluding the government was likely to succeed on its claim that USIP’s Board removal protections are unconstitutional because the Institute exercises substantial executive power in foreign affairs; the panel also found the remaining stay factors favored the government. Plaintiffs’ petition for en banc reconsideration of the stay was denied July 24, 2025.\n\nKey procedural milestones:  \n- March 18, 2025: Complaint and emergency TRO filed; TRO denied March 19.  \n- March 31/April 1: All Writs Act motion to suspend transfers denied.  \n- April 5 & 11: Cross‑motions for summary judgment filed.  \n- May 19, 2025: Summary judgment for plaintiffs; permanent injunctive and declaratory relief entered (2025 WL 1428641).  \n- May 21–23, 2025: Appeal filed; district‑court stay denied.  \n- June 27, 2025: D.C. Circuit grants stay pending appeal; July 24 en banc reconsideration denied.\n\nFactual context: After Executive Order 14217 (Feb. 19, 2025) directed elimination of “non‑statutory components and functions” and reduction of statutory functions to minimum levels, White House personnel emailed termination notices to all twelve appointed USIP Board members on March 14 without invoking § 4605(f). The three ex officio Board members purported to remove Moose and to install Jackson, later replaced by Cavanaugh. On March 17, DOGE personnel, with assistance from law enforcement, took control of USIP’s headquarters; plaintiffs’ counsel and staff were escorted out; USIP systems access was taken; and records and insignia were disturbed. Nearly all staff were later terminated, and USIP’s headquarters and other assets were transferred to GSA without consideration. The district court found these actions ultra vires and void in light of the invalid Board removals and appointments, and granted permanent declaratory and injunctive relief restoring USIP’s lawfully appointed leadership and protecting its property and operations, subject to the D.C. Circuit’s subsequent stay pending appeal.",
    "46274": "This consolidated action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenges the Environmental Protection Agency’s March 2025 attempt to terminate billions of dollars in previously awarded clean-energy grants under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), as well as Citibank’s refusal to disburse grant funds. The lead case was filed March 8, 2025, by Climate United Fund, a nonprofit NCIF grantee, against Citibank, N.A.; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, in his official capacity. The court later consolidated actions brought by two other national NCIF grantees (Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities, Inc.) and by state and public “green banks” that were subgrantees (California Infrastructure & Economic Development Bank, Efficiency Maine Trust, Illinois Finance Authority, and Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority), as well as additional related grantee cases (Justice Climate Fund and Inclusiv, Inc.). Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel and, for the state entities, by state attorneys general; EPA is represented by the U.S. Department of Justice; and Citibank is represented by private counsel.\n\nCongress, through the Inflation Reduction Act, appropriated $27 billion for the GGRF, including approximately $14 billion for the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), to be awarded competitively to nonprofit financing entities. In April 2024 EPA awarded NCIF grants to Climate United ($6.97 billion), CGC ($5 billion), and PFC ($2 billion). The grants were obligated in August 2024 and governed by EPA terms and conditions and the federal Uniform Guidance (2 C.F.R. part 200). EPA, working with Treasury, used a financial agent structure under which Citibank held and administered the funds pursuant to a Financial Agency Agreement with Treasury and Account Control Agreements (ACAs) among Citibank, EPA (as secured party), and each recipient. The ACAs permitted EPA to take “exclusive control” of accounts only upon specified conditions and notice; otherwise, Citibank was to disburse funds on recipients’ instructions.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that beginning in mid‑February 2025 Citibank stopped honoring disbursement requests after receiving an FBI “freeze” recommendation, followed by Treasury’s March 4 directive to pause disbursements and EPA’s March 10 instruction to continue the pause, even though EPA had not issued any Notice of Exclusive Control under the ACAs. On March 11, 2025, EPA sent notices purporting to terminate all NCIF and related CCIA grant agreements effective immediately, citing concerns about program integrity, “waste, fraud, and abuse,” misalignment with agency priorities, and insufficient oversight. Plaintiffs claim they were given no notice or opportunity to be heard and that EPA did not identify credible evidence of misconduct or any breach of grant conditions. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), asserted violations of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and the Appropriations Clause, and alleged that termination violated the Inflation Reduction Act and federal grant regulations (including 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339–.342). Separately, they sued Citibank for breach of the ACAs, conversion, and replevin, seeking orders compelling disbursements and barring transfer of funds.\n\nJudge Tanya S. Chutkan granted interim relief and then a preliminary injunction. On March 18, 2025, the court granted in part a temporary restraining order, enjoining EPA and Citibank from giving effect to the termination letters and preserving the status quo by prohibiting transfer or re‑obligation of the grant funds while not yet compelling disbursements. After expedited briefing and an April 2 hearing, the court on April 15, 2025 granted Plaintiffs’ consolidated motion for a preliminary injunction and denied EPA’s contingent motion for a stay pending appeal. The April 15 order (with a memorandum opinion filed April 16) enjoined EPA from effectuating the March 11 termination notices; from issuing any Notice of Exclusive Control or otherwise limiting access to funds except as permitted by the ACAs, the grant awards, applicable regulations, and law; and from directly or indirectly causing Citibank to deny, obstruct, delay, or limit access to the grant accounts. The court also enjoined Citibank from moving or transferring funds out of the accounts except as permitted by the ACAs and applicable law, and required Citibank to disburse funds “properly incurred” before the mid‑February 2025 suspension. The court waived any bond and ordered status reports on compliance. In granting preliminary relief, the court found a likelihood of success on Plaintiffs’ APA and due process claims, including that EPA had not complied with the Uniform Guidance’s termination and procedural requirements (2 C.F.R. §§ 200.340–.342) and had not provided credible, individualized reasons for termination; and that Plaintiffs faced imminent irreparable harm to their operations, programs, and reputations if access to funds remained blocked. The court rejected EPA’s mootness argument and distinguished EPA’s supplemental authority concerning a Supreme Court stay in an unrelated Department of Education grants case.\n\nEPA and Citibank both filed notices of appeal from the preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit (Nos. 25‑5122 and 25‑5123). The district court stayed all defendants’ deadlines to answer the complaints pending the appellate court’s mandate. Throughout, the court addressed several consolidation and procedural matters, including denying a motion to intervene by a nonparty and granting a motion to clarify aspects of the injunction for PFC. No trial has occurred, and no settlement has been reached.",
    "46142": "Filed on February 19, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, this case challenges three presidential executive orders issued January 20–21, 2025: Executive Order 14151 (Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing), Executive Order 14168 (Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government), and Executive Order 14173 (Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit‑Based Opportunity). The plaintiffs are two nonprofit organizations—the National Urban League and the AIDS Foundation of Chicago—that receive and administer federal grants and contracts supporting services for underserved communities. (The National Fair Housing Alliance was an original plaintiff but voluntarily dismissed on June 27, 2025.) Defendants are the President and numerous federal agencies and officials responsible for issuing, implementing, or enforcing the orders, including OMB, OFCCP, DOL, HHS, HUD, EPA, DOJ, CDC, NIH, HRSA, ACL, USDA, and DOC (with substitutions of certain agency heads reflected in the amended complaint).\n\nPlaintiffs are represented by civil‑rights organizations and private counsel (NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Lambda Legal, and Covington & Burling LLP). They assert constitutional claims under the First Amendment (viewpoint/content discrimination and chilled speech) and the Fifth Amendment (due process vagueness and equal protection—race and transgender status), and allege ultra vires presidential action violating separation‑of‑powers principles, both facially and as applied. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief barring enforcement of specified order provisions, rescission of implementing directives, and restoration or correction of contract and grant terms.\n\nThe challenged provisions include: (1) EO 14151’s Equity Termination Provision directing agencies to terminate “equity‑related” grants and contracts, and its List Provision instructing agencies to list grantees that advanced DEI/DEIA or environmental justice since January 20, 2021; (2) EO 14173’s Certification Provision requiring every federal contract and grant to include a certification that the counterparty “does not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti‑discrimination laws” and an FCA‑materiality clause, its Contract Terms Provision directing removal of references to DEI/DEIA “principles” from federal acquisition/grant procedures, its Government Mandates Provision to terminate “diversity,” “equity,” and like mandates, and its Report Provision directing DOJ to identify sectors, “the most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners,” and up to nine potential civil compliance investigations per agency; and (3) EO 14168’s Gender Funding Termination Provision and Promoting Gender Ideology Provision barring use of federal funds to “promote gender ideology” and directing agencies to end federal funding of “gender ideology.”\n\nPlaintiffs allege the orders and agency memoranda implementing them (including OPM guidance and OMB’s brief funding‑pause Memo M‑25‑13, later rescinded) spurred “stop‑work” notices, reporting restrictions, data‑collection changes, and terminations affecting DEI‑ or equity‑related activities. The Urban League specifically alleges EPA suspended on March 12, 2025, and then terminated on May 1, 2025, a $500,000 “Urban Environmental Justice Collaborative Program” grant, citing alignment with agency policy emphasizing “merit, fairness, and excellence.” The Urban League also reports a DOL direction on February 12, 2025, not to address “equity” in quarterly reporting. The AIDS Foundation alleges that HRSA and HUD instructions tied to the Anti‑Gender Order required removal or alteration of terms such as “gender identity,” “gender‑affirming care,” and “LGBTQIA” in program materials and reporting forms, and that Chicago (as a pass‑through recipient) relayed CDC/HHS directives to terminate DEI‑related activities under certain awards. Plaintiffs assert this has chilled their speech and constrained services central to their missions.\n\nOn February 28, 2025, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. The Court (Judge Timothy J. Kelly) set argument for March 19, 2025. A nonprofit, Do No Harm, moved to intervene as a defendant; on March 12, 2025, the Court denied intervention without prejudice, permitting Do No Harm to participate as amicus and present argument at the preliminary‑injunction hearing. On May 2, 2025, the Court denied plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. In a detailed memorandum opinion, the Court held plaintiffs had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits. As to standing, the Court found plaintiffs likely lacked standing to challenge some intra‑governmental directives (e.g., the List Provision and the Report Provision) and had not yet shown standing as to others (e.g., the “Contract Terms” and “Government Mandates” provisions). The Court concluded plaintiffs likely had standing to challenge the “funding‑focused” provisions (EO 14151’s Equity Termination Provision; EO 14168’s Gender Funding Termination and Promoting Gender Ideology provisions) and EO 14173’s Certification Provision. On the merits, the Court treated plaintiffs’ challenges as facial and held they were unlikely to prevail on their Fifth Amendment vagueness claims (particularly given the government’s role as funder/contracting party) or First Amendment claims. The Court reasoned that the funding provisions regulate what the government will fund, not private speech outside the scope of the grants, and that the Certification Provision’s reference to DEI programs that violate federal anti‑discrimination laws does not restrict any First Amendment right to engage in unlawful discrimination. The Court denied the preliminary injunction without reaching the remaining factors, and noted that as‑applied challenges to specific enforcement actions might present different issues later.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, plaintiffs filed a First Amended and Supplemental Complaint. It maintains First and Fifth Amendment claims and ultra vires claims (as‑applied and facial), adds new factual allegations about grant terminations and agency implementations, and updates defendant officials. The parties jointly proposed, and the Court ordered, a briefing schedule: defendants’ response due August 8, 2025; plaintiffs’ opposition due September 12, 2025; and defendants’ reply due October 3, 2025.\n\nThe case has proceeded alongside related litigation. Courts enjoined or addressed similar provisions elsewhere, including: a preliminary injunction later stayed on appeal in National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education v. Trump (D. Md.; 2025 WL 573764; stay granted by the Fourth Circuit); Chicago Women in Trades v. Trump (N.D. Ill.; 2025 WL 933871 (TRO); 2025 WL 1114466 (modifying ruling)); San Francisco AIDS Foundation v. Trump (N.D. Cal.; 2025 WL 1621636) (enjoining certain “Equity Termination” and “Gender Ideology” provisions); and Thakur v. Trump (N.D. Cal.; 2025 WL 1734471) (granting relief to grantees alleging viewpoint‑based funding cancellations). Those rulings were cited to the Court as supplemental authority.\n\nIn this case, there are no consent decrees or settlements, and no trial or appeal has yet occurred. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and permanent injunctive relief invalidating or barring enforcement of the challenged executive‑order provisions and implementing actions; restoration or correction of affected agreements; notice of any injunction to affected subrecipients and vendors; and costs and fees.",
    "46110": "On February 12, 2025, several federal-employee unions filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the President and multiple federal officials and agency leaders. The plaintiffs—the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)—challenge a series of executive-branch actions they allege are intended to drastically shrink the civil service: (1) a January 20, 2025 OPM directive requiring agencies to identify and promptly decide whether to retain probationary employees; (2) OPM’s January 28, 2025 “Fork in the Road” deferred resignation program; and (3) Executive Order No. 14210 (Feb. 11, 2025), which directs agency heads to “promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force,” prioritizing, among other areas, non‑statutorily mandated functions, offices not deemed “essential” during a lapse in appropriations, and initiatives the administration suspends or closes.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by in‑house union counsel (NTEU, NFFE, IAM, IFPTE) and private counsel for UAW (Bredhoff & Kaiser). They bring two claims: (i) a constitutional claim that the coordinated actions—mass separations of probationers, large-scale RIF preparations, and the deferred resignation program—violate separation-of-powers principles by undermining Congress’s authority to create, fund, and staff agencies and to set their missions; and (ii) an Administrative Procedure Act claim alleging that defendants are directing and implementing RIFs contrary to statute and OPM regulations, including by initiating RIFs for impermissible reasons, failing to establish proper competitive areas, and disregarding legally required retention factors and notice. Statutory bases cited include 5 U.S.C. § 3502 and 5 C.F.R. Part 351. The unions seek declaratory and injunctive relief halting implementation of Section 3(c) of EO 14210, preventing agency terminations of probationary employees under the OPM directive, and enjoining OPM from extending or replicating the deferred resignation program, along with fees and costs.\n\nShortly after filing, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. Following expedited briefing and a February 18, 2025 hearing, Judge Christopher R. Cooper denied preliminary relief on February 20, 2025. The Court concluded it likely lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the Federal Service Labor‑Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) channels these types of federal labor-management disputes to the Federal Labor Relations Authority in the first instance, with review in the courts of appeals. Applying the Thunder Basin framework, the Court found that channeling would not foreclose meaningful judicial review, the unions’ claims were not wholly collateral to the statutory scheme, and any constitutional issues could ultimately be resolved on appellate review; the Court therefore did not reach the remaining preliminary‑injunction factors. The Court also noted, as part of the factual backdrop, that some terminations had already occurred (including at the CFPB) and that OPM’s deferred resignation window had closed.\n\nThe plaintiffs amended their complaint on February 17, 2025 (substituting the then‑new HHS Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., among others) and later sought and received leave to file a Second Amended Complaint on June 6, 2025 to reflect additional developments and add defendants. Summons then issued to additional officials, including Doug Burgum, Andrew N. Ferguson, Travis Hill, Caroline D. Pham, and William J. Pulte; defendants thereafter moved to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on July 11, 2025. By stipulation and order, briefing on that motion is scheduled through August 29, 2025. One plaintiff, UAW, voluntarily dismissed its claims on May 27, 2025; the remaining unions continue to prosecute the case.\n\nAs alleged factual context, the pleadings describe: OPM’s Jan. 20, 2025 instruction to agencies to identify probationers and decide whether to retain them; the Jan. 28 “Fork in the Road” program inviting employees to submit deferred resignations effective September 30, 2025; and EO 14210’s RIF-preparation directive prioritizing certain categories of functions and positions. Plaintiffs assert that agencies began acting on those directives within days (e.g., notices to term and probationary employees at various agencies) and that the actions, individually and collectively, have already reduced membership and dues revenue and diminished the unions’ bargaining leverage.\n\nVenue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), and federal‑question jurisdiction is alleged under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. The presiding judge is the Hon. Christopher R. Cooper (the case was initially assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman). No class has been proposed; the plaintiffs sue in their organizational capacities. No trial date has been set. There are no consent decrees or settlements, and no monitor has been appointed. The case remains pending on defendants’ motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint.",
    "46098": "Filed on February 11, 2025, this action challenges the Executive Branch’s suspension and termination of U.S. foreign‑assistance funding and programs following President Trump’s January 20, 2025 Executive Order 14169, “Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid.” The plaintiffs are U.S. nonprofits and companies that implement State Department and USAID foreign‑aid awards (including a trade association for small implementers); they are represented by private counsel. They sued the President, the Secretary of State (also acting USAID Administrator), the Director of Foreign Assistance, the Director of OMB, and the State Department, USAID, and OMB.\n\nRelying on the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), the Anti‑Deficiency Act and Purpose Act, and the Constitution, plaintiffs allege that the government unlawfully froze obligations and disbursements, issued stop‑work orders, and then mass‑terminated thousands of foreign‑aid awards—actions they say ignored Congress’s 2024 appropriations for foreign assistance and the statutory limits on impoundment. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief (including reinstatement of awards), mandamus, and an order requiring defendants to make appropriated funds available and to pay for work completed.\n\nWithin days of filing, plaintiffs moved for a TRO/preliminary injunction. On February 13, 2025, Judge Amir H. Ali (D.D.C.) granted a TRO in both this case and the related case AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. U.S. Department of State (No. 25‑cv‑400), enjoining implementation of the State/USAID pause directives and forbidding the suspension, pausing, or other prevention of obligation or disbursement for awards in existence as of January 19, 2025, and enjoining the issuance or enforcement of terminations, suspensions, or stop‑work orders as to those awards. The Court later enforced the TRO on February 25, 2025, ordering defendants to pay invoices and honor letter‑of‑credit drawdowns for work completed before February 13. The D.C. Circuit dismissed an appeal of the TRO enforcement order for lack of jurisdiction, and the Supreme Court denied the government’s application to vacate an administrative stay, leaving the enforcement order intact.\n\nAfter a consolidated preliminary‑injunction hearing, the Court on March 10, 2025, granted a preliminary injunction in part. The Court held plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their APA challenge to the initial blanket suspension of funds (January 20–February 13) and on their constitutional separation‑of‑powers claim that the Executive had unlawfully impounded congressionally appropriated funds without following the ICA, and that the asserted foreign‑affairs authority could not override Congress’s exclusive power of the purse. The Court enjoined (1) giving effect to any terminations, suspensions, or stop‑work orders issued between January 20 and February 13, 2025; (2) withholding of payments or LOC drawdowns for work completed before February 13; and (3) unlawful impoundment, directing defendants to make available for obligation the full amount of foreign‑assistance funds appropriated in the 2024 Act. The Court declined to invalidate post‑TRO, award‑by‑award termination decisions on the record then presented. To facilitate compliance, the Court set a feasibility benchmark of roughly 300 payments per day and required status reports. It later denied the government’s request for an indicative ruling to dissolve the payments requirement as to non‑parties, and vacated an administrative stay it had entered while considering that motion.\n\nOn April 22, 2025, plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint expanding their claims. They allege the State Department and USAID executed “tranches” of mass terminations based on cursory spreadsheets and action memoranda signed by the Secretary, constituting pretextual, post hoc rationalizations for the earlier freeze; that the agencies are moving to retire USAID’s independent operations and shift or eliminate programs; and that defendants’ decisions to “shut down” congressionally mandated programs and to hold funds in reserve violate the ICA, Anti‑Deficiency Act, Purpose Act, and the 2024 Appropriations Act. The amended pleading asserts APA arbitrary-and-capricious and contrary‑to‑law claims; a stand‑alone separation‑of‑powers claim; ultra vires and mandamus claims; and (as to GHC plaintiffs) a procedural due‑process claim. Defendants moved to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) on June 12, 2025; briefing was held in abeyance pending the appellate proceedings.\n\nAppeals followed. The government appealed the preliminary injunction (Nos. 25‑5097/5098). On August 13, 2025, a D.C. Circuit panel vacated the impoundment portion of the injunction, holding plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to press that claim, with a dissent. On August 20, 2025, the en banc D.C. Circuit entered an order stating that “the preliminary injunction that requires the government to obligate the appropriated funds remains in effect,” and the district court denied the government’s motion for a partial stay pending mandate. As of the latest district‑court orders, defendants continue to file periodic status reports and to process payments for pre‑TRO work, while the obligation/impoundment and termination issues remain under active enforcement and appellate review.\n\nFactual context: The record shows that, after Executive Order 14169, State and USAID paused obligations and disbursements and issued stop‑work orders, in some instances halting payment even for completed work. OMB issued a government‑wide pause memorandum (M‑25‑13) that was later enjoined in separate litigation. Within weeks, State and USAID announced tens of hundreds of suspensions and terminations. Plaintiffs submitted declarations detailing widespread program disruptions and financial distress (including staff furloughs/layoffs, shuttered offices, and stranded commodities) and later alleged that defendants intend to realign or retire substantial USAID functions and not obligate large portions of appropriated funds absent judicial relief.\n\nJudge: Amir H. Ali (D.D.C.).  \nRelated/Consolidated: Proceedings coordinated with AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. U.S. Department of State (No. 25‑cv‑400) for TRO/PI relief; the D.C. Circuit consolidated the appeals (Nos. 25‑5097/5098).  \nRelief to date: TRO (2/13/2025); TRO enforcement (2/25/2025); preliminary injunction (3/10/2025) with continuing enforcement orders and status‑reporting; government’s motion for an indicative ruling denied (5/13/2025). The D.C. Circuit panel vacated the impoundment portion (8/13/2025), followed by an en banc order leaving the obligation requirement in place pending further proceedings. The district court denied a motion for a partial stay pending mandate (8/25/2025). The government’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint remains pending, with briefing stayed awaiting appellate resolution.",
    "46090": "On February 9, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Case No. 1:25‑cv‑00381‑ABJ) against the Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Russell Vought, in his official capacity. An amended complaint filed February 13 added the CFPB as a defendant and additional plaintiffs: the National Consumer Law Center, the NAACP, the Virginia Poverty Law Center, the CFPB Employee Association, and Pastor Eva Steege (later substituted by her estate). Plaintiffs are represented by Gupta Wessler LLP, Public Citizen Litigation Group, and NTEU counsel; defendants are represented by the Department of Justice’s Civil Division, Federal Programs Branch.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that after a change in administration, the CFPB’s leadership took steps to dismantle the agency in defiance of Congress’s mandate in the Dodd‑Frank Act, including a February 10, 2025 bureau‑wide “stop‑work” email; cancellation of dozens of contracts (including in Enforcement, Supervision, and Consumer Response); firing of probationary and term employees; closing CFPB’s headquarters for a week; and plans for mass reductions in force (RIFs). Plaintiffs asserted non‑statutory ultra vires claims grounded in separation‑of‑powers principles and Appointments Clause (FVRA) defects; and Administrative Procedure Act claims under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and (C), contending defendants exceeded statutory authority, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and sought to shut down the CFPB contrary to Title X of Dodd‑Frank and specific statutory duties (e.g., maintaining a consumer complaint function, HMDA reporting, and operating the Private Education Loan Ombudsman). They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent further shutdown actions and to preserve the Bureau’s statutorily required operations.\n\nFollowing an emergency filing, the court (Judge Amy Berman Jackson) entered a consent order on February 14, 2025 preserving agency data, prohibiting terminations except for cause and notices of RIF, and preventing transfers of reserve funds pending resolution of the preliminary‑injunction motion. After briefing, a motions hearing (March 3) and two‑day evidentiary hearing (March 10–11) were held. The court received testimony from CFPB Chief Operating Officer Adam Martinez and others regarding the February 10 stop‑work directive, contract cancellations, plans for an accelerated RIF, and the practical shutdown of key functions (including Consumer Response).\n\nOn March 28, 2025, the court issued a memorandum opinion and preliminary injunction. It found plaintiffs likely to succeed on separation‑of‑powers and APA claims, concluding the record showed defendants had undertaken “a concerted, expedited effort to shut the agency down entirely,” contrary to Congress’s mandate. The order required defendants to: (1) preserve all CFPB records and data; (2) reinstate probationary and term employees terminated since February 10 (including the Private Student Loan Ombudsman); (3) refrain from terminating employees except for cause and from issuing RIF notices; (4) cease enforcing the February 10 stop‑work directive or achieving a work stoppage by other means (e.g., administrative leave edicts); (5) provide staff with office space or fully functional remote‑work capability; (6) ensure the Office of Consumer Response maintained the toll‑free number, website, and database and continued monitoring and responses, including escalated case management; and (7) rescind contract termination notices and refrain from finalizing further terminations absent individualized assessments that a contract was unnecessary to statutory functions. The court initially required a compliance report by April 4.\n\nDefendants noticed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit and sought a stay. On April 11, 2025, the D.C. Circuit partially stayed the injunction pending appeal, permitting terminations or RIFs, and targeted work stoppages, only after “particularized assessments” that affected employees or work were unnecessary to statutory duties, and staying the compliance‑report provision. The court of appeals expedited the appeal for argument on May 16.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, defendants issued mass RIF notices to approximately 1,400–1,500 employees. Plaintiffs moved for an order to show cause; the district court held a hearing on April 18 and temporarily suspended the RIF and prohibited cutting off system access pending an evidentiary hearing, citing likely noncompliance with the injunction. Defendants appealed. On April 28, 2025, the D.C. Circuit clarified that a “particularized assessment” must determine, by the decisionmaker responsible for the RIF, that each CFPB division could perform statutorily required duties without the employees subject to RIF; and, sua sponte, lifted its partial stay of paragraph (3) of the preliminary injunction, restoring the district court’s blanket prohibition on RIFs to ensure meaningful final relief, while keeping other provisions as previously stayed.\n\nSeparately, a related appeal of the April 18 interim order was voluntarily dismissed as moot on May 12, 2025. On the merits appeal, the D.C. Circuit issued its decision on August 15, 2025, vacating the preliminary injunction and remanding. The court held that claims by the employee‑representative plaintiffs were channeled by the Civil Service Reform Act and thus outside district‑court jurisdiction; that the NAACP had associational standing; that plaintiffs’ APA claims failed because they did not target discrete, final agency action (the February 10 email was not final action, and the alleged “shutdown decision” was not a final, ripe, or discrete action under the APA); and that plaintiffs’ equitable separation‑of‑powers claim sounded in statutory ultra vires rather than a freestanding constitutional cause of action under Dalton v. Specter. Judge Pillard dissented.\n\nKey statutory context throughout was Title X of the Dodd‑Frank Act (12 U.S.C. § 5491 et seq.), which created the CFPB, assigned it rulemaking, supervision, enforcement, and specific mandatory duties (including consumer complaint intake and response, reporting obligations, and specialized offices), and established its funding outside annual appropriations. The district court’s March 28 injunction preserved those functions pending appeal; the D.C. Circuit’s April 11 and April 28 orders adjusted interim relief; and the August 15 appellate opinion vacated the injunction and returned the case for further proceedings consistent with its rulings.",
    "PN-NY-0014": "Filed on March 28, 2012, Ligon v. City of New York is a civil‑rights class action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 brought by residents and visitors of private apartment buildings in New York City—principally in the Bronx—challenging the New York City Police Department’s implementation of “Operation Clean Halls,” later formalized as the Trespass Affidavit Program (TAP). Plaintiffs, represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union, The Bronx Defenders, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, and pro bono counsel from Shearman & Sterling, alleged systematic Fourth Amendment seizures and frisks without reasonable suspicion and Fourteenth Amendment equal protection violations, arising from NYPD stops in and around TAP buildings based solely on presence, entry, or exit. Defendants were the City of New York, the Police Commissioner, and individual officers.\n\nAfter expedited discovery and a six‑day evidentiary hearing, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin granted a preliminary injunction on January 8, 2013 (amended February 14, 2013), finding a clear likelihood plaintiffs would prove the City’s deliberate indifference to a widespread practice of unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx. The court certified, for purposes of preliminary relief, a Rule 23(b)(2) class of “[a]ll individuals who have been or are at risk of being stopped outdoors within the vicinity of Bronx apartment buildings enrolled in the NYPD’s [TAP] without legal justification” (Feb. 11, 2013). On August 12, 2013, the court issued a Remedies Opinion in Floyd and Ligon ordering systemic reforms: revising NYPD policies on investigative encounters (clarifying what constitutes a Terry stop, the reasonable‑suspicion standard, and that a frisk requires separate reasonable suspicion that a person is armed and dangerous), prohibiting racial profiling, improving training and supervision, auditing, and instituting a one‑year body‑worn camera (BWC) pilot, as well as a community‑based Joint Remedial Process. A court‑appointed independent monitor, Peter L. Zimroth, was tasked with developing, overseeing, and reporting on implementation; Nicholas Turner and later Justice Ariel E. Belen served as facilitators for the Joint Remedial Process.\n\nThe City appealed the preliminary injunction and remedial orders. On October 31, 2013, the Second Circuit stayed the district court’s orders and reassigned the cases, but on February 21, 2014, it granted a limited remand to explore settlement. The City subsequently withdrew its appeals; the cases were reassigned to Judge Analisa Torres, who modified the remedial order to define “substantial compliance” and set the monitor’s minimum tenure (no sooner than three years after approval of reforms, contingent on the City’s showing of substantial compliance) (July 30, 2014). Procedures were set for submitting and approving the monitor’s recommendations (2015), and the BWC pilot was refined (Dec. 8, 2015).\n\nOn July 19, 2017, the parties executed a Stipulation of Settlement and Order that fully resolved Ligon. Without admitting liability, the City agreed to adopt and implement detailed standards for enforcement in and around TAP buildings and to incorporate oversight under the Floyd/Ligon remedial monitoring. The settlement tightened NYPD rules so that mere presence in, entry into, or exit from a TAP building cannot justify a Level 1 approach, a Level 2 accusatory inquiry, or a Level 3 stop; required documentation of every Level 3 stop (including narrative articulation of reasonable suspicion and, separately, grounds for any frisk or search); required probable cause for arrests or summonses; prohibited frisks absent reasonable suspicion that a person is armed and dangerous; and mandated completion of a standardized Trespass Crimes Fact Sheet prior to arraignment for every trespass arrest in or around a TAP building. The NYPD agreed to revise Patrol Guide § 212‑59 (interior patrols of TAP buildings) and Administrative Guide § 303‑27 (TAP administration), including enrollment and periodic renewal criteria tied to crime or complaints and higher‑level approvals for extended participation. The Department committed to training all personnel engaged in TAP enforcement and TAP administration on these standards, and to provide roll‑call, in‑service, promotional, and recruit training consistent with the revised policies (including the investigative encounters policy, P.G. 212‑11, and the racial profiling policy, P.G. 203‑25). The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, incorporated the Floyd remedial monitoring (with substantial‑compliance benchmarks), and provided for a second remedial phase of document production and review following the monitor’s tenure. The City agreed to pay $235,000 in damages to named plaintiffs and to pay class counsel’s reasonable fees and costs ($2,585,101 in fees and $55,432 in costs through June 30, 2016, plus additional negotiated interim fees).\n\nUnder oversight by Monitor Zimroth, the NYPD issued and implemented revised policies on investigative encounters (P.G. 212‑11) and racial profiling (P.G. 203‑25), and adopted the court‑approved Trespass Crimes Fact Sheet. The monitor launched a randomized BWC pilot in patrol precincts and a quasi‑experimental BWC evaluation in Housing Bureau PSAs, and reported on implementation, training, supervision, auditing, and performance‑evaluation changes, including NYPD’s RISKS Reviews to address underreporting and supervisory shortcomings. Subsequent orders facilitated the monitor’s recommendations and implementation (e.g., a 2019 confidentiality order for an observational study, and a 2020 order establishing an interagency adverse‑findings early‑intervention program). Throughout, the court also managed related proceedings in the companion cases Floyd v. City of New York (general stop‑and‑frisk) and Davis v. City of New York (NYCHA housing), with Ligon’s monitoring integrated into the combined remedial process.\n\nJudge Scheindlin presided through the preliminary‑injunction and remedies phase; Judge Torres has overseen the settlement and monitoring. The Second Circuit’s October 31, 2014 opinion affirmed denial of police unions’ motions to intervene and dismissed the City’s appeals, allowing the remedial process to proceed. The court retains jurisdiction under the settlement until substantial compliance is achieved and maintained per the agreed terms.",
    "PB-CT-0007": "Filed on November 9, 2010, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, this non‑class civil action was brought by several same‑sex couples lawfully married in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire and by the surviving spouse of a same‑sex marriage. The plaintiffs challenged Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 1 U.S.C. § 7, insofar as it required the federal government to disregard their state‑law marriages and deny them marital status and benefits under federal law. The defendants were federal agencies and officials responsible for administering programs that hinge on marital status—including the Office of Personnel Management, the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor, the Commissioner of Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service and the Postmaster General, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Attorney General, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the United States. After the Department of Justice notified Congress on February 23, 2011, that the Executive would no longer defend Section 3’s constitutionality, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives (BLAG) intervened to defend the statute. Plaintiffs were represented by Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (a public‑interest legal organization) and private firms; the government defendants by the Department of Justice; and BLAG by House Counsel and private counsel.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted a federal question and sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201–2202 (and program‑specific judicial review statutes including 5 U.S.C. § 8912, 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(2), and 42 U.S.C. § 405(g)). Their legal theory was that DOMA Section 3, as applied to them, violated the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment by denying federal recognition of valid state marriages and the spousal benefits and obligations that follow. Specific remedies included declarations that Section 3 is unconstitutional as applied, injunctions against its enforcement with respect to federal benefits, and, for the tax‑filing couples, appropriate refunds (with the United States named under 26 U.S.C. § 7422(f)(1)).\n\nThe factual basis of the case showed concrete denials flowing from DOMA’s marriage definition across multiple federal programs: (1) a retired federal civilian employee and her wife were barred from converting Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) coverage to “Self & Family” to cover the spouse; (2) a Postal Service employee was denied Family and Medical Leave Act leave to care for her wife and the couple was refused FEHB “Self & Family” coverage; (3) a widower was denied both the Social Security one‑time lump‑sum death benefit and a qualified preretirement survivor annuity under an ERISA‑governed defined‑benefit plan because his marriage was not recognized; (4) two retired New Hampshire teachers were denied a spousal medical cost supplement from the state retirement system because federal tax law (as applied through DOMA) limited § 401(h) retiree medical benefits to opposite‑sex “spouses”; (5) two married couples were denied the right to file joint federal income tax returns (and resulting refunds); and (6) a federal attorney was denied the ability to add his husband to existing FEHB family coverage, forcing purchase of private insurance.\n\nJudge Vanessa L. Bryant denied BLAG’s request to stay proceedings pending the Second Circuit’s decision in a related DOMA appeal (Windsor) and on July 31, 2012, granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, denying BLAG’s motion to dismiss. In a published memorandum (2012 WL 3113883), the court held that Baker v. Nelson’s summary disposition did not control because this case challenged a federal statute applied to already‑valid state marriages, not a state’s authority to issue marriage licenses. The court concluded that sexual orientation classifications warrant heightened scrutiny but found it unnecessary to apply that standard because Section 3 failed even rational basis review. The court rejected Congress’s and BLAG’s proffered justifications—defending “traditional” marriage; promoting responsible procreation and child‑rearing; moral disapproval; conserving resources; federal “uniformity”; and “caution”—as either impermissible, not legitimate in this context, or not rationally related to Section 3’s across‑the‑board denial of recognition to one subset of state‑sanctioned marriages. The court entered judgment declaring Section 3 unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiffs and enjoining its enforcement against them.\n\nKey filings included plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment (July 15, 2011); BLAG’s motion to dismiss (August 15, 2011); and the Attorney General’s notification to Congress ending executive defense of Section 3, prompting BLAG’s permitted intervention (May 27, 2011). Reported decision: Pedersen v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 2012 WL 3113883 (D. Conn. July 31, 2012). BLAG’s motion to stay was denied on July 4, 2012. The federal defendants filed a notice of appeal on August 17, 2012, and BLAG noticed a separate appeal on September 26, 2012, to the Second Circuit. While those appeals were pending, plaintiffs and the federal defendants each petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari before judgment; BLAG opposed, urging review in related cases instead. The district court proceedings concluded with the summary judgment and final judgment; no trial occurred.",
    "PC-AL-0034": "On May 28, 2015, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Civil Rights Division, filed suit under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, against the State of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) to enjoin ongoing deprivation of prisoners’ constitutional rights at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women. The complaint alleged that, through acts and omissions, the State subjected women at Tutwiler to sexual abuse and sexual harassment in violation of the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. DOJ’s allegations rested on a 2013–2014 investigation and a January 17, 2014 findings letter, which documented a longstanding, pervasive “sexualized environment” that included staff rape and coerced sexual activity, voyeurism and cross‑gender viewing, sexually explicit verbal abuse, pregnancies caused by staff, underreporting and inadequate investigations, retaliation against women who reported abuse (including segregation and lie‑detector tests), dangerously low staffing and supervision, lack of a grievance system, and facilities and practices that failed to protect women from harm.\n\nThe same day DOJ filed its complaint, the parties jointly moved for entry of a negotiated settlement as a court order. On June 18, 2015, Judge Myron H. Thompson approved the agreement as a consent decree, conditionally dismissed the case without prejudice, and retained jurisdiction to enforce the decree and resolve disputes. The court found the relief complied with the Prison Litigation Reform Act: it was narrowly drawn, extended no further than necessary to correct the constitutional violation, and was the least intrusive means. The decree contemplated that defendants would implement required policies and practices within nine months, be subject to independent monitoring and semiannual compliance reporting, and achieve and maintain substantial compliance with each provision for three consecutive monitor reports (18 months) before termination.\n\nThe consent decree requires system‑wide reforms at Tutwiler to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse and harassment. Significant terms include:\n- Zero‑tolerance PREA compliance: adopt and implement policies meeting the Prison Rape Elimination Act standards; provide comprehensive initial and annual refresher training for all staff, contractors, and volunteers; and educate all inmates at intake and in orientation about their rights, reporting methods, and access to medical/mental health care.\n- Reporting and grievance systems: create multiple, unimpeded reporting avenues (verbal, written, anonymous, third‑party), including an external, confidential hotline administered by the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA) and access to the Alabama Coalition Against Rape for confidential support; implement a formal inmate grievance system (including emergency grievances for imminent risk) that prohibits retaliation; and ensure prompt documentation and response to reports.\n- Investigations and discipline: conduct prompt, thorough, objective investigations (with trained investigators, appropriate evidence handling, and inmate notifications); refer substantiated staff sexual abuse to prosecutors; and track and impose appropriate staff discipline.\n- Privacy and searches: prohibit cross‑gender strip and visual body cavity searches absent exigent circumstances; prohibit cross‑gender pat‑downs of women absent exigent circumstances; restrict cross‑gender viewing of inmates who are nude or performing bodily functions; require opposite‑sex staff to announce their presence; and address architectural features to enhance privacy.\n- LGBTI/transgender protections: adopt gender‑responsive policies for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and gender‑nonconforming inmates; ensure appropriate clothing, hygiene, shower access, respectful communication (including pronoun use), and clinical care.\n- Staffing and supervision: develop and implement a gender‑responsive staffing plan (including identification of gender‑specific posts), a shift‑relief factor, and procedures for unannounced rounds; install and manage a state‑of‑the‑art camera system to supplement, not replace, physical rounds; recruit and retain women officers; and review the Alabama Peace Officers’ Standards and Training Commission (APOSTC) physical standards for validation and potential gender‑norming.\n- Classification and risk assessment: implement a gender‑responsive classification system and the Women’s Risk/Needs Assessment (WRNA); screen all inmates at intake and within 30 days for risk of victimization/abusiveness; use screening results to inform individualized housing, bed, work, program, and education assignments; limit use of involuntary segregation for protection; and abolish “restricted status.”\n- Quality improvement and data: establish a Risk Management System (RMS) and quality improvement program to collect, analyze, and act on data regarding sexual abuse/harassment incidents, unprofessional staff conduct (including sexually explicit, vulgar, degrading, or racially insensitive/offensive language), and use‑of‑force incidents; conduct regular inmate polling; and perform periodic reviews to identify trends and corrective actions.\n- Basic needs: ensure free and adequate access to essential hygiene supplies (including tampons and pads), uniforms, and linens.\n\nMonitoring has been continuous. The court appointed an independent monitor to oversee implementation and file semiannual reports. The first monitor (Jennie Lancaster) reported in February 2016 that ADOC and Tutwiler had achieved substantial compliance with many provisions (e.g., inmate education, hygiene supplies, camera management, initial PREA policy development and training) and partial compliance with others (notably the staffing plan and development of gender‑responsive use‑of‑force and discipline policies). In August 2016, Kathleen Dennehy became monitor and has filed regular reports. By March 2017 and through 2019, the monitor consistently found substantial compliance in most areas, with improvements including: widespread PREA and refresher training; robust inmate education and orientation; functioning internal and external reporting systems (ADECA hotline and third‑party reporting); a PREA‑trained investigations unit with timely, policy‑compliant investigations; expanded cameras and annual camera reviews; cross‑gender privacy and search policies implemented facility‑wide; gender‑responsive LGBTI policies and practices; a functioning grievance system; a quality improvement program and RMS with biannual and annual reviews; and implementation of the WRNA and women’s programming (e.g., Helping Women Recover, Beyond Trauma, Beyond Violence, Active Adult Relationships, Moving On, Parenting Inside Out, and reentry programming). The monitor reported that women generally felt sexually safe, knew how to report, and expressed confidence in the PREA investigator and the Institutional PREA Compliance Manager.\n\nTwo persistent challenges remained. First, correctional staffing: despite a finalized staffing plan (July 2017) and implementation of many of its recommendations (including shift changes, recruitment initiatives, and overtime controls), Tutwiler continued to have significant officer vacancies, requiring overtime, post “doubling,” and occasional use of supervisors in line posts. Recruitment and retention of women officers, validation of APOSTC standards, and long‑term staffing sufficiency remained in partial compliance. Second, aspects of facility culture: while sexual abuse and harassment declined, inmate polling and RMS data continued to identify a small number of staff using profane, degrading, or racially insensitive language; the administration responded with reminders, coaching, and training (including Racial Intelligence Training and Engagement) and progressive discipline where substantiated.\n\nThe court retains jurisdiction to enforce the consent decree, which remains in effect until the State achieves and sustains substantial compliance with all provisions for three consecutive monitor reports. No appeals were taken. The DOJ was represented by the Civil Rights Division, Special Litigation Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office; the State and ADOC were represented by ADOC’s General Counsel.",
    "ED-MI-0001": "On November 8, 2006, the day after Michigan voters approved “Proposal 2” amending the state constitution to prohibit public institutions from discriminating against or granting preferential treatment based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public higher education, employment, and contracting (Mich. Const. art. I, § 26), several organizations and individuals filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs included civil‑rights groups (BAMN, UEAALDF, Rainbow PUSH), unions, students, prospective applicants, and a student political party. They sued the Governor and the governing boards of the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University, later adding the Michigan Attorney General as a defendant and asserting claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. They alleged violations of the Equal Protection Clause—both as intentional discrimination and under the “political structure” doctrine of Hunter v. Erickson and Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1—preemption by Titles VI, VII, and IX, and infringement of universities’ First Amendment academic freedom, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief barring enforcement of Proposal 2.\n\nOn December 11, 2006, the university defendants filed a cross‑claim for declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction to postpone Proposal 2’s effective date during the then‑ongoing admissions cycle. The district court entered a stipulated temporary injunction on December 19, 2006, delaying application of § 26 to university admissions and financial aid through June 30, 2007, but the Sixth Circuit stayed that order on December 29, 2006 (Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm, 473 F.3d 237 (6th Cir. 2006)). The Attorney General intervened as a defendant; the court permitted Eric Russell, a Michigan law‑school applicant, to intervene and denied other intervention motions. A related action, Cantrell v. Granholm, filed December 19, 2006 by students and faculty asserting a political‑process equal protection claim focused on public university admissions, was consolidated on January 5, 2007. Plaintiffs also moved for class certification of student and faculty classes.\n\nOn March 18, 2008, Judge David M. Lawson granted summary judgment to the Attorney General, upheld Proposal 2, and denied the Cantrell plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion (Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v. Regents of the Univ. of Mich., 539 F. Supp. 2d 924 (E.D. Mich. 2008)). The court rejected the “political structure” challenge, distinguishing Hunter and Seattle on the ground that § 26 banned preferential treatment rather than obstructing access to equal treatment, and dismissed the First Amendment “academic freedom” claim for lack of standing. It denied the universities’ motion to dismiss themselves as unnecessary parties, reasoning their actions would be required to afford relief if the amendment fell. In a separate order that day, the court granted the Cantrell plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment as to intervenor Russell and dismissed him (Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v. Regents of the Univ. of Mich., 539 F. Supp. 2d 960 (E.D. Mich. 2008)); it later denied reconsideration (592 F. Supp. 2d 948 (E.D. Mich. 2008)).\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed. A Sixth Circuit panel reversed, holding Proposal 2 unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause’s political‑process doctrine (652 F.3d 607 (6th Cir. 2011)), but the court granted rehearing en banc, vacated the panel opinion, and on November 15, 2012 again reversed the district court, concluding that § 26 unconstitutionally restructured the political process by removing authority over race‑conscious admissions from elected university boards and placing it at the state‑constitutional level, thereby imposing special burdens on racial minorities (Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Regents of the Univ. of Mich., 701 F.3d 466 (6th Cir. 2012)). The en banc court also affirmed the district court’s refusal to dismiss the universities as parties and affirmed dismissal of intervenor Russell.\n\nThe Michigan Attorney General petitioned for certiorari. On April 22, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed, holding there is no federal constitutional basis to set aside a state constitutional amendment that commits to voters the decision whether race‑based preferences may be considered in governmental decisions—including university admissions—and that Hunter and Seattle did not compel a different result in this context (Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (BAMN), 572 U.S. 291 (2014)). The Supreme Court upheld § 26’s ban on race‑based preferences in public higher‑education admissions, reinstating the district court’s judgment for the defendants.\n\nJudge: David M. Lawson, U.S. District Judge, E.D. Michigan. Counsel: Plaintiffs were represented by private civil‑rights counsel and organizations (including Scheff & Washington, P.C., ACLU of Michigan, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and outside pro bono counsel); the Michigan Attorney General represented the State; the universities were represented by private counsel. Reported decisions: 473 F.3d 237 (6th Cir. 2006) (stay of injunction); 539 F. Supp. 2d 924 (E.D. Mich. 2008) (summary judgment); 539 F. Supp. 2d 960 (E.D. Mich. 2008) (intervenor dismissal); 592 F. Supp. 2d 948 (E.D. Mich. 2008) (denying reconsideration); 701 F.3d 466 (6th Cir. 2012) (en banc, reversed); and Schuette v. BAMN, 572 U.S. 291 (2014) (reversed en banc). No settlement, decree, or monitoring followed; the Supreme Court’s decision ended the litigation, leaving Proposal 2 in force.",
    "DR-CA-0033": "On August 22, 2005, a wheelchair user sued a national restaurant chain in the Southern District of California under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12181 et seq., and California access laws (the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Disabled Persons Act (CDPA)). The plaintiff alleged that two newly constructed Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants in San Diego (Pacific Beach) and Encinitas denied him full and equal enjoyment of their goods and services. He cited inaccessible parking, entrances, and restrooms, and principally challenged a 44-inch wall (46 inches with sneeze guard bracket) along the food preparation counter that blocked wheelchair users—whose average eye level is 43–51 inches—from seeing the food being prepared and displayed, which he argued was central to the “Chipotle experience.” He sought declaratory and injunctive relief and damages under state law.\n\nAt the time of the visits (2005–2006), Chipotle had an unwritten practice of accommodating customers with disabilities by holding up serving spoons or cups of food or moving food to a side counter or table; in February 2007, it adopted a written “Customers With Disabilities” policy to formalize such accommodations. After contested discovery (including a third‑party indemnity claim by Chipotle against its landlords over common‑area obligations that was later dismissed), the court (Judge Napoleon A. Jones, Jr.) granted in part and denied in part cross‑motions for summary judgment on June 14, 2007. The court held that the food area was governed by ADAAG § 7.2 (sales and service counters), not § 4.33.3 (fixed seating/assembly areas). It found Chipotle’s lowered transaction station did not satisfy § 7.2(2)(i) or (ii), and set for trial the question whether Chipotle provided “equivalent facilitation” under § 7.2(2)(iii). The court also found ADA violations in the parking lots during some of the plaintiff’s visits but, because those had been corrected, dismissed the ADA claims as moot and reserved CDPA damages; ADA claims regarding entrances, restrooms, and seating were resolved or deemed outside the pleadings.\n\nFollowing a four‑day bench trial in November–December 2007, the court ruled that Chipotle’s unwritten practice of accommodation did not constitute equivalent facilitation but that its 2007 written policy did. The court denied injunctive relief and awarded $5,000 in CDPA statutory damages ($1,000 per visit) for five “bona fide” visits before the written policy; it denied damages for three visits undertaken primarily to gather evidence. On April 21, 2008, it denied the plaintiff’s motion to amend the findings. The court later awarded the plaintiff $136,537.83 in attorneys’ fees; each side bore its own costs.\n\nBoth sides appealed. In a published decision, Antoninetti v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 643 F.3d 1165 (9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth Circuit (Judges Friedman, D.W. Nelson, and Reinhardt) affirmed that § 7.2 governs Chipotle’s counters and that the lowered transaction station was not a “portion” of the main counter or an auxiliary counter under § 7.2(2)(i) or (ii). It reversed the district court’s ruling that the written policy constituted equivalent facilitation under § 7.2(2)(iii), holding that showing samples or assembling food at another location did not provide “substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the facility.” The court concluded that Chipotle violated the ADA, vacated the denial of injunctive relief as an abuse of discretion, and remanded for entry of an appropriate injunction. It also vacated the damages award and remanded for further proceedings, noting that damages under the CDPA are available for visits when the plaintiff “actually presented himself … with the intent of being served and to purchase food … and actually encountered” unequal access. The Ninth Circuit vacated the fee award and directed reconsideration in light of the changed outcome.\n\nOn remand before Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz, the court entered judgment for the plaintiff on the ADA violation and set proceedings on injunctive relief and damages. Chipotle represented that it had lowered food preparation counters at all California restaurants; the court permitted limited discovery to evaluate mootness and how to ensure permanent compliance. Before injunctive relief could be fashioned, the plaintiff passed away on May 9, 2011. On March 21, 2012, the court denied injunctive relief as moot and awarded $5,000 in CDPA damages for five “bona fide” visits; it again denied damages for three litigation‑related visits under the Ninth Circuit’s guidance. The court later reconsidered fees and, in 2012, awarded substantially increased fees (over $500,000) and costs for district court work and for successfully opposing Chipotle’s petition for a writ of certiorari; the Ninth Circuit separately awarded appellate fees. Throughout the case, the plaintiff was represented by private counsel, and Chipotle by private counsel. Related litigation included a later‑filed statewide class action (Antoninetti et al. v. Chipotle, No. 06‑cv‑2671 (S.D. Cal.)), which was consolidated with this case for discovery.",
    "CJ-FL-0009": "In June 2019, several lawsuits were filed in the Northern District of Florida and later consolidated as Jones v. DeSantis (No. 4:19‑cv‑300). The individual plaintiffs were Florida residents with past felony convictions who had completed incarceration and supervision but still owed court-imposed financial obligations; organizational plaintiffs were the Florida State Conference of the NAACP, the Orange County Branch of the NAACP, and the League of Women Voters of Florida, which conduct voter registration and education. The defendants were the Governor of Florida, the Florida Secretary of State (the state’s chief election officer), and several county Supervisors of Elections. Plaintiffs were represented by civil-rights organizations and private counsel, including the ACLU, Brennan Center for Justice, Campaign Legal Center, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nProceeding under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the plaintiffs challenged Senate Bill 7066—enacted after Florida voters approved Amendment 4 in November 2018—which defined “completion of all terms of sentence” to include payment of fines, fees, costs, and restitution. They alleged (i) wealth-based discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause; (ii) an unconstitutional “poll tax or other tax” under the Twenty-Fourth Amendment; (iii) violations of the Due Process Clause due to vagueness and the risk of erroneous deprivation of the right to vote; and (iv) related statutory claims (including the National Voter Registration Act and, in some complaints, the Voting Rights Act). They sought declaratory and injunctive relief and class certification.\n\nOn October 18, 2019, after a two-day evidentiary hearing, Judge Robert L. Hinkle granted a preliminary injunction preventing the Secretary of State and certain county supervisors from barring the 17 individual plaintiffs from registering or voting based solely on unpaid LFOs if they asserted (for registration) or showed (for voting) that they were genuinely unable to pay. The court rejected a request to abstain and noted the Florida Supreme Court would soon address the state-law meaning of Amendment 4. On February 19, 2020, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction (950 F.3d 795), holding that heightened scrutiny applied to wealth-based discrimination in this context and that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Equal Protection claim as applied to those unable to pay.\n\nMeanwhile, on January 16, 2020, the Florida Supreme Court issued an advisory opinion construing Amendment 4 to require payment of all financial obligations imposed as part of the sentence. Back in the district court, Judge Hinkle certified a class (all otherwise-eligible persons denied the right to vote because of outstanding LFOs) and a subclass (those genuinely unable to pay) on April 7, 2020. Following an eight‑day bench trial in April 2020, the court issued a merits decision on May 24, 2020 (2020 WL 2618062). Based on extensive factual findings—including that Florida lacked a reliable process to determine what LFOs were owed and paid, and that most affected individuals were indigent—the court held that Florida could not condition voting on LFOs a person was genuinely unable to pay; that court fees and costs functioned as “other taxes” barred by the Twenty-Fourth Amendment; and that the State’s implementation created a substantial risk of erroneous deprivation and deterred lawful voting. The court permanently enjoined enforcement of SB 7066 to the extent it (1) required payment of fees and costs as a condition of voting, (2) required payment of fines or restitution that a person genuinely could not pay, or (3) required payment of amounts that could not be determined with diligence. It also ordered a streamlined advisory‑opinion process through the Division of Elections to confirm eligibility or inability to pay.\n\nThe Governor and Secretary appealed. On July 16, 2020, the Supreme Court denied an application to vacate an appellate stay; Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justices Ginsburg and Kagan, dissented. On September 11, 2020, sitting en banc, the Eleventh Circuit reversed (975 F.3d 1016), vacated the injunction, and upheld SB 7066. The majority held that rational-basis review applies to felon reenfranchisement classifications; that requiring completion of all sentencing terms, including LFOs, is rationally related to legitimate state interests; that court‑imposed fees and costs are punitive, not “taxes,” and therefore do not violate the Twenty-Fourth Amendment; and that Florida’s procedures—including notice and hearings before removal from the rolls and an advisory‑opinion mechanism—did not violate due process or render the scheme void for vagueness. The court also rejected arguments that the State’s administrative difficulties in determining LFO balances rendered the law unconstitutional.\n\nKey proceedings included: (1) preliminary injunction granted October 18, 2019 (N.D. Fla.); (2) partial stay of the injunction pending appeal December 19, 2019; (3) Florida Supreme Court advisory opinion, January 16, 2020, confirming inclusion of LFOs; (4) Eleventh Circuit panel affirmance, February 19, 2020, 950 F.3d 795; (5) class and subclass certification, April 7, 2020; (6) bench trial and permanent injunction, May 24, 2020, 2020 WL 2618062; and (7) Eleventh Circuit en banc reversal, September 11, 2020, 975 F.3d 1016. The district court case was presided over by Judge Robert L. Hinkle; earlier, Chief Judge Mark E. Walker handled initial scheduling before recusal. The consolidated actions included Jones v. DeSantis (lead), Raysor v. Lee (class action), Gruver v. Barton et al., McCoy v. DeSantis, and Mendez v. DeSantis.",
    "CW-CA-0005": "Filed on July 18, 2002, this class action challenged the failure to provide medically necessary mental health services to foster children in Los Angeles County and statewide in California. The plaintiffs are foster children (proceeding under pseudonyms) who alleged that children in or at imminent risk of foster care with documented mental health conditions were not receiving required services in home‑like settings. They sued Los Angeles County (and its Department of Children and Family Services) and the Directors of the California Department of Health Services and Department of Social Services. Plaintiffs were represented by public interest and private counsel, including the ACLU of Southern California, Western Center on Law & Poverty, National Center for Youth Law, and the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n\nThe First Amended Complaint (December 20, 2002) asserted federal claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to enforce Medicaid’s Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions, and alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and federal and state due process. Factually, plaintiffs alleged that tens of thousands of foster children with behavioral, emotional, or psychiatric impairments were not being provided medically necessary services (e.g., assessments, intensive home‑based services, case management, “wraparound” services, and therapeutic foster care) and were instead over‑relied upon institutional placements and experienced repeated placement disruptions. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nOn June 18, 2003, the court certified a statewide class of children in foster care or at imminent risk of placement with documented mental health needs who require individualized mental health services in home or home‑like settings. On July 16, 2003, the court approved a negotiated settlement with Los Angeles County, certified a county subclass, and retained jurisdiction, establishing an advisory panel to monitor county compliance.\n\nAs to the State of California, on March 14, 2006, the district court granted a preliminary injunction (433 F. Supp. 2d 1065) requiring the State to provide wraparound services and therapeutic foster care to class members on a consistent statewide basis through Medi‑Cal or other means, and issued a clarifying addendum on May 12, 2006. The Ninth Circuit denied a stay but, on March 23, 2007, reversed and remanded (481 F.3d 1150), holding that EPSDT requires provision of the component services listed in 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a), and directing the district court to determine whether those components were being effectively provided, rather than requiring specific “bundled” programs; it confirmed a § 1983 private right of action under § 1396a(a)(10).\n\nFollowing further proceedings and negotiations, the parties reached a statewide settlement. On December 5, 2011, the court entered a Stipulated Judgment pursuant to a Settlement Agreement with the state defendants. The Agreement required (1) development and dissemination of a Medi‑Cal Specialty Mental Health Documentation Manual describing Intensive Care Coordination (ICC), Intensive Home‑Based Services (IHBS), and Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC); (2) submission of State Plan Amendments as needed to ensure Medicaid coverage of these services; (3) adoption of a shared, statewide Core Practice Model using Child and Family Teams; (4) joint management and oversight by the Departments of Health Care Services and Social Services; (5) training, technical assistance, data collection and quality assurance; and (6) a process to identify class members and link them to services. The court retained jurisdiction for 36 months (until December 5, 2014) and appointed a Special Master (Richard Saletta) to assist in developing the Implementation Plan, monitor progress, and report regularly. The United States Department of Justice filed comments supporting final approval, citing consistency with the ADA’s integration mandate and EPSDT requirements.\n\nThroughout 2012–2014, the State filed implementation plans, expanded ICC/IHBS statewide, worked with CMS on TFC coverage, created a shared management structure, and reported on data collection efforts. The Special Master’s November 20, 2014 progress report documented increased delivery of ICC and IHBS to subclass members, the build‑out of county‑level structures, and ongoing work to secure CMS approval for TFC.\n\nSeparately, Los Angeles County’s 2003 settlement remained under the court’s jurisdiction and advisory panel oversight, with periodic reports documenting county efforts to implement Child and Family Teams, expand intensive services, reduce use of congregate care, and align practice with the Core Practice Model.\n\nReported opinions include the district court’s preliminary injunction order (433 F. Supp. 2d 1065 (C.D. Cal. 2006)) and the Ninth Circuit’s decision (Katie A. ex rel. Ludin v. Los Angeles County, 481 F.3d 1150 (9th Cir. 2007)). The case did not proceed to trial; it resolved through the 2003 county settlement and the 2011 statewide settlement, each enforced by the court with monitoring mechanisms.",
    "PC-VA-0022": "On December 19, 2014, a Virginia state prisoner filed an individual civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the Western District of Virginia against the state corrections department and numerous corrections officials at system and facility level. The prisoner proceeded pro se in the district court; the defendants were represented by the Virginia Office of the Attorney General. The court denied the prisoner’s motion to certify a class and his request for appointment of counsel. Two co‑plaintiffs originally named were severed, leaving a single plaintiff.\n\nThe suit challenged Virginia Department of Corrections Operating Procedure 830.A governing “Level S” segregation at Red Onion State Prison and Wallens Ridge State Prison, alleging that the classification and review procedures kept him in highly restrictive solitary conditions without constitutionally adequate process and that those conditions violated the Eighth Amendment. The prisoner, serving a 38‑year sentence for violent offenses and convicted in 2011 of malicious wounding after a 2009 assault on a guard, had been designated a Level S “Intensive Management” (IM) inmate at Red Onion. Under OP 830.A, Level S inmates are divided into Intensive Management and Special Management (SM) paths. SM inmates may progress through a goal‑oriented Step‑Down program toward general population, while IM inmates progress through IM‑0, IM‑1, and IM‑2 “privilege levels,” and, if approved, to an IM Closed Pod (IM‑SL6) intended to improve quality of life for those facing long‑term high security. Level S inmates receive periodic Institutional Classification Authority reviews at least every 90 days. The prisoner contended that IM status effectively barred him from meaningful progress out of segregation, that reviews were arbitrary or perfunctory, and that IM inmates were subjected to harsher conditions than similarly situated SM inmates, violating equal protection. He sought declaratory and injunctive relief (including abolishing OP 830.A and altering conditions) and monetary damages.\n\nThe prisoner described conditions that included single‑cell housing, meals in cell, three showers per week, one hour of out‑of‑cell recreation five days per week (alone in a secure area), restraints and escorts whenever out of cell, non‑contact visits, limited phone and commissary privileges, constant lighting, noise, and other restrictions he alleged caused mental and physical harms. The defendants submitted OP 830.A and related classification procedures, and an affidavit explaining the Level S program, IM/SM tracks, privileges, and review mechanisms.\n\nAfter the court granted leave to amend and denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss, it set a schedule for summary judgment. The magistrate judge had previously granted a protective order staying discovery pending the motion to dismiss. The defendants moved for summary judgment; the plaintiff opposed with a sworn declaration and exhibits.\n\nOn September 28, 2016, Judge James P. Jones granted summary judgment to all remaining defendants and dismissed the claim against the Virginia Department of Corrections as legally frivolous. The court held that the plaintiff failed to show a Fourteenth Amendment due process violation, finding that under OP 830.A he received periodic, multi‑level reviews of his status and opportunities to advance in step‑down and privilege levels; and that his restrictive conditions and duration, in light of his offense and institutional record, did not establish deprivation of a protected liberty interest without due process. The court also rejected his Eighth Amendment claim, concluding he had not shown deprivation of a basic human need such as food, shelter, or medical care, deliberate indifference by officials, or injury rising to constitutional magnitude. The court denied the equal protection claim for lack of evidence of purposeful discrimination among similarly situated inmates.\n\nThe prisoner appealed. On November 22, 2017, a Fourth Circuit panel (Judges Niemeyer, King, and Floyd) issued an unpublished per curiam decision affirming the district court’s judgment. The appeal was argued with appointed pro bono counsel for the prisoner; the Attorney General’s Office represented the appellees. No trial occurred, and there were no decrees or settlements.\n\nKey docket events:\n- March 6, 2015: Class certification and appointment of counsel denied.\n- October 29, 2015: Protective order staying discovery granted.\n- May 18, 2016: Leave to amend granted; motion to dismiss denied; defendants directed to move for summary judgment.\n- September 28, 2016: Summary judgment granted; claims against VDOC dismissed as frivolous.\n- November 22, 2017: Fourth Circuit affirmed by unpublished opinion.",
    "CJ-MD-0001": "On January 19, 2006, a condemned Maryland inmate filed a federal civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services, the Commissioner of the Division of Correction, two wardens, and unnamed execution team members, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to bar his execution under Maryland’s current lethal injection practices. The prisoner argued that the three‑drug protocol (sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride), the lack of anesthesiology-qualified personnel, long IV runs across two rooms, and the absence of monitoring for anesthetic depth created a grave and unnecessary risk that he would experience excruciating pain in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. He cited, among other things, a 1998 execution in which an IV line leaked and the procedure lasted 23 minutes, and he contended his history of intravenous drug use would complicate venous access. The State, represented by the Maryland Attorney General’s Office, opposed emergency relief.\n\nChief Judge Benson Everett Legg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland held expedited hearings on January 24, 27, and February 1, 2006, receiving testimony from medical experts (including an anesthesiologist and a trauma surgeon) and members of the execution team. On February 1, 2006, Judge Legg denied both a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, finding the inmate had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits under the governing preliminary injunction standard and that Maryland’s protocol, if properly implemented, would render an inmate deeply unconscious before administering the paralytic and potassium chloride. The court noted the State’s protocol called for 3 grams of thiopental and had built‑in redundancy (two IV lines, backup syringes). The prisoner appealed the denial; the Fourth Circuit dismissed/denied the appeal and issued its mandate on February 17, 2006. The district court ordered post‑execution reporting and then proceeded with discovery. A motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust under the Prison Litigation Reform Act was denied on September 15, 2006, after the court found exhaustion was not jurisdictional and that exhaustion had been completed. The court conducted an evidentiary bench proceeding September 19–22, 2006, including testimony from the inmate’s experts and execution team members, and issued rulings on evidentiary motions. In December 2006, the court reopened the record to explore whether qualified medical professionals could be used to assist in executions, but further proceedings were stayed in light of a dispositive state‑court decision described below. Ultimately, with executions in Maryland stayed, the federal case was administratively closed by agreement on August 16, 2012.\n\nSeparately, on January 20, 2006, three organizations (NAACP, ACLU of Maryland, and Maryland Citizens Against State Executions) and the same condemned inmate filed an action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against the Secretary and the Commissioner alleging that the Division of Correction’s Execution Operations Manual (including the “Lethal Injection Checklist”) conflicted with Maryland’s death penalty statute, Md. Code Ann., Correctional Services § 3‑905, and, in any event, was invalid because it had been adopted without complying with the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Md. Code Ann., State Government § 10‑101 et seq. The plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\n\nOn December 19, 2006, in consolidated appeals that included the Baltimore City APA case and other challenges, the Maryland Court of Appeals (opinion by Judge Alan M. Wilner) held: (1) the Execution Operations Manual’s three‑drug mix and method (including use of two paralytic agents) did not conflict with § 3‑905 and were not unconstitutional on their face; but (2) the detailed “Lethal Injection Checklist,” which specified the contents and manner of administering the drugs, was a “regulation” under the APA because it had general application and future effect and implemented the death penalty statute. Because the Division of Correction had not adopted the checklist pursuant to APA rulemaking (notice, review by the Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive, and Legislative Review, and publication), it was ineffective. The Court of Appeals vacated the denial of injunctive relief and remanded with instructions to enjoin enforcement of the Lethal Injection Checklist until it was properly adopted as a regulation under the APA or exempted by the General Assembly. See Evans v. State, 396 Md. 256 (2006). As a result, Maryland executions were stayed pending APA compliance. In 2010 the Secretary published proposed death penalty regulations in the Maryland Register, but withdrew them in early 2011 for further review. By March 2012, the parties reported that executions remained stayed until regulations were adopted.\n\nParties and Counsel: In the federal case, the prisoner was represented by private counsel (Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP and associated counsel); the State officials were represented by Assistant Attorneys General from the Maryland Office of the Attorney General. In the state APA action, the organizational plaintiffs (NAACP, ACLU of Maryland, CASE) and the prisoner proceeded against the Secretary of DPSCS and the DOC Commissioner.\n\nCause of Action and Relief: The federal suit was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging violations of the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief (including a TRO and preliminary injunction) to bar execution under Maryland’s existing lethal injection protocol. The state action sought declaratory and injunctive relief under Maryland law, asserting inconsistency with Md. Code Ann., Corr. Servs. § 3‑905 and failure to comply with the APA.\n\nJudges: Chief Judge Benson Everett Legg presided in the U.S. District Court. Judge Alan M. Wilner authored the Maryland Court of Appeals opinion; Chief Judge Robert M. Bell dissented in part.\n\nFilings and Proceedings: Key filings included the inmate’s January 2006 TRO/PI motion in federal court, the State’s opposition, a two‑day evidentiary hearing (with expert and execution team testimony), and Judge Legg’s February 1, 2006 memorandum denying relief (412 F. Supp. 2d 519). The Fourth Circuit dismissed the appeal and issued a mandate on February 17, 2006. Discovery and motion practice continued through summer 2006; the court denied a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust on September 15, 2006, held an evidentiary bench proceeding in September 2006, and later reopened the record in December 2006 before staying proceedings. In the state APA action, the Circuit Court initially denied emergency relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed in part, held the checklist to be a regulation, and remanded with instructions to enjoin its enforcement until APA compliance (396 Md. 256 (2006)).\n\nOutcome and Effect: The federal court denied preliminary injunctive relief and did not enter a final merits judgment; the case was administratively closed in August 2012 while Maryland executions remained stayed. In the state action, the Court of Appeals’ injunction against use of the Lethal Injection Checklist remained in effect until the State adopted valid regulations or obtained a legislative exemption. Proposed regulations were published in November 2010 but withdrawn in February 2011; as of March 2012, executions in Maryland were stayed pending adoption of regulations. The state’s lethal injection protocol was thus halted by court order of indefinite duration unless and until the APA was satisfied or the Legislature acted. The Court of Appeals also affirmed the validity of the protocol under § 3‑905 and rejected other consolidated challenges.",
    "CW-DC-0001": "Filed June 20, 1989, this class action was brought on behalf of children in the custody of, or known to, the District of Columbia’s child‑welfare system—principally foster children and abused or neglected children reported to authorities—against District officials, including the Mayor and senior human services leadership. The children, represented by private public‑interest counsel (the ACLU Children’s Rights Project/Children’s Rights, later A Better Childhood), sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause; the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 and Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act; and District statutes, including the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act of 1977 and the Youth Residential Facilities Licensure Act of 1986. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to end systemic deficiencies—untimely and inadequate investigations of abuse/neglect, failure to provide services to keep families intact, prolonged “emergency care,” inappropriate and unsafe placements, missing case plans and reviews, delayed permanency and adoptions, inadequate staffing, training, and information systems—and to enforce statutory and constitutional requirements.\n\nAfter a two‑week bench trial, Judge Thomas F. Hogan issued a detailed liability opinion on April 18, 1991 (762 F. Supp. 959), finding “widespread and systematic deficiencies” and holding the District liable under § 1983 for violating federal and local child‑welfare statutes, and, as to children in custody, due process. The court entered a comprehensive consent Remedial Order in August 1991 establishing a court‑appointed Monitor (the Center for the Study of Social Policy) and prescribing detailed requirements for protective services, emergency care, placement standards, case planning, visitation, permanency, staffing and caseload caps, training, licensing, contracting, information systems, and revenue maximization. On appeal, the D.C. Circuit affirmed the judgment on District law grounds and remanded to rest the decree solely on local law (990 F.2d 1319 (D.C. Cir. 1993)); the court adopted a Modified Final Order (MFO) on November 18, 1993 removing federal‑law references while maintaining substantive provisions.\n\nPersistent noncompliance led to enforcement proceedings. In October 1994 the court found contempt and imposed limited receiverships over resource development and protective services. In May 1995, after further failures, the court entered contempt sanctions and established a full receivership over the child‑welfare system (887 F. Supp. 297; General Receivership Order, Aug. 24, 1995). The D.C. Circuit later clarified that any receiver’s authority to override local law must be narrowly tailored to instances necessary to enforce the decree and tied to specific federal law justifications (144 F.3d 847 (D.C. Cir. 1998)). The receivership produced structural changes, including creation of a standalone Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA). By consent order, the court terminated the receivership effective June 15, 2001 and commenced a probationary period with performance standards.\n\nTo guide post‑receivership compliance, the court approved an Implementation Plan in 2003 (re‑stating exit benchmarks), amended it in 2007, and, after performance setbacks in 2008 (including highly publicized child fatalities), entered a 2008 Stipulated Order requiring a corrective “strategy plan.” In April 2010 the court held the District in civil contempt for failing to timely produce an adequate annual plan developed in consultation with plaintiffs and to include plaintiffs and the Monitor in selecting a permanent CFSA Director, as required by the stipulation; the court modified the MFO’s planning provisions and adopted a new Implementation and Exit Plan (IEP) with specific exit standards across safety, permanency, well‑being, and systems management. Subsequent Monitor reports documented mixed performance—improvements in health services, licensing, and sibling placement and visits; persistent deficiencies in investigations (especially timely closure and quality), consistent safety assessments during visits, parent‑child visitation, and timely permanency—and the court retained jurisdiction, occasionally ordering corrective actions and imposing sanctions.\n\nThroughout, the court relied on the Monitor (CSSP) to assess compliance, issue bi‑annual reports, and assist the parties. The court repeatedly awarded plaintiffs interim attorneys’ fees and costs for litigation and monitoring (e.g., 1998 and 2000 awards). On August 29, 2019, after mediation, the parties jointly submitted and the court approved an Exit and Sustainability Plan (ESP), replacing the 2010 IEP. The ESP recognizes the District’s sustained compliance by moving 56 exit standards—covering licensing, 24‑hour response, case planning, most visitation and placement standards, training, budgeting, provider payments, and many others—into “Outcomes to be Maintained,” ending routine court reporting on those items. It narrows ongoing external monitoring to a set of “Outcomes to be Achieved,” focusing on remaining problem areas: timely initiation and closure and qualitative adequacy of abuse/neglect investigations; provision of services to promote safety, permanency, and well‑being; safety assessment during worker visits to in‑home and out‑of‑home cases; intensive visitation in the first month after new or changed placements; adherence to the 30‑day limit for emergency/temporary care; and parent–worker and parent–child visitation for reunification cases. The ESP also memorializes CFSA’s self‑regulation and public reporting commitments and “placement array” development to support permanency. Under the ESP, the Monitor will continue bi‑annual reports on the remaining outcomes, and the parties will meet annually to reassess the path to final exit."
