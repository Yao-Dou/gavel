    "46290": "The Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council (QEC), a student organization, initiated a lawsuit against the Texas A&M University System's Board of Regents, Chancellor, and University President, alleging violations of the First Amendment. The suit arose after the Board of Regents passed a resolution, known as the \"Drag Ban Resolution,\" prohibiting drag shows on Texas A&M campuses, effectively canceling the QEC's annual drag performance, Draggieland, scheduled for March 27, 2025. The QEC argued that the ban constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination and an impermissible prior restraint on speech, seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe QEC asserted that drag performances, including Draggieland, are a form of expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, serving as a celebration of LGBTQ+ culture and a means of conveying messages of support and education. They contended that the Board’s resolution, which cited President Trump’s executive order on “gender ideology,” was viewpoint-based, targeting speech based on its perceived ideology. The Board of Regents argued that the ban was necessary to maintain an effective learning environment and comply with federal antidiscrimination laws and that the performances could be considered lewd or indecent.\n\nThe United States District Court ruled in favor of the QEC, granting the motion for a preliminary injunction on March 24, 2025. The court found that the Board’s resolution likely violated the First Amendment, constituting both viewpoint discrimination and an unconstitutional prior restraint. The Court reasoned that the ban was overly vague, failing to provide clear standards for determining what constitutes prohibited conduct. The court further found that the Board had not demonstrated a compelling governmental interest justifying the restriction, specifically regarding potential disruptions to the university environment or harassment of students. As a result, the court enjoined the Board from enforcing its ban and allowed the Draggieland performance to proceed as scheduled. The case has been appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "46324": "This legal case, filed on March 31, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, involves a dispute between Inclusiv, Inc., a non-profit organization, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), along with its Administrator Lee Zeldin and Acting Deputy Administrator W.C. McIntosh, and Citibank, N.A. The case also involves Citibank. Inclusiv received a $1.87 billion grant under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, intending to distribute these funds to credit unions to support clean energy initiatives in low- and moderate-income communities.\n\nShortly after Inclusiv announced its selection of subrecipient credit unions in February 2025, the EPA, under Administrator Zeldin, publicly announced its intent to freeze the GGRF funds and return them to the U.S. Treasury. Subsequently, EPA issued a notice terminating Inclusiv's grant and directed Citibank to refrain from disbursing the funds. Inclusiv alleges that these actions are unlawful, exceeding the EPA's statutory authority, violating the Administrative Procedure Act, and infringing on constitutional principles related to the separation of powers and due process.\n\nIn response, Inclusiv filed a Complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, requesting the court to prevent the EPA from interfering with the grant and Citibank from withholding the funds. Following an agreement not to move funds pending a temporary restraining order in a related case (Case No. 25-cv-698), Inclusiv discovered that Citibank had moved the funds into a money market fund. Inclusiv then filed an Emergency Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order to restore the funds, which was denied as moot following the Court’s ruling on the preliminary injunction motion in Case No. 25-cv-698. The court has consolidated this case with Case No. 25-cv-698 and ordered that all subsequent filings be made in the lead case.",
    "46391": "This is a civil case filed on April 11, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division, by five plaintiffs, S.Y., Z.D., Y.W., H.G., and W.X., against Kristi Noem (in her official capacity as Secretary of DHS), Todd M. Lyons (in his official capacity as Acting Director of ICE), Moises Becerra (in his official capacity as Acting Field Office Director of the San Francisco ICE Office), and Donald J. Trump (in his official capacity as President of the United States). The plaintiffs, all holders of F-1 student visas, allege that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated their Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems (SEVIS) records, jeopardizing their lawful immigration status. This termination occurred around April 4-8, 2025, after some of the plaintiffs had contact with law enforcement, though none have criminal histories that violate their visa status. The plaintiffs claim the terminations were based on flawed reasoning and lack due process, and believe DHS is attempting to coerce them into leaving the country.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment's procedural due process clause. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order restoring their SEVIS records and enjoining the defendants from taking enforcement actions against them. Following the filing of the Complaint, the court granted a Temporary Restraining Order on April 17, 2025, extending it for 14 days, and scheduled a hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction.  Subsequent filings included responses and supplemental briefs from the defendants and plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the defendants filed a Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the preliminary injunction orders. The case has been reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White and is currently ongoing, with a motion hearing scheduled for September 12, 2025. The case is currently stayed pending the Ninth Circuit’s review of the preliminary injunction.",
    "46509": "On April 29, 2025, The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, its Board of Directors, and individual Board members Laura G. Ross, Thomas E. Rothman, and Diane Kaplan filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, various officials within his administration, and the United States Office of Management and Budget. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment and a preliminary injunction challenging an email purportedly from the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel informing Ross, Rothman, and Kaplan that they had been terminated from their positions on the CPB Board.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the CPB is a private nonprofit corporation created by the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, designed to be insulated from governmental interference. They asserted that the President lacks the authority to remove Board members, citing provisions within the Act that explicitly prevent the executive branch from exercising control over the CPB’s governance. The defendants argued that the president has the authority to remove board members.\n\nFollowing a hearing on May 14, 2025, Judge Randolph D. Moss denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction on June 8, 2025. The court found that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or a likelihood of irreparable harm. The court recognized the congressional intent to insulate the CPB from political influence but concluded that the facts and applicable law did not clearly support the plaintiffs' claim that the President’s actions violated the Public Broadcasting Act. Subsequently, Laura G. Ross and Thomas E. Rothman voluntarily dismissed their claims, leaving Diane Kaplan and the Board of Directors as the remaining plaintiffs. The case now proceeds toward a hearing on the plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment.",
    "46590": "This is a civil case filed on April 7, 2025, in the Southern District of West Virginia, concerning the termination of employees within the Respiratory Health Division of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the subsequent disruption of the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP). The plaintiff, Harry Wiley, acting individually and on behalf of similarly situated coal miners, filed suit against Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Wiley alleges that the abrupt termination of key NIOSH personnel, including the chief medical officer overseeing the CWHSP, jeopardizes the health and safety of coal miners, particularly those seeking screening for coal mine dust lung disease (CMDLD) and job transfers to non-dusty areas.\n\nThe core of the case revolves around the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended, which mandates that miners have access to medical screening and job transfer rights if they develop signs of occupational lung disease. The CWHSP, operating within NIOSH, is responsible for providing these screenings and facilitating job transfers under the Part 90 program. Wiley, a coal miner diagnosed with black lung disease, applied for Part 90 benefits in November 2024, but the program’s closure has prevented NIOSH from processing his application and other miners’ requests.\n\nWiley’s amended complaint asserts claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging that the Defendants’ actions were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, violating the statutory duties outlined in the Mine Act. He also asserts a claim for deprivation of procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment. The Defendants contend that the actions are within the Secretary's discretion and related to a broader reorganization of HHS.\n\nFollowing a hearing on May 7, 2025, Judge Irene C. Berger granted the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction on May 13, 2025. The Court ordered that the RIFs in the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division be rescinded to facilitate the full restoration of the division and ensure continued operation of the CWHSP, preventing any pause or gap in mandated protections for miners. The court also set the security required for the injunction at zero. The case is scheduled for a pretrial conference on April 23, 2026, and trial on May 4, 2026.",
    "46605": "Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan, a Venezuelan citizen detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), initiated legal action in the Central District of California seeking a writ of habeas corpus and declaratory and injunctive relief against several government officials and agencies. The case arose from President Trump’s issuance of Proclamation No. 10903, which invoked the Alien Enemies Act to authorize the immediate removal of certain Venezuelan citizens. Arevalo, along with others, challenged the Proclamation's enforcement, arguing that they were not afforded adequate notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal. \n\nInitially, Arevalo filed an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and a motion for class certification, both of which were granted in part by the Court. The Court temporarily enjoined the Government from removing Arevalo or members of the putative class without further order. Following arguments and a hearing, the Court issued an amended order granting a preliminary injunction and certifying a class for the limited purpose of injunctive relief. \n\nSubsequently, Arevalo filed an ex parte application for a writ of habeas corpus, seeking immediate release from ICE custody after being granted asylum. However, the government asserted its right to appeal the asylum decision and invoked 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A), allowing continued detention pending the appeal. The Court denied Arevalo’s application for a writ of habeas corpus, noting the government’s right to appeal and directing the government to file status reports regarding the appeal's progress. The government ultimately appealed the District Court’s preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "46635": "In May 2025, President Donald J. Trump removed Carla D. Hayden as Librarian of Congress and subsequently attempted to remove Shira Perlmutter from her position as Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office. The President then appointed Todd Blanche, the Deputy Attorney General, as acting Librarian of Congress without Senate confirmation and directed him to replace Ms. Perlmutter. Ms. Perlmutter, alleging that the President lacked the authority to take these actions, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on May 22, 2025, seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. She initially sought a temporary restraining order to prevent Mr. Blanche from exercising the powers of acting Librarian of Congress and to ensure her continued role as Register of Copyrights. The court denied this request.\n\nThe lawsuit asserts that the President's actions violate the Constitution and statutory provisions governing the Library of Congress. Specifically, the complaint argues that the President exceeded his authority under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and the statutory framework outlining the Librarian of Congress’s appointment and the Register of Copyrights’ role, which is vested in the Librarian. Ms. Perlmutter contends that the Librarian, not the President, has the authority to remove the Register of Copyrights. Following the denial of the temporary restraining order, Ms. Perlmutter moved for a preliminary injunction, which the court also denied, finding she had not demonstrated an irreparable harm. She then appealed this decision to the D.C. Circuit Court and filed a motion for an injunction pending appeal, which was also denied. The case remains pending on appeal.",
    "45143": "This legal action, filed on April 20, 2023, in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming (Case No. 23-cv-00069-SWS), involves a dispute between the parents (the plaintiffs) and the Sweetwater County School District No. 1 Board of Trustees, along with several school officials (the defendants). The plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated their fundamental parental rights and free exercise of religion through a policy regarding student gender identity.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted that the school district’s policy, generally referred to as “the Policy,” allowed students to socially transition (e.g., using preferred names and pronouns) without parental knowledge or consent, even over parental objections. They claim this policy requires school staff to conceal information from parents and, in some instances, actively deceive them about their children's gender identity. The plaintiffs specifically cited concerns about their daughter, A.S., who is a childhood trauma survivor receiving mental health treatment, and alleged that the school's actions interfered with her treatment plan.\n\nThe plaintiffs initially sought a preliminary injunction to halt the implementation of the policy. However, after filing an amended complaint, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss without prejudice, finding the original complaint superseded. Following this, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, dismissing all remaining claims brought by the plaintiff, Ashley Willey. The court ordered that all pending motions were denied as moot and that the Clerk of Court enter a final judgment terminating the case. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. The case is now pending before the appellate court, with deadlines for docketing statements, transcripts, and notices of appearance set.",
    "PH-IL-0002": "This class action lawsuit, filed on May 10, 2016, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, involved a group of plaintiffs, current and former residents of the Alexander County Housing Authority (ACHA), alleging violations of the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and the Illinois Civil Rights Act. The plaintiffs claimed that ACHA engaged in a pattern and practice of race and familial status discrimination within its public housing developments, particularly at the McBride and Elmwood locations. Specifically, they asserted that ACHA segregated residents based on race, failed to adequately maintain McBride and Elmwood, leading to substandard living conditions, and improperly denied families with children access to certain housing developments. They also alleged that ACHA overcharged residents for rent in violation of the Brooke Amendment.\n\nThe lawsuit initially named several individual defendants, including former and current ACHA officials. Through multiple amended complaints, the plaintiffs refined their claims and added more plaintiffs. After several procedural steps, including a motion to withdraw for certain plaintiffs and a series of continuances, a settlement conference was repeatedly scheduled and ultimately held. A key procedural hurdle arose when certain plaintiffs, Latonya Lee, Denieshia Childress, and Coretta Cornelius, failed to respond to court orders and participate in proceedings, leading to the dismissal of their claims for lack of prosecution.\n\nUltimately, on July 27, 2017, the remaining represented plaintiffs entered into a Stipulation of Dismissal, agreeing to dismiss their claims with prejudice, with each party bearing its own attorneys’ fees. The court approved this stipulation, and on September 12, 2017, the court issued a final order dismissing all remaining claims, effectively closing the case. The case concluded with a settlement between the parties, resolving the claims of discrimination and rent overcharges without a trial or finding of liability against ACHA.",
    "16518": "On April 14, 2022, the United States of America filed a lawsuit against the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, alleging a pattern or practice of violating the constitutional rights of children confined at the Broad River Road Complex (BRRC), a long-term juvenile commitment facility. The lawsuit stemmed from an investigation initiated in 2017 concerning conditions of confinement, specifically focusing on youth-on-youth violence, the use of prolonged isolation, and physical abuse by staff. The DOJ’s investigation found reasonable cause to believe that DJJ failed to adequately protect youth from harm, used isolation punitively, and engaged in practices that placed youth at risk.\n\nFollowing negotiations, the United States and DJJ reached a Settlement Agreement, which was submitted to the court and approved on April 20, 2022, resulting in the conditional dismissal of the lawsuit without prejudice. The Agreement outlines a series of remedial measures DJJ is obligated to implement over the next several years. These measures include conducting a staffing study, revising policies regarding use of force and isolation, implementing positive behavior management strategies, providing specialized housing for vulnerable youth, and establishing a quality assurance system to monitor compliance. A Subject Matter Expert has been appointed to assist DJJ in these efforts and provide ongoing assessments. The court retained jurisdiction to resolve any claims of material breach of the Settlement Agreement. The core objective of the agreement is to ensure a safer and more rehabilitative environment for youth at BRRC, addressing concerns about excessive force, inadequate protection from harm, and the inappropriate use of isolation.",
    "46815": "On May 21, 2025, a grand jury in the Middle District of Tennessee indicted Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia on charges of conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens and illegal transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain. Following his arrest on June 6, 2025, the government moved for detention, citing concerns about flight risk and the potential for obstruction of justice, as well as the involvement of minors. A United States Magistrate Judge initially denied the government's motion for detention, finding that the government had not met its burden of showing a serious risk of flight or danger to the community. The government appealed this decision, seeking both a stay of the release order and revocation of the release order.\n\nDuring the hearing on the government’s motion, the magistrate judge ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing. Following this, the magistrate judge issued an order granting the defendant's release. District Judge Crenshaw subsequently granted the government an extension to file a response to the defendant’s motion to dismiss for vindictive and selective prosecution. He also rescheduled a status conference. The court found the government’s motion for a stay was not warranted, and the defendant was released on conditions, as ordered by the magistrate judge. The case is currently pending, with a trial date set for January 27, 2026.",
    "46755": "The City of Columbus, Ohio; the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland; the City of Chicago, Illinois; Doctors for America; and Main Street Alliance (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") filed suit against Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Mehmet Oz, in his official capacity as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (collectively \"Defendants\") on July 1, 2025. Plaintiffs challenged the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability” (2025 Rule), alleging it would undermine the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by reducing access to affordable health coverage. The Plaintiffs are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe Plaintiffs contend that the 2025 Rule, which aims to reduce fraud and improve marketplace integrity, creates barriers to coverage, increases costs, and ultimately harms consumers. Specifically, they objected to provisions related to premium penalties for re-enrollees, modifications to premium adjustment methodology, changes to actuarial value calculations, stricter income verification requirements, and restrictions on special enrollment periods. The Plaintiffs argue that these changes are arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with the law, citing a lack of sufficient justification and potential harm to vulnerable populations.\n\nFollowing a hearing, Judge Brendan A. Hurson issued a memorandum opinion on August 22, 2025, granting in part and denying in part the Plaintiffs’ motion for a stay. The Court found that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits regarding several provisions of the Rule, including those imposing the $5 premium penalty, modifying the premium adjustment methodology, revising actuarial value policies, and imposing stricter income verification requirements. The Court declined to stay the changes to the premium adjustment measurement and the revisions to the special enrollment period policy.\n\nThe Court issued an order on August 5, 2025, staying the effective dates of the challenged provisions pending a final ruling on the merits of the case. The Court reasoned that the government’s interest in enforcing the rule did not outweigh the potential harm to the Plaintiffs and the public, particularly given the lack of evidence supporting the asserted benefits of the challenged provisions and the potential for significant coverage losses. The case remains pending.",
    "46576": "In April 2025, a coalition of sixteen states and the District of Columbia (the Plaintiffs) filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Education and its Secretary (the Defendants) in the Southern District of New York. The Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the Department's decision to abruptly rescind extensions of time granted for the liquidation of funds awarded under COVID-19 relief programs, specifically the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) fund. The Plaintiffs argued that the rescission, communicated in letters issued in March and May 2025, was arbitrary and capricious and violated the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe District Court granted the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction on May 6, 2025, enjoining the Department from enforcing the revised deadlines and requiring notice before any future modifications to liquidation periods. The Department appealed this decision to the Second Circuit and sought a stay pending appeal. However, on June 10, 2025, the Second Circuit denied the Department’s motion for a stay, directing the case to a three-judge panel for further review. Shortly thereafter, on August 11, 2025, the parties stipulated to withdraw the appeal, effectively ending the appellate proceedings. The District Court’s preliminary injunction remains in effect, barring the Department from enforcing the rescinded deadlines and requiring notice of any future changes.",
    "46637": "National Public Radio (NPR) and several affiliated public radio stations (Aspen Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio, and KSUT Public Radio) have filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, several federal agencies (the Office of Management and Budget, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Department of the Treasury), and officials within those agencies. The case, filed on May 27, 2025, challenges Executive Order 14290, which directs federal agencies to cease funding to NPR and PBS, citing concerns about perceived bias in their news coverage.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the Executive Order violates the First Amendment, the Public Broadcasting Act, and other federal statutes, asserting that it constitutes viewpoint-based discrimination and an unlawful attempt to control independent media. They contend that the order exceeds the President’s authority, infringes upon their freedom of speech and association, and deprives them of due process. The Federal Defendants argue that the President has broad discretion in allocating federal funds and that the Executive Order does not violate any constitutional or statutory provisions.\n\nFollowing the initial filing, the court issued orders related to pro hac vice applications for counsel and requested a briefing schedule.  A joint motion for an expedited schedule was granted, and various parties filed amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs.  The Federal Defendants subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, disputing the plaintiffs' claims and asserting the legality of the Executive Order. Plaintiffs filed a response, and the Federal Defendants then filed a reply. The case is currently awaiting a ruling on the motions for summary judgment. The Court has also addressed a motion regarding an amicus brief filed by the Center for Judicial Accountability.",
    "46340": "In April 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and several other labor unions (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Donald J. Trump and numerous federal agencies and officials (collectively, “Defendants”), challenging Executive Order 14251. This executive order, issued on March 5, 2025, excluded a significant number of federal agencies and subdivisions from coverage under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), effectively stripping their employees of collective bargaining rights. The Plaintiffs allege that the Executive Order was issued in retaliation for their criticism of the Trump administration and constitutes an ultra vires action, exceeding the President’s statutory authority.\n\nThe Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the enforcement of the Executive Order, arguing that it violated their First Amendment rights and harmed their ability to represent their members. The District Court initially granted the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that they had raised serious questions regarding First Amendment retaliation. However, the government appealed this decision, seeking a stay pending appeal.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the government’s request for an administrative stay of the injunction. The appellate court found that the government had not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits and that they would suffer irreparable harm absent a stay. The court also noted that the balance of hardships and the public interest weighed against a stay. As of August 1, 2025, the preliminary injunction remains stayed pending the Ninth Circuit’s further review of the case. A status conference has been scheduled for August 18, 2025, to determine the next steps in the litigation.",
    "46805": "A coalition of domestic violence and homelessness advocacy organizations (the Plaintiffs) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the Secretaries of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), as well as the agencies themselves (the Defendants). The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants have imposed unlawful conditions on federal grant funding in the form of Executive Orders related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and abortion, violating the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution. Specifically, the Defendants require grantees to certify compliance with anti-discrimination laws, refrain from promoting \"gender ideology,\" and not use funds to promote elective abortions. The Plaintiffs argue these conditions are vague, arbitrary, and infringe on their First Amendment rights.\n\nFollowing the filing of the Complaint, the Plaintiffs requested a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent the enforcement of these new conditions. After a hearing, the court granted the TRO, enjoining HUD and HHS from enforcing the contested conditions on Continuum of Care grants, Community Development Block Grants, and Family Violence Prevention Services Act State Domestic Violence Coalition Grants. The court subsequently amended and revised the TRO after considering further motions and documentation from both parties.\n\nThe core purpose of the TRO is to maintain the status quo pending a hearing on the Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, scheduled for September 4, 2025. The court has ordered HUD and HHS to provide notice of compliance with the TRO and has deferred ruling on certain aspects of the Plaintiffs’ motion pending further administrative record development.",
    "46375": "The Southern Education Foundation (SEF), a non-profit organization with a history dating back to 1867 dedicated to advancing equitable education policies in the Southern United States, received a federal grant from the United States Department of Education in 2022 to operate the Equity Assistance Center for the Southern Region (EAC-South). EAC-South provided technical assistance to public schools in efforts to comply with federal civil rights law and address the legacy of segregation. In early 2025, President Trump issued Executive Orders aimed at eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives within the federal government. Subsequently, on February 13, 2025, the Department of Education terminated SEF's grant, citing concerns that EAC-South’s programs were inconsistent with the new administration's priorities.\n\nSEF challenged the grant termination, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and other legal statutes.  Following an initial filing and an oral argument on the matter, SEF withdrew its administrative appeal before the Department. The Court found that the Department’s termination of the grant was arbitrary and capricious, lacking a reasonable explanation. The court further ruled that the termination was not ripe for review before the withdrawal of the administrative appeal.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued an order granting SEF’s motion for a preliminary injunction, reinstating the EAC-South grant and enjoining the Department from further terminating the grant in a manner deemed unlawful.  The court ordered the Department to reimburse SEF for expenses incurred since the termination and provided SEF with a deadline to file an answer to the amended complaint. Following this decision, the defendants appealed the ruling to the D.C. Circuit Court.",
    "46284": "Yunseo Chung, a lawful permanent resident and Columbia University student, initiated legal action against President Donald J. Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Acting Director of ICE Todd M. Lyons, and Acting Field Office Director William P. Joyce, seeking a writ of habeas corpus and a temporary restraining order. The lawsuit arises from the government's actions following Ms. Chung’s participation in protests related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, actions she alleges are intended to punish her for exercising her First Amendment rights.\n\nIn March 2025, following her arrest during a protest at Columbia University, Ms. Chung’s immigration status came under scrutiny. The government initiated actions, including an administrative arrest warrant and a search warrant targeting Columbia University, allegedly based on her participation in protests and perceived support for Hamas. Ms. Chung and her legal team claim this constitutes retaliation for her protected speech.\n\nMs. Chung filed a complaint and petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging violations of the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act, and other legal principles. The court granted a temporary restraining order, enjoining the government from detaining or transferring Ms. Chung pending further orders and requiring notice before any detention based on grounds other than removal proceedings. The court also denied the government’s motion to dismiss in part.\n\nThe government subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit challenging the District Court’s jurisdiction. Despite the pending appeal, the court has continued to manage discovery related to the case. The District Court issued an order staying discovery and noting that the appellate court now has jurisdiction over the matter, limiting the District Court's authority. The case is currently stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.",
    "46735": "The Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools (the “School District”) brought suit against Linda McMahon, the Secretary of Education, the U.S. Department of Education, and President Donald J. Trump, seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief following the termination of a $6 million federal grant awarded under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This Act provided funding to support school-based behavioral health services. The School District alleged that the Defendants’ actions, specifically a Dear Colleague Letter and subsequent grant termination, violated the First and Fifth Amendments and the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and were contrary to the Administrative Procedure Act. \n\nThe Defendants argued that the grant termination was a discretionary decision within the agency’s authority, consistent with the terms of the grant agreement, and did not violate any constitutional rights. They further contended that the Court lacked jurisdiction, asserting that the School District’s claims were essentially contractual in nature and should be brought in the Court of Federal Claims.\n\nFollowing a hearing, Judge William P. Johnson denied the School District’s motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. The court reasoned that the School District’s claims involved a dispute over a federal contract, falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. The court further found that the School District had failed to demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored the Defendants. The court’s decision hinged on the conclusion that the case involved a challenge to a discretionary agency decision regarding contract enforcement, a matter outside the scope of this district court’s authority.",

The case, filed on April 4, 2025, stems from a series of actions taken by Defendants, beginning in February 2025, aimed at dismantling IES, a federal agency responsible for education research and statistics. Plaintiffs assert that these actions, including the termination of research studies (NPSAS 2024, BPS:20/25, HSLS:09, HS&B:22, ECLS-K:2024), the elimination of IES staff, and the cessation of data access programs, violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and are arbitrary and capricious. \n\nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants’ actions are contrary to the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002, which mandates IES’s functions and requires public access to research and data. They seek a declaratory judgment declaring the defendants' actions unlawful, an injunction to prevent further actions disrupting IES's operations, and reinstatement of terminated programs. Following an initial motion for a preliminary injunction denied by the court, the Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint on July 16, 2025. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss, which the court denied as moot. The case is currently proceeding, with briefing schedules established for the defendants’ renewed motion to dismiss.",
    "46322": "On March 31, 2025, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Secure Families Initiative, and Arizona Students’ Association filed suit challenging Executive Order 14,248, issued by President Trump on March 25, 2025. The order, titled “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,” attempts to grant the Executive Branch broader authority over federal election rules. The plaintiffs, joined by the Democratic National Committee, the League of Women Voters, and other organizations, allege that the Executive Order violates the separation of powers.\n\nExecutive Order 14,248 directs the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration using the national mail voter registration form and instructs federal agencies to share voter information. It also directs the Attorney General to prioritize enforcement of election laws and potentially withhold federal funding from states that do not comply with the President’s directives regarding ballot receipt deadlines.\n\nThe Defendants, including the Executive Office of the President, the EAC, and various federal agencies, argue that the plaintiffs lack standing and that the Executive Order does not exceed the President's authority. The court heard arguments on the plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunctions on April 17, 2025.\n\nOn April 24, 2025, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting the plaintiffs' motions in part. The Court preliminarily enjoined the EAC from implementing the provisions of the Executive Order requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the Federal Form, finding that the President lacks constitutional authority to direct such a change. The court, however, did not make a ruling regarding the remaining provisions of the Executive Order. The case is ongoing, with a scheduling conference set for June 18, 2025, to determine the next steps.",
    "46510": "Plaintiffs, a coalition of Head Start associations and parent advocacy groups, have filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Department of Health and Human Services, and other related agencies, challenging recent policy changes impacting the Head Start program. The lawsuit, filed on April 28, 2025, seeks a declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants are unlawfully dismantling the Head Start program through a combination of policy changes and budget cuts.\n\nThe core of the plaintiffs’ complaint centers on two actions. First, the defendants issued a March 14, 2025 letter and subsequently implemented an April 16, 2025 certification, effectively banning diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) initiatives within Head Start programs. Plaintiffs argue this ban is vague, violates the First Amendment, contravenes the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and infringes upon the Rehabilitation Act. Second, the plaintiffs claim the defendants have systematically delayed decision-making on Head Start agency renewals, causing uncertainty and disruption to program operations. These actions, combined with significant budget cuts and staff reductions within the Office of Head Start, are allegedly crippling the program's ability to effectively serve children and families.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert that these actions are contrary to Congressional mandates requiring HHS to maintain and support Head Start programs. They seek a preliminary injunction to halt the implementation of the DEIA ban, restore funding levels, and prevent further disruption to Head Start services until the court can resolve the merits of their claims. The case is being litigated in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, presided over by Judge Ricardo S. Martinez. Oral argument on the motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for June 13, 2025.",
    "46734": "In May 2025, Plaintiffs, a group of Roman Catholic clergy including the Archbishops of Seattle and Spokane, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, challenging the constitutionality of Washington State's Senate Bill 5375 (SB 5375). This bill mandates that all clergy, including Catholic priests, report suspected child abuse or neglect, regardless of how the information was obtained, effectively eliminating the long-standing legal protection of the sacramental seal within Confession. The Plaintiffs allege that SB 5375 violates their First Amendment rights, specifically the Free Exercise Clause, by compelling them to act against their religious beliefs and interfering with Church autonomy.\n\nThe United States intervened in the case, supporting the Plaintiffs’ challenge and asserting an interest in ensuring compliance with federal constitutional law. The court heard arguments on the Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on July 14, 2025. On July 25, 2025, Judge David G. Estudillo granted the preliminary injunction, enjoining Defendants—the State of Washington and its various county prosecutors—from enforcing SB 5375 as it pertains to the Sacrament of Confession against the Plaintiffs and all Roman Catholic priests within their jurisdiction. The court’s order temporarily suspends the law’s application to this specific religious practice while the case proceeds.

The lawsuit challenges the President’s decision to federalize members of the California National Guard without the Governor’s consent, following protests in Los Angeles related to federal immigration enforcement actions.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the President violated 10 U.S.C. § 12406, which authorizes the President to call the National Guard into federal service under specific conditions – invasion, rebellion, or inability to execute laws with regular forces - and requires orders be issued “through the governors of the States.” They claim that none of these conditions were met and that the President bypassed the Governor in the order process. The plaintiffs also argue that federalizing the National Guard infringes upon the State's police powers and violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of the military for civilian law enforcement.\n\nFollowing a hearing on June 12, 2025, Judge Charles R. Breyer granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining Defendants from deploying California National Guard members in Los Angeles and ordering them to return control of those troops to Governor Newsom. The court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits of their claims. A preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled for August 11-13, 2025. The court has also issued orders regarding transcript requests and page limits for briefs. The court is considering a claim that the State of Los Angeles has standing to participate in the suit.",

The lawsuit challenges the recent actions by the Executive Branch regarding funding for Columbia University.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the government initiated an investigation into Columbia University based on concerns about antisemitism on campus. Following this investigation, the government terminated approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia and issued a letter demanding that the University implement significant programmatic and structural changes, including modifying disciplinary policies, restricting demonstrations, and potentially placing the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies department under academic receivership. The plaintiffs claim these actions constitute an unlawful attempt to control academic freedom and viewpoint diversity at Columbia.\n\nDefendants argue that the government’s actions are justified by its responsibility to ensure federal funds are used responsibly and that Columbia adequately addresses concerns about a hostile environment for Jewish students. They contend that the funding termination was based on Columbia’s failure to effectuate agency priorities and was taken for the government’s convenience. They also assert that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring the lawsuit.\n\nThe court, after reviewing the filings, denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed the case for lack of standing. The court found that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a sufficient injury or a direct connection between the government’s actions and their own rights, nor had they presented a clear entitlement to the disputed funds, which were awarded to Columbia University, not the plaintiffs themselves. This decision affirms the government’s authority to manage federal funding and prioritize its programs, while also reinforcing the requirement for plaintiffs to demonstrate a direct and concrete injury to establish standing in federal court.",

Established by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the NEVI Program allocates $5 billion to states for building out electric vehicle charging infrastructure. In January 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order directing agencies to pause the disbursement of funds appropriated under the IIJA, including NEVI funds. Subsequently, the Federal Highway Administration rescinded guidance related to the NEVI Program, revoked state deployment plans previously approved, and effectively suspended the distribution of funds.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants’ actions exceed statutory authority and violate the separation of powers doctrine. They contend that the agency lacks the authority to unilaterally withhold congressionally appropriated funds and that the actions are arbitrary and capricious. The Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to prevent the Defendants from suspending or revoking state plans and withholding NEVI funds.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, the court held a hearing on the Plaintiffs' motion. The court granted the motion in part, enjoining Defendants from revoking state plans and withholding NEVI funds for states Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin. The court denied the motion as to the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont.

The students, proceeding pseudonymously, allege that the Committee and certain federal agencies have improperly pressured Columbia University to suppress their protected speech and violate their privacy through demands for student records.\n\nThe lawsuit centers on a February 13, 2025, letter from the Committee requesting a broad range of student disciplinary records related to eleven specific incidents, likely involving hundreds of students. The plaintiffs claim this demand, coupled with a March 13, 2025, letter from federal agencies threatening to withhold federal funding, constitutes an unlawful attempt to chill protected speech and violates the First Amendment. The students seek a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to prevent the disclosure of their records and to enjoin the University from complying with the requests.\n\nThe lawsuit asserts that the Committee’s actions violate the First Amendment, citing concerns about coercion and an overbroad intrusion into student privacy. The plaintiffs also allege that the actions of the Committee and federal agencies are not substantially related to a compelling state interest.\n\nMultiple motions have been filed, including a motion for a temporary restraining order, which was denied without prejudice. The plaintiffs have since filed an amended complaint. The defendants, including the Committee and federal agencies, have moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the lawsuit is barred by the Speech or Debate Clause and that sovereign immunity applies. The court has granted extensions for filing briefs and indicated it will consider the merits of the motions to dismiss. As of July 10, 2025, the case remains ongoing.",

The lawsuit challenges a directive issued by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on March 27, 2025, outlining a plan to terminate approximately 10,000 HHS employees and restructure numerous agencies. The Plaintiffs allege that this directive, and its subsequent implementation, violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the U.S. Constitution, and several statutes governing HHS’s operations.\n\nThe Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants’ actions are arbitrary and capricious, lacking a rational basis and disregarding the potential harm to states and the public. They argue that the directive undermines HHS’s ability to fulfill its statutory mandates, particularly in areas such as disease prevention, public health research, and maternal health programs. Specifically, the lawsuit highlights disruptions to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) laboratory services, the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\n\nOn July 2025, the District Court granted the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Defendants from taking any actions to implement the planned layoffs and agency restructuring until the case can be further litigated. The court also ordered the parties to file a joint status report and set a hearing date.

The Plaintiffs claim that AmeriCorps, acting under direction from the \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" initiated a series of actions including releasing National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) members, placing staff on administrative leave, and terminating grant funding for numerous state-run programs. The Plaintiffs allege these actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), claiming a failure to adhere to proper rulemaking procedures and arbitrary decision-making.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks a preliminary injunction to halt these actions. The court held a hearing and supplemental briefing was ordered, and on June 5, 2025, issued a preliminary injunction, limiting AmeriCorps' ability to terminate grants and NCCC member service. Subsequently, the court heard arguments regarding the scope of the preliminary injunction, and on July 10, 2025, modified the order to clarify that the restrictions apply only to actions that directly harm the Plaintiff States.

The lawsuit stems from an Executive Order issued by President Trump on March 14, 2025, which directed IMLS to reduce its operations to the minimum functions required by law. \n\nPlaintiffs allege that Sonderling, acting pursuant to the Executive Order, has taken steps to dismantle IMLS, including placing staff on administrative leave, terminating grants, and firing members of the National Museum and Library Services Board. They contend that these actions violate the Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and are beyond the scope of IMLS’s statutory authority. The plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to prevent the further implementation of the Executive Order and to restore IMLS's operations.\n\nThe court initially granted Plaintiffs a temporary restraining order. However, on May 1, 2025, the court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction based on concerns about jurisdiction. Subsequently, the court stayed that order pending consideration of the parties' briefing. On June 6, 2025, the court issued a memorandum opinion denying the motion for a preliminary injunction without prejudice and ordered the parties to file a joint status report.

The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants are unlawfully constructing a mass detention facility, dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (TNT) in the Big Cypress National Preserve without complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other applicable laws. The Plaintiffs contend this construction poses a threat to the ecologically sensitive area and endangered species.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed on June 27, 2025, seeks to halt construction and operation of the facility until Defendants comply with NEPA and related state, federal, and local environmental laws. The Plaintiffs initially requested a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.  The Court initially recused Judge Martinez and reassigned the case to Judge Williams.\n\nThe Defendants argue that the facility’s construction is a State action, not a federal one, and thus not subject to NEPA review. The State claims it is responding to a national emergency related to illegal immigration.\n\nFollowing a four-day evidentiary hearing, Judge Williams issued a preliminary injunction on August 21, 2025, ordering Defendants to immediately cease bringing new detainees to the facility, halt all new construction, and remove recently installed infrastructure within sixty days. The Court also denied Defendants' motion to dismiss on the ground of improper venue. Defendants have now filed a motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal.",
    "46388": "Plaintiffs, comprised of faculty and student organizations at Harvard University, initiated a lawsuit against several federal agencies and their leadership (the \"Defendants\") alleging an unlawful campaign to influence Harvard’s academic policies and control its speech. The lawsuit, filed in April 2025, stems from a series of actions initiated after the Trump administration expressed concerns about antisemitism on Harvard’s campus. In March 2025, the Department of Justice announced a review of Harvard's federal funding and subsequently demanded the university implement a list of sweeping programmatic and structural changes, including reforms to admissions, hiring, and disciplinary procedures. The Defendants threatened to withhold over $9 billion in federal funding if Harvard did not comply. \n\nFollowing Harvard’s refusal to meet these demands, the administration froze over $2.2 billion in federal grants and contracts, citing concerns about compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and alleged inaction regarding antisemitism. The Plaintiffs allege that these actions constitute an unlawful misuse of federal funding to coerce the university into adopting specific viewpoints and suppress free speech, violating the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act. The lawsuit asserts that Defendants failed to follow proper procedures outlined in Title VI and the APA, including failing to provide adequate notice, opportunity for hearing, or a reasoned explanation for the funding actions. The Amended Complaint details a series of public statements from the President and government officials further demonstrating a concerted effort to penalize Harvard for its resistance. The Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the Defendants’ actions are unlawful and an injunction preventing further interference with Harvard’s academic freedom and autonomy.",

Bondi (in her official capacity as Attorney General), the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), and Maureen A. Henneberg (in her official capacity as Acting Head of OJP). The lawsuit challenges the DOJ’s decision to abruptly terminate over 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants, totaling over $820 million, provided to various organizations. \n\nPlaintiffs allege that OJP terminated these grants without prior notice, citing a vague explanation that the awards “no longer effectuate[] the program goals or agency priorities.” These grants funded critical programs addressing violence reduction, victim services, juvenile justice, and other public safety functions. The Plaintiffs, all recipients of these grants, seek declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that the terminations violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Constitution. \n\nThe lawsuit asserts that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious, lacked a reasoned basis, and exceeded OJP’s lawful authority. The Plaintiffs also contend that the DOJ failed to provide adequate notice or opportunity for comment before terminating the grants. The Plaintiffs are seeking to represent a class of all entities in the United States whose OJP grants were terminated in April 2025.\n\nThe DOJ defends its actions, asserting that it has the discretion to re-evaluate and adjust funding priorities. On June 9, 2025, the DOJ filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that the court lacks jurisdiction and that the Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim. On July 6, 2025, the court set a hearing date for June 26, 2025, for consideration of Plaintiffs' motions for preliminary injunction and class certification, and Defendants’ motion to dismiss.

    "46387": "On April 11, 2025, Susman Godfrey LLP filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against multiple federal agencies and officials, including the Executive Office of the President, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The lawsuit challenges Executive Order 14,263, issued by President Trump on April 9, 2025, which targets Susman Godfrey based on its legal representation of clients and advocacy positions deemed detrimental to American interests. The order directs agencies to review security clearances held by Susman employees, cease providing goods and services to the firm, and generally restrict government interaction with the firm.\n\nSusman Godfrey alleges that the Executive Order violates the First and Fifth Amendments, exceeds the President’s constitutional authority, and infringes upon the separation of powers. The firm argues that the order retaliates against its protected speech and advocacy, and that it is overly vague and lacks due process. \n\nThe Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that the claims lack merit and that the executive order did not violate the law.  On April 24, 2025, Judge Loren AliKhan issued an Order granting Susman Godfrey's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, preventing the enforcement of Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the Executive Order.  The Court further ordered that the Defendants file a status report demonstrating compliance with this order, and set a briefing schedule for the motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. The Court also granted several motions for Pro Hac Vice admission to attorneys representing Susman. This suggests the court found sufficient standing and merit to warrant further proceedings.",

Trump, challenging actions taken to restructure the Institute. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants unlawfully removed the duly appointed members of the USIP Board of Directors and attempted to seize control of the Institute's operations. The suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to protect the Institute's independence and prevent further interference.\n\nShortly after filing the complaint, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and an administrative stay. On March 19, 2025, the District Court denied the motion, finding that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm. The court acknowledged the unique status of USIP as an independent nonprofit corporation but questioned whether the President’s actions were unlawful under existing legal precedent.\n\nSubsequently, defendants filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc and an Application for Emergency Administrative Stay of the June 27 order by the Motions Panel. This petition challenges the District Court’s earlier ruling and seeks to reinstate the President's authority to remove USIP board members, arguing that the court’s interpretation of the statute protecting board members was flawed and exceeded established legal boundaries. The legal issue at the heart of the case centers on whether USIP, as a congressionally established entity, falls within the purview of the President’s removal power under Article II of the Constitution, particularly in light of statutory protections for board member removal.",

The Plaintiffs allege that the EPA is unlawfully withholding grant funds allocated under the Inflation Reduction Act. These funds were awarded to the Plaintiffs following a competitive application process, with Citibank serving as a financial agent to administer the funds under agreements with both the EPA and the Plaintiffs. \n\nThe Plaintiffs received notification on March 11, 2025, that the EPA had terminated their grants, prompting them to seek a temporary restraining order to prevent Citibank from withholding funds. Following a hearing, the court granted a temporary restraining order, enjoining the EPA from effectuating the termination and directing Citibank to refrain from disbursing funds until further order of the court. The EPA subsequently filed a motion for a stay pending appeal, which the court denied. \n\nThe core of the dispute centers on whether the EPA has the authority to terminate the NCIF grants and whether the government’s actions violate established principles of appropriations law. The Plaintiffs argue that the EPA's actions are unlawful and that the funds should be released to fulfill the commitments made under the NCIF program. The EPA contends it has the authority to terminate the grants and that any resulting financial impact is outweighed by its need to reassess the program's priorities. The case is currently proceeding, with the court scheduling a hearing on the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, and an appeal is likely.",

These orders, labeled Anti-Diversity1, Anti-Gender, and Anti-Diversity2, aim to restrict diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) programs and policies within the federal government and among its contractors and grantees. Plaintiffs allege these orders violate the Fifth and First Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, claiming they are vaguely worded, chill protected speech, and discriminate against certain groups. The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment against the enforcement of these orders.\n\nThe Executive Orders direct agencies to terminate or restrict programs promoting DEIA, including requiring certification that entities do not operate programs “promoting DEI” that violate federal anti-discrimination laws. Plaintiffs contend these directives have already resulted in harm, citing examples like the cessation of certain grant activities and alterations to data collection practices impacting their ability to serve vulnerable populations.\n\nDefendants argue that the orders are necessary to ensure compliance with civil rights laws and promote merit-based principles.  Do No Harm, a non-profit organization advocating against DEI policies, has filed a motion to intervene as a defendant, arguing the plaintiffs’ claims are unfounded. \n\nThe court has ordered the parties to submit a joint proposed briefing schedule for the motion for a preliminary injunction and has scheduled a hearing for March 19, 2025.

Trump and several federal agency heads, including the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management, the Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, and the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Defense, and other agencies. The plaintiffs, representing federal employees, allege that the President's Executive Order No. 14210, directing agencies to prepare for mass reductions in force, and related actions by the Office of Personnel Management, including the directive to fire probationary employees and a \"deferred resignation program,\" violate the separation of powers principles and federal law.\n\nThe suit seeks a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to prevent the implementation of these policies. The plaintiffs assert that the President is overstepping his authority by attempting to dismantle the federal workforce, a responsibility they contend belongs to Congress. They also argue that the actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act and agency regulations governing reductions-in-force. The plaintiffs base their claims on the idea that the actions undermine Congress’s authority to establish and fund federal agencies.\n\nFollowing the filing, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to halt the challenged actions. The defendants filed an opposition arguing that the President has the authority to manage the federal workforce. On February 18, 2025, the court held a hearing on the motion. Judge Christopher R. Cooper has taken the motion under advisement. The case is ongoing, and the court has not yet ruled on the plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief.",

The plaintiffs allege that the defendants’ actions, stemming from an executive order and subsequent directives, unlawfully curtailed U.S. foreign assistance programs and caused significant harm to their operations and the communities they serve. The plaintiffs assert violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and constitutional claims related to the separation of powers.\n\nThe executive order, issued by the President, directed a review and potential suspension of foreign development assistance, prompting the defendants to halt funding and initiate a review process. The plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent these actions. The court initially granted a temporary restraining order, and subsequently a preliminary injunction, directing the government to refrain from the specified actions.\n\nFollowing the preliminary injunction, the government appealed the order to the D.C. Circuit.  While the appeal was pending, the District Court ordered the government to provide a plan for compliance and requested documentation regarding terminations. The District Court has since set a hearing for March 6, 2025 to consider the matter further. The D.C. Circuit has accepted the appeal and the case is currently pending before that court. The core of the legal dispute revolves around whether the executive branch exceeded its authority in restricting foreign aid funding and whether the plaintiffs have standing to challenge those actions.",

The lawsuit, filed on February 9, 2025, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting violations of separation of powers principles and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Following the 2008 financial crisis, Congress created the CFPB to protect consumers, assigning it specific duties to supervise financial institutions and enforce consumer protection laws.\n\nShortly after the lawsuit was filed, Vought issued directives instructing CFPB staff to cease most work activities, including rulemaking, investigations, and public communications.

The lawsuit challenged the NYPD's practice of stopping individuals based solely on their presence near TAP buildings without reasonable suspicion.\n\nThe lawsuit proceeded through discovery and motions, with Judge Shira A. Scheindlin issuing a preliminary injunction in January 2013, finding a likelihood of success on the merits. Following appeals and further proceedings, the court issued a final order and remedial order in August 2013, directing the NYPD to implement changes to policies, training, supervision, and auditing practices. A facilitator, Ariel E.

The parties reached a settlement agreement, which was approved by the court, and directed the creation of a monitoring system to measure the effectiveness of reforms.. The case remains active with ongoing monitoring and reporting on the NYPD's compliance efforts.",
    "PB-CT-0007": "This case, *Joanne Pedersen et al. v. Office of Personnel Management et al.*, concerns the constitutionality of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). A group of same-sex couples and a surviving spouse, residing in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire, brought suit against federal agencies and officials, asserting that DOMA violated the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. The plaintiffs, legally married under the laws of their respective states, claimed that DOMA denied them federal benefits and recognition afforded to opposite-sex married couples. The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives intervened to defend DOMA.  The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on August 2, 2012, declaring Section 3 of DOMA unconstitutional. This decision effectively enjoined the federal government from administering and enforcing DOMA’s discriminatory definition of marriage and spouse, thereby extending federal recognition and benefits to legally married same-sex couples.",
    "PC-AL-0034": "In May 2015, the United States of America filed a lawsuit against the State of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) alleging violations of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (42 U.S.C. § 1997) at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women. The lawsuit stemmed from concerns regarding sexual abuse and harassment within the prison. Following negotiations, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, the court approved, which outlined specific remedial steps the ADOC was required to implement to address the deficiencies. Kathleen Dennehy was appointed as a monitor to oversee the ADOC’s compliance with the agreement.\n\nSubsequent compliance reports, filed periodically, documented the ADOC’s progress toward fulfilling the settlement’s requirements. These reports detailed ADOC's efforts to improve policies, training programs, and overall conditions at Tutwiler, with a focus on preventing sexual abuse and harassment. The monitor consistently evaluated the ADOC’s actions and provided feedback, and has found substantial progress with some areas still requiring attention. As of the Eighth Compliance Report filed in 2019, the ADOC had achieved \"substantial compliance\" with forty-one sections of the agreement, and “partial compliance” with two remaining sections. The case remains under the court’s oversight, with the monitor continuing to monitor and report on the ADOC’s adherence to the terms of the settlement.",
    "ED-MI-0001": "In 2006, Michigan voters approved Proposal 2, an amendment to the state constitution prohibiting the use of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin as factors in admissions decisions at public colleges and universities. This amendment was challenged in federal court by a coalition of organizations and individuals, including students and labor unions, who argued it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court initially granted summary judgment in favor of the state, upholding Proposal 2. However, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the amendment unconstitutionally burdened the political process for those seeking to promote diversity. The Michigan Attorney General and the University defendants appealed this decision to the United States Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a per curiam opinion delivered by Justice Kennedy, reversed the Sixth Circuit’s judgment. The Court reasoned that voters have the right to decide whether race-conscious admissions policies should be implemented and that the Michigan amendment did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Court distinguished the case from *Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1*, finding that Proposal 2 did not impair a particular remedial program but rather altered the political process by removing a specific decision-making authority. The Court emphasized the importance of state autonomy and the right of citizens to express their views on controversial policy matters through the ballot box, ultimately affirming the constitutionality of Proposal 2.",
    "DR-CA-0033": "This case originates from a lawsuit filed by Maurizio Antoninetti alleging that Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by failing to provide adequate access for wheelchair users to view the food preparation process. Antoninetti initially sought injunctive relief and damages, claiming that Chipotle’s design of its food counters, with a wall separating customers from the food preparation area, obstructed his view. After initial proceedings, the District Court denied Chipotle’s motion to dismiss and ordered a status conference. Subsequently, Chipotle filed a motion for summary judgment, which the District Court denied. The court found that Chipotle's unwritten policy regarding accommodations for wheelchair users violated the ADA, but its written policy did not. Following this ruling, Antoninetti appealed, and Chipotle cross-appealed. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decision, holding that Chipotle’s written policy also violated the ADA. The appellate court remanded the case back to the District Court for further proceedings regarding injunctive relief and damages. Upon remand, the District Court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of Antoninetti, ordered Chipotle to provide injunctive relief, and awarded Antoninetti $5,000 in statutory damages. The District Court also addressed the issue of attorney’s fees, ultimately awarding Antoninetti a reduced fee.",
    "CJ-FL-0009": "In June 2019, Kelvin Jones and others filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida challenging Florida's Senate Bill 7066 (SB 7066), which implemented a provision of the state's 2018 constitutional amendment restoring voting rights to felons. Plaintiffs argued that SB 7066, by requiring payment of all outstanding legal financial obligations (LFOs) – including fines, fees, and restitution – before a felon could vote, violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The plaintiffs, representing a class of similarly situated individuals, sought declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe District Court initially granted a preliminary injunction, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on their Equal Protection claim. The State appealed, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that conditioning the right to vote on the ability to pay LFOs constituted wealth discrimination. The District Court subsequently issued a permanent injunction.\n\nFollowing these rulings, a series of motions and appearances occurred, including motions for *pro hac vice* admission for attorneys and efforts to serve defendants. The case’s procedural history involved a scheduling conference and subsequent cancellation. The District Court ultimately ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring that certain provisions of SB 7066 were unconstitutional and enjoining the state from enforcing those provisions. The case is ongoing, with the state having filed answers to the amended complaints and deadlines set for further filings.",
    "CW-CA-0005": "This class action lawsuit, filed in 2002, challenges the State of California’s provision of mental health services to foster children, alleging violations of the Medicaid Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs, a group of children in foster care, claimed the state failed to provide necessary mental health services, particularly wraparound services and therapeutic foster care.\n\nThe District Court initially granted a preliminary injunction in 2006, ordering the State to provide these services. This injunction was later vacated by the Ninth Circuit, which clarified that while the Medicaid Act requires providing medically necessary services, it does not mandate specific service delivery models like wraparound or TFC. The Court, on remand, affirmed the class certification, defining the class as children in foster care or at imminent risk of placement with documented mental health needs.\n\nA Settlement Agreement was reached, establishing an Advisory Panel to oversee implementation. The Panel’s subsequent reports revealed ongoing challenges in meeting the agreement’s objectives. While the State made some progress, particularly in increasing staffing within the Department of Children and Family Services, concerns remained regarding the consistent and effective delivery of wraparound and therapeutic foster care. Notably, the Ninth Circuit underscored the importance of ensuring that the children's services are provided in the most integrated settings.\n\nThe Advisory Panel’s reports also highlighted concerns about data tracking and analysis, making it difficult to assess the State’s progress accurately. The court ordered the State to meet and confer regarding a discovery schedule and invited the Department of Health and Human Services to provide an amicus brief.  The case has been under ongoing judicial oversight to ensure compliance with the Settlement Agreement. The Court has denied the State Defendants' motion to join additional parties and has continued to monitor the implementation of the settlement agreement through regular status conferences and reports from the Advisory Panel.",
    "PC-VA-0022": "Eric J. DePaola, an inmate serving a lengthy sentence, initiated this civil rights action against the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) and several individual defendants, alleging violations related to his prolonged confinement in solitary. He initially filed a complaint and subsequently an amended complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging the VDOC’s classification system and its impact on his ability to progress out of restrictive housing. Mr. DePaola was initially transferred to Red Onion State Prison, a facility housing inmates classified as Level S, requiring segregation. He was placed in Intensive Management (IM) status, which involved restrictive conditions and limited privileges.  The VDOC’s Operating Procedure 830.A governs the Step-Down program intended to allow inmates to progress from IM to less restrictive statuses. Mr. DePaola contended that the program was not meaningfully accessible and that he had been unfairly denied opportunities to advance.\n\nThe district court granted the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, finding that Mr. DePaola failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate a genuine dispute of material fact regarding his claims. The court concluded that the VDOC's procedures did not violate Mr. DePaola’s procedural due process rights or the Eighth Amendment.  The court also found that Mr. DePaola failed to establish that the VDOC acted with deliberate indifference to his mental health needs.  The court, therefore, dismissed Mr. DePaola’s claims. Mr. DePaola subsequently appealed this decision to the Fourth Circuit.",
    "CJ-MD-0001": "In January 2006, Vernon Evans, Jr., a death row inmate, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and other relevant officials, challenging the constitutionality of Maryland’s lethal injection protocol. Evans argued that the protocol, as implemented, created an unreasonable risk of unnecessary pain and suffering, violating the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe lawsuit stemmed from concerns about the training and qualifications of personnel involved in executions, the lack of monitoring during the procedure, and the potential for complications arising from the drugs used. Evans sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to halt his execution pending a determination on the merits of his claims.\n\nThe defendants contested Evans’s claims, arguing that the protocol was consistent with legal requirements and did not create an unacceptable risk of harm. The court ordered a hearing and directed the parties to engage in discovery. Evidentiary hearings were held, and multiple motions were filed, including requests for production of documents related to the state’s execution procedures.\n\nThe court ultimately issued an order granting Evans relief regarding the production of records from the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. However, the case remained complex, with ongoing disputes over discovery and the interpretation of the relevant legal standards. As of August 17, 2012, the case was terminated, although the specific outcome regarding the injunction request is not explicitly detailed in the provided documents.",
    "CW-DC-0001": "This case, *LaShawn A. v. Barry*, initiated in 1989, concerns systemic failures within the District of Columbia’s child welfare system, impacting numerous children in foster care and those reported to be abused or neglected. The Plaintiffs, a class of children represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and Children's Rights, filed suit alleging violations of federal statutes, the Fifth Amendment, and District of Columbia laws related to child welfare. Following a bench trial in 1991, the District Court found the District of Columbia liable for inadequate care and a flawed system, issuing a Remedial Order aimed at correcting these deficiencies.\n\nThe case has proceeded through multiple phases, involving consent decrees, court-appointed monitors, and ongoing adjustments to implementation plans. The District Court initially approved a Remedial Order, which was later modified and replaced with an Amended Implementation Plan in 1994.  A Court-appointed Monitor was tasked with overseeing compliance, regularly reporting on the District’s progress. Despite efforts, compliance proved challenging, leading to ongoing disputes and periodic findings of non-compliance.\n\nThe District appealed the initial judgment, but the Court of Appeals affirmed the findings, emphasizing the reliance on District law. Subsequent orders focused on refining the implementation plan and addressing specific areas of concern. A notable feature of the case has been the recurrent motion for contempt, reflecting persistent challenges in achieving full compliance with the court’s orders.  As of 2014, the court ordered a final review and potential modification of the agreement, suggesting a move toward ending court oversight while maintaining accountability for the District’s child welfare practices. The case ultimately concluded with a final agreement in 2014, marking the end of the court's direct involvement in the District's child welfare system."
