    "46567": "On May 5, 2025, G.M.G., a Venezuelan national detained in Rhode Island, filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against several federal officials and agencies, including the President of the United States, the Attorney General, and the Department of Homeland Security. G.M.G. is challenging the government’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) through a recent presidential proclamation targeting members of the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua (TdA).\n\nThe government, acting under the AEA, seeks to remove G.M.G. and others deemed members of TdA without providing due process protections, despite the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in *Trump v. J.G.G.*, which affirmed the right to habeas relief for those subject to the proclamation and emphasized the need for notice. G.M.G. alleges that the proclamation is unlawful because it misapplies the AEA, as TdA is not a \"foreign nation or government\" and its actions do not constitute an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” within the meaning of the Act. He further contends that the government’s procedural safeguards are inadequate, failing to provide sufficient notice and opportunity to challenge the designation as a TdA member.\n\nFollowing his arrest and detention, G.M.G. was denied bond in immigration court based on the government’s assertion of his TdA membership, raising concerns about imminent removal. On May 5, 2025, the court issued an order requiring the government to provide 48 hours' notice before moving G.M.G. outside of the District, which was later amended to 72 hours. On May 7, 2025, Petitioner filed a Notice of Supplemental Authorities, citing District Court opinions in New York and Colorado which found similar issues with the Proclamation’s application. The case is being handled by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union and cooperating counsel.",
    "46582": "Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian woman residing in New Jersey since 2016, filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas on April 30, 2025, seeking a writ of habeas corpus and declaratory and injunctive relief against several federal agencies and officials. Kordia was detained in March 2025 after attending a protest in support of Palestinian rights near Columbia University and sending money to a family member in Palestine. She alleges that her detention is based on her political views and association, violating her First Amendment rights and due process guarantees.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the government, influenced by statements from President Trump and his administration, began targeting noncitizens who express support for Palestinian rights. Kordia was arrested and transferred over 1,500 miles to the Prairieland Detention Facility in Texas, despite an immigration judge granting her bond, which was subsequently stayed by the Department of Homeland Security. While detained, Kordia alleges she has faced significant religious freedom violations, including a lack of halal meals and inadequate prayer accommodations.\n\nKordia’s legal challenge is based on the First Amendment’s protection of free speech and association, the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). She seeks release from detention and an injunction against the government's discriminatory practices. Following preliminary filings and motions, including a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction Ordering Release Pending Final Judgment, the court recommitted the matter to Magistrate Judge Rutherford to address new issues raised after the initial report. On August 11, 2025, a Joint Motion to Modify the Briefing Schedule was filed and granted, setting deadlines for amended pleadings and responsive documents. The case remains ongoing, with the court considering the merits of Kordia’s claims and the government’s justifications for her continued detention.",
    "46496": "On April 24, 2025, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the Southern Border Communities Coalition, and the Urban Justice Center filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Kristi Noem, alleging that DHS’s actions to eliminate CRCL, CISOM, and OIDO were unlawful. The plaintiffs asserted that these actions exceeded DHS’s statutory authority, violated the Administrative Procedure Act, and undermined Congress’s intent in establishing these oversight offices. The offices were created to protect civil rights and civil liberties within DHS, receiving specific appropriations from Congress.\n\nIn March 2025, DHS abruptly closed these offices, placing nearly all employees on administrative leave and announcing their separation. The plaintiffs claimed this action disrupted their ability to address civil rights and immigration issues and impacted individuals seeking assistance. The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to prevent further actions hindering the offices’ functions.\n\nFollowing the filing of the complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo. The court heard arguments on the motion and subsequently denied the preliminary injunction without prejudice, while ordering DHS to provide information regarding its budget communications. The Court ordered the parties to submit an administrative record and scheduled briefing on cross-motions for summary judgment. Throughout these proceedings, the court scrutinized DHS’s representations regarding its intentions for the offices, highlighting inconsistencies between public statements and internal budget documents. As of August 22, 2025, the case remains ongoing, with an administrative record submitted and motions for summary judgment pending.",
    "46432": "Mohammed H., a 20-year-old Bangladeshi national and student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, initiated a legal challenge against several federal and state officials, including the President of the United States and the Attorney General, seeking a writ of habeas corpus. The case stemmed from his arrest by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers on March 28, 2025, following a revocation of his student visa and termination of his SEVIS record. Mohammed H. alleged that his arrest and subsequent detention were retaliatory, stemming from his public expression of support for Palestinian human rights.\n\nThe legal proceedings began with Mohammed H. filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent his transfer out of the District of Minnesota. Judge Jerry W. Blackwell initially granted the temporary restraining order on April 22, 2025, to preserve jurisdiction and prevent irreparable harm while the case was adjudicated. Subsequent orders extended this restraining order multiple times.\n\nThe government argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to review the immigration enforcement actions. However, the court rejected this argument, finding that the case presented substantial First and Fifth Amendment claims. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Blackwell granted Mohammed H.’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus on June 17, 2025. The court found that Mohammed H. had demonstrated a violation of his First Amendment rights due to retaliatory actions based on his protected speech and a violation of his Fifth Amendment due process rights due to the arbitrary nature of his detention and the government's justification for the same. The court ordered his release from custody, subject to the existing bond conditions. The defendants subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "46477": "On April 14, 2025, a group of international students (Plaintiffs) filed suit in the Western District of Michigan against Kristi Noem, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and other DHS officials (Defendants), alleging that DHS had improperly terminated their records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The Plaintiffs, comprised of thirty-one F-1 and M-1 visa holders, asserted violations of the Due Process Clause and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They sought declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nFollowing an emergency ex parte motion, Judge Jane M. Beckering issued a Temporary Restraining Order on April 23, 2025, requiring Defendants to set aside the SEVIS termination decisions, restore the Plaintiffs’ records, and refrain from certain actions, including terminating records without valid grounds, revoking Optional Practical Training (OPT) authorizations, and initiating removal proceedings. The Court found that the Plaintiffs demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits – specifically regarding their APA claim – and that irreparable harm would result absent injunctive relief.\n\nOn May 7, 2025, Judge Beckering issued an Opinion and Order granting the Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, reinforcing the terms of the Temporary Restraining Order and prohibiting DHS from taking certain actions. The Court determined that Defendants had not demonstrated that the challenged conduct could reasonably be expected to recur. The court also denied a motion for an order to show cause and ordered DHS to provide notice regarding the status of SEVIS records.\n\nSubsequently, Defendants filed a notice of appeal, and a transcript of the preliminary injunction hearing was prepared. The Defendants also sought and were initially granted an extension to respond to the Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, which was later denied. As of August 2025, the case remained active, with ongoing procedural steps related to the appeal and the response to the Amended Complaint.",
    "46239": "In March 2025, Erie County, New York, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Corporation for National and Community Service (AmeriCorps) and its interim agency head, Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi. The suit stemmed from AmeriCorps’ response to two executive orders issued by President Trump in January 2025, which aimed to eliminate \"DEI\" (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives within the federal government. Erie County, having applied for and received a grant for its Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), was subsequently directed by AmeriCorps to certify that its program did not promote DEI activities, a requirement that conflicted with Erie County’s prior representations and long-standing practices of promoting diversity in its volunteer efforts.\n\nErie County sought injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment, arguing that AmeriCorps’ actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Spending Clause of the Constitution. The county filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent AmeriCorps from enforcing the new certification requirement. However, before the court could rule on the motion, AmeriCorps revised its certification requirements. As a result, on April 14, 2025, Erie County voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice, effectively ending the litigation.",
    "46230": "On March 14, 2025, Jane Doe 1-6 and John Doe 7-12 (the \"Plaintiffs\") filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Douglas A. Collins, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. The lawsuit stemmed from President Trump's January 20, 2025, Executive Order 14151, which directed executive agencies to terminate Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) offices and programs. Following this order, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) closed the Office of Equity Assurance (OEA) and placed its twenty-seven employees, including the Plaintiffs, on administrative leave. The Plaintiffs, who allege they are nonpartisan career civil servants, claimed the VA’s actions were arbitrary, capricious, violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights, and were contrary to the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe Plaintiffs sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent the VA from designating OEA as a DEIA office and from classifying the Plaintiffs as DEIA employees, as well as to restore their access to VA systems. They argued that the VA’s actions were retaliatory and discriminated based on perceived political viewpoints. The Plaintiffs also alleged procedural deficiencies in the subsequent Reduction in Force (RIF) process.\n\nThe Defendant, Douglas A. Collins, filed an opposition to the Plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO, arguing that the actions were consistent with Executive Order 14151 and that the Plaintiffs' claims lacked merit. Supplemental filings by the Defendant included documentation related to the Deferred Resignation Program (DRP) and job announcements.\n\nOn May 2, 2025, Judge Rudolph Contreras held a hearing on the Plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO and subsequently denied it. The court directed the parties to meet and propose a briefing schedule for a motion for a preliminary injunction. On July 17, 2025, the Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal without prejudice, effectively ending the case.",
    "46242": "The case, filed on March 5, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, involves a challenge to the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) December 31, 2024 Decision Record for the San Rafael Swell Travel Management Plan. Plaintiffs BlueRibbon Coalition, Inc., Sage Riders Motorcycle Club, and Paul Wells are seeking relief from this plan, alleging violations of the Dingell Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The plan designates 1,496 miles for motorized vehicle use and closes 665 miles to such use within the San Rafael Swell Travel Management Area. Plaintiffs argue that the closures are ultra vires, arbitrary and capricious, and violate NEPA requirements.\n\nFollowing the initial filing, the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA) filed a motion to intervene as of right, which was granted by Judge David Nuffer on April 21, 2025. SUWA argues that they have a protectable interest in the litigation and that the federal defendants may not adequately represent their interests.  The court has established a schedule for the administrative appeal process, with deadlines for the submission of opening briefs, responsive briefs, and reply briefs extending into 2026, indicating the case is expected to proceed through a detailed review of the BLM’s actions. The court has set deadlines for the submission of briefs related to the administrative appeal.",
    "46039": "This case, *Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association v. Department of Justice*, was filed on February 4, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, comprised of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association (FBIAA) and several individual FBI agents (identified as John and Jane Does), allege that the Department of Justice is retaliating against them for their involvement in investigations related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and related matters, including a case *United States v. Haniyeh*. They fear the disclosure of their personal information, potentially leading to public scrutiny and even vigilante action. The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and monetary damages, alleging violations of the Privacy Act and other constitutional and statutory rights.\n\nThe Department of Justice argues that the plaintiffs lack standing due to speculative fears of future harm and that their request for injunctive relief exceeds the scope of their claims. The DOJ asserts that the information gathering is part of a lawful review process directed by an Executive Order and doesn’t indicate any intent to misuse employee data.\n\nInitially, the plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the dissemination of their information. However, on February 7, 2025, the court issued an order deferring a ruling and entering a consent order. This order temporarily prevents the government from disclosing the list of personnel involved in the investigations, pending a hearing scheduled for March 27, 2025, for a preliminary injunction. The court also consolidated this case with a related case, *Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association v. Department of Justice*, case number 25-cv-0325. Further filings and proceedings are anticipated before the court makes a final determination.",
    "46681": "In February 2025, Gary L. Barnes, proceeding pro se, filed a complaint in the United States Court of International Trade against the United States, challenging the constitutionality of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on goods from Mexico, Canada, and China. Barnes argued that the President exceeded his authority by imposing these tariffs, which he claimed violated Article I, Sections 7 and 8 of the U.S. Constitution, which grant the power to levy tariffs to Congress. The Defendant, the United States, filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that Barnes lacked standing to bring the claim. The Defendant contended Barnes's argument regarding a “breach of the constitutional contract” did not meet the requirements for Article III standing. Barnes responded in a Reply, asserting that the case involved a violation of constitutional rights and that the Court should allow for flexibility in standing requirements when challenging unconstitutional actions. However, on May 23, 2025, Judge Jennifer Choe-Groves granted the Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, finding that Barnes failed to demonstrate a particularized and concrete injury sufficient to establish standing. The Court concluded that Barnes’s claims of generalized harm to U.S. citizens did not satisfy the constitutional minimum for standing, and dismissed the complaint without prejudice, allowing Barnes an opportunity to file an amended complaint.",
    "46758": "A lawsuit was filed on June 20, 2025, in the Central District of California by multiple plaintiffs, including individual residents and several advocacy organizations, against the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and other high-ranking federal officials. The plaintiffs allege that federal agents have been conducting detentive stops in public places within the district without reasonable suspicion, violating the Fourth Amendment. These stops are part of \"Operation At Large,\" a federal enforcement initiative. \n\nFollowing the filing, the plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent these stops. After a hearing, the district court granted the TRO on July 11, 2025, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in proving that unlawful stops were occurring. The TRO prohibits federal agents from conducting detentive stops without reasonable suspicion and restricts reliance on specific factors – apparent race or ethnicity, language, presence at a particular location, or type of work – as the sole basis for suspicion.\n\nThe Defendants appealed the TRO and filed motions with both the district court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals seeking a stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit denied the motion for a stay, but only as to the “except as permitted by law” clause in the TRO. The district court also granted several motions for intervenors to join the case. On August 13, 2025, the court continued the hearing on the motion to file a first amended complaint. As of August 28, 2025, the case remains ongoing, with a hearing scheduled on the motion for a preliminary injunction on September 24, 2025.",
    "46378": "On April 10, 2025, Chinmay Deore, Yogesh Joshi, Xiangyun Bu, and Qiuyi Yang, four international students studying at Michigan universities, filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, and the Field Office Director of Detroit, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The students sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction following the termination of their records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). They alleged that the terminations violated their Fifth Amendment due process rights and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe students contended that the SEVIS terminations had effectively terminated their F-1 student status, leaving them at risk of detention and deportation. The Government, in response, argued that a SEVIS record termination does not automatically equate to a termination of F-1 student status and that they had no basis to believe the students were in danger of removal proceedings. The Government also submitted declarations indicating that the terminations were based on criminal history records or immigration status issues.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, Judge Stephen J. Murphy III denied the motion for a temporary restraining order. The Court reasoned that it was unclear whether the SEVIS terminations necessarily reflected a loss of F-1 status and that the students had not sufficiently demonstrated an irreparable harm. The Court further acknowledged the Government's interest in enforcing immigration laws. The Court did, however, grant a stipulated order extending deadlines and scheduling a hearing on a preliminary injunction for June 11, 2025. Ultimately, on May 29, 2025, the parties entered into a stipulated order of dismissal, resolving the case.",
    "46385": "On April 5, 2025, Sheila Bedi and Lynn Cohn, faculty members at Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the United States House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce, Committee Chair Tim Walberg, Subcommittee Chair Burgess Owens, Northwestern University, President Michael Schill, and Board of Trustees Chair Peter Barris. The plaintiffs allege that the Committee is exceeding its authority and violating their constitutional rights through a demand for extensive documents related to the law school’s clinics and their work, particularly that of Professor Bedi.\n\nThe lawsuit, alleging violations of the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, stems from a series of increasingly assertive actions by the Committee, beginning with an initial request for documents in December 2024. The plaintiffs contend that the Committee’s demands, which target their work, donor information, and performance reviews, are driven by a desire to punish viewpoints the Committee disfavors and chill advocacy for causes deemed “left-wing.” They assert that the Committee’s actions are a broader pattern of targeting institutions and individuals critical of the current administration.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to prevent Northwestern from complying with the Committee’s demands pending a full adjudication of the case. During a hearing on April 10, 2025, Judge Elaine E. Bucklo denied the motion, finding it moot. The court subsequently stayed the proceedings and scheduled a status hearing for September 22, 2025, requiring the parties to submit a joint status report by September 15, 2025. The case involves claims of potential harm to academic freedom, the right to counsel, and freedom of association, with the plaintiffs arguing that the Committee’s actions threaten their ability to represent clients and teach without fear of reprisal.",
    "46353": "Plaintiff John Doe, a software engineer in lawful F-1 status with post-graduate STEM Optional Practical Training (OPT) authorization, initiated a lawsuit against several defendants, including the President of the United States, the Acting Field Office Director of San Francisco ICE, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, on April 7, 2025. Doe alleges that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unlawfully terminated his SEVIS record, impacting his ability to lawfully remain in the United States. The lawsuit, joined by other plaintiffs in related cases, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Doe claims the termination violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and his Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert that DHS lacks legal authority to terminate SEVIS records and that the terminations are part of a policy targeting international students, particularly those of specific ethnic and religious backgrounds. This assertion is supported by instances where students have been arrested and transferred to detention facilities in other states. \n\nOn April 16, 2025, Doe filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent DHS from taking enforcement action against him. The Defendants opposed the motion, arguing that the termination of a SEVIS record does not automatically terminate an F-1 nonimmigrant status. Following a hearing, the Court granted the TRO and extended it for fourteen days, enjoining the defendants from imposing legal effects resulting from the termination of Doe’s SEVIS status. \n\nThe court has consolidated these cases and set a hearing for a preliminary injunction on September 12, 2025. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has been notified of the case and proceedings, and a Notice of Appeal has been filed by the defendants. The court has issued several orders, including granting the plaintiffs’ motion to proceed under a pseudonym and resolving administrative motions related to deadlines and hearing schedules. A motion to stay pending appeal was filed and denied by the Court. The case remains ongoing, with further proceedings scheduled before the District Court.",
    "46337": "On March 25, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued Executive Order No. 14248, aiming to modify federal election procedures, specifically targeting the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and voter registration processes. Nineteen states, acting as plaintiffs, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the President, the Attorney General of the United States, and several members of the EAC, alleging that the Executive Order exceeded the President's constitutional authority and infringed on states’ rights to regulate elections.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the Executive Order violated the Elections Clause of the Constitution and the separation of powers doctrine by attempting to dictate election regulations and interfere with the NVRA. Specifically, the order directed the EAC to require documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration and imposed limitations on ballot receipt deadlines. The defendants contended that the Executive Order was a necessary measure to ensure election integrity.\n\nFollowing a hearing on May 6, 2025, Judge Denise J. Casper issued a memorandum and order on June 13, 2025, granting the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the defendants from implementing key provisions of the Executive Order. The court found the states likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, citing concerns about the President’s overreach of executive power. The ruling specifically prohibited actions related to documentary proof of citizenship requirements, the assessment of citizenship prior to voter registration, and the enforcement of strict ballot receipt deadlines.\n\nOn July 31, 2025, the defendants filed a Notice of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals. The appeal was assigned case number 25-1726. The court also scheduled a hearing on the defendants’ motion to dismiss for September 4, 2025.",
    "46238": "This legal action, filed on March 17, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, involved two active-duty Air Force service members, Logan Ireland and Nicholas Bear Bade, who challenged recent executive orders issued by President Donald Trump. These orders, Executive Order 14168 and Executive Order 14183, reversed prior policies allowing transgender individuals to serve openly in the military and implemented restrictions based on an individual's biological sex, effectively barring transgender individuals from military service.\n\nThe plaintiffs, both transgender men who had previously served honorably, sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the implementation of these directives, arguing that the orders violated their Fifth Amendment rights – specifically, the Equal Protection Clause. They claimed they faced imminent administrative separation proceedings due to their transgender status. The court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order on March 24, 2025, which remained in effect for fourteen days.\n\nFollowing the TRO, the parties engaged in further filings, including a request by Defendants for a stay of TRO implementation. The court denied this request on March 26, 2025. Simultaneously, a parallel case, *Talbott v. United States* in the District Court for the District of Columbia, issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against similar orders, but that injunction was subject to potential appeal. \n\nUltimately, on May 15, 2025, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their case without prejudice. The case was terminated, leaving the legal standing of the executive orders to be determined in the parallel case of *Talbott v. United States*.",
    "46234": "On March 15, 2025, Momodou Taal, Mũkoma Wa Ngũgĩ, and Sriram Parasurama filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York against President Donald J. Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and Kristi Noem, challenging the constitutionality of Executive Order 14161 and Executive Order 14188. The plaintiffs alleged that these orders, which restrict speech critical of the U.S. government or the government of Israel, violate the First and Fifth Amendments. Specifically, Mr. Taal, a non-citizen student, faced potential deportation due to his advocacy for Palestinian rights and the government's interpretation of his speech as hostile. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the orders.\n\nShortly after filing the complaint, the plaintiffs requested a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent Mr. Taal’s detention and potential removal. The court initially denied the ex parte request and scheduled a hearing, ordering the parties to submit briefs.\n\nThe government argued that the actions were necessary for national security and to combat anti-Semitism. Following the initial filings and court proceedings, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case on March 31, 2025, without prejudice. The court subsequently dismissed the case, ending the legal challenge to the executive orders. The case involved claims of threats to Mr. Taal's immigration status based on his protected speech, raising concerns about potential First Amendment violations and due process rights.",
    "46216": "Gordon Schiff and Celeste Royce, Harvard Medical School professors, initiated a lawsuit against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Charles Ezell (Acting Director of OPM), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (Secretary of HHS), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and Mamatha S. Pancholi (Acting Director of AHRQ), alleging violations of the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act. The lawsuit stems from AHRQ’s removal of Dr. Schiff and Dr. Royce’s articles from the Patient Safety Network (PSNet), a government-run online resource for patient safety information. The removals occurred following President Trump’s January 20, 2025, Executive Order directing agencies to eliminate content promoting “gender ideology” and subsequent guidance from OPM.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that AHRQ’s actions constitute viewpoint discrimination, suppressing research based on its inclusion of terms like “LGBTQ” and “transgender.” Following a hearing, Judge Leo T. Sorokin granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction, ordering AHRQ to restore the removed articles and all other content authored by private parties removed as a result of the same policy. The Court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment claim and that the balance of equities and public interest favored injunctive relief.\n\nSubsequently, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction, arguing the claims were moot and that the plaintiffs lacked standing. While the Court has not yet ruled on this motion, the preliminary injunction remains in place, requiring the restoration of the removed content while the case proceeds. The deadline for the defendants to file their answer has been extended to July 16, 2025 and the parties have requested an extension for their response and reply briefs, to July 28, 2025.",
    "46207": "In March 2025, Alishea Kingdom, Solo Nichols, and Jas Kapule, three incarcerated individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria, filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, the Attorney General of the United States, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief challenging Executive Order 14168, issued by President Trump, which mandates the cessation of gender-affirming medical care, including hormone therapy and social accommodations, for individuals in BOP custody. The plaintiffs asserted claims under the Eighth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Rehabilitation Act.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the enforcement of the Executive Order and its implementing memoranda, and for class certification to represent all individuals incarcerated in BOP custody with gender dysphoria. Several states filed an amicus brief in support of the defendants, arguing that policymakers should have the authority to regulate medicine, particularly in areas of uncertainty.\n\nThe Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification on July 3, 2025, defining the class as individuals who are currently or will be incarcerated in BOP facilities with a current diagnosis of gender dysphoria or who receive such a diagnosis in the future. The Court also granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the BOP from implementing Section 4(c) of Executive Order 14168 against any class member from September 1, 2025, to November 30, 2025. The Court’s decision was based on a finding that the BOP’s actions were arbitrary and capricious and that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their APA claims. The court also considered the balance of equities and the public interest, concluding that they favored granting the injunction. Further proceedings and potential renewals of the injunction are anticipated as the case progresses.",
    "46104": "American Oversight has filed suit against the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the U.S. DOGE Service, the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, the U.S. Digital Service, and the Office of Management and Budget, alleging violations of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The lawsuit stems from American Oversight’s requests for records related to communications involving Elon Musk and his staff, primarily concerning DOGE’s formation and operations.\n\nDOGE was established in November 2024, following President Trump’s announcement of its creation and Elon Musk's appointment as its head. The agency’s structure and purpose have been subject to evolving executive orders, initially intended to modernize federal technology and enhance governmental efficiency. However, DOGE has subsequently taken actions, including directing agency personnel and influencing decisions regarding contracts and staffing, leading to concerns about its independent authority and potential circumvention of established procedures.\n\nAmerican Oversight argues that DOGE's unusual structure and actions necessitate discovery to determine whether it meets the legal definition of an \"agency\" under FOIA. The plaintiff seeks limited discovery to ascertain DOGE's internal structure, the scope of its authority within other agencies, and the actual roles of individuals within the organization, particularly concerning Musk's leadership and involvement. The court has granted a limited discovery motion, setting a schedule for the parties to submit discovery requests, oppositions, and replies. The case is ongoing, with the court actively managing the discovery process to clarify DOGE's status and ensure compliance with FOIA.

The lawsuit, filed in May 2025, centers on the abrupt termination of general operating support grants to state humanities councils by DOGE, following its arrival at NEH. \n\nPlaintiffs argue that these actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), and the separation of powers doctrine. They contend that DOGE, acting under the direction of the Executive Office of the President, unilaterally terminated grants without following required statutory procedures, including providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing. The Plaintiffs further assert that these actions were arbitrary and capricious, lacking a reasoned explanation and disregarding established NEH policies.\n\nThe Defendants argue that NEH has broad discretion in allocating funds and that the grant terminations were justified by a need to align with new policy priorities. They also contend that the plaintiffs' claims are based on a misinterpretation of the ICA. A hearing on the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction was held, and the Court is currently considering the arguments presented regarding the likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, and the balance of equities. The Court has issued an order establishing a briefing schedule and setting a date for oral argument.",

(the Plaintiffs) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump and several federal agencies (the Defendants), challenging the legality of tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Plaintiffs, American businesses that import educational products from various countries, allege that the President exceeded his authority by unilaterally imposing tariffs without proper congressional authorization. They claim violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and argue the tariffs contravene the nondelegation doctrine.\n\nThe Defendants moved to transfer the case to the United States Court of International Trade (CIT), asserting that the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving tariffs. The Plaintiffs opposed this motion. Following a hearing on May 27, 2025, the District Court denied the Defendants' motion to transfer and granted the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, temporarily halting the collection of the challenged tariffs. The court reasoned that the District Court had jurisdiction and that the President’s actions likely exceeded his authority under IEEPA. The court has ordered a stay of its preliminary injunction pending appeal.",
    "46390": "In April 2025, D.B.U. and R.M.M., along with others, filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, challenging the U.S. government's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to remove Venezuelan citizens. The lawsuit stemmed from a March 2025 Presidential Proclamation designating members of Tren de Aragua (TdA) as alien enemies and authorizing their summary removal without due process. Petitioners sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to halt these removals and ensure notice and an opportunity to contest their designation.\n\nThe Court initially granted the TRO, ordering that Petitioners and the provisionally certified class not be transferred outside the District of Colorado and mandating that the government provide twenty-one days’ notice, written in a language the individual understands, informing detainees of their right to seek judicial review. Following this, the government appealed the TRO, seeking a stay pending appeal, but the Tenth Circuit denied this request.\n\nSubsequently, the District Court heard arguments on the Petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction, which would replace the temporary TRO. The Court granted the preliminary injunction, reaffirming the restrictions on the government’s actions and solidifying the class’s right to due process under the AEA. The government has appealed this order.",

The plaintiffs allege that DHS, through ICE, initiated a widespread termination of Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records and revocation of F-1 visas for international students in early April 2025, without due process or legal justification. The plaintiffs assert claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment, alleging arbitrary and capricious agency action and violations of due process.\n\nThe lawsuit stems from a policy implemented by ICE, known as the Student Criminal Alien Initiative (SCAI), which resulted in the mass termination of SEVIS records based on searches of the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database. The plaintiffs, who are all international students, contend that their SEVIS records were terminated despite having no criminal convictions and maintaining compliance with their visa requirements.\n\nFollowing the initial complaint, the court granted a temporary restraining order on April 18, 2025, and subsequently a preliminary injunction on May 22, 2025, enjoining DHS from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring the named plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals nationwide. The court has since continued the case management conferences to allow parties to engage in negotiations. The court ordered Defendants to reinstate the SEVIS records of the Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals. Defendants have appealed the preliminary Injunction. As of July 2025, the court has set deadlines for defendants to file their response to the complaint and has scheduled a case management conference.",

Trump, Charles Ezell (Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management), and various heads of federal agencies, challenging an Executive Order issued on March 27, 2025. The Executive Order, designated as 14,251, seeks to exclude numerous agencies and subdivisions from coverage under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), effectively stripping collective bargaining rights from a significant portion of federal employees represented by NTEU. NTEU alleges that the Executive Order is unlawful and constitutes an ultra vires action, exceeding the President’s statutory authority, and also amounts to retaliation in violation of the First Amendment.\n\nThe lawsuit was initiated on March 31, 2025, and NTEU promptly moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the Executive Order’s implementation. Following a hearing on April 23, 2025, the District Court granted NTEU’s motion for a preliminary injunction on April 25, 2025, finding that the Executive Order was likely unlawful. The court reasoned that the President’s actions demonstrated an indifference to the Statute’s purpose and were motivated by a desire to punish unions challenging the administration’s policies.\n\nThe Defendants have now filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and oppose NTEU’s motion for summary judgment, arguing that the President’s actions were within his authority and do not constitute retaliation. The case is currently pending before the District Court and has been appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court, which has assigned it case number 25-5157.",

(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed suit in the District of Columbia against Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of Homeland Security, and other high-ranking officials within the Department of Homeland Security (collectively “Defendants”). The lawsuit challenges recent policy changes implemented by the administration that expand expedited removal to individuals who entered the country legally through humanitarian parole programs.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the Defendants’ actions, including a memorandum issued in January 2025, a February 2025 directive from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and a March 2025 Federal Register Notice terminating the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan parole processes, are unlawful. These actions collectively threaten to expose hundreds of thousands of individuals who were lawfully paroled into the United States to summary deportation without due process. Plaintiffs argue that the expansion of expedited removal to paroled individuals exceeds the statutory authority granted to DHS under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\n\nThe case centers on the interpretation of two provisions of the INA: the “Arriving Aliens Provision” and the “Designation Provision.” Plaintiffs contend that the challenged actions misinterpret these provisions and that paroled individuals, having completed inspection at a port of entry, are no longer considered “arriving aliens” subject to expedited removal. Defendants argue that the actions are consistent with the statute and are necessary to enforce immigration laws effectively.\n\nThe Court has taken the matter under advisement following a hearing on July 9, 2025, and is currently considering Plaintiffs’ motion for a stay of the challenged agency actions pending resolution of the case.

LeBlanc and Felten, both Senate-confirmed members, were removed by the President in January 2025 without stated cause. They argued that the PCLOB’s organic statute, amended in 2007, protects Board members from at-will removal, aiming to ensure the Board’s independence in overseeing executive branch counterterrorism policies.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted that the 2007 amendments, which eliminated language allowing the President to remove members at will, established a fixed six-year term and mandated partisan balance, demonstrated Congress's intent to insulate Board members from presidential influence. They further argued that the Board's function of providing independent oversight necessitates protection from politically motivated removals.\n\nThe defendants contended that the President retains the power to remove PCLOB members, arguing that the statute lacks explicit language restricting that power and that the PCLOB’s functions fall within the executive branch’s purview.\n\nFollowing extensive briefing and a hearing, Judge Reggie B. Walton sided with the plaintiffs. The court found that the statutory structure and function, including the removal of language permitting at-will removal and the establishment of fixed terms and partisan balance requirements, indicated Congress’s intent to restrict the President’s removal power. The court declared the plaintiffs’ terminations unlawful and ordered the PCLOB, along with the named defendants, to reinstate them to their positions. The court also denied the defendants’ motion to stay this order pending appeal, and the case was subsequently closed. The defendants have appealed the decision to the D.C. Circuit.",

The plaintiffs allege that OPM improperly disclosed sensitive personal data to DOGE affiliates, including Elon Musk, in violation of the Privacy Act of 1974. These disclosures occurred shortly after President Trump issued Executive Order 14,158, which established the U.S. DOGE Service and directed agencies to facilitate access to data for modernization efforts. The plaintiffs claim that this access was granted without proper vetting, training, or a demonstrated need, and that OPM failed to adhere to established security protocols.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, requesting a court order preventing further disclosure of their data, requiring the destruction of any unlawfully obtained information, and mandating the implementation of appropriate safeguards to protect against future breaches. Following the filing of the complaint, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order, which the court considered in conjunction with the defendants' motion to dismiss. The court has ordered a telephone conference to allow for discussion and propose terms for a preliminary injunction, and has indicated it will consider the plaintiffs' request for expedited discovery. The case is ongoing, and the court is currently evaluating the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims and considering appropriate injunctive relief.",
    "46095": "On February 10, 2025, several universities and associations (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and their acting leadership. The Plaintiffs challenged a recently released NIH Guidance that imposed a 15% cap on indirect costs for research grants, effectively reducing funding for research institutions. The Plaintiffs argued this Guidance, announced with little notice, violated existing laws and regulations, including an appropriations rider that prohibits NIH from modifying indirect cost recovery processes.\n\nThe Plaintiffs immediately sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent the Guidance from taking effect. Following a hearing, the court granted the TRO on February 11, 2025.  After considering the arguments presented, the court issued a Memorandum and Order on March 5, 2025, finding in favor of the Plaintiffs. The court determined that the NIH’s action was arbitrary and capricious, failed to follow proper administrative procedures, and was impermissibly retroactive. Consequently, on April 4, 2025, the court converted the temporary restraining order into a permanent injunction, effectively blocking the NIH’s new indirect cost rate policy and maintaining the status quo. The court also consolidated the three related cases. Defendants have appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.",

The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants unlawfully disclosed personal and financial information contained in the Bureau’s records to individuals affiliated with the United States DOGE Service (Doge) without proper authorization, violating the Privacy Act of 1974 and Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThe Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants' actions, initiated shortly after a new Secretary of the Treasury took office, involved granting Doge team members improper access to sensitive data. The Plaintiffs argue these actions were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to federal law. The case concerns the Bureau's payment systems, which contain records including names, social security numbers, and bank account information of millions of individuals.\n\nFollowing the filing of the Complaint, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, which the Court converted into a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. The Court initially deferred ruling but ordered the Defendants to preserve the status quo. Subsequent filings revealed that the Doge team was granted access to the Bureau’s systems, leading to concerns about unauthorized disclosure.\n\nThe Court denied the Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, finding that they had established standing and that the Defendants' actions were contrary to law, but it deferred ruling pending review of a complete administrative record. The Court ordered the Defendants to file the administrative record by March 10, 2025, and set deadlines for Plaintiffs to file objections and for further proceedings, including motions for summary judgment from both sides.

The lawsuit, filed on May 7, 2025, challenges newly imposed conditions on federal grant funding. These conditions, enacted by the Trump Administration, require grant recipients to comply with broad mandates related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), immigration enforcement, and abortion access.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that these conditions are unlawful, exceeding Congress's authority and violating the Administrative Procedure Act. They argue that the conditions are not germane to the purposes of the grants, are unconstitutionally vague, and represent an improper attempt to commandeer state and local governments. The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the conditions are unlawful and an injunction preventing Defendants from enforcing them.\n\nThe case originated with a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), which the court granted, temporarily halting the enforcement of the conditions. Following the TRO, several new plaintiffs joined the lawsuit, and the Court ordered Defendants to respond to a motion for a preliminary injunction, which will be heard on May 28, 2025. The plaintiffs are seeking to protect approximately $4 billion in federal grant funding essential for providing critical services like homelessness assistance and transportation infrastructure improvements within their jurisdictions.",
    "46484": "On April 23, 2025, the American Bar Association (ABA) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi. The lawsuit alleges that the DOJ retaliated against the ABA for exercising its First Amendment rights by terminating five of the ABA’s grants totaling $3.2 million, which funded services to victims of domestic and sexual violence. This action occurred shortly after the ABA publicly criticized the Administration and filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government. The ABA seeks a temporary restraining order and, in the alternative, a preliminary injunction barring the DOJ from enforcing the termination, re-obligating the funds, and requiring the DOJ to continue disbursing the funds as customary.\n\nThe core of the dispute stems from a memorandum issued by Deputy Attorney General Blanche restricting DOJ engagement with the ABA following the ABA’s public criticism. The DOJ contends the grant terminations were based on a change in agency priorities, as permitted under federal regulations. However, the ABA argues that the termination was a retaliatory measure in response to its protected First Amendment activities.\n\nFollowing a hearing on May 12, 2025, Judge Christopher R. Cooper issued a memorandum opinion on May 14, 2025, finding that the ABA had demonstrated a likelihood of success on its First Amendment retaliation claim. The court found that the government did not present a compelling justification for the grant terminations beyond the timing and the ABA’s public criticisms. Because the ABA met all the requirements for a preliminary injunction, the court granted its motion and denied the DOJ's motion to dismiss the First Amendment retaliation claim, effectively preventing the DOJ from taking further action regarding the terminated grants. A transcript of the hearing was filed on April 30, 2025.",
    "46279": "This case, filed in March 2025, involves a class action lawsuit brought by four non-citizens (Plaintiffs) against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), its Secretary, the Attorney General, and a County Correctional Facility Superintendent (Defendants). The Plaintiffs allege that DHS's policy and practice of deporting non-citizens to third countries without providing notice or an opportunity to contest removal violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA) related to the Convention Against Torture (CAT), and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to halt this practice. The court initially granted a temporary restraining order, and subsequently a preliminary injunction, requiring DHS to provide notice and a chance to raise CAT claims before removing individuals to third countries. Following these rulings, DHS appealed to the First Circuit Court of Appeals and sought a stay of the injunction pending appeal. The Supreme Court granted that stay.\n\nThe case’s factual background centers on the Plaintiffs’ experiences, revealing that some were deported to countries where they feared persecution or torture without proper notification or opportunity to present a claim. Following the Supreme Court’s stay, the district court vacated its prior orders and the case remains pending before the First Circuit on appeal. The central legal question is whether DHS’s actions violate established statutory and constitutional protections afforded to non-citizens facing removal proceedings.",
    "46186": "Plaintiffs, a group of non-citizens and an advocacy organization, filed a lawsuit in February 2025 against the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of ICE, the Acting Commissioner of CBP, the Director of USCIS, and the President of the United States, challenging recent actions by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding humanitarian parole programs. The plaintiffs allege that DHS’s actions are unlawful and seek declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, they challenge the termination of the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U), Family Reunification Parole (FRP), Operation Allies Welcome (OAW), and the processes for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV).\n\nThe lawsuit began with a challenge to DHS’s January 20, 2025, Executive Order 14165, directing the termination of “categorical parole programs.” Following this, Acting Secretary Huffman issued a memorandum asserting that the existing parole programs were “blatantly inconsistent with the statute.” Subsequently, DHS published a Federal Register Notice on March 25, 2025, formally terminating the CHNV parole programs and announcing the imminent termination of existing grants of parole.  Plaintiffs argue that these actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and exceed DHS’s statutory authority. \n\nThe court initially granted a temporary stay of the termination of CHNV parole, and the Supreme Court has since stayed that order pending appeal. The court has also addressed motions regarding pseudonyms for plaintiffs and scheduling of hearings. The case remains ongoing, with further arguments and potential rulings pending concerning the legality of DHS’s actions and the scope of judicial review. The core issue is whether DHS acted lawfully in terminating these parole programs and whether the courts have the authority to review such discretionary decisions.",
    "46180": "On February 25, 2025, the American Federation of Teachers, the American Sociological Association, Eugene School District 4J, and the American Federation of Teachers-Maryland filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon, and Acting Assistant Secretary Craig Trainor, challenging a Dear Colleague Letter issued by the Department on February 14, 2025. This letter, intended to clarify the Department’s interpretation of Title VI and the Supreme Court’s ruling in *Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Harvard*, prompted concerns that it unduly restricted educational institutions' ability to teach about race and implement diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Plaintiffs allege the Letter and a subsequent Certification Requirement violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the First Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that the Department’s actions were arbitrary, capricious, and lacked proper notice and comment procedures as required by the APA. They argue that the Letter’s vague language chills protected speech and restricts academic freedom. Following the initial complaint, the court ordered the parties to show cause as to venue. Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed motions for preliminary injunctions seeking to halt the enforcement of both the Letter and the Certification Requirement. \n\nOn April 18, 2025, the court issued an order staying the Dear Colleague Letter and denying the motion for a preliminary injunction regarding the Certification Requirement. However, the court also acknowledged the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims and the potential for harm. On August 14, 2025, the court issued an order of judgment granting summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs, vacating both the Dear Colleague Letter and the Certification Requirement. The case remains ongoing, with further proceedings likely to address the scope and nature of injunctive relief.",

Plaintiffs allege that Musk and DOGE have been dismantling USAID, exceeding their legal authority and violating the Constitution. The lawsuit, filed in February 2025, initially sought a preliminary injunction to halt these actions, claiming violations of the Appointments Clause and the separation of powers. \n\nFollowing initial filings and a hearing, the District Court granted the preliminary injunction, finding a likelihood of success on the merits. However, Defendants appealed this decision, and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the injunction pending review. Subsequently, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, challenging the District Court's jurisdiction and arguing that the Plaintiffs' claims are without merit. The court has ordered Defendants to supplement the record with information relevant to the preliminary injunction motion. The case remains ongoing, with both sides actively contesting the legal and factual basis of the Plaintiffs' claims.

The plaintiffs allege that President Trump's Executive Order 14169, issued on January 20, 2025, and subsequent actions by federal agencies, unlawfully froze funding for foreign assistance programs and violated the plaintiffs' rights. These actions, they contend, exceeded the President’s constitutional authority and violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). \n\nThe Executive Order directed a 90-day pause in foreign development assistance, followed by a review of the programs. Subsequently, the State Department and USAID issued directives halting new funding obligations and issuing stop-work orders, ultimately leading to the termination of numerous awards. Plaintiffs argue this constitutes an unlawful impoundment of congressionally appropriated funds.\n\nThe District Court initially granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the defendants from enforcing certain directives related to the freeze. Following a hearing, the court issued a preliminary injunction on February 13, 2025, and subsequently ordered the defendants to make available funds for obligation, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on their constitutional and APA claims.  Defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit.  The district court has also scheduled a hearing on March 6, 2025, to further consider the preliminary injunction motions. The case remains ongoing, with the appellate court reviewing the lower court’s decision regarding the preliminary injunction.",

The lawsuit began in February 2025, alleging that Executive Order 14163, which suspended refugee admissions and processing, along with subsequent funding cuts to resettlement partners, violated the law. The court initially issued a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of the executive order. \n\nFollowing the injunction, the government sought a stay pending appeal, which the Ninth Circuit partially granted, limiting the injunction's scope to refugees who could demonstrate a “strong reliance interest” arising before January 20, 2025.  The District Court then appointed a magistrate judge to assist in determining which refugees met this standard. Subsequently, the government attempted to restrict the number of eligible refugees by invoking Proclamation 10949, but the court found this action inconsistent with the proclamation’s text. The court has continued to monitor the government's compliance with the injunction, ordering status reports and scheduling conferences to address ongoing concerns about the administration of the USRAP and the treatment of refugees awaiting resettlement. The court's most recent order directs the government to resume processing refugees consistent with the injunction and outlines a process for determining individual eligibility.",
    "46065": "This case involves a legal challenge to Executive Orders issued by President Trump that aim to restrict access to gender-affirming care for transgender and gender-diverse individuals. The lawsuit was initially filed by the States of Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota, along with three physician plaintiffs, who allege that the orders violate the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and the separation of powers. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of these orders.\n\nOn February 14, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining Defendants from enforcing certain provisions of the orders. Following this, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, which the court granted on February 28, 2025, extending the restrictions. Subsequently, the court ordered expedited discovery to investigate the factual basis for the challenged orders.\n\nHowever, shortly after this order, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) terminated a research grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital, purportedly due to the Executive Orders. This action prompted the plaintiffs to file a motion for contempt, alleging that the Defendants were violating the court’s orders. The court, in an order issued on March 17, 2025, granted Defendants' motion to stay proceedings while an appeal on the preliminary injunction is pending.  This effectively pauses the case while the appellate court reviews the lower court's decision.",
    "46028": "This case involves a legal challenge to two Executive Orders issued by President Trump regarding medical care for transgender individuals under the age of nineteen. Plaintiffs, including LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations (PFLAG and GLMA) and individual transgender minors and their parents, filed a complaint alleging that the Executive Orders are unlawful and unconstitutional. The first Executive Order, “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” directs federal agencies to avoid promoting \"gender ideology.\" The second, \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" directs agencies to ensure institutions receiving federal research or education grants cease providing gender affirming medical care for minors.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that these orders violate the separation of powers, conflict with existing nondiscrimination laws, and infringe upon the equal protection rights of transgender individuals. Following the filing of the complaint, the court granted a temporary restraining order barring enforcement of the Executive Orders. Defendants appealed this order. Subsequently, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to enforce the preliminary injunction, citing notices issued by HHS agencies that appeared to contradict the court's order.

The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants’ abrupt termination of funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children violates the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA) and constitutes an unlawful action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The Plaintiffs represent organizations that have historically provided legal services to these children. \n\nOn March 26, 2025, the Plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to prevent the Defendants from ceasing funding. Shortly thereafter, on March 27, 2025, they moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The court set a hearing on the matter. On April 1, 2025, the Court granted the Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the Defendants from withdrawing the services or funds related to legal representation. Subsequently, the Defendants moved to dissolve the TRO and for a recusal of the presiding judge. The Court denied the recusal motion, extended the TRO, and scheduled a hearing on the preliminary injunction. On April 29, 2025, the court granted the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, further reinforcing the requirement for continued funding and legal representation.

These programs were established by Congress to address nationwide teacher shortages and improve teacher quality, particularly in underserved communities. In February 2025, the Department abruptly terminated these grants, citing vague “priorities” without providing specific justifications to individual grant recipients.\n\nThe Plaintiff States sought a temporary restraining order and, subsequently, a preliminary injunction to prevent the Department from implementing these terminations and to restore funding to impacted programs. The District Court initially granted a temporary restraining order, and then, following a hearing, issued an order potentially enjoining the terminations. The Department appealed this order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, arguing that the District Court lacked jurisdiction and that the agency's actions were within its authority.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the District Court was presented with claims that a change in policy had occurred and that the termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) due to the Department's failure to provide a transparent and reasoned explanation for its actions. The Supreme Court intervened, granting a petition to vacate the District Court’s order and issuing a per curiam opinion finding that the District Court likely lacked jurisdiction. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s order and stayed its enforcement, pending the Court of Appeals' review. The First Circuit is currently reviewing the case. The case involves complex legal issues concerning agency discretion, administrative procedure, and the authority of the Department of Education to allocate federal funds.

    "46057": "This case concerns a challenge to Executive Order 14183, issued by President Trump on January 27, 2025, which prioritizes military excellence and readiness and effectively bans transgender individuals from serving in the United States military. Seven current service members, along with a prospective enlistee and the Gender Justice League, have filed suit against the President, the Department of Defense, and various Secretaries within the Department, alleging the order and related policies violate their constitutional rights.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that the 2025 Military Ban, which defines a “falsehood” as someone whose gender identity differs from their assigned sex at birth, and directs the Secretary of Defense to implement policies barring transgender service, is discriminatory and lacks a legitimate basis. They contend this policy violates the Equal Protection and First Amendment clauses of the Fifth Amendment and infringes upon their procedural due process rights. The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the ban.\n\nThe government defends the Executive Order, asserting that it is necessary to maintain military readiness, lethality, and unit cohesion. They argue that the policy is rationally related to legitimate government interests and that the military has the professional judgment to determine standards for service. The Department of Defense has issued guidance implementing the Military Ban, requiring service members to adhere to standards consistent with their biological sex and disqualifying those with a history of gender dysphoria unless they meet specific criteria.\n\nFollowing the filing of the complaint, the parties engaged in preliminary motions, including a request for a preliminary injunction by the plaintiffs. The court has requested briefing on the merits of the case and oral argument is scheduled for March 29, 2025.  The government has also sought a stay pending appeal and a stay pending review by the Supreme Court.",
    "45984": "This case concerns a challenge to President Trump’s January 27, 2025, executive order (EO 14183) and related memoranda that restrict transgender individuals from serving in the United States military. Six active-duty service members and two prospective enlistees, who are transgender, filed a lawsuit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the President, the United States, and various Departments of Defense. The plaintiffs allege that the executive order and its implementation violate the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.\n\nThe executive order, which revoked previous policies allowing transgender individuals to serve openly, directs the Secretary of Defense to reverse accession and retention standards and adopt a policy stating that transgender status is incompatible with military readiness. EO 14183 is supported by Executive Order 14168, which defines \"sex\" as an individual’s biological classification at birth and prohibits the recognition of gender identity as a basis for federal law.\n\nPlaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent the enforcement of this policy. Following a hearing, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' renewed application for a preliminary injunction, enjoining Defendants from implementing EO 14183 and related guidance. The Court reasoned that the policy likely violated the Equal Protection Clause and that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm.\n\nThe Defendants have subsequently filed a motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction and for a stay pending appeal. The case is currently pending before the District Court, with the government awaiting a decision on its motion. The court has ordered the parties to submit a joint status report and scheduled a hearing on February 18, 2025, to address the preliminary injunction. The court has also issued an order requiring the government to notify the court and plaintiffs of any actions taken regarding the challenged policies.",
    "45964": "On January 21, 2025, the States of Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon, along with individual plaintiffs, filed a lawsuit in the Western District of Washington challenging President Trump's January 20, 2025, Executive Order, titled \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.\" The executive order sought to limit citizenship to individuals born in the United States whose parents were either U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, potentially denying citizenship to children born to those present in the country temporarily or unlawfully.  The plaintiffs argued that the order violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause.  They immediately requested a temporary restraining order to prevent the order’s implementation.\n\nFollowing a hearing, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction that broadly prohibited the enforcement of the Executive Order. The court reasoned that the States had standing and that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits based on the Fourteenth Amendment’s plain language. The government subsequently appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nDuring the appeal process, the Supreme Court intervened and accepted the case, indicating a need to address the scope of the injunction and the underlying legal questions.  The Ninth Circuit ultimately affirmed the District Court's injunction and dismissed claims from the individual plaintiffs due to their potential mootness. The Supreme Court ultimately held that the universal scope of the injunction was impermissible, leaving open the question of whether a narrower injunction might be appropriate to provide relief to the state plaintiffs. The case remains ongoing, with the Ninth Circuit expected to revisit the scope of the injunction following the Supreme Court's guidance.",
    "45965": "Plaintiffs, comprising CASA, Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, and five individual parents with unborn children, initiated a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland challenging the legality of Executive Order 14,160. This Executive Order purports to restrict birthright citizenship to children born in the United States to parents who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, if the mother was either unlawfully present or temporarily present in the U.S. The plaintiffs allege this order violates the Fourteenth Amendment and the Immigration and Nationality Act. Following a hearing, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction, enjoining the enforcement of the Executive Order nationwide. The government appealed this decision, requesting a stay pending appeal. Initially, both the District Court and the Fourth Circuit denied the stay request. Subsequently, the Supreme Court consolidated the case with similar challenges and granted a partial stay, limiting the injunction’s scope to only those plaintiffs with standing and postponing the effective date of the Executive Order by 30 days. The District Court is now tasked with adjusting the injunction to align with the Supreme Court’s guidance and setting a schedule to address the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims. The Court's subsequent memorandum opinion reinforces the need for the District Court to ensure the injunction comports with the Supreme Court's directive and to expedite the consideration of the plaintiffs’ motion for class-wide relief.",
    "VR-LA-0120": "Plaintiffs, a coalition of civil rights organizations and individual voters, initiated legal action against Louisiana’s Governor, Secretary of State, and Attorney General, challenging aspects of the state’s election laws related to absentee voting and early voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs allege that the existing laws, particularly the requirements for excuses to vote absentee, the witness signature requirement, and the limited timeframe for early voting, create undue burdens on the right to vote, especially for vulnerable populations, and disproportionately impact Black voters.\n\nThe lawsuit, initially filed as separate cases, was consolidated. The defendants subsequently moved to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims, arguing a lack of standing and asserting that the courts should not interfere with election procedures. The plaintiffs argue that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly alters the context of these election laws, making them unconstitutional and infringing on their right to vote. They seek an injunction to modify these procedures to ensure safer and more accessible voting options during the 2020 elections.  On June 22, 2020, the court issued a judgment dismissing the claims with prejudice. The case is now closed.",
    "VR-SC-0078": "This case concerns a legal challenge to South Carolina’s absentee voting laws brought by a group of plaintiffs, including Mary T. Thomas, Nea Richard, Jeremy Rutledge, The Family Unit, Inc., and the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP. The plaintiffs allege that the state’s “excuse requirement” and the requirement for a witness signature on absentee ballots unduly burden the right to vote, violating the Fourteenth Amendment, the Voting Rights Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on April 22, 2020, and quickly attracted interest from various parties. The South Carolina Republican Party, along with Speaker James H. Lucas and President Harvey Peeler, sought to intervene to defend the state's election laws. The court granted these motions to intervene.\n\nThe core of the dispute revolves around whether the challenged provisions place an unreasonable burden on voters, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Plaintiffs argue that these requirements create unnecessary risks and obstacles, while defendants contend that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the electoral process.\n\nAs of August 24, 2020, the court had stayed proceedings in this case after a related case, *DNC v. Bostelmann*, addressed similar issues. The court indicated it would reconsider its order and potentially lift the stay or enter judgment in favor of the defendants and intervenors, recognizing concerns about the timely resolution of the case and the potential impact on the upcoming election.",
    "JC-MD-0017": "This is a civil rights lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Greenbelt Division, by Keith Seth, David Smith, Mario Burch, and John Does 1-5 (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") against Mary Lou McDonough, the Director of the Prince George’s County Department of Corrections (\"Defendant\"). The Plaintiffs, representing themselves and a putative class of similarly situated individuals, allege that the Defendant violated their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights due to inadequate conditions and practices at the Prince George’s County Jail, particularly concerning the facility’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Plaintiffs’ Complaint outlines a situation where the jail has experienced an outbreak of COVID-19, and alleges that the Defendant failed to implement adequate preventative measures, resulting in a heightened risk of infection and inadequate medical treatment for those who contracted the virus. They assert claims for conditions of confinement, over-detention, and the denial of due process.  They also seek injunctive relief to compel the Defendant to improve conditions at the facility.\n\nThe Defendant has filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, arguing that the Plaintiffs’ claims fail to state a valid cause of action and that the Released Plaintiffs’ claims are moot. In a Reply Memorandum to the Motion, the Defendant contends that the Plaintiffs did not exhaust available administrative grievance procedures, and that the allegations regarding the lockdown measures do not establish a violation of constitutional rights. The Defendant also asserts that injunctive relief is inappropriate under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. The case is currently pending before Judge Paula Xinis, and the court has not yet issued a ruling on the Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.\n\n\n\n**Docket Information:**\n\n*   **Case Name:** Seth et al v.

    "IM-FL-0029": "This case concerns a class-action lawsuit filed by a group of detainees held at three ICE detention centers in Florida – Krome, Broward Transitional Center, and Glades County Detention Center – alleging inadequate protection against COVID-19. Petitioners claimed ICE’s response violated their rights, citing failures to follow CDC guidelines, inadequate sanitation, and insufficient medical care. Initially, the detainees sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, including release from detention. Following hearings and supplemental filings, the court initially granted a temporary restraining order and later a preliminary injunction, directing ICE to improve conditions and comply with CDC guidelines. Subsequently, Petitioners filed an emergency motion to compel compliance, highlighting ongoing concerns about cohorting practices and inadequate supplies. After considering the motions and declarations, the Court issued a post-hearing administrative order, clarifying the term \"staff members\" for the purpose of the order and requiring ICE to provide additional information regarding staff responsible for COVID-19 protocols. The Court has indicated it will continue to monitor ICE’s compliance with the order and further proceedings are ongoing."
