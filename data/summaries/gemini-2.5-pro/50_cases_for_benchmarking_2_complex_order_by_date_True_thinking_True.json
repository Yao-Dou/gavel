    "46290": "On March 5, 2025, a recognized student organization at Texas A&M University filed a civil rights lawsuit against the university's Board of Regents, Chancellor, and President in their official capacities. The suit, brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, was initiated after the Board of Regents passed a resolution on February 28, 2025, banning all \"Drag Show Events\" from university venues. The resolution specifically targeted the student organization's sixth annual, student-funded drag show, \"Draggieland,\" which was scheduled to take place in the on-campus Rudder Theatre on March 27, 2025. The Board justified the ban by stating that such shows \"demean[] women,\" promote \"gender ideology,\" and could create a \"hostile environment.\"\n\nRepresented by counsel from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), the student organization alleged that the ban constituted an unconstitutional prior restraint and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The organization sought a temporary restraining order, a preliminary and permanent injunction to block the enforcement of the ban, and a declaratory judgment that the policy was unconstitutional.\n\nThe case was assigned to Senior United States District Judge Lee H. Rosenthal. After expedited briefing and a hearing on the student organization's motion for a preliminary injunction, the court issued a Memorandum and Opinion and an Order of Injunction on March 24, 2025. Judge Rosenthal granted the preliminary injunction, finding the student organization demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. The court ruled that the drag show was expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment and that the Rudder Theatre was a designated public forum. It concluded that the university's ban was an impermissible viewpoint-based restriction, noting that the Board's justification—that the show promoted an ideology with which it disagreed—was \"the kind of viewpoint discrimination proscribed by the Court.\" The court also found the ban was an unconstitutional prior restraint and was unconstitutionally vague.\n\nThe preliminary injunction, effective immediately and lasting until further court order, enjoined the university officials from enforcing the resolution and ordered them to permit the \"Draggieland\" performance to proceed as scheduled. On March 28, 2025, the university officials filed a notice of appeal of the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.",
    "46324": "On March 31, 2025, a nonprofit community development financial institution filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), its Administrator and Acting Deputy Administrator in their official capacities, and Citibank, N.A. The case, brought by private counsel, centers on the EPA's decision to freeze and terminate a $1.87 billion grant awarded to the nonprofit under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF).\n\nThe GGRF was established by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 to fund clean energy and pollution reduction projects. The nonprofit was competitively awarded its grant in April 2024 through the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator program. The funds were legally obligated and deposited into an account held by Citibank, which was designated as the government's financial agent. After receiving the award, the nonprofit selected an initial 108 credit unions as subrecipients.\n\nIn February 2025, the EPA Administrator publicly announced an intent to claw back all GGRF funds. Subsequently, the EPA directed Citibank to freeze the grant funds, preventing the nonprofit from accessing them. On March 11, 2025, the EPA issued a letter formally terminating the grant, citing vague concerns about \"program integrity, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the Agency's priorities.\"\n\nThe lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the EPA's actions are unlawful. The complaint asserts multiple causes of action, including violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (arguing the termination was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law), the Inflation Reduction Act, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, and the Anti-Deficiency Act. The nonprofit also alleges the EPA's actions violate the U.S. Constitution, specifically the separation of powers principles (Legislative Vesting, Spending, and Appropriations Clauses), the Take Care Clause, and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Against Citibank, the nonprofit brought claims for breach of contract, conversion, and replevin for refusing to disburse the funds as instructed.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan. On April 1, 2025, the nonprofit filed for a preliminary injunction and an emergency temporary restraining order (TRO), the latter after discovering the funds had been moved from its account. The TRO motion was withdrawn the next day after the funds were restored, with the transfer being attributed to a routine month-end process. On April 15, 2025, Judge Chutkan consolidated this case with a related case, *Coalition for Green Capital v. Citibank* (1:25-cv-00698), which was designated as the lead case. Consequently, on April 16, 2025, the motion for a preliminary injunction was denied as moot in light of a ruling in the lead case.",
    "46391": "On April 11, 2025, five international students and recent graduates on F-1 visas filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the President of the United States and senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The students, represented by private counsel, alleged that the federal government unlawfully terminated their records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS).\n\nThe lawsuit was initiated after the government, between April 4 and April 8, 2025, terminated each student’s SEVIS record, citing the reason as \"Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked.\" The students contend that their respective histories—which include minor misdemeanor convictions, arrests that resulted in dismissed charges or no charges being filed, and a prior non-criminal deportation that was waived—do not constitute a legal basis for termination of status under federal regulations. They argued that the government's actions were an attempt to circumvent the law and coerce them into leaving the country.\n\nThe students brought their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to vacate the SEVIS terminations, restore their F-1 status, and prevent the government from taking any enforcement action against them, such as arrest or deportation.\n\nInitially assigned to Judge Noël Wise, the case saw immediate action when the students filed for a temporary restraining order (TRO). On April 17, 2025, Judge Wise granted the TRO, enjoining the government for 14 days from arresting the students or giving any legal effect to the SEVIS terminations. The case was subsequently found to be related to several similar lawsuits and was reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White for coordinated proceedings.\n\nFollowing a hearing on April 25, 2025, Judge White extended the TRO. After further briefing, he granted the students' motion for a preliminary injunction on May 22, 2025, maintaining the protections against enforcement actions while the case proceeds. On July 21, 2025, the government defendants filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging the preliminary injunction. The government later filed a motion in the district court to stay the injunction pending the outcome of the appeal, which the court ruled on after a hearing.",
    "46509": "On April 29, 2025, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), its Board of Directors, and three individual board members filed a lawsuit against the President of the United States and various executive branch officials and offices. The suit was prompted by an April 28, 2025, email from the White House Presidential Personnel Office purporting to immediately terminate the three individual plaintiffs from their positions on the CPB board.\n\nRepresented by private counsel from Saul Ewing LLP, the plaintiffs alleged that the President's action was illegal and unconstitutional. The complaint argued that the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 established the CPB as a private, nonprofit corporation deliberately insulated from executive control to prevent political interference. Citing the Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and constitutional principles of separation of powers, the plaintiffs contended that the President has no authority to remove CPB board members. They sought a declaratory judgment that the terminations were legally void and an injunction to prevent the administration from interfering with CPB’s governance and operations. The complaint also referenced a recent case involving the U.S. Institute of Peace as context for what it described as a pattern of unlawful executive action.\n\nFiled in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the case was assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss. The plaintiffs immediately moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO). At a subsequent hearing, the parties agreed to treat the TRO motion as a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn June 8, 2025, Judge Moss issued a memorandum opinion and order denying the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The judge found that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or a likelihood of irreparable harm. On the merits, the court noted that the Public Broadcasting Act subjects the CPB to the D.C. Nonprofit Corporation Act, which permits the appointing authority (here, the President) to remove a director unless the corporation's bylaws provide otherwise. At the time of the terminations, the CPB’s bylaws did not contain such a restriction. Regarding irreparable harm, the court found that the CPB could continue to function, as the two remaining board members constituted a quorum and the corporation's bylaws provided a mechanism to form a \"designated body\" to act if the board fell below the statutory minimum number of members.\n\nFollowing the ruling, two of the three individual board member plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims in July and August 2025. The remaining parties filed a joint motion to set a briefing schedule for expedited summary judgment, and the case is proceeding on the merits.",
    "46590": "On April 7, 2025, a coal miner filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of himself and all other miners with evidence of pneumoconiosis (\"black lung\" disease) against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary. The plaintiffs are represented by a combination of private and non-profit legal services counsel.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges the agency's effective shutdown of two programs mandated by the federal Mine Safety and Health Act: the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP), which provides health screening for miners, and the \"Part 90\" program, which grants miners diagnosed with black lung the right to transfer to jobs with lower dust exposure. The plaintiffs allege that on April 1, 2025, HHS abruptly terminated or placed on administrative leave nearly all employees of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Respiratory Health Division responsible for administering these programs. This action, the plaintiffs claim, left them unable to access the life-saving job transfer rights designed to prevent the progression of their occupational lung disease.\n\nThe suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia and assigned to Judge Irene C. Berger. The plaintiffs asserted that the agency's actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to its mandatory statutory duties under 30 U.S.C. § 843. They also alleged a violation of their property interests in the health programs without notice or an opportunity to be heard, contrary to the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to compel HHS to restore the NIOSH division and resume the suspended programs.\n\nShortly after filing an amended complaint, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction. After a hearing on May 7, 2025, Judge Berger issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order on May 13, 2025, granting the preliminary injunction. The court found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims and would suffer irreparable harm from continued dust exposure without the programs.\n\nThe preliminary injunction ordered HHS to rescind the employee terminations (Reductions in Force), fully restore the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division and its programs, and ensure no gap in the services mandated by Congress for miner health and safety. The court ordered the HHS Secretary to certify compliance within 20 days. The defendants filed the required certification of compliance on June 2, 2025. The case remains ongoing.",
    "46605": "On May 17, 2025, a Venezuelan citizen detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The suit, brought by private counsel, named the U.S. government and various federal officials as defendants.\n\nThe case challenges the President’s March 2025 executive order, Proclamation No. 10903, which invoked the Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. §§ 21 et seq.) to authorize the immediate apprehension and removal of Venezuelan citizens aged 14 or older who are alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The named plaintiff, an asylum applicant and vocal dissident of the Venezuelan government, was arrested during a scheduled ICE check-in and detained, allegedly because his tattoos were suspected of indicating gang affiliation. The lawsuit sought a writ of habeas corpus as well as declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent removals under the proclamation without adequate due process, citing the U.S. Constitution and related statutes.\n\nOn the same day the suit was filed, the plaintiff moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and class certification. On May 19, 2025, Judge John W. Holcomb granted the TRO in part, temporarily enjoining the government from removing the plaintiff or any putative class members under the proclamation.\n\nAfter briefing and a hearing, the court issued a preliminary injunction on June 2, 2025. The injunction prohibits the government from removing or transferring any class members out of the judicial district pursuant to the proclamation, pending further court order. The court also formally certified a class consisting of all noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California who were, are, or will be subject to the proclamation. The court's reasoning relied heavily on two recent Supreme Court decisions, *Trump v. J.G.G.*, 145 S. Ct. 1003 (2025), and *A.A.R.P. v. Trump*, 2025 WL 1417281 (S. Ct. May 16, 2025), which affirmed that detainees subject to the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.\n\nSubsequently, after an immigration judge granted the named plaintiff asylum in a separate proceeding, he remained in ICE custody. He filed an ex parte application for a writ of habeas corpus seeking his immediate release. On June 20, 2025, Judge Holcomb denied the application, finding that federal law permitted the government to continue his detention while it appealed the asylum grant.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the U.S. government filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging the district court's preliminary injunction order.",
    "46635": "On May 22, 2025, the Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the President of the United States, the Executive Office of the President, two White House personnel officials, and the two individuals the President purported to install as the acting Librarian of Congress and acting Register of Copyrights. The plaintiff is represented by private counsel and the non-profit organization Democracy Forward Foundation.\n\nThe case arose after the President fired the Librarian of Congress on May 8, 2025, and then purported to terminate the plaintiff from her position as Register of Copyrights on May 10, 2025. The President then appointed the Deputy Attorney General to serve as acting Librarian of Congress, who in turn named another Department of Justice official as acting Register of Copyrights.\n\nThe plaintiff's lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that her removal and the new appointments were unlawful. The complaint alleges that the President’s actions were *ultra vires* (beyond his legal authority) and violated the U.S. Constitution's Appointments Clause and the principle of separation of powers. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act does not authorize the President to appoint an acting Librarian of Congress because the Library is not an \"Executive agency.\" Furthermore, she argues that under 17 U.S.C. § 701(a), only a lawfully appointed Librarian of Congress—not the President—has the authority to remove the Register of Copyrights.\n\nContemporaneously with the complaint, the plaintiff filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). On May 28, 2025, after a hearing, Judge Timothy J. Kelly denied the TRO motion. The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on June 10, 2025. In a memorandum opinion and order issued on July 30, 2025, Judge Kelly denied the preliminary injunction, reasoning that the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that she would suffer irreparable harm without the relief, a necessary requirement for an injunction in government personnel cases.\n\nOn July 31, 2025, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concerning the denial of the preliminary injunction. She then moved the district court for an injunction pending that appeal. On August 20, 2025, Judge Kelly denied this motion as well, again finding a failure to show irreparable harm. While the appeal is pending, proceedings on the merits of the case have continued in the district court, with a schedule set for the parties to file cross-motions for summary judgment.",
    "45143": "On April 20, 2023, the parents of a student in Sweetwater County School District No. 1 filed a lawsuit against the district's Board of Trustees and several individual administrators. One of the parents is also a teacher employed by the district. The parents, represented by a private law firm and the Child & Parental Rights Campaign, alleged that the school district maintained a policy of allowing students to adopt a gender identity and use preferred names and pronouns at school without parental consent. They claimed this policy required staff to conceal this information from parents, even directing them to use a student's legal name in parental communications while using the preferred name at school.\n\nThe lawsuit was prompted by the parents' discovery that their daughter, a student with a history of trauma and mental health issues, had been treated as a boy and called by a male name at school for over six months without their knowledge. The parents sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages. The suit was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging the district's policy violated their fundamental parental rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and their rights under the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause. The parent-teacher also brought claims for compelled speech and violation of her free exercise rights under the First Amendment.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Scott W. Skavdahl. On June 30, 2023, the court granted in part the parents' motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering that, absent a reasonable concern of physical abuse, the district could not prevent employees from responding to a parent's inquiry about their child's requested name or pronoun, nor could it require an employee to lie to a parent about it.\n\nAfter the parents filed an amended complaint on July 20, 2023, the school district filed a motion to dismiss. On December 18, 2023, the court granted the motion in part, dismissing the parent-teacher's free speech claim and the parents' requests for injunctive and declaratory relief regarding their parental rights claims. However, the court allowed the parents' claims for monetary damages for the alleged violation of their parental rights and the parent-teacher's free exercise claim to proceed.\n\nFollowing discovery, the school district moved for summary judgment on all remaining claims. On April 28, 2025, the court granted the motion in its entirety, entering a final judgment in favor of the school district and dismissing the case. The parents filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on May 23, 2025.",
    "PH-IL-0002": "On May 10, 2016, current and former residents of the Alexander County Housing Authority (ACHA) filed a class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois against the housing authority and several of its past executive directors. The residents were represented by private counsel and attorneys from the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that the ACHA engaged in systemic racial and familial status discrimination. The residents claimed the ACHA intentionally segregated its public housing by race, allowing the predominantly African-American developments, McBride and Elmwood, to deteriorate into nearly uninhabitable conditions with severe pest and rodent infestations, mold, and plumbing deficiencies. In contrast, the predominantly white developments were allegedly well-maintained and provided with security. The complaint also asserted that the ACHA unlawfully prohibited families with children from living in certain developments to perpetuate segregation. A separate claim alleged that the ACHA systematically overcharged residents for rent in violation of federal law.\n\nThe residents’ claims were based on the federal Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3604), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Illinois Civil Rights Act, and the Brooke Amendment to the U.S. Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 1437a), brought via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to end the discriminatory practices, as well as monetary damages for rent overcharges and other injuries.\n\nThe case was assigned to Chief Judge Michael J. Reagan. On February 13, 2017, the residents filed a Third Amended Complaint, which added numerous plaintiffs but removed the rent overcharge claims. Instead, it added state-law claims for breach of contract, negligence, and willful and wanton conduct related to the ACHA's failure to maintain the properties in a safe and sanitary condition.\n\nThe represented parties reached a settlement, and on July 27, 2017, filed a stipulation to dismiss the case with prejudice, with each party bearing its own attorneys' fees and costs. The terms of the settlement were not included in the court record. Three plaintiffs were not part of the settlement, and their counsel was permitted to withdraw. After these three individuals failed to respond to court orders or appear for hearings to prosecute their claims, the court dismissed their cases. On September 12, 2017, Judge Reagan issued a final order approving the stipulated dismissal for the settling parties, dismissing the remaining plaintiff's claims, and closing the case.",
    "16518": "On April 14, 2022, the United States, through the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, filed a lawsuit against the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ). The complaint alleged a pattern or practice of conduct that violated the constitutional rights of incarcerated youth at the Broad River Road Complex (BRRC), the state's long-term juvenile commitment facility.\n\nThe lawsuit was based on a multi-year investigation that concluded in two findings reports issued in February 2020 and April 2022. The investigation found reasonable cause to believe that conditions at BRRC violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, the United States alleged that the DJJ failed to protect youth from frequent and serious youth-on-youth violence and from excessive force by staff, which included choking, punching, and breaking a youth’s arm. The investigation also found that the DJJ unconstitutionally subjected youth to prolonged and punitive isolation for minor misbehaviors, confining them for 23 hours a day in small, dark cells without meaningful education or programming. These failures were attributed to inadequate staffing, poor video surveillance, a failure to train staff in de-escalation, and deficient internal investigation practices. The United States sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.\n\nSimultaneously with the complaint, the parties filed a comprehensive settlement agreement to resolve the allegations. The case was assigned to Judge Mary Geiger Lewis. Under the terms of the settlement, the DJJ agreed to implement sweeping reforms over a five-year period, with the court retaining jurisdiction to enforce compliance. Key terms of the agreement require the DJJ to:\n*   Conduct a staffing study and improve video surveillance to eliminate blind spots.\n*   Revise its use-of-force policies to emphasize de-escalation and limit force to situations of immediate danger.\n*   Overhaul its investigation process to ensure all allegations of harm are promptly and thoroughly reviewed.\n*   Eliminate the use of isolation for punishment, protective custody, or suicide intervention, and limit its use to short-term responses to behavior that poses a serious and immediate danger.\n*   Develop a positive behavior management system and provide enhanced staff training.\n*   Establish a quality assurance system to track data on violence, force, and isolation to correct systemic deficiencies.\n\nTo oversee implementation, the agreement established a jointly selected, independent Subject Matter Expert to provide technical assistance and report on the DJJ's compliance every six months. On April 20, 2022, Judge Lewis granted the parties' joint motion and entered a judgment dismissing the case without prejudice, subject to reinstatement if the DJJ materially breaches the settlement agreement.",
    "46815": "On May 21, 2025, the United States government filed a two-count indictment against an individual defendant, charging him with conspiracy to unlawfully transport aliens for financial gain and the illegal transportation of aliens for financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324. The charges stemmed in part from a November 30, 2022, traffic stop in Tennessee. The case was initiated shortly after the defendant's court-ordered return to the U.S. from El Salvador, a situation detailed in a related Supreme Court case, *Noem v. Abrego Garcia*, 145 S. Ct. 1017 (2025).\n\nFollowing the defendant's arrest on June 6, 2025, the government moved for his pretrial detention. The defendant was initially represented by the Federal Public Defender and later by private counsel. After an evidentiary hearing on June 13, 2025, Magistrate Judge Barbara D. Holmes issued a memorandum opinion on June 22, 2025, denying the government's motion. She ruled that the government had failed to prove that a detention hearing was authorized under the Bail Reform Act, finding no sufficient evidence of a minor victim, a serious risk of flight, or a serious risk of obstruction of justice.\n\nThe government immediately appealed the release order to the District Court. After conducting a de novo review and holding a new evidentiary hearing on July 16, 2025, District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. issued a memorandum opinion on July 23, 2025, denying the government's appeal and affirming the defendant's release. The District Judge disagreed with the Magistrate Judge on a key point of law, finding that the government had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the case \"involves a minor victim\" under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(1)(E), thus authorizing a detention hearing. However, after weighing the statutory factors under § 3142(g), Judge Crenshaw concluded that the government had not shown that no condition or combination of conditions could reasonably assure the defendant's appearance and the safety of the community.\n\nAn order formalizing the conditions of the defendant's pretrial release was issued on August 22, 2025. Subsequently, on August 19, 2025, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for vindictive and selective prosecution. A jury trial has been scheduled for January 27, 2026.",
    "46755": "On July 1, 2025, three cities (Columbus, Baltimore, and Chicago), a national network of small businesses, and an organization of physicians filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. Represented by counsel from a non-profit legal foundation, they challenged a new federal regulation issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability\" rule (the 2025 Rule) violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs claim the rule is contrary to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and arbitrary and capricious because it erects numerous barriers to obtaining and maintaining affordable health insurance, undermining the ACA's core purpose. The challenged provisions include imposing a $5 monthly surcharge on certain low-income enrollees, allowing insurers to deny new coverage to individuals with past-due premiums, and implementing stricter verification requirements that would cause eligible individuals to lose subsidized coverage. The plaintiffs argued these changes would increase the number of uninsured residents, leading to greater uncompensated care costs for the cities and economic hardship for the small businesses and patients of the physicians. They sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction to vacate and prevent the implementation of the rule.\n\nThe plaintiffs immediately filed a motion for a stay or preliminary injunction to block the rule's effective date of August 25, 2025. On August 22, 2025, Judge Brendan A. Hurson granted the motion in part and denied it in part. In a detailed memorandum opinion, the court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their challenges to seven of the rule's provisions.\n\nThe court determined that three provisions were contrary to law because the agency lacked statutory authority to implement them:\n1.  The $5 monthly surcharge on certain automatically re-enrolled individuals, which improperly altered the ACA's statutory formula for tax credits.\n2.  The policy allowing insurers to deny new coverage to applicants with past-due premiums, which created an exception to the ACA’s \"guaranteed issue\" requirement that Congress did not authorize.\n3.  The provision making enrollees ineligible for advance premium tax credits for failing to reconcile prior-year credits, which added an eligibility condition not present in the statute.\n\nThe court found four other provisions were likely arbitrary and capricious because the agency failed to provide a rational explanation, relied on flawed data, or did not meaningfully respond to public comments. These included changes that would reduce the value of insurance plans (actuarial value), impose new verification burdens for Special Enrollment Periods, and require heightened income verification based on questionable assumptions about fraud. The court's reasoning was informed by a similar, prior case involving the same city plaintiffs, *City of Columbus v. Cochran*, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731 (D. Md. 2021).\n\nHowever, Judge Hurson declined to stay two provisions: a change to the premium adjustment percentage methodology and the elimination of an automatic 60-day extension for resolving income inconsistencies. The court found the agency had provided a reasoned explanation for the former and appeared to correctly interpret its limited statutory authority regarding the latter.\n\nAn order issued on August 25, 2025, formally stayed the effective dates of the seven challenged provisions nationwide, pending a final ruling on the merits of the case.",
    "46576": "On April 10, 2025, a coalition of sixteen states, the District of Columbia, and the Governor of Pennsylvania, represented by their respective State Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and its Secretary. The case centers on the administration of federal Education Stabilization Funds (ESF) appropriated by Congress to help K-12 schools address the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe factual basis of the complaint is that after awarding the funds, the Department of Education (ED) granted the plaintiff states extensions to liquidate, or draw down, the funds for pre-committed projects, with most deadlines pushed to March 2026. However, on March 28, 2025, ED sent a letter abruptly and retroactively rescinding all previously approved extensions. The letter stated that because the pandemic had ended, extending the deadlines was \"not consistent with the Department's priorities.\" The states argued this sudden reversal caused chaos, jeopardizing ongoing projects such as HVAC upgrades, tutoring programs, and services for homeless youth, for which they had relied on the extensions to budget and enter into contracts.\n\nThe states sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the rescission was a final agency action that was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The case was assigned to Judge Edgardo Ramos in the Southern District of New York.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, Judge Ramos granted the states' motion for a preliminary injunction, prohibiting ED from enforcing the March 28 rescission letter and requiring the agency to provide at least 14 days' notice before any future modification to the liquidation periods. In response, on May 11, 2025, ED issued a new letter terminating the extensions effective May 25, 2025. The states immediately sought further injunctive relief. On June 3, 2025, the court granted a second, broader preliminary injunction that barred enforcement of both the March 28 and May 11 letters, increased the required notice period for future changes to 30 days, and ordered ED to process the states' payment requests \"without delay.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education appealed the June 3 injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal. The government argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act because the case was fundamentally a claim for money against the U.S., and that its decision to rescind the extensions was a lawful exercise of agency discretion.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit denied the motion for a stay. The majority found that the district court likely had jurisdiction because the suit challenged a regulatory action rather than a contractual obligation to pay money. The court also held that the government was unlikely to succeed on the merits, reasoning that the blanket rescission appeared arbitrary and capricious and failed to seriously consider the states' significant reliance interests. One judge dissented, arguing the district court likely lacked jurisdiction and that the agency's actions were reasonable. On August 11, 2025, the Second Circuit issued a mandate indicating that the parties had stipulated to withdraw the appeal.",
    "46637": "On May 27, 2025, a national, nonprofit media organization (National Public Radio, Inc.) and three of its local member public radio stations in Colorado filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit challenges Executive Order 14290, titled \"Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,\" which was issued by the President on May 1, 2025. The case was assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by private counsel against the President, several executive branch officials and their agencies (including the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of the Treasury, and the National Endowment for the Arts), and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which was named as a defendant to ensure complete relief. The factual basis of the case is the Executive Order, which directs the CPB to cease all direct and indirect federal funding to the media organization and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The Order also directs all federal agencies to terminate any funding to the two entities, citing the President’s view that their news coverage is not \"fair, accurate, or unbiased.\" The plaintiffs allege this action is unconstitutional retaliation for their journalism, pointing to public statements by the President criticizing their content as \"left-wing propaganda.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the Executive Order is unlawful and a permanent injunction to block its enforcement. Their complaint asserts that the Order exceeds the President's statutory and constitutional authority. They argue it directly violates the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which created the CPB as a private entity and expressly prohibits any U.S. government officer or agency from exercising \"direction, supervision, or control over\" the CPB or its grantees. The plaintiffs also allege violations of their constitutional rights under the First Amendment's Free Speech, Press, and Association Clauses (for viewpoint discrimination and retaliation) and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n\nThe case is connected to other litigation, including *Corporation for Public Broadcasting v. Trump* (2025 WL 1617191), which challenges the President's attempt to remove members of the CPB's board of directors.\n\nAs of late July 2025, the case is at the summary judgment stage. The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on June 13, 2025. The federal defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on July 12, 2025, arguing that the plaintiffs' claims are not ripe for review because the CPB has not complied with the Order and the plaintiffs have not suffered a concrete loss of funding. On the merits, the government contends that when it acts as a patron subsidizing speech, it has broad discretion to choose which activities to fund, and therefore the Order does not violate the First Amendment. The government also argues that federal grants do not constitute a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause. The plaintiffs filed their reply on July 25, 2025, countering that the Order is causing an ongoing and irreparable chilling effect on their First Amendment rights, making the case ripe for review, and that viewpoint-based funding restrictions are unconstitutional when the government's aim is to facilitate private speech rather than convey its own message.",
    "46340": "On April 3, 2025, six federal employee unions filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the President of the United States, numerous federal departments and agencies, and their respective heads. The suit, brought by private and in-house union counsel, challenges Executive Order 14251, which was issued on March 27, 2025. The Order used presidential authority under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1)) to exclude a large number of federal employees from collective bargaining rights, citing national security concerns.\n\nThe unions allege that the Order was not a legitimate exercise of national security authority but was an unconstitutional act of retaliation for their protected First Amendment activities, such as filing lawsuits and publicly criticizing the administration's agenda. They point to a White House Fact Sheet issued with the Order that condemned \"hostile Federal unions\" and stated the President \"supports constructive partnerships with unions who work with him.\" The lawsuit claims the Order violates the First Amendment's protections for speech and petitioning, as well as the Fifth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The unions also argue the action was *ultra vires*, exceeding the President's statutory authority. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the Order's implementation.\n\nThe unions filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, which the court converted into a motion for a preliminary injunction. On June 24, 2025, Judge James Donato granted a preliminary injunction (2025 WL 1755442), finding that the unions had raised \"serious questions\" on the merits of their First Amendment retaliation claim. The injunction prohibited the defendant agencies from implementing or enforcing the Executive Order against the unions and their members pending further court proceedings.\n\nThe federal government appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit granted the government's emergency motion to stay the district court's injunction pending the outcome of the appeal.",
    "46805": "On July 21, 2025, a coalition of over twenty non-profit organizations that provide services to domestic and sexual violence survivors and homeless populations filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The defendants are the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), along with their respective Secretaries and the heads of several sub-agencies, sued in their official capacities. The plaintiffs are represented by a combination of private law firms and public interest organizations, including the Democracy Forward Foundation, the National Women’s Law Center, and cooperating counsel from the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges new conditions the federal agencies began imposing on grant agreements following a series of 2025 presidential executive orders. These conditions require grant recipients to certify that they will not use grant funds to promote \"gender ideology\" or \"elective abortions,\" and that they do not operate any programs advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) that violate federal anti-discrimination laws. The conditions also compel grantees to agree that their compliance with these terms is \"material\" for the purposes of the False Claims Act, exposing them to potentially severe civil and criminal liability.\n\nThe non-profit organizations allege that these new requirements are unauthorized by Congress, unconstitutionally vague, and violate their First Amendment free speech rights and Fifth Amendment due process rights. They argue the conditions force them into an impossible choice: either accept the terms and risk ruinous liability while compromising their missions to serve vulnerable communities, or reject the essential federal funding they rely on to operate. The plaintiffs' causes of action are based on the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)—alleging the agency actions are in excess of statutory authority, contrary to law, and arbitrary and capricious—as well as direct violations of the Constitution's separation of powers, Spending Clause, First Amendment, and Fifth Amendment. They seek a declaratory judgment that the conditions are unlawful and an injunction preventing their enforcement.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Melissa R. DuBose. Concurrently with their complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). On July 28, 2025, Judge DuBose granted the motion, finding the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and would suffer irreparable harm. The initial TRO enjoined HUD from enforcing four challenged conditions on certain Continuum of Care grants and enjoined HHS's Administration for Children and Families (ACF) from enforcing its anti-DEI certification requirement on certain Family Violence Prevention Services Act (FVPSA) grants. The court subsequently granted motions to amend the TRO on August 7, 2025, expanding its scope to cover additional plaintiffs and grant types, including HUD's Community Development Block Grants.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on August 4, 2025, seeking to broaden the relief to cover all challenged agency policies. The TRO remains in effect pending a hearing on that motion, which is scheduled for September 4, 2025.",
    "46375": "On April 9, 2025, a non-profit organization with a long history of advancing educational equity in the southern United States filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education, its Secretary, and the President of the United States. The case, filed by private counsel in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, centers on the Department’s abrupt termination of a five-year, $8.6 million federal grant. The grant, awarded to the non-profit in 2022 and authorized under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, funded the operation of an Equity Assistance Center for the southern region (EAC-South) to provide technical assistance to school districts working to comply with desegregation mandates.\n\nThe factual basis for the suit arose after a new presidential administration took office in January 2025 and issued executive orders targeting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs. On February 13, 2025, the Department terminated the non-profit's grant mid-budget period. The Department issued a boilerplate letter, also sent to other grantees, stating the grant was inconsistent with new Department priorities and supported prohibited DEI initiatives, forcing EAC-South to cease all operations.\n\nThe non-profit sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, alleging the termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being arbitrary and capricious, failed to follow statutory due process procedures under the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA), constituted an unlawful impoundment of Congressionally-appropriated funds, and violated the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe non-profit moved for a preliminary injunction to reinstate the grant. On May 21, 2025, Judge Paul L. Friedman granted the motion. In the accompanying opinion, the court found the non-profit was likely to succeed on its APA claim, reasoning that the Department’s use of a boilerplate termination letter demonstrated a failure to provide a satisfactory explanation for its decision or a rational connection between any facts and the choice made. The court also found the non-profit would suffer irreparable harm to its operations, reputation, and mission.\n\nThe court's order, issued the same day, required the Department to reinstate the grant award within five business days, reimburse the non-profit for outstanding expenses incurred since the termination, and enjoined the Department from terminating the grant again in the same unlawful manner pending a final resolution of the case. On July 18, 2025, the government defendants filed a notice of appeal of the preliminary injunction order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.",
    "46284": "On March 24, 2025, a lawful permanent resident and student at Columbia University filed a lawsuit and petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The student sued the President of the United States and other high-ranking federal officials in their official capacities, including the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The student is represented by a coalition of private, legal services, and non-profit counsel.\n\nThe case arose after the student was arrested by New York City police and charged with a misdemeanor for obstruction of governmental administration while participating in a campus protest on March 5, 2025. The protest concerned the university's disciplinary actions against students involved in advocacy for Palestinian rights. Days later, federal agents sought to locate the student, and her counsel was informed that her lawful permanent resident status was being revoked and that an administrative arrest warrant had been issued.\n\nThe student alleges that the government's actions are part of a broader, unlawful policy to use immigration enforcement to retaliate against noncitizens for their protected speech, specifically for expressing views critical of U.S. and Israeli government policies. The lawsuit claims these actions violate her rights under the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent her arrest, detention, and deportation.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald. On March 25, 2025, the day after the initial filing, the court granted the student's motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the federal government from detaining or transferring her. The government subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the case. After briefing and oral argument, on June 5, 2025, Judge Buchwald granted the student's motion for a preliminary injunction, extending the prohibitions against her arrest and detention pending further court order. The court also largely denied the government's motion to dismiss.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, the federal government filed a notice of interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, challenging the preliminary injunction order. The district court has since stayed discovery pending the outcome of the appeal.",
    "46735": "On June 20, 2025, a New Mexico school district filed a lawsuit against the President of the United States, the U.S. Secretary of Education, and the U.S. Department of Education. The school district, represented by private counsel, sought to reverse the federal government's termination of a $6 million, five-year mental health grant awarded under the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.\n\nThe lawsuit's factual basis stems from a series of executive orders issued by the new presidential administration aimed at eliminating Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Following these orders, the Department of Education issued a \"Dear Colleague Letter\" threatening the loss of federal funding for schools pursuing ambiguously defined DEI programs. On April 29, 2025, the Department terminated the school district's grant, stating the mental health programs reflected the prior administration's priorities and were not in the best interest of the government.\n\nThe school district alleged that the termination was an unlawful final agency action that was arbitrary, capricious, and exceeded the Department's statutory authority in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The complaint also raised constitutional claims, arguing the government's actions violated the First Amendment's guarantees of free speech, the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause due to vagueness, and Congress's authority under the Spending Clause. The district sought a declaratory judgment that the termination was unlawful and an injunction to reinstate the funding. The district detailed the significant, positive impact the grant had on student mental health and school safety and the irreparable harm its termination would cause.\n\nShortly after filing the complaint, the school district moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent the loss of funding while the case proceeded.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, Senior U.S. District Judge William P. Johnson issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order denying the motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissing the case. The court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Judge Johnson found that the \"essence\" of the lawsuit was a contract dispute seeking more than $10,000 from the federal government. Under the Tucker Act, exclusive jurisdiction for such claims lies with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, not a federal district court. The court noted that the school district could not circumvent this jurisdictional limit by framing its monetary claim as one for equitable or constitutional relief. The case was dismissed without prejudice, allowing the school district the option to refile its suit in the appropriate court.",
    "46342": "On April 4, 2025, two nonprofit education research and policy organizations, represented by Public Citizen Litigation Group, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and its Secretary. The suit was a response to a series of actions taken by the Department in February and March 2025 that the plaintiffs alleged were intended to dismantle the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), the Department's semi-independent research arm. These actions included the mass cancellation of contracts for statutorily mandated research studies, a reduction-in-force that eliminated approximately 90% of IES staff, and the termination of remote access to restricted research data.\n\nThe plaintiffs, who rely on IES data for their work, argued that these actions were an unlawful attempt to terminate a congressionally mandated agency. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the U.S. Constitution, claiming the Department's actions were contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and a violation of the separation of powers.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Trevor N. McFadden of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. A related case, *National Academy of Education, et al. v. Department of Education, et al.*, No. 25-cv-01266, was filed and considered alongside this one. The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to halt the Department's actions.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, Judge McFadden denied the motion for a preliminary injunction. In a memorandum opinion, the court ruled that the lawsuit was an impermissible \"programmatic challenge\" under the APA. Citing *Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed'n*, the judge found that the plaintiffs were attempting to gain wholesale judicial oversight of the agency's day-to-day operations rather than challenging specific, discrete, and final agency actions. The court concluded that such broad challenges to agency programs must be addressed by Congress or the executive branch, not the courts.\n\nIn response to the court's ruling, the plaintiffs amended their complaint twice, on June 18 and July 16, 2025. The Second Amended Complaint significantly narrowed the scope of the lawsuit, abandoning the broad \"dismantling\" claim and instead challenging six specific program terminations as arbitrary and capricious or contrary to law. These include the termination of several longitudinal studies and the agency's peer review program for new grants. One plaintiff also brings a claim of unreasonable delay regarding the agency's failure to process its requests to publish research. A motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint is pending.",
    "46322": "On March 31, 2025, a coalition of non-profit organizations representing Latino citizens, military families, and students filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the legality of Executive Order 14248, \"Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,\" which had been issued on March 25, 2025. The case was consolidated with two similar lawsuits filed by other non-partisan advocacy groups and by the Democratic National Committee and its affiliates. The plaintiffs, represented by private non-profit legal organizations including the Campaign Legal Center, named the Executive Office of the President, several federal agencies (including the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), Department of Justice, and Department of Defense), and the heads of those agencies as defendants.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the President exceeded his constitutional authority and violated federal statutes, including the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). The plaintiffs contend that the Constitution's Elections and Electors Clauses grant the power to regulate federal elections to Congress and the states, not the President. The challenged provisions of the executive order included directives to: require documentary proof of citizenship (DPOC) on the national mail voter registration form (Section 2(a)); require federal agencies to \"assess citizenship\" before providing registration forms to public assistance recipients (Section 2(d)); direct the Attorney General to take action against states that count mail-in ballots received after Election Day (Section 7(a)); and instruct the EAC to withhold federal funds from states that do not comply with the order's ballot receipt deadline (Section 7(b)). The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgments that these provisions are unlawful and preliminary and permanent injunctions to block their implementation.\n\nThe plaintiffs in all three consolidated cases filed motions for a preliminary injunction. On April 24, 2025, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly issued a memorandum opinion and order partially granting the motions. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the President acted beyond his authority with respect to Sections 2(a) and 2(d). The court issued a preliminary injunction that:\n1.  Prohibits the EAC, its commissioners, and its executive director from taking any action to implement Section 2(a) of the order, specifically barring them from modifying the national mail voter registration form to require documentary proof of citizenship based on the executive order.\n2.  Prohibits the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Interior, and the Small Business Administration, along with their respective secretaries, from implementing Section 2(d) by requiring them to provide voter registration forms without first assessing an applicant's citizenship.\n\nThe court denied injunctive relief for the other challenged provisions—related to data sharing, Attorney General enforcement, and the withholding of funds—finding that those challenges were premature or not properly brought by these plaintiffs.\n\nFollowing the ruling, the Republican National Committee was granted permission to intervene in the case as a defendant. The parties have since filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment, which are currently pending before the court.",

Represented by private counsel and civil rights organizations, including the ACLU, the plaintiffs allege that the executive branch is unlawfully dismantling the congressionally-mandated Head Start program.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges a series of recent actions by the federal government. The plaintiffs allege that on April 1, 2025, HHS abruptly closed half of its regional Head Start offices and laid off the majority of their staff, creating widespread chaos and crippling the administration of grants and support for local agencies. This has resulted in extreme delays in funding approvals and access to funds, forcing one Washington-based Head Start agency to suspend services for 400 children and lay off 70 staff members.\n\nAdditionally, the suit targets a March 14, 2025, letter and an April 16, 2025, grant certification requirement that collectively ban federal funding for any programs that \"promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives\" or \"advance or promote DEI, DEIA [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility], or discriminatory equity ideology.\" The plaintiffs contend these directives are unconstitutionally vague and directly conflict with their statutory obligations under the Head Start Act and the Rehabilitation Act to serve diverse populations, including children with disabilities, dual-language learners, and families from various cultural backgrounds.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert that these actions violate the constitutional separation of powers and the Spending Clause by usurping Congress's authority to fund and define the program. They also bring claims under the First Amendment (for chilling protected speech), the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (for vagueness), the Administrative Procedure Act (for being arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the dismantling of Head Start and to enjoin enforcement of the DEIA ban.\n\nThe case is assigned to Judge Ricardo S. Martinez. After filing an amended complaint on May 13, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on May 16, 2025. On July 21, 2025, they also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). Following an oral argument on August 5, 2025, the court issued an order on August 8, 2025, declaring the TRO motion moot based on a stipulation by the defendants. The court converted the TRO motion to a preliminary injunction motion and scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing for September 9, 2025.",
    "46734": "On May 29, 2025, Roman Catholic archbishops, bishops, and priests in Washington filed a federal lawsuit against the Governor, Attorney General, and all county prosecuting attorneys of Washington. The suit challenges Washington Senate Bill 5375, a law set to take effect on July 27, 2025, that amends the state's mandatory child abuse and neglect reporting statute (RCW § 26.44.030). The new law designates clergy as mandatory reporters and eliminates the priest-penitent privilege for communications concerning suspected abuse, including those made during the Sacrament of Confession.\n\nThe plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and religious liberty legal services organizations, argue the law forces priests into an impossible choice: either violate the sacred and inviolable \"sacramental seal\" of confession, a core tenet of their faith that results in automatic excommunication, or face criminal prosecution and civil liability under state law. The lawsuit, brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleges that the law violates the First Amendment's Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The complaint notes that while the new law targets clergy, a separate bill passed in the same session (SHB 1171) expanded reporting exemptions for university-affiliated attorneys. The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the law is unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against its enforcement.\n\nOn June 23, 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice moved to intervene as a plaintiff, arguing that the law violates the Equal Protection Clause by infringing on the fundamental right to free exercise of religion. The court granted the motion on July 15, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the law from taking effect. On July 15, 2025, all defendant county prosecutors stipulated to be bound by a preliminary injunction, and the case was stayed as to them. Following a hearing, Judge David G. Estudillo granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on July 18, 2025. The court found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Free Exercise Clause claim because SB 5375 is not a neutral and generally applicable law. The ruling highlighted that the law treats religious activity less favorably than comparable secular activity, particularly given the simultaneous passage of SHB 1171, which expanded privileges for attorneys. The order temporarily enjoins the Governor and Attorney General from enforcing the law against the plaintiffs and all Roman Catholic priests under their administration with respect to information learned during the Sacrament of Confession.\n\nThe court has identified a related case filed by the Orthodox Church in America (*Orthodox Church in America et al v. Ferguson et al*, 2:25-cv-01537) and has ordered the parties to show cause why the two cases should not be consolidated.",
    "46678": "On June 9, 2025, the Governor of California and the State of California, represented by the California Attorney General's Office, filed a lawsuit against the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and the U.S. Department of Defense. The suit sought declaratory and injunctive relief to challenge the federalization of the California National Guard.\n\nThe case arose after federal immigration enforcement raids in Los Angeles on June 6, 2025, led to public protests. While the state contended that local and state law enforcement had the situation under control, the President issued a memorandum on June 7, 2025, invoking 10 U.S.C. § 12406 to call 4,000 members of the California National Guard into federal service for 60 days. The President asserted that the protests constituted a \"rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States\" and hindered the execution of federal laws. The Department of Defense subsequently issued orders to the Adjutant General of California, bypassing the Governor, and also deployed approximately 700 active-duty U.S. Marines to Los Angeles.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the President's actions were unlawful (ultra vires) and violated the Tenth Amendment. They claimed that none of the statutory conditions for invoking § 12406—invasion, rebellion, or inability to execute federal laws with regular forces—were met. They further alleged a procedural violation, as the statute requires that such orders \"shall be issued through the governors of the States,\" which did not occur. The federal government, represented by the U.S. Department of Justice, countered that the protests were violent riots that local authorities could not control, and that the President's decision to deploy troops to protect federal personnel and property was a non-justiciable exercise of executive discretion.\n\nOn June 10, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). On June 12, 2025, Judge Charles R. Breyer of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted the TRO. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims, reasoning that the statutory conditions for federalization were not met and that the President had failed to follow the required procedure of issuing the order through the Governor. The TRO enjoined the federal government from deploying the Guard members and ordered their control returned to the Governor.\n\nThe defendants immediately appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and sought an emergency stay of the TRO. On June 19, 2025, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit granted the stay pending appeal. The appellate court found that the defendants had made a strong showing of likely success on the merits. It reasoned that, under a highly deferential standard of review, the President likely had a colorable basis to invoke the statute due to an inability to execute federal laws with regular forces. The panel also found that the procedural requirement was likely satisfied by sending the order to California's Adjutant General.\n\nFollowing the appellate court's stay, the case proceeded in the district court. After further briefing and discovery, a three-day bench trial was held before Judge Breyer from August 11 to August 13, 2025. The case was then taken under submission for post-trial briefing.",
    "46287": "On March 25, 2025, two national labor unions representing university faculty, the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers, filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York. The suit was brought against several U.S. federal departments—including the Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services—and their officials. The case was handled by private counsel.\n\nThe lawsuit was a response to actions taken by the federal government against Columbia University. Following the creation of a multi-agency task force to combat antisemitism on college campuses, the government announced an investigation into Columbia. Shortly thereafter, on March 7, 2025, the government announced the \"immediate cancellation of approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University.\" Subsequently, on March 13, 2025, the government sent a letter to the university demanding sweeping institutional changes—including placing an academic department into receivership and reforming admissions—as a \"precondition for formal negotiations regarding Columbia University’s continued financial relationship with the United States government.\"\n\nThe unions alleged that these actions were an unlawful attempt to coerce the university into policing free speech and academic inquiry. Their complaint asserted that the government's actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to follow the mandatory procedural requirements for terminating federal funding under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The unions also brought claims for violations of their members' constitutional rights under the First Amendment (freedom of speech and academic freedom), Fifth Amendment (Due Process), and Tenth Amendment, as well as for violations of the separation of powers doctrine. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to reinstate the terminated funding and prevent future unlawful terminations, as well as monetary damages.\n\nOn April 3, 2025, the unions filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to compel the government to restore the funding. The government opposed the motion, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction because the unions did not have legal standing to sue, as the grants and contracts were with Columbia University, not the unions or their members. The government also contended that the funding terminations were not Title VI enforcement actions but were lawful, discretionary decisions made under the terms of the grants and contracts, which permit termination if an award \"no longer effectuates ... agency priorities\" or \"for the convenience of the Government.\"\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil issued an opinion and order that denied the motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed the case without prejudice. The court ruled that the unions lacked standing to bring the lawsuit. Judge Vyskocil reasoned that the grants and contracts were awarded to Columbia University, which was not a party to the case, and therefore the unions could not enforce the university's contractual rights. The court also found that any alleged injuries to the union members, such as chilled speech or loss of research opportunities, were not fairly traceable to the government's actions because the independent decisions of Columbia—including its pre-existing plans for campus reforms and its choice to cover some lost salaries—broke the chain of causation.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on June 16, 2025.",

The suit challenges the federal government's suspension of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, a $5 billion initiative established by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to fund the nationwide deployment of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the defendants' actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers doctrine. The states argue that following a January 20, 2025, executive order, the FHWA unlawfully implemented a directive to pause the program. In a letter dated February 6, 2025, the FHWA rescinded all program guidance, retroactively revoked all previously approved state implementation plans, and prohibited states from obligating their congressionally appropriated formula funds. The states claim this action constitutes an illegal impoundment of funds and has caused irreparable harm by halting ongoing infrastructure projects, disrupting state planning and budgeting, and jeopardizing private-sector partnerships. The states seek declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the defendants to release the funds and reinstate their approved plans.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, a group of public interest and environmental organizations, represented by counsel from Earthjustice and other legal services groups, moved to intervene in the case as plaintiffs. The court granted their motion on July 23, 2025.\n\nThe case is before Judge Tana Lin in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. On June 24, 2025, Judge Lin granted in part the states' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found the states were likely to succeed on their claims that the administration acted in excess of its statutory authority, was arbitrary and capricious, and violated the separation of powers. The order enjoins the defendants from suspending the approved plans and withholding NEVI funds from fourteen of the plaintiff states, restoring their access to the program. The injunction was denied for the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont because they had not submitted evidence of irreparable harm. The injunction became effective on July 2, 2025, and remains in place pending further orders. The case is ongoing, with the parties having filed cross-motions for summary judgment.",
    "46259": "On March 13, 2025, eight students from Columbia University and Barnard College filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The students, represented by private counsel and attorneys from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), are proceeding under pseudonyms.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that federal government actors are unconstitutionally coercing the university to suppress and punish students for speech and activism critical of Israel and supportive of Palestinian rights. The case centers on a First Amendment \"jawboning\" theory, arguing that government officials are indirectly chilling protected speech by pressuring the university. The students seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages for records already produced. The case is assigned to Judge Arun Subramanian.\n\nInitially, the complaint targeted the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce and its Chairman. The students sought to block the university from complying with a February 13, 2025, letter from the Committee demanding student disciplinary records related to eleven pro-Palestinian campus protests. The complaint also included a breach of contract claim against the university, alleging it violated its own promises of free expression.\n\nThe lawsuit was amended on March 19, 2025, to add several high-ranking executive branch officials as defendants. This amendment followed actions by a federal inter-agency task force, which threatened to and subsequently did cancel or pause approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts with the university. In a March 13, 2025, letter, these agencies demanded that the university, as a precondition for restoring funding, implement specific measures, including harsher discipline for protestors, placing the Middle East studies department under \"academic receivership,\" banning masks on campus, and centralizing disciplinary authority.\n\nThe students filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to halt the university's compliance with these demands. On April 4, 2025, Judge Subramanian denied the motion without prejudice, finding that the plaintiffs had not yet sufficiently established standing or irreparable harm for such broad relief. However, the judge ordered the university to provide 30 days' notice to the court and the plaintiffs before furnishing any further student records to Congress. The court also granted the students leave to file a second amended complaint, which they did on April 18, 2025, further detailing their claims against all defendants.\n\nOn May 23, 2025, all three groups of defendants—the university, the congressional defendants, and the executive branch officials—filed motions to dismiss the second amended complaint. The congressional defendants argue they are immune from suit under the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause. The other defendants raise defenses including lack of state action and failure to plausibly allege coercion. On June 18, 2025, the students voluntarily dismissed their claims against the executive branch officials in their individual capacities, while maintaining the suit against them in their official capacities. Briefing on the motions to dismiss and a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction by the plaintiffs is ongoing.",
    "46557": "On May 5, 2025, nineteen states and the District of Columbia, represented by their respective Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), its Secretary, and the heads of several of its sub-agencies. The case was assigned to Judge Melissa R. DuBose.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges a March 27, 2025 directive issued by the HHS Secretary to \"Make America Healthy Again.\" This directive initiated a significant restructuring of the department, including the termination of 10,000 employees, the consolidation of twenty-eight divisions into fifteen, and the closure of five of the ten regional offices. The plaintiff states allege that this action was an unlawful attempt to dismantle the department, preventing it from fulfilling hundreds of functions mandated by Congress. These functions include disease surveillance at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), worker safety research at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), tobacco control at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), maternal and child health data collection, and the administration of programs like Head Start.\n\nThe states' legal claims are based on the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing the directive was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. They also allege the action violates the U.S. Constitution's Separation of Powers doctrine and Appropriations Clause, and that the defendants acted outside the scope of their statutory authority (*ultra vires*). The states seek declaratory judgments that the directive is unlawful and injunctive relief to halt its implementation.\n\nOn May 9, 2025, the plaintiff states filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to block the terminations and restructuring at specific HHS components, including the CDC, the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, the Office of Head Start, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.\n\nOn July 1, 2025, Judge DuBose granted the preliminary injunction. The court found that the states were likely to succeed on their APA claims because the directive appeared to be arbitrary and capricious—lacking a reasoned explanation and failing to consider consequences—and contrary to law, as it made it functionally impossible for HHS to comply with its statutory mandates and congressional appropriations. The court's order enjoined the defendants from executing existing reduction-in-force (RIF) notices, issuing new ones, or placing additional employees on administrative leave within the targeted agencies and programs.\n\nThe defendants subsequently moved to vacate the injunction or obtain a stay pending appeal, both of which the court denied on July 18, 2025. On August 12, 2025, following cross-motions for clarification, the court issued a revised order specifying the exact sub-agencies and divisions covered by the injunction. These included several components within the CDC (such as NIOSH, the Division of Reproductive Health, and the Office on Smoking and Health) and the specific division responsible for calculating the Federal Poverty Guidelines.\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the defendants filed a notice of appeal of the injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. A motion to dismiss the case remains pending in the district court.",
    "46511": "On April 29, 2025, a coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia, represented by their Attorneys General and Governors' offices, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against the federal agency AmeriCorps and its interim head. The suit followed a series of actions taken by the agency in April 2025 to dismantle its operations, which the states alleged were unlawful.\n\nThe complaint states that, at the direction of the administration's \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE), AmeriCorps abruptly ordered all members of its National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) to cease service pending termination, placed 85% of its staff on administrative leave ahead of a large-scale reduction in force, and terminated approximately $400 million in grants supporting over 1,000 service programs nationwide. Grantees were instructed to immediately cease all member activities, with the agency stating the awards \"no longer effectuate agency priorities.\"\n\nThe states sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as they were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and undertaken without legally required procedures. Specifically, they argued the agency violated a provision in its annual appropriations act requiring it to use public notice-and-comment rulemaking for any \"significant changes to program requirements, service delivery or policy.\" The states also raised constitutional claims, arguing the agency's actions usurped Congress's power of the purse in violation of the separation of powers.\n\nThe states filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to halt the dismantling of the agency. On June 5, 2025, Judge Deborah L. Boardman issued an opinion and order granting the motion in part. The court found the states were likely to succeed on their claim that AmeriCorps violated the notice-and-comment requirement in its appropriations act, concluding that the mass termination of programs and removal of NCCC members constituted \"significant changes to... service delivery\" that could not be made without public rulemaking. However, the court denied the request to enjoin the agency's staff reductions, finding the states lacked legal standing to challenge those internal personnel decisions.\n\nThe court's preliminary injunction, issued June 5, 2025, enjoined AmeriCorps from enforcing the termination of grants and the removal of members in the plaintiff states. It ordered the agency to reinstate the terminated grants and return AmeriCorps, VISTA, and NCCC members to service. Following a subsequent U.S. Supreme Court decision in a related case (*Trump v. CASA*), the parties jointly moved to modify the injunction. On July 10, 2025, the court issued a modified order narrowing one provision to require AmeriCorps to comply with the notice-and-comment rule only for changes that harm the plaintiff states. The injunction remains in effect pending further court proceedings.",
    "46350": "On April 7, 2025, the American Library Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, filed a lawsuit against the President of the United States, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), its Acting Director, and other federal officials. The suit, brought by private counsel, challenges the administration's efforts to dismantle IMLS following a March 14, 2025, Executive Order that declared the agency \"unnecessary.\" The plaintiffs allege that in the weeks following the order, the administration terminated nearly all IMLS staff, fired the agency's advisory board, and began canceling congressionally mandated grants essential for library services nationwide.\n\nThe complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants' actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the constitutional separation of powers, the Take Care Clause of Article II, and the First Amendment. The plaintiffs argue that only Congress can abolish a statutorily created agency and that the defendants are unlawfully withholding appropriated funds and preventing IMLS from fulfilling its legal duties under the Museum and Library Services Act.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Richard J. Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to halt the dismantling of the agency. After a hearing on April 30, 2025, the court converted the motion into one for a temporary restraining order (TRO). On May 1, 2025, Judge Leon issued a limited TRO that prevented the defendants from terminating additional grants or staff but did not require the reinstatement of those already terminated.\n\nThe defendants moved for reconsideration, citing new, persuasive authority from the D.C. Circuit in a similar case, *Widakuswara v. Lake*, which suggested that district courts likely lack jurisdiction over such matters. After the TRO expired, Judge Leon issued a memorandum opinion on June 6, 2025, denying the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction without prejudice. The court reasoned that recent Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit decisions created substantial questions as to whether jurisdiction properly lies with the district court or exclusively with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. This jurisdictional uncertainty prevented the plaintiffs from demonstrating the substantial likelihood of success on the merits required for an injunction. Following the ruling, the parties began negotiating a schedule for the defendants to file a motion to dismiss.",
    "46746": "On June 27, 2025, two environmental non-profit organizations, represented by counsel from Earthjustice and other private firms, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The suit was brought against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (USDHS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM), and Miami-Dade County. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the construction and operation of a mass detention facility for up to 5,000 noncitizens, dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. The site is located within the ecologically sensitive Big Cypress National Preserve. The complaint alleged that the project, a \"major federal action\" due to substantial federal funding and control, was proceeding without the required environmental impact reviews in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida later joined the case as an intervenor-plaintiff.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams. After a multi-day evidentiary hearing began in August 2025, the court on August 7 issued a 14-day temporary restraining order (TRO) that prohibited further construction or site expansion. The TRO was issued mid-hearing after the plaintiffs raised concerns that construction would continue during a recess and the defendants declined to agree to a pause.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, Judge Williams issued an omnibus order that denied the state and federal defendants' motions to dismiss for improper venue and granted a preliminary injunction. The court found that the project constituted a \"major federal action\" subject to NEPA due to substantial federal control and responsibility, evidenced by federal requests for the facility, promises of full federal funding, and federal supervision of the facility's immigration functions through 287(g) agreements. The court ruled that the government's failure to conduct any environmental review was a final, reviewable agency action under the APA and that the project was likely to cause irreparable environmental harm.\n\nThe preliminary injunction prohibits the defendants from bringing any new detainees to the site and from engaging in any further site expansion, including paving, fencing, or installing new lighting or buildings. The order also mandates that within 60 days, the defendants must remove temporary fencing, industrial-style lighting, generators, and waste receptacles installed for the project.\n\nThe state and federal defendants filed notices of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (Case No. 25-12873). On August 26, 2025, they filed an emergency motion with the appellate court to stay the preliminary injunction pending the appeal, arguing that venue was improper, the project was not a major federal action, and the injunction harms the public interest in immigration enforcement. The district court had previously denied the defendants' motion for a stay on August 27, 2025. A related case concerning conditions at the facility, *C.M. v. Noem*, is also pending in the Southern District of Florida.",
    "46388": "On April 11, 2025, two faculty associations filed a lawsuit against multiple federal executive departments, agencies, and their senior officials, challenging the government's actions concerning federal funding for Harvard University. The plaintiffs were later joined by a union representing graduate students and other academic workers at the university. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs allege that the administration is unlawfully misusing its federal funding and civil rights enforcement authority to undermine academic freedom and free speech.\n\nThe case stems from a multi-agency \"Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism\" which, on March 31, 2025, announced a \"comprehensive review\" of billions of dollars in federal grants and contracts with Harvard University, citing unspecified failures to address antisemitism. On April 3, the task force sent a letter demanding that Harvard implement a list of \"non-exhaustive\" preconditions to continue receiving federal funds. These demands included sweeping changes to university governance, leadership, academic programs, admissions, hiring, and student discipline, as well as the shuttering of all Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs. An even more extreme set of demands followed in another letter on April 11.\n\nAfter Harvard rejected these demands in a letter on April 14, 2025, the administration announced hours later that it was freezing over $2 billion in federal funding to the university. In May 2025, multiple federal agencies—including the Department of Education, National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, and others—sent formal letters terminating all active federal grants to Harvard, citing the university's refusal to implement the previously demanded reforms.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that these actions are a pretext to impose the administration's political views and punish disfavored speech. Their lawsuit is based on the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the U.S. Constitution. They argue the defendants' actions are arbitrary, capricious, and procedurally unlawful for failing to follow the mandatory requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which govern the termination of federal funds for civil rights noncompliance and require formal findings, an opportunity for a hearing, and an attempt to secure voluntary compliance. The plaintiffs also allege violations of their members' constitutional rights, including the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech and academic freedom (through coercion, viewpoint discrimination, and retaliation) and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. They seek a declaratory judgment that the government's actions are unlawful and an injunction to halt the funding terminations and prevent future coercive actions.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Allison D. Burroughs in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs initially filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order but withdrew it. The complaint was amended twice, first to add the academic workers' union as a plaintiff and again to add more federal agencies as defendants after they formally terminated their grants. On June 2, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. The government filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on June 16, 2025. A hearing on the motions was held on July 21, 2025, and the matter was taken under advisement. A related case, *President & Fellows of Harvard Coll. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs.* (1:25-cv-11048), was filed by Harvard University itself.",
    "46625": "On May 21, 2025, five non-profit organizations that administer community violence intervention, victim support, and other public safety programs filed a class action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), its Office of Justice Programs (OJP), and top officials. The suit, brought by counsel from Democracy Forward Foundation and Perry Law, followed the DOJ's abrupt termination of over 370 multi-year grants in April 2025, totaling more than $820 million. The government's stated reason, provided in identical notices to all grantees, was that the awards \"no longer effectuate[] the program goals or agency priorities.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the mass terminations were unlawful and caused irreparable harm to their operations and the vulnerable communities they serve. Their complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming the government's actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. They also raised constitutional claims, alleging violations of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and principles of separation of powers under the Spending, Appropriations, and Take Care Clauses.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction and class certification. In response, the government filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the lawsuit was fundamentally a contract dispute seeking monetary relief, which falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims per the Tucker Act.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, Judge Mehta granted the government's motion to dismiss. While describing the grant terminations as \"shameful\" and \"unquestionably arbitrary, at least in lay terms,\" the court concluded it lacked the power to grant relief. The judge ruled that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the APA claims, agreeing they were essentially contract claims that belonged in the Court of Federal Claims. The court dismissed the constitutional claims on the merits, finding that the grant agreements did not create a constitutionally protected property interest necessary for a due process claim and that the complaint did not plausibly allege the government was unlawfully impounding funds. The motions for a preliminary injunction and class certification were denied as moot.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit on July 8, 2025, and subsequently moved for an injunction pending appeal in the district court. On July 21, 2025, Judge Mehta denied the plaintiffs' request to reinstate the grants but, based on the parties' agreement, issued a limited injunction prohibiting the DOJ from re-obligating the funds from the five named plaintiffs' terminated grants. This order was set to expire on October 1, 2025, and was intended to preserve the status quo while the appeal proceeds.",
    "46387": "On April 11, 2025, the private law firm Susman Godfrey LLP filed a lawsuit against the United States, numerous federal executive branch agencies, and their respective heads in their official capacities. The suit challenged Executive Order 14,263, issued by the President on April 9, 2025, which was titled \"Addressing Risks from Susman Godfrey.\" The firm alleged the Order was unconstitutional retaliation for its legal advocacy, particularly its representation of clients in matters adverse to the President's political interests, such as litigation defending the integrity of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe challenged Order accused the law firm of \"egregious conduct,\" including \"weaponiz[ing] the American legal system,\" and directed federal agencies to take punitive actions. These actions included suspending the security clearances of all firm employees, requiring government contractors to disclose any business with the firm, directing agencies to terminate contracts involving the firm's services, restricting firm employees' access to federal buildings and their engagement with federal officials, and barring federal agencies from hiring the firm's employees.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the law firm sought a declaratory judgment that the Order was unconstitutional and a permanent injunction to prevent its implementation. The complaint alleged that the Order violated the First Amendment's protections for speech, association, and the right to petition; the Fifth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses; and constitutional separation of powers principles. The case was assigned to Judge Loren L. AliKhan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint noted that similar executive orders targeting other law firms, such as Perkins Coie LLP and WilmerHale LLP, had also been challenged in court.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, the law firm filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). Following a hearing the next day, Judge AliKhan granted the motion, temporarily enjoining the government from implementing or enforcing key sections of the Order. On April 16, 2025, by agreement of the parties, the court extended this injunction to remain in effect until a final judgment was entered.\n\nThe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and dismissal on April 23, 2025. On June 27, 2025, the court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting the law firm's motion for summary judgment and denying the government's motion to dismiss. The court declared the entire Executive Order unconstitutional, null, and void. A permanent injunction was issued, prohibiting all defendants and their agents from implementing, enforcing, or giving any effect to the Order. The decree specifically directed the government to rescind any guidance related to the Order, cease any related security clearance reviews or other investigations, and reverse any actions already taken pursuant to it. The government filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on August 22, 2025.",
    "46245": "On March 18, 2025, the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), its purportedly removed acting president, and several of its presidentially-appointed board members filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sued the President of the United States and various executive branch officials and entities, including a new office called the \"U.S. DOGE Service.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was precipitated by a February 19, 2025, Executive Order that declared USIP \"unnecessary.\" Following the order, the President terminated all of USIP's presidentially-appointed board members. The plaintiffs alleged this action was unlawful because it did not comply with the specific removal procedures outlined in the United States Institute of Peace Act (22 U.S.C. § 4605(f)), the statute that established USIP as an \"independent nonprofit corporation.\" After the terminations, the remaining *ex officio* board members—the Secretaries of State and Defense and the president of the National Defense University—voted to remove USIP's acting president and install a replacement. Under this new leadership, the administration began to dismantle the Institute, firing nearly all of its staff, seizing its headquarters, and initiating the transfer of its building and financial assets to the General Services Administration (GSA). The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt this process, arguing it was an illegal takeover that violated the USIP Act and the separation of powers. The defendants countered that the statutory removal restrictions were an unconstitutional infringement on the President's executive power under Article II of the Constitution, making the terminations lawful.\n\nThe plaintiffs' initial emergency motion for a temporary restraining order was denied. The case proceeded on an expedited basis to cross-motions for summary judgment before Judge Beryl A. Howell. On May 19, 2025, Judge Howell granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs (2025 WL 1428641). The court ruled that the statutory removal protections were constitutional because USIP is not part of the Executive branch and does not exercise executive power. Alternatively, the court found that even if USIP were an Executive branch entity, it fit the exception for multi-member expert boards that do not wield substantial executive power. The court issued an order declaring the removals of the board members and the acting president unlawful, null, and void. It also voided all subsequent actions taken by the new leadership, including the appointment of new presidents and the transfer of USIP's assets. The court's decree ordered the plaintiffs reinstated to their positions and enjoined the defendants from trespassing on or exercising control over USIP's property and resources.\n\nThe government immediately appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and filed an emergency motion to stay the district court's order pending the appeal. On June 27, 2025, a three-judge motions panel of the D.C. Circuit granted the stay. The panel found that the government was likely to succeed on the merits, reasoning that USIP exercises \"substantial executive power\" through its activities in foreign affairs, making the statutory removal restrictions likely unconstitutional. The plaintiffs' subsequent petition for rehearing en banc of the stay order was denied by the full court on July 24, 2025. As a result, the district court's order is paused, and the administration's leadership remains in control of USIP while the appeal proceeds on the merits.",
    "46274": "On March 8, 2025, a nonprofit financial institution filed a lawsuit against a national bank (Citibank), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the EPA Administrator. The case was later consolidated with similar lawsuits filed by other nonprofit grant recipients and state-level green banks. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, were recipients of billions of dollars in grants from the EPA’s National Clean Investment Fund, a program created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to finance clean energy projects.\n\nThe lawsuit's factual basis stems from a dispute over access to these grant funds. Under the program's structure, the awarded funds were held in accounts at Citibank, governed by an Account Control Agreement (ACA) among each recipient, the EPA, and the bank. The ACA required Citibank to disburse funds upon a recipient's request unless the EPA formally issued a \"Notice of Exclusive Control,\" an action permitted only under specific conditions such as substantial noncompliance or fraud. Beginning in mid-February 2025, after a new EPA Administrator took office and publicly expressed hostility toward the grant program, Citibank began refusing to honor the plaintiffs' disbursement requests, stating it was awaiting guidance from the EPA, even though no Notice of Exclusive Control had been issued.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that Citibank was in breach of contract and that the EPA's actions constituted an unlawful de facto suspension of their grants. The claims were brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Appropriations Clause.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Shortly after the initial plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), the EPA formally terminated the grants on March 11, 2025. The plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended complaint to challenge the legality of the termination itself, arguing it was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, Judge Chutkan granted a TRO, finding the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims and would suffer irreparable harm, including threats to their existence, without relief. The TRO enjoined the EPA from giving effect to the termination and prohibited Citibank from transferring the funds out of the plaintiffs' accounts, thereby preserving the status quo pending further proceedings. After extending the TRO twice, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on April 15, 2025. The preliminary injunction largely mirrored the terms of the TRO but also ordered Citibank to disburse funds that had been properly incurred before the freeze began in mid-February.\n\nOn April 16, 2025, the EPA and Citibank filed notices of appeal of the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. An amicus curiae brief was later filed in the appeal in support of the grant recipients, arguing that the EPA's stated intent to re-obligate the funds is legally impossible because the statutory appropriation authority expired on September 30, 2024.",
    "46142": "On February 19, 2025, three nonprofit civil rights and advocacy organizations—the National Urban League, the National Fair Housing Alliance, and the AIDS Foundation of Chicago—filed a lawsuit against the President of the United States and multiple federal agencies and their leaders. Represented by legal services organizations and private counsel, the plaintiffs challenged three executive orders issued in January 2025 that broadly targeted diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) initiatives and what the orders termed \"gender ideology.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the executive orders are unconstitutional and exceed presidential authority. The plaintiffs claimed the orders violate the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause by chilling their speech and discriminating against their viewpoints, and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause by being impermissibly vague and violating equal protection principles. The factual basis for the case is that the orders, through vague and sweeping directives, threaten to terminate the federal grants and contracts that are essential to the plaintiffs' missions of serving marginalized communities, including people of color, women, and LGBTQ individuals. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to block the enforcement of the orders. The case was assigned to Judge Timothy J. Kelly.\n\nShortly after filing, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on February 28, 2025. While the motion was pending, a nonprofit organization named Do No Harm, which opposes DEI programs, moved to intervene in the case as a defendant on March 5, 2025. The court denied the motion to intervene on March 12, 2025, finding that the organization had not shown its interests would be inadequately represented by the government defendants, but permitted it to participate as an amicus curiae (friend of the court).\n\nOn May 2, 2025, Judge Kelly issued a memorandum opinion and order denying the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their facial challenge to the orders. For several of the challenged provisions, the court concluded that the plaintiffs likely lacked standing because the provisions were internal government directives that did not inflict a concrete injury. For the remaining provisions, the court reasoned that the constitutional claims were unlikely to prevail because the government is not required to subsidize the exercise of constitutional rights, and the Constitution does not grant a right to violate federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\nFollowing the court's ruling, one of the original plaintiffs, the National Fair Housing Alliance, voluntarily dismissed its claims on June 27, 2025. The remaining two plaintiffs filed a First Amended and Supplemental Complaint on June 30, 2025. The amended complaint added more specific, as-applied allegations of harm, including the Environmental Protection Agency's termination of a $500,000 grant to the National Urban League and directives from federal agencies requiring the AIDS Foundation of Chicago to remove references to gender identity from its program materials. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on August 8, 2025. The case is connected to *National Council of Nonprofits v. OMB*, No. 1:25-CV-00239 (D.D.C.).",
    "46110": "On February 12, 2025, a coalition of five federal employee unions, represented by their own general counsel and private counsel, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the President of the United States and the heads of several federal agencies. The suit challenges three Executive Branch actions aimed at significantly reducing the federal civilian workforce.\n\nThe first action was a \"deferred resignation program\" announced by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on January 28, 2025, which invited federal employees to resign by a certain date in exchange for continued pay and benefits through September 30, 2025. The second was an OPM-coordinated directive, beginning January 20, 2025, for agencies to review and terminate probationary employees, which the unions allege led to mass firings. The third was Executive Order 14210, issued on February 11, 2025, which directed agencies to prepare for large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), prioritizing employees who are typically not designated as \"essential\" during a government shutdown.\n\nThe unions' complaint alleges that these actions, taken together, violate the constitutional principle of separation of powers by usurping Congress's authority to create, fund, and set the mission for federal agencies. The complaint also brings a cause of action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing that the implementation of the RIFs and firings violates federal law (5 U.S.C. § 3502) and regulations (5 C.F.R. Part 351) by proceeding for an improper purpose and without following the required procedures for competitive areas and employee retention factors. The unions sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt these workforce reduction measures.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Christopher R. Cooper. The unions immediately filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction. After expedited briefing and a hearing, the court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order on February 20, 2025, denying the motion. Judge Cooper found that the court likely lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the unions' claims. The opinion reasoned that the lawsuit presented a federal labor-management dispute that Congress intended to be channeled through the exclusive administrative review scheme of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). Under this scheme, claims must first be brought before the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), with subsequent judicial review available only in the courts of appeals, not in a district court.\n\nFollowing the denial of preliminary relief, the unions have twice amended their complaint to add new factual developments and defendants. The government has filed motions to dismiss, reiterating its argument that the court lacks jurisdiction under the FSLMRS channeling doctrine and also arguing that the unions lack standing and have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The case is currently proceeding on the defendants' motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint.",
    "46098": "On February 11, 2025, a coalition of non-profits, small businesses, and professional associations that implement U.S. foreign assistance programs filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, named the President, the Secretary of State, other high-level federal officials, the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as defendants.\n\nThe lawsuit was a direct response to Executive Order 14,169, issued on January 20, 2025, which ordered an immediate \"pause\" on all foreign assistance funding, which the order described as \"antithetical to American values.\" Following the executive order, the defendant agencies issued directives halting all obligations and disbursements, issuing stop-work orders for existing awards, and initiating a review of all programs. The plaintiffs alleged that this wholesale freeze of congressionally appropriated funds, including payments for work already completed, caused them immediate and irreparable harm, forcing them to lay off thousands of employees and cease critical humanitarian operations.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging the defendants’ actions were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and violated federal law, including the Impoundment Control Act, the Anti-Deficiency Act, and the 2024 Appropriations Act. They also brought constitutional claims, arguing the executive actions usurped Congress's exclusive spending power in violation of the separation of powers. An amended complaint later added a claim for violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n\nThe case, consolidated with a similar case, *AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. United States Department of State*, was assigned to Judge Amir H. Ali. On February 11, 2025, the plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary injunction. After a hearing, Judge Ali granted a TRO in part on February 13, 2025, enjoining the agency defendants from implementing the funding freeze on awards that existed as of January 19, 2025. Following disputes over non-compliance, the court issued several enforcement orders, one of which was unsuccessfully appealed by the government to the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court.\n\nOn March 10, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction. The injunction ordered the defendants to make payments for work completed prior to February 13, 2025, and enjoined them from unlawfully impounding funds from the 2024 Appropriations Act, requiring them to make the full amount available for obligation. The government appealed this preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on April 1, 2025.\n\nOn August 13, 2025, the D.C. Circuit vacated the portion of the preliminary injunction related to the impoundment of funds. The appellate court held that the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to enforce the Impoundment Control Act, reasoning that the statute's specific enforcement mechanism—a suit brought by the Comptroller General—impliedly precluded judicial review under the APA. The court further held that the plaintiffs' constitutional separation-of-powers claims were, in essence, claims that the President violated a statute, which under *Dalton v. Specter*, do not give rise to a separate constitutional cause of action. The case was remanded for further proceedings on the remaining issues, including the defendants' pending motion to dismiss the amended complaint.",
    "46090": "On February 9, 2025, a federal employees' union filed a lawsuit against the Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the agency itself. The suit was later joined by other plaintiffs, including consumer advocacy groups, another employee association, and an individual consumer. Represented by private counsel and public interest groups, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to stop what they characterized as an unlawful effort by the new presidential administration to dismantle the CFPB.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that a series of actions taken by the Acting Director—including issuing a bureau-wide stop-work order, terminating all probationary and term employees, initiating a large-scale Reduction in Force (RIF), canceling hundreds of contracts, and declining future funding—violated constitutional separation of powers principles and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs also claimed the Acting Director's appointment was unlawful under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, rendering his actions ultra vires.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. On February 13, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). The following day, the court converted the TRO motion into a motion for a preliminary injunction and entered a consent order temporarily halting terminations, RIF notices, and the transfer of agency funds. After a two-day evidentiary hearing in March, Judge Jackson granted a preliminary injunction on March 28, 2025. In a detailed memorandum opinion, the court found that the defendants were engaged in a \"concerted, expedited effort to shut the agency down entirely\" in violation of the law. The injunction ordered the defendants to, among other things, reinstate terminated employees, cease all terminations and RIFs, rescind the stop-work order, provide employees with the means to work, and continue the statutorily mandated functions of the Office of Consumer Response.\n\nThe defendants immediately appealed the injunction to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and sought a stay. On April 11, 2025, the appellate court partially stayed the injunction, permitting the CFPB to terminate employees or issue RIF notices if it determined, after a \"particularized assessment,\" that the employees were unnecessary for performing the agency's statutory duties. Days later, on April 17, the CFPB issued RIF notices to approximately 90% of its workforce. The plaintiffs moved for an order to show cause, and on April 18, Judge Jackson issued an order suspending the RIF, finding cause to believe the defendants were violating the injunction. After the defendants appealed this new order, the D.C. Circuit on April 28, 2025, modified its earlier stay, lifting the provision that allowed RIFs and fully reinstating the district court's original ban on such actions pending the appeal's resolution.\n\nOn August 15, 2025, the D.C. Circuit issued its final opinion on the appeal of the preliminary injunction, vacating the district court's order. The appellate court held that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the employment-related claims, which must be brought through the specialized administrative review scheme of the Civil Service Reform Act. For the remaining claims, the court found that the plaintiffs' challenge to a generalized \"shutdown decision\" did not target a discrete, final agency action reviewable under the APA, nor did it constitute a constitutional violation reviewable in equity.",
    "PB-CT-0007": "On November 9, 2010, seven same-sex couples and a widower, all legally married under the laws of Connecticut, Vermont, or New Hampshire, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) and several law firms. The suit was brought against various federal agencies and their heads in their official capacities, including the Office of Personnel Management and the Secretary of the Treasury, as well as the United States itself.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centered on the plaintiffs being denied federal rights and benefits available to opposite-sex married couples. These deprivations stemmed from the application of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 1 U.S.C. § 7, which defined \"marriage\" for all federal purposes as a union between one man and one woman. The specific harms alleged included the denial of spousal coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB); the denial of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to care for a sick spouse; the denial of a Social Security lump-sum death benefit; the denial of an ERISA-mandated spousal survivor pension; the denial of a spousal medical benefit from a state retirement plan due to federal tax code restrictions; and the inability to file federal income taxes jointly, resulting in a higher tax burden.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that Section 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, as well as injunctive relief and monetary damages for the tax-related claims.\n\nAfter the suit was filed, the U.S. Department of Justice announced in February 2011 that it would no longer defend the constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA. Consequently, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives (BLAG) successfully moved to intervene in the case to defend the statute.\n\nThe case was decided on dispositive motions before Judge Vanessa L. Bryant. The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, while BLAG filed a motion to dismiss. On July 31, 2012, the court issued a memorandum of decision granting the plaintiffs' motion and denying BLAG's motion (2012 WL 3113883). Judge Bryant determined that classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny. However, she found it unnecessary to apply that standard, ruling that Section 3 of DOMA failed to pass constitutional muster even under the more deferential rational basis review. The court concluded that none of the government interests proffered by Congress or BLAG—including defending traditional marriage, protecting the public fisc, and promoting child-rearing in opposite-sex households—bore a rational relationship to the law. Judgment was entered for the plaintiffs on August 2, 2012.\n\nThe federal government defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on August 17, 2012, followed by BLAG on September 26, 2012. Citing the national importance of the issue and the need for a definitive resolution, both the plaintiffs and the federal government then filed petitions for a writ of certiorari before judgment with the U.S. Supreme Court, asking the Court to hear the case without awaiting a decision from the Second Circuit. The appeal to the Second Circuit was ultimately withdrawn on July 23, 2013.",
    "ED-MI-0001": "On November 8, 2006, a day after Michigan voters passed a ballot initiative known as Proposal 2, two consolidated lawsuits were filed challenging the new state constitutional amendment. Proposal 2 amended Article I, § 26 of the Michigan Constitution to prohibit public institutions, including state universities, from discriminating against or granting preferential treatment to individuals based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public education, employment, or contracting.\n\nThe plaintiffs were two groups: one led by the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (BAMN), comprised of civil rights organizations, students, and labor unions represented by private counsel; and a second group (the *Cantrell* plaintiffs) of students, faculty, and prospective applicants represented by the ACLU and NAACP Legal Defense Fund, among others. The plaintiffs, who sought class action status, sued the Governor of Michigan and the governing boards of the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University. The Michigan Attorney General and a prospective law school applicant intervened as defendants.\n\nThe lawsuits, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and assigned to Judge David M. Lawson, sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs' central cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 was that Proposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They argued that the amendment unconstitutionally restructured the political process by removing the authority to enact race-conscious admissions policies from publicly-elected university boards and requiring supporters of such policies to undertake the far more burdensome process of amending the state constitution, a theory based on the \"political process\" doctrine from *Hunter v. Erickson* and *Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1*. The BAMN plaintiffs also raised claims under the First Amendment and alleged that Proposal 2 was preempted by federal civil rights statutes.\n\nEarly in the litigation, the defendant universities filed a cross-claim seeking a temporary injunction to delay Proposal 2's implementation until the end of the 2006-2007 admissions cycle. On December 19, 2006, Judge Lawson granted a temporary injunction based on a stipulation among the parties, delaying the amendment’s application to university admissions until July 1, 2007. However, on December 29, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed the injunction, allowing Proposal 2 to take effect as scheduled.\n\nOn March 18, 2008, Judge Lawson granted summary judgment in favor of the Michigan Attorney General and dismissed the consolidated cases. He ruled that the political process doctrine did not apply because Proposal 2 restricted the ability to seek \"preferential treatment,\" which he distinguished from seeking protection against unequal treatment. He also rejected the plaintiffs' other constitutional and statutory claims. This decision was upheld upon a motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed to the Sixth Circuit. On July 1, 2011, a 2-1 panel reversed the district court, holding that Proposal 2 did violate the political process doctrine. The Sixth Circuit then granted rehearing *en banc*, which vacated the panel's opinion. On November 15, 2012, in an 8-7 decision, the *en banc* Sixth Circuit again reversed the district court, finding Proposal 2 unconstitutional as applied to public universities because it impermissibly burdened racial minorities by reconfiguring the political process.\n\nThe Michigan Attorney General successfully petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. On April 22, 2014, the Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit in a 6-2 decision with no single majority opinion. The plurality opinion, authored by Justice Kennedy, held that the political process doctrine did not apply because the case concerned whether voters could prohibit a policy of race-based preferences, not an attempt to inflict a racial injury. The Court concluded that the Constitution does not prohibit voters from making such a policy choice through the democratic process, thereby upholding the constitutionality of Proposal 2.",
    "DR-CA-0033": "On August 22, 2005, a man who uses a wheelchair for mobility filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against a national fast-food restaurant chain. The suit, brought by private counsel, alleged that two of the chain's newly constructed restaurants in San Diego County, California, had architectural barriers that denied him full and equal access in violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and related California state laws, including the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the Disabled Persons Act. The central claim was that a 44-inch-high wall in front of the food preparation counter prevented customers in wheelchairs from seeing the food ingredients and watching their orders being assembled, denying them the \"Chipotle experience\" available to other patrons. The plaintiff sought injunctive relief, monetary damages, and a declaratory judgment.\n\nIn December 2006, the same plaintiff, along with four others, filed a related putative class action against the restaurant chain concerning accessibility issues at all of its California locations. On March 20, 2007, Judge Napoleon A. Jones, Jr. denied the restaurant chain's motion to dismiss the original individual lawsuit but granted its motion to consolidate the two cases for discovery purposes only. The cases were not consolidated for trial.\n\nOn June 14, 2007, the court ruled on cross-motions for summary judgment. The court determined that the food service counter was governed by the ADA Accessibility Guideline (ADAAG) for sales counters (§ 7.2), not the guideline for assembly areas (§ 4.33.3). It found the counter's design did not meet the height requirements but that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the restaurant's customer service policy provided \"equivalent facilitation.\" The court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff on liability for state-law damages claims related to past parking lot barriers, which the restaurant had since remediated, rendering the ADA claim for injunctive relief on that issue moot.\n\nA four-day bench trial was held in November and December 2007 on the remaining counter issue. On January 10, 2008, Judge Jones issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, holding that the restaurant's prior unwritten accommodation policy did not constitute equivalent facilitation, but its new, written \"Customers with Disabilities Policy\" did. Consequently, the court denied the request for an injunction to lower the counter. It awarded the plaintiff $5,000 in statutory damages for five \"bona fide\" visits made while the inadequate unwritten policy was in effect but denied damages for three \"litigation-related\" visits.\n\nThe plaintiff appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 26, 2010, the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court in a published opinion, *Antoninetti v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.*, 643 F.3d 1165 (9th Cir. 2010). The appellate court held that neither the unwritten nor the written policy constituted \"equivalent facilitation\" because they provided a \"substitute experience\" that was not \"substantially equivalent\" to the one offered to non-disabled patrons. The Ninth Circuit remanded the case with instructions to enter judgment for the plaintiff, issue an appropriate injunction, and reconsider damages and attorneys' fees.\n\nOn remand before Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz, the original plaintiff passed away and his wife was substituted as the plaintiff. This rendered the claim for injunctive relief moot. On March 21, 2012, the court awarded $5,000 in statutory damages for the five \"bona fide\" visits, again denying damages for the litigation-related visits. Following the successful appeal, the court reconsidered attorneys' fees. On July 17, 2012, it awarded the plaintiff $545,079.05 in fees and costs for the district court litigation. A separate order from the Ninth Circuit on December 26, 2012, awarded an additional $353,469.95 for the appellate work.",
    "CJ-FL-0009": "This litigation began with a series of lawsuits, the first of which was filed on June 15, 2019, challenging Florida's implementation of a voter-approved constitutional amendment. In November 2018, Florida voters passed Amendment 4, which automatically restored voting rights to individuals with prior felony convictions (excluding murder or felony sexual offenses) \"upon completion of all terms of sentence.\" In June 2019, the Florida legislature enacted Senate Bill 7066 (SB 7066), codified as Fla. Stat. § 98.0751, defining \"completion of all terms of sentence\" to include the full payment of all court-ordered fines, fees, costs, and restitution, collectively known as legal financial obligations (LFOs).\n\nMultiple lawsuits, which were later consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, were filed against the Governor of Florida, the Florida Secretary of State, and various county Supervisors of Elections. The plaintiffs included seventeen individuals with prior felony convictions who had completed their terms of incarceration and supervision but had outstanding LFOs they asserted they were genuinely unable to pay. They were joined by several voting rights and civil rights organizations, including the Florida State Conference of the NAACP, the Orange County Branch of the NAACP, and the League of Women Voters of Florida. The plaintiffs, represented by counsel from the ACLU, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Brennan Center for Justice, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and other private and nonprofit firms, brought their claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that conditioning voting rights on the payment of LFOs created a pay-to-vote system that violated the U.S. Constitution. The claims included violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause (as wealth-based discrimination) and Due Process Clause (as unconstitutionally vague and procedurally inadequate), the Twenty-Fourth Amendment (as an unconstitutional poll tax), the First Amendment (burdening associational rights of the organizations), and the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA).\n\nThe consolidated cases were assigned to Judge Robert L. Hinkle. On October 18, 2019, Judge Hinkle granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the 17 individual plaintiffs. The injunction prohibited state and county officials from preventing the plaintiffs from registering to vote if they asserted an inability to pay their LFOs, and from preventing them from voting if they showed they were genuinely unable to pay. The State appealed this decision. On February 19, 2020, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction, holding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the LFO requirement, as applied to those genuinely unable to pay, constituted wealth discrimination that was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nBack in the district court, on April 7, 2020, Judge Hinkle certified a class of all persons otherwise eligible to vote in Florida but for unpaid LFOs, and a subclass of such persons who assert they are genuinely unable to pay. Following an eight-day bench trial, Judge Hinkle issued a permanent injunction on May 24, 2020. The court declared Florida's pay-to-vote system unconstitutional as applied to those genuinely unable to pay their LFOs. It also ruled that requiring payment of fees and costs as a condition of voting constituted an impermissible tax under the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. The injunction established a statewide process for individuals to request an advisory opinion from the state on the amount owed or to establish their inability to pay, and created a rebuttable presumption of inability to pay for those previously found indigent by a court.\n\nThe State appealed the permanent injunction to the Eleventh Circuit and moved to stay the injunction. The Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc, granted the stay. The plaintiffs' application to the U.S. Supreme Court to vacate the stay was denied on July 16, 2020, with Justices Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and Kagan dissenting.\n\nOn September 11, 2020, the en banc Eleventh Circuit issued its opinion, reversing the district court's judgment and vacating the permanent injunction. The majority held that the reenfranchisement scheme was subject only to rational basis review, not heightened scrutiny, because wealth is not a suspect class and felons do not have a fundamental right to vote. The court found the state's classification—distinguishing between felons who have completed all terms of their sentence and those who have not—was rationally related to the state's legitimate interests in punishing crime and restoring voting rights only to those who have fully completed their sentences. The court also held that court-ordered fees and costs were part of a criminal penalty, not a \"tax\" under the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. Finally, the court rejected the due process claims, finding the state's laws were not unconstitutionally vague and that existing state procedures for challenging ineligibility were sufficient.",
    "CJ-MD-0001": "On January 19, 2006, a death-sentenced inmate, represented by private counsel, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against officials of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS). The suit, brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the state's three-drug lethal injection protocol violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments' prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe factual basis of the case was that the state’s protocol—using sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride—created a grave and unnecessary risk of conscious suffering. The inmate argued that the protocol was flawed due to inadequately trained personnel, the absence of a qualified individual to monitor anesthesia, and the use of a paralytic agent (pancuronium bromide) that could mask an inmate's pain. A central component of the challenge was an \"as-applied\" claim, supported by expert medical testimony, asserting that the inmate's long history of intravenous drug use had severely compromised his veins, making reliable IV access for the lethal drugs highly unlikely and increasing the risk of a botched and agonizing execution.\n\nWith the inmate's execution scheduled for the week of February 6, 2006, his counsel immediately filed for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary injunction. After expedited hearings, Chief Judge Benson Everett Legg denied the motions on February 1, 2006, concluding that the inmate had not demonstrated a substantial and unnecessary risk of unconstitutional pain. That decision was published as *Evans v. Saar*, 412 F. Supp. 2d 519 (D. Md. 2006). The inmate appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which denied an injunction pending appeal on February 3, 2006. The inmate subsequently dismissed his appeal on February 15, 2006.\n\nConcurrently, on January 20, 2006, the inmate, along with the NAACP, the ACLU Foundation of Maryland, and Maryland Citizens Against State Executions, had filed a separate lawsuit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. This related case argued that the state's Execution Operations Manual violated Maryland's Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it was a regulation adopted without the required public notice and comment. It also alleged the protocol conflicted with the state's death penalty statute.\n\nOn December 19, 2006, the Maryland Court of Appeals issued a dispositive ruling in the state case. In *Evans v. State*, 396 Md. 256 (2006), the court held that the portion of the execution protocol detailing the lethal injection procedure was indeed a regulation that had been adopted in violation of the APA. The court enjoined the state from carrying out any executions until the protocol was properly promulgated as a regulation or exempted by the legislature. This state-level injunction effectively halted all executions in Maryland.\n\nFollowing this development, a bench trial in the federal case proceeded in September 2006. However, given the state-level injunction, the parties in the federal case filed a consent motion to stay proceedings. On February 22, 2007, Judge Legg granted the motion, staying the federal case pending resolution of the protocol issue by the Maryland General Assembly or through the state's administrative process. Status reports filed over the following years indicated that the state was unable to successfully adopt a new protocol. As a result, the federal case remained stayed until August 16, 2012, when, by agreement of the parties, Judge Legg ordered the case administratively closed without a final judgment on the merits of the constitutional claims.",
    "CW-DC-0001": "On June 20, 1989, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of children in the District of Columbia's foster care system and other children known to the city's Department of Human Services (DHS) due to reports of abuse or neglect. The plaintiffs sued the Mayor of the District of Columbia and senior officials responsible for the child welfare system, alleging systemic failures that violated the children's rights.\n\nThe complaint was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, the federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, the D.C. Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act of 1977, and the D.C. Youth Residential Facilities Licensure Act of 1986. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy these systemic deficiencies. The factual basis of the case included allegations of dangerously high social worker caseloads, failure to investigate abuse reports, children languishing for years in \"emergency\" placements, inappropriate institutionalization, and a lack of case planning to achieve permanency for children through family reunification or adoption.\n\nFollowing a two-week bench trial, Judge Thomas F. Hogan issued a memorandum opinion on April 18, 1991, finding the District of Columbia liable for widespread statutory and constitutional violations (*LaShawn A. v. Dixon*, 762 F.Supp. 959). The court found that the city's \"ineptly managed\" child welfare system was in a state of crisis, resulting in psychological, emotional, and physical harm to the children it was meant to protect. The average stay in D.C. foster care was nearly five years, more than double the national average.\n\nAfter the liability finding, the parties negotiated a remedial consent order, which the court entered on August 27, 1991. The District appealed the liability judgment. On April 16, 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the judgment but did so on the independent basis of D.C. local law, thereby avoiding the federal constitutional and statutory issues (*LaShawn A. v. Kelly*, 990 F.2d 1319). The case was remanded with instructions to fashion a remedial order based on local law. This resulted in the court issuing a comprehensive Modified Final Order (MFO) on November 18, 1993, detailing the specific reforms required across the child welfare system.\n\nThe District struggled to comply with the MFO, leading to years of contentious enforcement proceedings. On May 22, 1995, after finding the defendants in contempt for their noncompliance, Judge Hogan placed the child welfare system into a general receivership (*LaShawn A. v. Kelly*, 887 F.Supp. 297). A court-appointed Receiver was given broad authority to manage the agency and implement the MFO. The D.C. Circuit later remanded the receivership order, finding its grant of authority to disregard local law overly broad (*LaShawn A. v. Barry*, 144 F.3d 847 (1998)). The receivership remained in place until June 15, 2001, after which the system entered a probationary period under the oversight of a Court Monitor, the Center for the Study of Social Policy.\n\nThroughout the post-receivership period, the court has overseen the District's progress through a series of detailed implementation plans, including an Amended Implementation Plan (AIP) in 2007 and an Implementation and Exit Plan in 2010. These plans established specific, measurable benchmarks for performance in areas such as timeliness of investigations, caseloads, placement stability, and permanency outcomes. The District's continued failure to meet these benchmarks led to further contempt proceedings. On April 5, 2010, the court again held the District and its then-Mayor in civil contempt for failing to comply with a 2008 stipulated order requiring the development of an adequate annual plan and consultation with plaintiffs on the selection of a new agency director.\n\nAfter years of monitoring and incremental progress, the parties jointly moved in 2019 to adopt a final Exit and Sustainability Plan. This plan, approved by the court on October 31, 2019, removed from active monitoring the standards the District had successfully maintained and focused on the remaining areas of non-compliance. The case remains under the jurisdiction of Judge Hogan, with the Court Monitor continuing to report on the District's performance as it works toward the eventual termination of court supervision.",
    "PN-NY-0014": "On March 28, 2012, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of Black and Latino residents of and visitors to private apartment buildings in New York City against the City of New York, its Police Commissioner, and several individual NYPD officers. The suit, brought by counsel from the New York Civil Liberties Union, The Bronx Defenders, and LatinoJustice PRLDEF, challenged the NYPD's \"Operation Clean Halls\" program (later known as the Trespass Affidavit Program or TAP). Under this program, police officers patrolled thousands of private residential buildings. The plaintiffs alleged that this led to a widespread practice of unconstitutional stops, searches, and arrests of residents and their guests for trespassing in and around their own homes without reasonable suspicion, in violation of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments and the Fair Housing Act. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to end the practice and compensatory damages for the named plaintiffs.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Shira A. Scheindlin. After an evidentiary hearing, on January 8, 2013, Judge Scheindlin granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering the NYPD to immediately cease performing trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx without reasonable suspicion. On February 11, 2013, she certified a class for the purposes of the preliminary injunction. The remedies phase of the case was later consolidated with a related case, *Floyd v. City of New York*.\n\nThe City appealed the preliminary injunction. On October 31, 2013, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the injunction and, in a highly unusual move, ordered the case reassigned to a different district judge, citing an appearance of partiality based on the initial judge's public statements and application of the court's related case rule. The case was subsequently reassigned to Judge Analisa Torres. Following a change in mayoral administration, the City sought to withdraw its appeal. Several police unions moved to intervene to continue the appeal, but Judge Torres denied their motions on July 30, 2014. On October 31, 2014, the Second Circuit affirmed the denial of intervention and granted the City's motion to voluntarily dismiss its appeal with prejudice.\n\nOn July 19, 2017, the parties entered into a court-enforced settlement agreement. The settlement expanded the class to be city-wide and required the NYPD to implement significant reforms to the TAP program, including stricter criteria for enrolling and renewing buildings and mandatory use of a \"Trespass Crimes Fact Sheet\" for all trespass arrests in TAP buildings. The City agreed to pay $235,000 in damages to the named plaintiffs. The settlement also incorporated the ongoing remedial process established in the joint *Floyd/Ligon* Remedial Order of August 12, 2013.\n\nThat remedial order had appointed Peter L. Zimroth as an independent monitor to oversee reforms. Key reforms ordered and implemented under the monitor's oversight include:\n*   Revisions to the NYPD Patrol Guide to clarify the legal standards for investigative encounters (P.G. 212-11) and to prohibit racial and bias-based profiling (P.G. 203-25), which were approved on August 24, 2015.\n*   A pilot program for body-worn cameras, which was modified on December 8, 2015, to be a randomized controlled trial.\n*   An Early Intervention Program, ordered on June 2, 2020, requiring the NYPD to systematically track adverse legal findings against officers (such as declined prosecutions and court findings of incredible testimony) to identify officers needing intervention.\n\nThe monitor's term was set for three years, contingent on the City achieving substantial compliance. The monitor has issued numerous reports tracking the NYPD's progress on developing new policies, training, supervision, and auditing procedures, noting both significant changes and continuing challenges, such as the underreporting of stops. The court retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement terms.\n\nReported opinions in this case include: 2012 WL 3597066; 2013 WL 71800; 2013 WL 227654; 288 F.R.D. 72 (2013); 925 F. Supp. 2d 478 (2013); 959 F. Supp. 2d 668 (2013); and 770 F.3d 1051 (2d Cir. 2014).",
    "PC-AL-0034": "On May 28, 2015, the United States, represented by the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, filed a lawsuit against the State of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC). The lawsuit was initiated under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, alleging that conditions at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women violated the prisoners' Eighth Amendment rights to be protected from cruel and unusual punishment. The government sought declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy the conditions.\n\nThe case is based on a January 17, 2014, Department of Justice findings letter which concluded that the State of Alabama was deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of harm to women prisoners at Tutwiler. The investigation detailed a history of unabated staff-on-prisoner sexual abuse and harassment, including rape, coercion, voyeurism, and verbal abuse. It described a \"toxic, sexualized environment\" where prisoners universally feared for their safety. The DOJ found systemic deficiencies, including dangerously low staffing levels, a lack of female officers, inadequate investigation of abuse allegations, a heightened fear of retaliation for reporting misconduct, and a failure to implement gender-responsive policies, despite officials being on notice of the problems for over eighteen years.\n\nOn the same day the complaint was filed, the parties submitted a joint motion to enter a pre-negotiated settlement agreement, indicating a resolution had been reached prior to litigation. On June 18, 2015, Judge Myron H. Thompson of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama approved the settlement and entered it as a court-enforceable consent decree. The court then conditionally dismissed the case without prejudice, retaining jurisdiction to enforce the decree's terms.\n\nThe consent decree mandates comprehensive reforms at Tutwiler, including: full compliance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA); development and implementation of gender-responsive policies and procedures; establishment of multiple confidential methods for reporting sexual abuse and a formal grievance system; protection for prisoners and staff from retaliation; thorough and objective investigations of all allegations; and appropriate disciplinary action against staff for misconduct. The decree also requires ADOC to address staffing shortages, recruit more female officers, improve the inmate classification and risk-assessment system, install a comprehensive camera system, and implement a data-driven quality improvement program.\n\nThe decree will terminate after the defendants achieve and maintain \"Substantial Compliance\" with all substantive provisions for three consecutive six-month compliance reports, for a total of 18 months. To oversee implementation, the court approved the joint appointment of a monitor, initially Jennie Lancaster. In August 2016, Kathleen Dennehy was approved as the replacement monitor.\n\nSince 2016, the monitor has filed numerous compliance reports with the court, detailing the defendants' progress. The reports, filed approximately every six months, track compliance on a provision-by-provision basis. Early reports found \"Partial Compliance\" on many items, but subsequent reports through 2019 have documented sustained progress, with the defendants achieving \"Substantial Compliance\" on the vast majority of the consent decree's requirements.",
    "CW-CA-0005": "A class action lawsuit was filed on July 18, 2002, on behalf of children in California's foster care system, or at imminent risk of placement, who have mental health impairments. The plaintiffs alleged that state and Los Angeles County agencies were failing to provide necessary, community-based mental health services as required by federal and state law. The plaintiffs were represented by a consortium of counsel, including the ACLU of Southern California, private law firms, and public interest advocacy organizations.\n\nThe lawsuit named as defendants the directors of the California Department of Health Services and the California Department of Social Services (the \"State Defendants\"), as well as Los Angeles County and its Department of Children and Family Services (the \"County Defendants\"). The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting causes of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the Medicaid Act's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions, the Fourteenth Amendment's Substantive Due Process Clause, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n\nThe case proceeded in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, initially before Judge A. Howard Matz and later reassigned to Judge John A. Kronstadt. On June 18, 2003, the court certified a statewide class of foster children with documented mental health needs requiring individualized services in a home-like setting.\n\nShortly thereafter, on July 16, 2003, the court approved a settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and the County Defendants. This settlement obligated Los Angeles County to ensure class members receive necessary, individualized mental health services, expand \"wraparound services,\" and improve placement stability. A six-member expert Advisory Panel was appointed to monitor compliance. Subsequent disputes over the County's compliance led to a November 20, 2006 court order requiring the County to amend its implementation plan. A 2018 report from the Advisory Panel noted some progress, such as increased staffing, but found significant ongoing deficiencies in practice quality, service utilization, and placement stability.\n\nLitigation against the State Defendants continued. On March 14, 2006, the district court granted a preliminary injunction requiring the State to provide \"wraparound services\" and \"therapeutic foster care\" (433 F. Supp. 2d 1065). The State Defendants appealed, and on March 23, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded the decision (481 F.3d 1150). The appellate court ruled that the district court had erred by requiring the State to provide services as a specific \"bundle\" or package (i.e., \"wraparound\" and \"TFC\"). It directed the lower court to first determine whether the State was effectively providing the individual component services required under the Medicaid Act before ordering a specific delivery model. Following remand, on September 22, 2008, the district court ordered the parties into mandated negotiations.\n\nThese negotiations culminated in a comprehensive settlement agreement with the State Defendants, which received final court approval on December 5, 2011. The agreement required the State to develop and implement a \"Core Practice Model\" to ensure coordinated, community-based mental health care for class members. Key terms included the creation of two new Medi-Cal service arrays—Intensive Care Coordination (ICC) and Intensive Home Based Services (IHBS)—and the establishment of a shared management structure between the state's health and social services departments. The court appointed Richard Saletta as a Special Master to oversee the development and execution of an Implementation Plan and retained jurisdiction for 36 months, until December 2014. The Special Master's final report in November 2014 noted progress in implementing the plan but also a significant gap between the number of potential subclass members and those actually receiving the new services. On December 6, 2011, the court awarded plaintiffs' counsel $3.75 million in attorneys' fees and costs.",
    "PC-VA-0022": "On December 19, 2014, a Virginia inmate, proceeding without counsel, filed a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) and numerous VDOC and prison officials. The inmate alleged that the prison's policies regarding long-term solitary confinement violated his constitutional rights. The case was initially filed with two other inmates, but their cases were later severed into separate actions.\n\nThe inmate alleged violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses and the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. He sought monetary damages and injunctive relief to abolish the challenged policies and improve the conditions of his confinement. The case was assigned to Judge James P. Jones.\n\nThe factual basis of the case stems from the inmate's confinement at Red Onion State Prison, a supermax facility. After being convicted for stabbing a prison guard in 2009, the inmate was placed in administrative segregation. In 2013, under a new VDOC policy known as the \"Segregation Reduction Step-Down Program\" (Operating Procedure 830.A), he was classified onto the \"Intensive Management\" (IM) pathway. This program separates inmates in segregation into two tracks: IM, for those deemed to have a potential for extreme violence, and \"Special Management\" (SM). The inmate alleged that the IM classification created a permanent state of solitary confinement from which he could never progress back to the general population, unlike inmates on the SM track. He argued that the periodic reviews of his status were meaningless and that the conditions of his confinement—including 23-hour-a-day isolation, constant artificial light, and lack of meaningful human contact or environmental stimuli—were unconstitutional.\n\nThe defendants, represented by the Office of the Attorney General of Virginia, filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. On September 27, 2016, the court granted the motion. In its opinion, the court first dismissed all claims against the VDOC, holding it is not a \"person\" subject to suit under § 1983. On the constitutional claims, the court found no procedural due process violation, reasoning that while VDOC policy created an expectation of review, the conditions of the inmate's confinement did not impose an \"atypical and significant hardship\" necessary to create a constitutionally protected liberty interest. The court determined that the step-down program, even for IM inmates, provided a pathway for earning privileges and prevented the confinement from being indefinite, thus distinguishing it from precedents that found due process violations.\n\nThe court also rejected the Equal Protection claim, finding that the inmate's violent offense provided a rational basis for treating him differently from inmates on the SM track. Finally, the court dismissed the Eighth Amendment claim, concluding that the inmate's allegations of physical and mental harm were conclusory and did not demonstrate a deprivation of \"the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities.\" A final judgment was entered for the defendants on September 27, 2016.\n\nThe inmate appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, where he was represented by pro bono counsel. On November 22, 2017, the Fourth Circuit issued an unpublished per curiam opinion affirming the district court's judgment. The appellate court rejected the inmate’s argument that summary judgment was granted prematurely and affirmed the dismissal of the constitutional claims based on the reasoning in the district court's opinion."
