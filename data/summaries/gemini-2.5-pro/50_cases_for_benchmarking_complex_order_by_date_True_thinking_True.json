    "46567": "On May 5, 2025, a Venezuelan national in immigration custody filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The case challenges the legality of a Presidential Proclamation that invokes the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798 to authorize the summary removal of Venezuelan citizens alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) criminal gang. The petitioner is represented by counsel from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The respondents include the President, the heads of various federal departments (including Homeland Security, Justice, State, and Defense), and the warden of the Wyatt Detention Facility where the petitioner is held.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the Proclamation exceeds the authority granted by the AEA. The petitioner asserts that the statute, which applies only during a \"declared war\" or a military \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by a \"foreign nation or government,\" cannot be legally invoked against a criminal gang during peacetime. The filing also alleges that the Proclamation unlawfully bypasses the exclusive removal procedures and humanitarian protections of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the right to seek asylum and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Furthermore, the petitioner claims the process violates the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause by failing to provide a meaningful opportunity to challenge the designation as an \"alien enemy.\"\n\nThe petitioner, who has a pending asylum application and denies any gang affiliation, was recently denied bond in immigration court after the government identified him as a TdA member. Fearing imminent removal to a prison in El Salvador, he sought a temporary restraining order (TRO), a writ of habeas corpus, and declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent his transfer and removal under the Proclamation.\n\nThe case is assigned to Judge Melissa R. DuBose. On May 5, 2025, the day the case was filed, Judge DuBose issued an order requiring the government to provide the court with 48 hours' advance notice before moving the petitioner out of the district. Following a hearing on May 7, 2025, the judge amended this order to require 72 hours' advance notice, calculated using only business days. The case is one of several similar habeas petitions filed nationwide challenging the Proclamation, with other federal courts having also granted relief, as noted in cases like *J.A.V. v. Trump*, 2025 WL 1257450, and *D.B.U v. Trump*, 2025 WL 1163530.",
    "46582": "On April 30, 2025, a Palestinian woman filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The petitioner is represented by a combination of private counsel and attorneys from legal services organizations, including the Texas Civil Rights Project, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Muslim Advocates. The suit names as respondents several high-ranking federal officials in their official capacities, including the Secretary of Homeland Security, the U.S. Attorney General, the Acting Director of ICE, and the warden of the detention facility where the petitioner is held.\n\nThe case arises from the petitioner's detention by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The petitioner, who was lawfully admitted to the U.S. in 2016 and lived in New Jersey, alleges her detention is unlawful retaliation for exercising her First Amendment rights. The petition states that in April 2024, she was arrested for a local ordinance violation while attending a peaceful protest near Columbia University to mourn family members lost in the conflict in Gaza; the charges were swiftly dismissed. Nearly a year later, in March 2025, following what the complaint describes as a new administration policy to target noncitizens for pro-Palestinian advocacy, she was investigated by federal agents. After voluntarily meeting with agents on March 13, 2025, she was taken into custody and transferred overnight to the Prairieland Detention Facility in Alvarado, Texas, over 1,500 miles from her home.\n\nOn April 3, 2025, an immigration judge granted her release on a $20,000 bond, finding she was neither a danger to the community nor a flight risk. However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appealed the decision and invoked an automatic stay, preventing her release. The petitioner’s lawsuit challenges her continued confinement, arguing it violates the First Amendment (retaliation for protected speech and association) and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (substantive and procedural). She also brings a claim under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), alleging that while detained, she has been denied halal meals and other religious accommodations, leading to significant weight loss. She seeks a writ of habeas corpus for her immediate release, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Sam A. Lindsay and referred to Magistrate Judge Rebecca Rutherford. On May 5, 2025, the petitioner filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking her immediate release pending a final judgment. After briefing from both parties, Magistrate Judge Rutherford held a hearing on June 5, 2025. On June 27, 2025, the Magistrate Judge issued a Findings, Conclusions, and Recommendation, advising that the petitioner's motion be granted and that she be released. Both the petitioner and the government filed objections to this recommendation. On July 16, 2025, Judge Lindsay determined that new issues had been raised in the parties' objections and recommitted the matter to Magistrate Judge Rutherford to issue new findings and recommendations in light of this new information. The case is ongoing.",
    "46496": "On April 24, 2025, three nonprofit advocacy organizations filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its Secretary in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case, assigned to Judge Ana C. Reyes, was brought by private counsel from Public Citizen Litigation Group, Democracy Forward Foundation, and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights.\n\nThe lawsuit arose after DHS, on March 21, 2025, effectively shut down three of its internal oversight bodies: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman Office (CIS Ombudsman), and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO). The department placed nearly all employees of these offices on administrative leave and issued reduction-in-force (RIF) notices for their termination, effective May 23, 2025. The plaintiff organizations, which rely on these offices to report civil rights abuses, assist with immigration cases, and monitor detention conditions, allege that this de facto elimination of the offices is unlawful.\n\nThe complaint asserts that the defendants' actions exceed their executive authority and violate the constitutional separation of powers, as only Congress can abolish offices it created by statute. The plaintiffs also bring claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing the shutdown was arbitrary, capricious, and in excess of statutory authority. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief to compel DHS to resume the offices' statutorily mandated functions.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on May 8, 2025, and a temporary restraining order (TRO) on May 23, 2025, to prevent the RIF from taking effect and to restore the offices' operations. After holding evidentiary hearings, the court denied the TRO without prejudice. Throughout the proceedings, the plaintiffs raised concerns about the defendants' good faith, citing conflicting statements made to the court about restaffing the offices versus a formal congressional budget justification that stated one office, OIDO, had been \"eliminated in its entirety.\"\n\nOn July 11, 2025, the court denied the pending motion for a preliminary injunction as moot and, with the parties' agreement, entered a scheduling order for expedited discovery and cross-motions for summary judgment. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration of that order on August 1, 2025, which remains pending.",
    "46432": "On April 18, 2025, a 20-year-old Bangladeshi university student on an F-1 visa filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus against federal officials—including the President, Attorney General, and heads of the Departments of Homeland Security and State—as well as local county law enforcement. Represented by a private law firm, the ACLU of Minnesota, and other legal aid organizations, the student alleged he was unlawfully detained in retaliation for his social media posts supporting Palestinian human rights.\n\nThe case arose from the student's arrest by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers on March 28, 2025. The government's stated reasons for the arrest and detention shifted over time, including a visa revocation, termination of his student status in the SEVIS database, and various statutory grounds for removal. The student contended these justifications were pretextual and that the government targeted him as part of a broader policy to suppress pro-Palestinian speech among international students. Although an immigration judge found the student was not a danger to the community and ordered him released on a $7,500 bond, DHS invoked an automatic stay to block his release and keep him in custody.\n\nThe student sought release from custody, arguing that his detention violated his First Amendment free speech rights, his Fifth Amendment due process rights, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The case was assigned to Judge Jerry W. Blackwell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota.\n\nOn April 22, 2025, Judge Blackwell granted a temporary restraining order preventing the government from transferring the student out of the district, ensuring the court could adjudicate his claims. On May 5, 2025, finding the student had presented substantial constitutional claims and demonstrated exceptional circumstances, including a worsening hernia condition requiring surgery, the court ordered his immediate release on bail pending a final decision on his habeas petition.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, the court granted the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Judge Blackwell ruled that the student had proven his detention was an unlawful retaliation for his protected political speech, in violation of the First Amendment. The court also found his Fifth Amendment due process rights were violated because the detention was punitive and because the government's use of an automatic stay to override a bond order was arbitrary. Finally, the court held that the termination of his student (SEVIS) record violated the APA because it lacked a lawful basis and contravened the agency's own policies. The court ordered that the student remain released from custody. The government filed an appeal of the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on July 29, 2025.",
    "46477": "On April 14, 2025, a group of international students and recent graduates on F-1 and M-1 visas filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and senior officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The case arose after DHS unilaterally terminated the students' records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), the government database used to track their legal status. The terminations, based on \"criminal records check and/or ... VISA revoked,\" caused the students' universities to advise them to cease all employment, including post-graduate Optional Practical Training (OPT), and prepare for immediate departure from the United States.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the students, whose number grew from ten to thirty-one during the initial proceedings, alleged that the government's actions were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They also claimed a violation of their constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause. The students argued that none had been convicted of a crime that would legally justify the termination of their status under federal regulations. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to have their student records restored.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Jane M. Beckering of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. On April 15, 2025, the students filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). After a hearing, the court granted the TRO on April 23, 2025. The order required the federal government to set aside the termination decisions, restore the students' SEVIS records retroactively, and refrain from terminating their records again without a valid legal basis. The TRO also prohibited the government from revoking the students' work authorizations or initiating their arrest, detention, or removal based on the SEVIS terminations.\n\nFollowing further briefing and another hearing, the court granted the students' motion for a preliminary injunction on May 7, 2025. The court found that the students were likely to succeed on their APA claim, as the government had not identified a valid statutory or regulatory basis for its actions. The preliminary injunction extended the terms of the TRO, preserving the students' legal status and ability to study and work pending a final resolution of the case.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, the federal government filed an interlocutory appeal of the preliminary injunction order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.",
    "46239": "On March 17, 2025, Erie County, New York, represented by private counsel, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Corporation for National and Community Service (Americorps) and its interim head. The case was assigned to Chief Judge James E. Boasberg.\n\nThe dispute arose from a three-year, $250,000 Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) grant Americorps awarded to the county in January 2024. In its application, the county described its efforts to recruit diverse volunteers and form a diverse advisory council, as required by a long-standing Americorps regulation (45 C.F.R. § 2553.24). However, following the issuance of Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 in January 2025, which targeted government \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\" (DEI) programs, Americorps demanded that Erie County certify that its grant activities did not \"promote DEI activities.\" The agency gave the county the options to make the certification, amend its grant application to remove the DEI-related language, or relinquish the award.\n\nErie County argued that it could not honestly make the new certification because its program was designed to comply with Americorps' own pre-existing diversity requirement. The county filed suit, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. The complaint alleged that the agency's new requirements were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) because they contradicted its own valid regulations without a formal rulemaking process. The suit also claimed the vague and unauthorized funding conditions violated the U.S. Constitution's Spending Clause.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, Erie County filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent Americorps from enforcing the new certification requirement and to compel the disbursement of funds. Americorps filed its opposition on April 4, 2025, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction and that the county had not demonstrated irreparable harm. Before the court could rule on the motion, Erie County filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice on April 14, 2025. The notice stated the dismissal was because Americorps had \"changed its certification requirements since the filing of this suit.\" The court subsequently dismissed the case the same day.",
    "46230": "On March 14, 2025, twelve nonpartisan, career civil servants from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs worked in the Veterans Benefits Administration's Office of Equity Assurance (OEA), an office created in 2023 to identify and resolve disparities in veterans' access to benefits.\n\nThe lawsuit was a response to actions taken following a January 20, 2025, Executive Order aimed at terminating Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) programs across the federal government. The plaintiffs alleged that on January 22, 2025, the VA erroneously designated their office as a DEIA office, shut it down, and placed all employees on administrative leave, revoking their access to government systems. They contended their work was not DEIA-related but focused on ensuring equitable access to benefits for all veterans, such as those in rural areas.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed they were subsequently terminated via a Reduction in Force (RIF) on February 14, 2025, without proper notice or the opportunity for reassignment typically offered to other VA employees in similar situations. Although the termination was rescinded on February 27, 2025, they were placed back on administrative leave and received a new RIF notice effective May 10, 2025. They argued that being publicly labeled as \"DEIA\" employees in a program described by the administration as \"divisive\" and \"shameful\" stigmatized them, destroyed their professional reputations, and caused pending job offers to be withdrawn.\n\nThe complaint sought injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging the VA's actions were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. It also raised constitutional claims, arguing the agency violated the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights by retaliating against them for their perceived political viewpoints and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Rudolph Contreras after an initial judge rejected a notice relating it to another case. On April 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent the VA from continuing to designate them as DEIA employees and to restore their access to agency systems and benefits. After a hearing, Judge Contreras denied the motion on May 2, 2025. On July 17, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, ending the case without prejudice.",
    "46242": "On March 5, 2025, a national non-profit organization advocating for motorized recreation, a Utah-based motorcycle club, and an individual member of both groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Department of the Interior. The suit, overseen by Judge David Nuffer, challenges the legality of the San Rafael Swell Travel Management Plan, which was finalized on December 31, 2024, and closed 665 miles of routes to off-highway vehicles (OHVs) in a popular recreational area in Emery County, Utah. The plaintiffs are represented by in-house counsel from one of the plaintiff organizations.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the BLM's plan violates federal law on several grounds. The plaintiffs claim the route closures create illegal \"buffer zones\" around Congressionally designated wilderness areas and effectively establish a \"wild river\" designation for the Price River, actions they argue violate the Dingell Act and usurp Congressional authority. The complaint further asserts that the BLM’s decision was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs contend the agency failed to adequately respond to public comments, used inconsistent reasoning to justify closures, relied on regulations recently found to be invalid by the D.C. Circuit in *Marin Audubon Society v. FAA*, and improperly bypassed the standard administrative appeal process, causing immediate harm by making the plan effective upon issuance. Finally, the plaintiffs allege a violation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), arguing the BLM should have prepared a full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) rather than a less comprehensive Environmental Assessment due to the plan's significant impact on the human environment. The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the plan is unlawful and a permanent injunction to prevent its enforcement.\n\nThe day after filing the complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to immediately halt the plan's implementation, arguing they would suffer irreparable harm if the BLM began physically obliterating the closed routes. Shortly thereafter, a nonprofit conservation organization, the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, filed a motion to intervene as a defendant to support the BLM's travel plan. The court granted this motion on April 21, 2025, making the conservation group a party to the case. As of the latest filings, the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction remains pending, and the court has established a scheduling order for briefing on the merits of the case.",
    "46039": "On February 4, 2025, the Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association and several anonymous FBI employees (including special agents and forensic specialists) filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice and the United States. Represented by private and non-profit counsel, the plaintiffs sought to prevent the government from collecting and disseminating their personally identifiable information in connection with their work on investigations into the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe lawsuit arose after the new presidential administration, which began on January 20, 2025, pardoned individuals prosecuted for January 6-related offenses and initiated a review of the personnel involved in those cases. The Department of Justice directed the FBI to compile a list of all personnel who had worked on the investigations. The plaintiffs alleged this action was retaliatory and created an imminent risk that their names and involvement would be publicly disclosed, exposing them and their families to threats, harassment, and violence from pardoned individuals and their supporters.\n\nThe complaint asserted violations of the Privacy Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, the First Amendment (retaliation based on perceived political affiliation), and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (reputational harm and privacy interests). The primary remedy sought was an injunction to prohibit the government from collecting or disseminating the list of personnel.\n\nThe plaintiffs immediately moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO). The case was assigned to Judge Jia M. Cobb and consolidated with a related case, *John and Jane Does 1-9 v. Department of Justice*, No. 25-cv-0325. The government opposed the TRO, arguing that the plaintiffs' fears of public disclosure and termination were speculative and did not constitute the imminent, irreparable harm required for such an extraordinary remedy. The government stated the information was collected for a lawful internal review and was a permissible intra-agency exchange under the Privacy Act. It also noted that the list provided by the FBI to the DOJ used unique employee identifiers, not names.\n\nFollowing a hearing, the court deferred ruling on the TRO. Instead, on February 7, 2025, Judge Cobb entered a consent order agreed to by the parties. Under the terms of the order, the government agreed not to disseminate the list to the public before the court could rule on the plaintiffs' forthcoming motion for a preliminary injunction. The order allows the government to terminate this agreement at its discretion by providing two business days' notice to the court and the plaintiffs. The court set a briefing schedule for the preliminary injunction motion, with a hearing scheduled for March 27, 2025. Subsequently, some of the anonymous individual plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims.",
    "46681": "On February 3, 2025, a U.S. citizen, representing himself *pro se*, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of International Trade against the United States. The case challenged executive orders issued in February 2025 that imposed tariffs on goods imported from Canada, Mexico, and China. The citizen alleged that the President's imposition of these tariffs, purportedly under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), was unconstitutional.\n\nThe lawsuit's legal foundation rested on the argument that the President's actions violated the separation of powers doctrine, specifically Article I, Sections 7 and 8 of the U.S. Constitution, which grant Congress the exclusive power to lay and collect taxes and duties. The plaintiff claimed that as a consumer on a fixed income, the tariffs would cause him direct economic harm through increased prices. He sought a declaratory judgment that the tariffs were unconstitutional and permanent injunctive relief to prohibit their collection.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, the United States, represented by the Department of Justice, filed a motion to dismiss the case. The government argued that the citizen lacked both Article III standing and prudential standing to bring the suit. It contended that the plaintiff's alleged injury—a generalized grievance about unconstitutional governance and speculative future economic harm—was not a concrete and particularized injury-in-fact. The government also noted that importers, who directly pay the tariffs, were better suited to litigate their validity and had filed similar challenges in other cases, such as *V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump* and *Princess Awesome, LLC v. U.S. Customs & Border Prot.*\n\nOn May 23, 2025, Judge Jennifer Choe-Groves issued an opinion and order (Slip-Op. 25-65) granting the government's motion to dismiss. The court ruled that the plaintiff failed to establish the \"injury in fact\" required for Article III standing. It found his claims of harm, based on a \"breach of the Constitutional contract\" and potential future price increases, were abstract, speculative, and not particularized to him in a way that differed from the general public. The complaint was dismissed without prejudice, and the court granted the plaintiff until June 23, 2025, to file an amended complaint that could resolve the standing deficiencies.",
    "46758": "On June 20, 2025, several individuals filed a habeas corpus petition, which was later amended into a putative class action complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs are individuals (including U.S. citizens) and non-profit organizations representing farmworkers, carwash workers, and immigrants in the Los Angeles area. They are represented by counsel from the ACLU and public interest law firms. The defendants are the Secretary of Homeland Security and other senior federal immigration officials.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges a federal immigration enforcement initiative in the Central District of California, referred to as \"Operation At Large,\" which began in June 2025. The plaintiffs allege that as part of this operation, federal agents are conducting detentive stops without the individualized, reasonable suspicion required by the Fourth Amendment. The plaintiffs claim these stops are based on a profile that includes factors such as apparent Latino ethnicity, speaking Spanish, presence at locations like carwashes or day laborer sites, and the type of work a person does.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to halt these practices. After briefing and a hearing, Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong granted the TRO on July 11, 2025. The order enjoined the federal officials from conducting detentive stops within the district without reasonable suspicion that the person is in the U.S. unlawfully. It specifically prohibited officials from relying solely on the combination of four factors—apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, or type of work—to form reasonable suspicion.\n\nIn a related matter, after government attorneys took inconsistent positions regarding an immigration court's jurisdiction to hold a bond hearing for one of the detained plaintiffs, Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym found that special circumstances existed and ordered his release from custody on a $5,000 bond on July 30, 2025.\n\nThe federal officials appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and filed an emergency motion to stay the order pending appeal. On August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit issued a published order largely denying the motion for a stay. The appellate court found that the plaintiffs had demonstrated standing and a likelihood of success on the merits, concluding that the district-wide scope of the TRO was necessary to provide them with complete relief. However, the Ninth Circuit did grant a partial stay of a single clause in the TRO, \"except as permitted by law,\" which it found to be impermissibly vague.",
    "46378": "On April 10, 2025, four international students attending Michigan universities filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other federal immigration officials. The students, represented by the ACLU Fund of Michigan and cooperating attorneys, alleged that DHS had unlawfully terminated their F-1 student immigration status.\n\nThe case arose after the students' universities notified them between April 4 and April 8, 2025, that their records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a federal tracking database, had been terminated. The reason provided in SEVIS was a boilerplate note: \"Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.\" The students, who had minor or no criminal history (such as arrests that did not lead to charges) and were not notified of any visa revocation, were advised by their universities that they had lost their lawful status and should prepare to leave the United States.\n\nThe students' lawsuit claimed that the government's action was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, violating the Administrative Procedure Act and their procedural due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. They immediately filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to have their student status restored and to prevent any arrest or deportation proceedings.\n\nThe government opposed the motion, arguing a critical distinction: terminating a student's electronic SEVIS *record* is not legally synonymous with terminating their formal F-1 immigration *status*. A declaration from a senior immigration official stated that the SEVIS record terminations were based on criminal history matches or visa revocations but affirmed that this action did not, in itself, revoke the students' legal F-1 status. The government confirmed that none of the students were in removal proceedings.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, Judge Stephen J. Murphy, III denied the students' motion for a TRO. The court found that because of the significant factual and legal uncertainty as to whether a SEVIS record termination automatically equated to a loss of legal F-1 status, the students had not shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their claims.\n\nThe case was resolved shortly thereafter. On May 29, 2025, the parties filed a stipulated order of dismissal, indicating they had reached a settlement.",
    "46385": "On April 9, 2025, two clinical law professors from Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The suit names the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce and its leadership as defendants, with Northwestern University and its leaders named as nominal defendants. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel and attorneys from the Center for Constitutional Rights.\n\nThe case arose after the House Committee, investigating alleged antisemitism on college campuses, sent a letter to Northwestern on March 27, 2025. The letter demanded a wide range of documents related to the university's Bluhm Legal Clinic, including budgets, donor lists, and policies. It also specifically requested all hiring materials and performance reviews for one of the plaintiffs, a professor who directs the Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic and represents pro-Palestinian protesters in separate litigation. The Committee's letter characterized the clinic's work as \"left-wing political activism.\"\n\nThe professors allege the Committee's demands are a pretext to punish them for their professional work, client advocacy, and protected speech. They claim the investigation has no valid legislative purpose and violates their constitutional rights, including the First Amendment (infringing on free speech, association, petition, and academic freedom), the Fifth Amendment (violating due process and equal protection), and the Sixth Amendment (interfering with the right to counsel for their clients). The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment that the Committee's demands are unconstitutional and an injunction to prevent Northwestern from producing the requested documents.\n\nContemporaneous with the complaint, the professors filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to block Northwestern's compliance with the Committee's April 10, 2025, deadline. On April 10, 2025, emergency Judge Andrea R. Wood held a hearing and denied the TRO motion as moot and without prejudice.\n\nThe case is assigned to Judge Elaine E. Bucklo. On June 24, 2025, following a joint motion by the parties, Judge Bucklo granted a stay of all proceedings until further order of the court.",
    "46353": "On April 7, 2025, an international software engineer in the United States on an F-1 student visa for post-graduate employment filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The suit was brought against the President of the United States and high-ranking officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, challenged ICE's abrupt termination of his record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a government database used to track international students.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that on March 28, 2025, ICE terminated the plaintiff's SEVIS record, citing a criminal records check, which effectively jeopardized his ability to remain and work lawfully in the U.S. The plaintiff contended that his only criminal history was a minor misdemeanor conviction that he had previously disclosed to DHS and which, under federal regulations, did not constitute a failure to maintain his F-1 status. The complaint asserted that the termination was part of a broader, unlawful policy targeting students of certain national origins—primarily African, Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim, and Asian—to coerce them into leaving the country. The plaintiff brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing the agency's action was arbitrary, capricious, and exceeded its statutory authority, and also alleged a violation of his procedural due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. He sought declaratory and injunctive relief to have his SEVIS record reinstated and to prevent any enforcement action, such as detention or removal.\n\nThe plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 16, 2025, arguing he faced irreparable harm, including the loss of his job and the risk of imminent arrest. The government opposed the motion, arguing that a SEVIS record termination is a ministerial, internal record-keeping action that does not, by itself, terminate a person's legal immigration status and therefore is not a \"final agency action\" subject to judicial review.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White and was subsequently related to numerous similar lawsuits filed by other students. After an initial ex parte TRO was granted on April 17, 2025, the court held a hearing on April 25, 2025. During the proceedings, the government announced it was developing a new policy for SEVIS terminations and would reactivate the records for the plaintiff and others similarly affected. The plaintiff’s SEVIS record was reactivated that same day. The court extended the TRO and, on May 22, 2025, granted a preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiff had raised serious questions on the merits of his APA claims and demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm. The injunction prohibits the defendants from imposing any legal consequences that might otherwise result from the SEVIS termination.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the government appealed the preliminary injunction order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Subsequently, on August 22, 2025, Judge White granted in part and denied in part the government's motion to stay proceedings in the district court pending the outcome of the appeal.",
    "46337": "On April 3, 2025, nineteen states, represented by their Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the President of the United States and the heads of several federal agencies, including the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC). The suit challenges the legality of Executive Order 14248, “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,” which was issued on March 25, 2025.\n\nThe states alleged that the Executive Order unlawfully usurped the constitutional authority over election administration that is reserved for the states and Congress. The challenged provisions of the order directed the EAC to require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship on the national mail voter registration form, ordered the Secretary of Defense to impose a similar requirement for military and overseas voters, and commanded federal and state public assistance agencies to assess an applicant's citizenship before providing a registration form. The order also reinterpreted federal law to prohibit states from counting mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day, even if postmarked on time, and directed the Attorney General to enforce this interpretation while making federal election funding contingent on compliance.\n\nThe states’ cause of action was that the President’s order was *ultra vires* (beyond his legal authority) and violated the U.S. Constitution, specifically the separation of powers and the Elections and Electors Clauses of Articles I and II, which grant regulatory power over federal elections to the states and Congress, not the Executive Branch. The states sought a declaratory judgment that the order's provisions were unlawful and an injunction to prevent their enforcement.\n\nAfter the case was assigned to Judge Denise J. Casper, the federal government unsuccessfully moved to transfer the case to the District of Columbia, where related lawsuits by private organizations were pending. On June 13, 2025, Judge Casper granted the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found the states were likely to succeed on their claims because the President lacked the authority to direct the independent, bipartisan EAC or to unilaterally impose new conditions on federal election funding contrary to statutes like the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). The court also found the states would suffer irreparable harm from the significant compliance costs and the potential disenfranchisement of eligible voters.\n\nThe court issued an injunction that was later amended on July 18, 2025. The amended order prohibits the defendants from implementing the documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for both the standard federal registration form and the form for military and overseas voters. It also enjoins enforcement of the ballot receipt deadline through civil or criminal action or through the conditioning of federal funds against the thirteen plaintiff states whose laws allow for counting ballots received after Election Day.\n\nThe defendants have since filed a motion to dismiss the case. On July 31, 2025, the defendants also filed a notice of appeal of the preliminary injunction order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.",
    "46238": "On March 17, 2025, two decorated, active-duty transgender men in the U.S. Air Force, represented by private counsel and LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The suit was brought against the U.S. Secretary of Defense, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force, the United States, and the Department of the Air Force.\n\nThe case challenged the constitutionality of two January 2025 executive orders and their implementing memoranda, which reversed a prior policy that had allowed open military service by transgender individuals. The new policy effectively banned service by individuals with a history of gender dysphoria, required all personnel to serve according to their sex assigned at birth with respect to facilities and pronouns, and defined \"sex\" as an \"immutable biological classification.\" The plaintiffs, both of whom had medically transitioned years prior and had distinguished service records, alleged that under the new policy they were removed from their duties, placed on administrative absence, and faced imminent involuntary administrative separation. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing the policy violated the Equal Protection and Due Process components of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe plaintiffs immediately moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent the government from initiating discharge proceedings against them. On March 24, 2025, Judge Christine P. O'Hearn granted the motion, issuing a 14-day TRO that enjoined the defendants from initiating separation proceedings against the two plaintiffs. The court found that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their equal protection claim and would suffer irreparable harm to their careers and reputations if the policy were enforced against them. The government subsequently requested a stay of the TRO, citing parallel litigation in other districts, including a nationwide injunction issued in *Talbott v. United States*, but Judge O'Hearn denied the request.\n\nOn May 15, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice, and the case was terminated.",
    "46234": "On March 15, 2025, a non-citizen Ph.D. student at Cornell University, along with a professor and a fellow student who are both U.S. citizens, filed a lawsuit against the President of the United States, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and its Secretary. The plaintiffs, represented by private and non-profit counsel, challenged two recent executive orders: one targeting non-citizens with \"hostile attitudes\" toward the U.S. and another aimed at combating \"anti-Semitism.\"\n\nThe complaint alleged that the executive orders were being used to unconstitutionally suppress speech critical of the U.S. and Israeli governments. The plaintiffs claimed the orders violated their First Amendment rights to free speech, association, and the right to receive information, as well as their Fifth Amendment due process rights, arguing the orders were impermissibly vague and overbroad. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to block the enforcement of these orders.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centered on the non-citizen plaintiff, an outspoken critic of U.S. foreign policy and an advocate for Palestinian rights, who alleged the orders created a chilling effect on his academic and expressive activities. The situation escalated when the U.S. government began efforts to detain him. Concurrently with their complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO).\n\nOn March 27, 2025, Judge Elizabeth C. Coombe denied the plaintiffs' motions for a TRO. The court found it likely lacked subject matter jurisdiction to interfere with removal proceedings, which are channeled exclusively through immigration courts and appellate review. Furthermore, the judge determined the plaintiffs had not established standing for some claims, which were deemed unripe, or demonstrated the immediate irreparable harm necessary for such an extraordinary remedy. The court record revealed that the non-citizen plaintiff's student visa had been revoked on March 14, 2025, the day before the lawsuit was filed, based on his protest activities.\n\nThat same day, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint and Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus. This new filing added the Department of State, the Attorney General, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials as defendants. It directly challenged the visa revocation as unlawful retaliation for protected speech and sought to prevent the plaintiff's detention and removal. The amended complaint also referenced a similar case, *Chung v. Trump*, involving a student at Columbia University.\n\nOn March 31, 2025, before the court ruled on the new requests for relief in the amended complaint, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice. The court subsequently closed the case on April 2, 2025.",
    "46216": "On March 12, 2025, two physicians and professors at Harvard Medical School, represented by the ACLU and the Media Freedom & Information Access Clinic at Yale Law School, filed a lawsuit against several federal agencies and their directors, including the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).\n\nThe lawsuit was a response to the removal of the physicians' peer-reviewed articles from the Patient Safety Network (PSNet), a website operated by AHRQ. The removals followed a January 20, 2025, Executive Order directing federal agencies to remove messages that \"promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\" An implementing memorandum from OPM on January 29, 2025, instructed agencies to take down outward-facing media containing such content. AHRQ subsequently removed the physicians' articles, one on suicide risk assessment and another on endometriosis, because they contained terms such as \"LGBTQ\" and \"transgender.\" AHRQ offered to republish the articles only if these terms were removed, a condition the authors refused.\n\nThe physicians alleged that the government's actions constituted viewpoint-based censorship in violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. They also brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing the agencies' actions were arbitrary and capricious and that OPM had exceeded its statutory authority. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to have their articles restored and to prevent future censorship. The case was assigned to Judge Leo T. Sorokin.\n\nOn April 1, 2025, the physicians moved for a preliminary injunction. The federal agencies opposed the motion, arguing in part that the matter was moot because the government’s contract to maintain the PSNet website had expired on March 24, 2025, rendering it a \"static\" site unable to accept new or restored content. The agencies also referenced a similar, earlier-filed case in the District of Columbia, *Doctors for America v. OPM*.\n\nOn May 23, 2025, Judge Sorokin granted the preliminary injunction. In his order, the judge found the physicians were likely to succeed on their First Amendment claim, describing the removal of their articles as \"a textbook example of viewpoint discrimination.\" The court rejected the agencies' jurisdictional and mootness arguments. The resulting injunction, also dated May 23, 2025, ordered the agencies to restore the physicians' complete, unaltered articles—as well as all other content removed from PSNet under the same policy—within seven days. The injunction remains in effect until a final judgment is entered.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, the federal agencies filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, reasserting their arguments that the physicians' claims are moot and that they lack standing.",
    "46207": "On March 7, 2025, three incarcerated transgender individuals, represented by a coalition of civil rights organizations including the ACLU and the Transgender Law Center, filed a class-action lawsuit against the President of the United States, the U.S. Attorney General, and several officials of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The case challenges the government's categorical ban on gender-affirming health care for people in federal custody.\n\nThe lawsuit was a direct response to Executive Order 14168, issued on January 20, 2025, which prohibited the use of federal funds for any medical care \"for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\" In February 2025, the BOP issued two memoranda implementing this order, which reversed its long-standing policy of providing individualized, medically necessary gender-affirming care—including hormone therapy and social accommodations like appropriate clothing and commissary items—to incarcerated people diagnosed with gender dysphoria. As a result of the new policy, the named plaintiffs and others had their prescribed treatments discontinued or were informed that termination of their care was imminent, causing them severe psychological distress, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the ban violated their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment (deliberate indifference to serious medical needs) and the Fifth Amendment's equal protection component. They also brought claims under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing the BOP's implementing memoranda were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to block enforcement of the Executive Order and the BOP memoranda and to restore access to care.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. On March 17, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and for class certification. After briefing, which included an amicus brief from 24 states in support of the defendants, the court held a hearing.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, Judge Lamberth issued a memorandum opinion and order granting the plaintiffs' motions. The court granted a preliminary injunction, finding the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their APA claim that the BOP's memoranda were arbitrary and capricious. The judge reasoned that the BOP failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its abrupt policy reversal, did not justify treating gender dysphoria differently from other medical conditions, and did not properly consider the serious reliance interests of inmates who depended on the now-prohibited care. The court also found that the plaintiffs demonstrated they would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction.\n\nThe court certified a class consisting of \"all persons who are currently or will be incarcerated in BOP facilities with a current diagnosis of gender dysphoria or who receive such a diagnosis in the future.\" The injunction ordered the BOP to provide hormone therapy and social accommodations to class members to the same extent they were available before the Executive Order was issued. On August 20, 2025, the court granted a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction, extending the relief through November 30, 2025. The case is related to *Doe v. McHenry*, No. 25-cv-286.",
    "46104": "On February 11, 2025, a nonpartisan, non-profit government watchdog organization filed a lawsuit against several federal executive branch entities, including the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (collectively, “DOGE”) and the Office of Management and Budget. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and is assigned to Judge Beryl A. Howell. The organization, represented by its in-house counsel, alleges that the federal entities violated the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552, by failing to respond to eight records requests.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the government to process the FOIA requests, some of which seek expedited review. The requests concern the new administration’s mass firing of at least 17 federal inspectors general and communications involving Elon Musk, who the complaint alleges leads the newly created DOGE. According to the complaint, DOGE was established by executive order to increase government efficiency and has wielded substantial independent authority, including accessing sensitive agency data systems, directing personnel actions, and freezing funds.\n\nAfter the initial complaint was filed, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on March 5, 2025, providing additional factual detail. The DOGE-related defendants subsequently denied the FOIA requests, asserting that they are not an \"agency\" subject to FOIA but are instead part of the Executive Office of the President, whose records are governed by the Presidential Records Act.\n\nOn March 24, 2025, citing concerns that DOGE staff were using ephemeral messaging apps for official business, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preservation order. On April 2, 2025, the court granted the motion, ordering the defendants to preserve all records potentially responsive to the FOIA requests.\n\nThe central dispute in the litigation has become whether the DOGE entities are an \"agency\" subject to FOIA. To address this, the non-profit organization filed a Motion for Limited Discovery on June 2, 2025, arguing that a factual inquiry into DOGE’s structure, authority, and operations is necessary to resolve its status, citing D.C. Circuit precedent. The motion references other ongoing litigation challenging DOGE's status and actions, including *AFL-CIO v. Dep't of Lab.*, 2025 WL 542825. As of the last available filings, the motion for discovery has been fully briefed and is pending before the court.",
    "46602": "On May 15, 2025, a nonprofit organization representing 55 of the 56 state and jurisdictional humanities councils, along with one of its members, the Oregon humanities council, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sued the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), its acting chairman, the U.S. DOGE Service (an executive branch component), and its acting administrator.\n\nThe lawsuit was a response to the defendants' actions in April 2025, when, at the direction of the newly formed DOGE Service, the NEH abruptly terminated nearly all grants awarded to the state and jurisdictional humanities councils during the prior administration. These terminations affected congressionally mandated general operating support grants that the councils rely on to fund local humanities programs, such as those for rural libraries, schools, and cultural preservation. The plaintiffs alleged the terminations were executed via boilerplate emails without the notice, opportunity to be heard, or appeal process required by federal law. Concurrently, the NEH terminated approximately 80% of its staff, effectively dismantling the Office of Federal/State Partnership responsible for administering the council grants.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted that these actions were unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious, and constituted an unreasonable delay of agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They also claimed the defendants' refusal to disburse congressionally appropriated funds violated the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers principles, including the Appropriations and Take Care Clauses. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore the grant funding and halt the dismantling of the federal-state partnership. On June 11, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding details about a partial \"rescission\" of the terminations in early June, which they alleged was also unlawful as it still halved the promised funding without proper procedure.\n\nOn June 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. On August 6, 2025, Judge Michael H. Simon granted the motion. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their APA and separation of powers claims. Judge Simon's opinion stated that the NEH likely acted contrary to law by failing to follow the statutory process for grant terminations, which requires notice, a hearing, and specific findings of noncompliance. The court also found the NEH likely violated the law by ignoring the mandatory statutory formula for allocating funds to the councils. Furthermore, the court concluded that the mass terminations and partial rescissions were likely arbitrary and capricious because the agency failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its change in policy and did not consider the councils' significant reliance interests.\n\nThe court issued a preliminary injunction and a stay under the APA, effective August 6, 2025, and lasting until further court order. The injunction prohibits the defendants from implementing the April 2, 2025, grant terminations against the plaintiffs and all member councils of the Federation. It also bars the defendants from further suspending or canceling the grants approved as of that date, except for cause as specified in the statute, and from reallocating the funds committed to the councils.",
    "46478": "On April 22, 2025, two family-owned American companies that develop and sell educational products filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit was brought against the President of the United States and the heads and agencies of the Departments of Homeland Security, Treasury, and Commerce, as well as the U.S. Trade Representative and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel.\n\nThe case challenges a series of executive orders issued in early 2025 through which the President imposed broad and substantial new tariffs on goods imported from China and nearly all other U.S. trading partners. These tariffs, which reached a minimum of 145% on most goods from China and included a 10% universal tariff on most other imports, were justified by the President as necessary to address declared national emergencies related to fentanyl trafficking and persistent U.S. trade deficits. The plaintiffs, who import the majority of their products, alleged these tariffs were causing irreparable harm to their businesses.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that the President's actions exceeded his statutory authority. The plaintiffs' primary claim is that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq., the statute invoked by the President, does not grant the authority to impose tariffs. Alternatively, they argued that even if IEEPA permits some tariffs, the specific ones imposed were not reasonably related to the declared emergencies and served other purposes. The plaintiffs also raised a constitutional challenge, asserting that if IEEPA were interpreted to grant such sweeping authority, it would constitute an unconstitutional delegation of Congress's legislative power under Article I of the Constitution.\n\nShortly after the case was filed, the government defendants moved on April 24, 2025, to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), arguing the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction over legal challenges involving tariffs. On the same day, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the government from collecting the tariffs from them while the case proceeded.\n\nOn May 29, 2025, Judge Rudolph Contreras issued a memorandum opinion resolving both motions. He denied the government's motion to transfer, concluding that the district court had jurisdiction because the central legal question was whether IEEPA is a law \"providing for\" tariffs, a question he answered in the negative. Judge Contreras then granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding they were likely to succeed on their claim that the President's actions were *ultra vires*. The court ruled that IEEPA's text, context, and legislative history do not authorize the President to impose tariffs. The injunction was narrowly tailored to prohibit the collection of the challenged tariffs from the two plaintiff companies.\n\nThe government filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on May 29, 2025. On June 2, 2025, the government moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending the appeal, arguing it would cause irreparable harm to national security and foreign policy negotiations. On June 3, 2025, Judge Contreras granted the stay, and the district court case is now stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.",
    "46390": "On April 12, 2025, the ACLU and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network filed a class-action habeas corpus petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The petitioners are Venezuelan noncitizens detained in Colorado who are at risk of summary removal from the United States under a March 14, 2025, Presidential Proclamation. The Proclamation invoked the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798, a wartime statute, to target alleged members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) criminal gang, authorizing their removal without the standard procedures and humanitarian protections provided by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\n\nThe suit was filed after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a related case, *Trump v. J.G.G.*, 2025 WL 1024097 (U.S. Apr. 7, 2025), stayed a nationwide injunction, ruling that challenges to the Proclamation must be brought through individual habeas petitions in the district of confinement. The petitioners argue that the President’s use of the AEA is unlawful because a criminal gang does not constitute a \"foreign nation or government\" and its activities do not constitute a military \"invasion or predatory incursion\" as required by the statute. They also allege violations of their statutory rights under the INA and their constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The petitioners sought a writ of habeas corpus along with declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent their removal.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Charlotte N. Sweeney. On April 22, 2025, Judge Sweeney granted the petitioners' motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), provisionally certifying a class of all noncitizens in custody in Colorado subject to the Proclamation. The TRO, published at *D.B.U. v. Trump*, 2025 WL 1163530 (D. Colo. Apr. 22, 2025), prohibited the government from transferring class members out of the district and required 21 days' notice before any removal under the AEA.\n\nThe government immediately appealed the TRO and sought an emergency stay from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. On April 29, 2025, the Tenth Circuit denied the stay, finding the government had not shown it would suffer irreparable harm. *D.B.U. v. Trump*, 2025 WL 1233583 (10th Cir. Apr. 29, 2025). The government subsequently voluntarily dismissed this appeal.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, Judge Sweeney issued two key orders. First, she formally granted the motion for class certification. Second, she granted the petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the government from detaining, transferring, or removing any class member from the District of Colorado under the authority of the AEA Proclamation pending the final resolution of the case. The government filed a new notice of appeal to the Tenth Circuit on July 7, 2025, challenging the preliminary injunction and class certification orders.",
    "46499": "On April 11, 2025, four international students with F-1 visas filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The students, represented by private counsel and later joined by the Chinese American Legal Defense Alliance, alleged that in early April 2025, the federal government initiated a sweeping, nationwide termination of the immigration records (known as SEVIS records) of hundreds or thousands of F-1 students. The terminations were carried out without prior notice, explanation, or an opportunity for the students to be heard. The students, all of whom maintained good academic standing and had never been convicted of a crime, argued that the government's actions were based on minor, dismissed, or expunged prior contacts with law enforcement, which is not a lawful basis for termination under federal regulations.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and violated the students' rights under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The students sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore their legal status and prevent future unlawful terminations.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Susan Illston, who on April 18, 2025, issued a temporary restraining order limited to the four named plaintiffs, enjoining DHS and ICE from arresting them or imposing other adverse legal effects from the SEVIS terminations. Shortly thereafter, the case was related to several other lawsuits filed by F-1 students in the same district and was reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White for consolidated proceedings.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, Judge White granted a nationwide preliminary injunction. The order prohibits DHS and ICE from arresting or transferring the plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals based on the terminations, imposing any adverse legal effect from the terminations, and reversing the subsequent reinstatement of their SEVIS records for reasons not permitted by regulation without court approval.\n\nFollowing the injunction, the students filed a First Amended Complaint on July 29, 2025, adding three new plaintiffs and the Secretary of State as a defendant. The amended complaint alleges that the Department of State unlawfully revoked the F-1 visas of many affected students as part of the same government initiative. The students then filed a motion to amend the preliminary injunction to include the Secretary of State and compel the restoration of the revoked visas.\n\nThe government defendants have appealed Judge White's preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On August 8, 2025, they filed a motion in the district court seeking to stay the injunction pending the appeal, arguing that its nationwide scope is an improper universal injunction and that it unlawfully restricts the government's law enforcement authority.",
    "46319": "On March 31, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union, a labor union representing federal employees, filed a lawsuit against the President of the United States and the heads of various federal agencies. The suit challenges a presidential executive order issued on March 27, 2025, that stripped collective bargaining rights from approximately two-thirds of the federal workforce. The union, represented by its in-house counsel, alleged that the executive order was an unlawful overreach of presidential authority (*ultra vires*) and constituted retaliation in violation of the First Amendment.\n\nThe legal claims are based on the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). The President invoked a narrow provision of the statute, 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1), which permits the exclusion of agencies from collective bargaining requirements if they have a \"primary function\" of national security work and the statute cannot be applied consistently with national security. The union argued this rationale was pretextual, contending the affected agencies do not primarily perform national security work and that the administration's own statements revealed the true motivations were to make federal employees easier to fire and to retaliate against unions for opposing the President's agenda. The union sought declaratory and injunctive relief to block the order's implementation.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The union filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which Judge Friedman granted on April 25, 2025. In his opinion (2025 WL 1218044), the judge found the union was likely to succeed on its claim that the order was *ultra vires*. He concluded that the union had presented \"clear evidence\" to rebut the presumption of regularity afforded to presidential actions, pointing to the order's unprecedented scope and a White House Fact Sheet that suggested retaliatory motives. The court found the President had applied an overly broad interpretation of \"national security\" and that the union would suffer irreparable harm from the loss of bargaining power and dues revenue.\n\nThe government immediately appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and moved to stay the injunction. On May 16, 2025, a divided appellate panel granted the stay. The majority found the government was likely to succeed on appeal because the union had not demonstrated irreparable harm, reasoning that any injury was speculative since the government had advised agencies not to terminate collective bargaining agreements pending the litigation's outcome. A dissenting judge argued the government had failed to show it would be irreparably harmed by the injunction.\n\nFollowing the appellate court's stay, the case returned to the district court. The parties have since filed cross-motions for summary judgment, which are fully briefed and pending before Judge Friedman. A related case, *American Foreign Service Ass’n v. Trump*, is also pending.",
    "46285": "On March 24, 2025, three nonprofit, membership-based immigrant rights organizations filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the President and senior officials of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its component agencies. The suit challenges a series of administration policies issued in early 2025 that terminated various humanitarian parole programs and expanded the use of expedited removal, a summary deportation process with limited due process protections.\n\nThe organizations, represented by private non-profit counsel, brought the case on behalf of their members, who include noncitizens lawfully paroled into the United States at ports of entry under programs for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) or through the CBP One mobile application. The factual basis of the case is that these individuals, after entering the U.S. legally and beginning to establish lives, were unlawfully targeted for summary deportation by three specific agency actions: a January 23, 2025 DHS memorandum, a February 18, 2025 ICE directive, and a March 25, 2025 Federal Register notice.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment that applying expedited removal to individuals previously granted parole is unlawful, as well as an injunction to stop the government from enforcing these policies. The legal claims are based on the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), specifically 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), with jurisdiction cited under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3). The plaintiffs argue the policies exceed the government's statutory authority and are arbitrary and capricious. They also raised a claim under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n\nAfter the government filed a motion to dismiss on May 30, 2025, the organizations filed a First Amended Complaint on June 11, 2025. This amended complaint, which mooted the motion to dismiss, added new factual allegations that DHS had begun an aggressive enforcement campaign, including arresting parolees at courthouses following their routine immigration hearings to place them in expedited removal. The amended complaint also added claims that the policies violated the government's own regulations and that the underlying regulatory definition of \"arriving alien\" (8 C.F.R. § 1.2) is itself unlawful.\n\nOn the same day they amended their complaint, the organizations filed a motion for a stay of agency action to halt the enforcement of the challenged policies. On August 1, 2025, Judge Jia M. Cobb issued a detailed memorandum opinion and order granting the motion. The court found that the organizations were likely to succeed on the merits, reasoning that the challenged policies exceeded DHS's statutory authority under both the \"Arriving Aliens Provision\" and the \"Designation Provision\" of the INA. Judge Cobb also found the policies were likely arbitrary and capricious because they offered conflicting and unexplained legal justifications for subjecting parolees to expedited removal.\n\nThe court issued a nationwide stay of the three challenged agency actions, effective for the duration of the litigation. The order prohibits the government from applying expedited removal to any noncitizen who has, at any time, been paroled into the United States at a port of entry. The government filed a notice of appeal of Judge Cobb's order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on August 5, 2025. The case is related to other federal lawsuits, including *Make the Road New York v. Huffman* and *Svitlana Doe v. Noem*.",
    "46179": "On February 24, 2025, two Senate-confirmed members of the U.S. Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit was brought against the PCLOB itself, a remaining Board member, the Board's Executive Director, the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel, and the President of the United States, all in their official capacities. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, challenged their removal from the Board by the President.\n\nThe factual basis of the case is that on January 27, 2025, the two plaintiffs, along with a third member, were terminated from their positions on the PCLOB without cause. All three removed members were affiliated with the Democratic Party, and their removal left the five-member Board with only one member and without the three-person quorum required to conduct its official business.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that their removals were unlawful under the PCLOB's governing statute, 42 U.S.C. § 2000ee, as amended by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. They contended that while the statute does not contain an express for-cause removal provision, Congress clearly intended to protect Board members from at-will removal by making several key changes in 2007: establishing the PCLOB as an \"independent agency,\" removing it from the Executive Office of the President, deleting language stating that members \"serve at the pleasure of the President,\" and adding a provision that members \"shall serve a term of 6 years.\" Their lawsuit was brought under the Administrative Procedure Act and included claims for ultra vires action and violations of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to nullify their terminations and restore them to their positions.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Reggie B. Walton and was decided on cross-motions for summary judgment. On May 21, 2025, Judge Walton granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. In a detailed memorandum opinion (2025 WL 1454010), the court ruled that although the statute lacks an express removal restriction, the PCLOB’s structure (a multi-member, nonpartisan, expert body with staggered terms) and its quasi-legislative function (providing independent oversight of the executive branch for Congress) are \"operationally incompatible with at-will Presidential removal.\" The court found that the PCLOB fits within the exception to the President's removal power established in *Humphrey's Executor v. United States*.\n\nThe court's order, also issued on May 21, 2025, declared the terminations unlawful, null, and void. It ordered that the plaintiffs remain members of the PCLOB for the duration of their statutory terms and could only be removed for cause. The order enjoined the defendants (excluding the President) from treating the plaintiffs as removed and from interfering with their official duties. On May 29, 2025, the District Court denied the government's motion to stay the order pending appeal.\n\nThe government appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On July 1, 2025, a panel of the D.C. Circuit granted the government's motion and stayed the District Court's order pending the appeal. The appellate court found that the government had made a strong showing that it was likely to succeed on the merits, reasoning that the PCLOB's statute lacks the \"very clear and explicit language\" required to restrict the President's removal power over principal officers and that the PCLOB is not an adjudicatory body, distinguishing it from cases where removal protections have been implied.",
    "46106": "On February 11, 2025, two labor unions representing federal employees, along with several current and former government employees, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, sued the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), its Acting Director, and officials associated with the newly created \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE), including its director, Elon Musk.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that on and after January 20, 2025, OPM granted DOGE agents sweeping, \"administrative\" access to its computer systems, which contain highly sensitive personal, financial, and employment records for millions of federal employees. The plaintiffs claimed this access was granted without the proper security vetting or clearances required by law and OPM's own protocols. The suit sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting that the defendants' actions violated the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order on February 14, 2025. In response, on March 14, the government defendants moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing because they had not suffered a concrete injury and that their claims were not legally viable.\n\nOn April 3, 2025, Judge Denise L. Cote issued an opinion and order (2025 WL 996542) that largely denied the motion to dismiss. The court ruled that the plaintiffs had established standing, finding that the unauthorized access to their private information constituted a concrete injury analogous to the common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion. The court allowed the APA claims to proceed, reasoning that OPM's actions constituted \"final agency action\" and that the Privacy Act did not provide an adequate alternative remedy for the injunctive relief sought. The direct claims for injunctive relief under the Privacy Act itself were dismissed, though the underlying violations could serve as the basis for the APA claims.\n\nFollowing this decision, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on April 25, 2025. After an evidentiary hearing, Judge Cote granted the motion on June 9, 2025. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that OPM had violated the Privacy Act by disclosing records to individuals who either were not OPM employees or lacked a legitimate \"need to know,\" and by failing to establish appropriate security safeguards. A formal preliminary injunction was issued on June 20, 2025, which requires OPM to report on the procedures it has implemented to ensure future compliance with the Privacy Act. The order was administratively stayed for 14 days and became effective after the plaintiffs posted a $1,000 bond. The case is noted to be related to similar lawsuits challenging DOGE activities at other federal agencies.",
    "46095": "On February 10, 2025, several associations of universities, numerous individual universities, and other research institutions, represented by private counsel, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The case was consolidated for proceedings with two similar lawsuits, one filed by 22 states and another by a group of medical associations.\n\nThe lawsuit challenged guidance issued by NIH on Friday, February 7, 2025, which was set to take effect the following Monday. This guidance unilaterally imposed a 15% cap on the reimbursement of \"indirect costs\" for all new and existing NIH research grants awarded to institutions of higher education. Indirect costs, which cover essential research support like facility maintenance, utilities, and administration, had for decades been reimbursed based on rates individually negotiated with each institution. The plaintiffs argued that this sudden change, made without notice, would devastate medical research, force layoffs, halt critical clinical trials, and upend significant financial commitments made in reliance on the established system.\n\nThe plaintiffs' cause of action was under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They alleged the NIH guidance was unlawful because it violated Section 224 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024—a legislative rider Congress enacted in 2018 and renewed annually specifically to prevent NIH from modifying the negotiated rate system. The plaintiffs further claimed the guidance was arbitrary and capricious, violated HHS's own regulations, was procedurally invalid for lacking a notice-and-comment period, and was impermissibly retroactive in its application to existing grants. They sought a declaratory judgment, vacatur of the guidance, and injunctive relief to prevent its implementation.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Angel Kelley of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Following the filing of a motion for a temporary restraining order, the court issued a nationwide temporary restraining order to maintain the status quo. After briefing and a hearing, Judge Kelley granted a nationwide preliminary injunction on March 5, 2025. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the guidance violated the congressional appropriations rider and existing HHS regulations. The court also determined the action was arbitrary and capricious for failing to provide adequate reasoning and for ignoring the institutions' significant reliance interests, and that it was procedurally improper and impermissibly retroactive.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, upon an assented-to motion by the parties to expedite an appeal, the court converted the preliminary injunction into a final judgment and permanent injunction. The final decree permanently enjoined the federal government from implementing the guidance nationwide and formally vacated the guidance in its entirety. The government filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on April 8, 2025.",
    "46023": "On February 3, 2025, three large membership organizations—an advocate for retired Americans and two labor unions representing government and service employees—filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, the Department of the Treasury, and its Bureau of the Fiscal Service. The plaintiffs, represented by Public Citizen Litigation Group and the State Democracy Defenders Fund, allege that the Treasury Department unlawfully granted individuals affiliated with a new initiative, the \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE), access to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's payment systems. These systems contain sensitive personal and financial data, including Social Security numbers, bank account details, and tax information, for millions of Americans.\n\nThe complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and assigned to Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs contend that granting DOGE affiliates access to this data is arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and exceeds the agency's statutory authority by violating the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. § 6103).\n\nThe plaintiffs immediately moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO). Following a hearing, the parties agreed to a consent order, entered by the court on February 6, 2025, which deferred a ruling on the TRO. The order prohibited the defendants from providing access to their payment systems, with an exception for two named individuals designated as Special Government Employees who were granted \"read only\" access for their official duties. The order was later modified on February 20, 2025, to substitute a new employee for one who had resigned.\n\nThe court converted the TRO motion into a motion for a preliminary injunction. On March 7, 2025, Judge Kollar-Kotelly issued a memorandum opinion denying the preliminary injunction (*All. for Retired Ams. v. Bessent*, 2025 WL 740401 (D.D.C. Mar. 7, 2025)). The court found that while the plaintiffs had established Article III standing, they failed to demonstrate a likelihood of suffering irreparable harm under the D.C. Circuit's high standard, which requires a showing that the harm is \"both certain and great.\" The denial of the injunction also dissolved the interim consent order.\n\nFollowing the ruling, the court ordered the defendants to produce the administrative record. After the plaintiffs objected to its contents, the court granted a subsequent motion for limited, expedited discovery, finding the record was insufficient to \"ascertain the contours of the precise policy at issue.\" The defendants have since filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, and the plaintiffs have filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The case is ongoing, with these dispositive motions pending before the court. The proceedings have referenced several related cases challenging the DOGE initiative's access to records at other federal agencies.",
    "46563": "On May 2, 2025, a coalition of eight U.S. cities and counties filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Transportation (DOT), the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and their respective secretaries. The plaintiffs, represented by a combination of private law firms, public interest organizations, and their own government counsel, challenged new conditions the agencies began imposing on federal grant agreements. The lawsuit has since expanded significantly, with two amended complaints adding over twenty more local government entities and public agencies as plaintiffs, and including the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as defendants.\n\nThe lawsuit's factual basis is that following a series of executive orders, the federal agencies unilaterally inserted new, unauthorized conditions into agreements for congressionally-appropriated funds. These funds, totaling over $4 billion, support critical local services, including HUD's Continuum of Care (CoC) grants for homelessness assistance and various DOT and HHS grants for transportation and public health. The challenged conditions require grant recipients to certify they do not operate programs promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI); agree to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement; use specific systems to verify the immigration status of beneficiaries; and not use funds to \"promote\" what the administration defines as \"gender ideology\" or \"elective abortion.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that the conditions are unlawful. Their causes of action are rooted in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the U.S. Constitution, alleging that the agencies' actions violate the separation of powers, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment's anti-commandeering principle, and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (void-for-vagueness doctrine).\n\nThe case is before Judge Barbara J. Rothstein in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. After the initial filing, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which Judge Rothstein granted on May 7, 2025. As new plaintiffs joined the case, the court granted a second TRO on May 23, 2025.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, Judge Rothstein granted a preliminary injunction covering all plaintiffs and claims in the First Amended Complaint. The court rejected the federal government's argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, finding the case was based on constitutional and statutory rights, not contract law, and sought equitable relief rather than monetary damages. The court found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, reasoning that the agencies exceeded their statutory authority and violated the separation of powers by imposing conditions not authorized by Congress. The judge also found the actions were likely arbitrary and capricious under the APA. A third preliminary injunction was granted on August 12, 2025, extending this relief to the additional plaintiffs and claims included in the Second Amended Complaint.\n\nThe preliminary injunctions, which remain in effect pending further court orders, prohibit the defendant agencies from imposing or enforcing the challenged grant conditions and from withholding funds from the plaintiffs for refusing to accept them. The federal government filed a notice of appeal of the June 3 preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on June 9, 2025.",
    "46484": "On April 23, 2025, the American Bar Association (ABA), represented by counsel from the Democracy Forward Foundation, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and two of its senior officials, the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General. The suit alleged that the DOJ unlawfully retaliated against the ABA for exercising its First Amendment rights.\n\nThe complaint states that for decades, the ABA’s Commission on Domestic & Sexual Violence had received federal grants from the DOJ’s Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) to fund trainings and provide technical assistance for legal professionals working with survivors of domestic and sexual violence. In early 2025, the ABA issued public statements critical of the administration and joined a lawsuit challenging the administration’s actions on an unrelated matter. On April 9, 2025, the Deputy Attorney General issued a memorandum to all DOJ employees restricting their engagement with the ABA, citing the ABA’s lawsuit and its support for “activist causes.” The following day, the DOJ terminated all five of the ABA’s active OVW grants, totaling $3.2 million, stating only that the grants no longer effectuated “agency priorities.”\n\nThe ABA’s lawsuit sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting that the grant terminations violated the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. The primary claim was that the DOJ’s action constituted unlawful retaliation for the ABA’s protected speech and its right to petition the government through litigation.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Christopher R. Cooper of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The day after filing the complaint, the ABA moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to bar the DOJ from enforcing the grant terminations. On May 14, 2025, Judge Cooper granted the motion for a preliminary injunction. In the accompanying memorandum opinion, the court found that the ABA was likely to succeed on the merits of its First Amendment retaliation claim. The court rejected the government’s argument that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims, ruling that the claim was based on the Constitution, not contract law. The opinion noted the strong causal link between the ABA’s protected speech, the Deputy Attorney General’s critical memorandum, and the immediate termination of the grants the next day. The court ordered the DOJ to cease enforcing the termination and to continue disbursing funds under the existing grant agreements.\n\nFollowing the injunction, the parties entered discussions to resolve the matter. On July 17, 2025, the court struck the DOJ’s motion to dismiss as moot and administratively closed the case, pending periodic joint status reports from the parties.",
    "46279": "On March 23, 2025, four noncitizens with final removal orders filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Attorney General, and other officials. Represented by legal services organizations, the plaintiffs challenged a government policy of deporting or seeking to deport noncitizens to a \"third country\"—a country not designated in their original removal proceedings—without providing advance written notice or a meaningful opportunity to present claims that they would face persecution or torture there. The plaintiffs alleged this policy violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act (FARRA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the practice.\n\nThe case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts and assigned to Judge Brian E. Murphy. The plaintiffs immediately sought a temporary restraining order (TRO), citing a February 18, 2025, DHS directive that instructed officers to review cases for third-country removal and re-detention, placing numerous noncitizens at imminent risk. One named plaintiff, O.C.G., had already been granted protection from removal to his native Guatemala but was then removed without notice to Mexico, where he had previously been assaulted, and was ultimately returned to Guatemala.\n\nOn March 28, 2025, Judge Murphy granted a TRO, finding the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their due process claims. The order enjoined the government from removing class members to a third country without first providing written notice and a meaningful opportunity to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). The government's appeal of the TRO was denied a stay by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nFollowing a hearing, on April 18, 2025, the district court certified a class of all individuals with final removal orders whom DHS has deported or will deport to a non-designated third country on or after February 18, 2025. The court also issued a preliminary injunction requiring that before any such removal, the government must provide written notice to the individual and their counsel in a language they understand, and a meaningful opportunity to seek CAT protection. The injunction specified that if a \"reasonable fear\" is found, the government must move to reopen immigration proceedings; if not, the individual must be given 15 days to file their own motion to reopen.\n\nDisputes over compliance arose quickly. After the government attempted to remove class members to South Sudan on May 20, 2025, with less than 24 hours' notice, the court found the government in violation of the preliminary injunction. On May 21, 2025, the court clarified that a \"meaningful opportunity\" requires a minimum of 10 days' notice before removal. As a remedy for the violation, the court ordered that the affected class members, who were being held at a U.S. military base in Djibouti, be given a reasonable fear interview with access to counsel, either abroad or upon return to the U.S.\n\nIn a key development, the government filed a notice on May 16, 2025, retracting its earlier sworn declaration that plaintiff O.C.G. had been asked about and denied any fear of removal to Mexico. Based on this retraction, on May 23, 2025, Judge Murphy ordered the government to facilitate O.C.G.’s immediate return to the United States.\n\nThe government appealed the preliminary injunction and, after the First Circuit denied a stay, sought relief from the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted a stay of the preliminary injunction pending the outcome of the appeal. The case remains active in the district court, where the parties have filed motions for summary judgment and to stay proceedings pending the appeal.",
    "46186": "On February 28, 2025, a coalition of noncitizens, their U.S.-based sponsors, and the Haitian Bridge Alliance filed a class-action lawsuit against the President of the United States and senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its component agencies. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and non-profit legal organizations, challenge the Trump administration's actions to terminate various humanitarian parole programs and suspend the processing of immigration applications for those already granted parole.\n\nThe lawsuit was prompted by a series of executive orders and agency memoranda issued on and after Inauguration Day, January 20, 2025. These directives terminated several \"categorical\" parole programs, including Uniting for Ukraine (U4U), the processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV), Operation Allies Welcome (OAW) for Afghans, Family Reunification Parole (FRP), Military Parole-in-Place (MPIP), and the Central American Minors (CAM) program. The administration's stated legal basis was that these programs were \"blatantly inconsistent\" with the Immigration and Nationality Act's requirement for \"case-by-case\" parole grants. Concurrently, DHS suspended the adjudication of all other immigration benefit applications—such as for asylum, Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and green cards—for individuals already in the U.S. through these programs, citing a need to review vetting standards.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege these actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as they are contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and in excess of statutory authority. They also bring a claim under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The suit seeks declaratory judgments that the parole programs are lawful and the administration's actions are illegal, as well as injunctive relief to resume the processing of parole and other immigration benefit applications.\n\nThe case is before Judge Indira Talwani of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Key proceedings and rulings include:\n\n*   **CHNV Parole Termination:** On March 25, 2025, DHS published a Federal Register Notice officially terminating the CHNV programs and announcing that all existing two-year grants of CHNV parole would be truncated, ending on April 24, 2025. In response to an emergency motion from the plaintiffs, Judge Talwani issued a preliminary injunction on April 14, 2025, staying the mass termination of existing CHNV parole grants and work authorizations. On the same day, the court certified a class of all CHNV parolees affected by the termination.\n*   **Appeal and Supreme Court Stay:** The government appealed the April 14 injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which denied a stay pending appeal on May 5, 2025. The government then sought emergency relief from the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted a stay on May 30, 2025. The Supreme Court's order allows the government to terminate the existing CHNV parole grants while the appeal proceeds in the First Circuit.\n*   **Suspension of Benefits Adjudication:** On May 28, 2025, Judge Talwani granted a separate preliminary injunction staying the government's suspension of adjudications for other immigration benefits. This order requires DHS to resume processing applications for re-parole (for programs like U4U and OAW), initial parole under the MPIP program, and other benefits like asylum and TPS for all parolee class members. The court also amended its class certification order to include subclasses for these affected individuals.\n*   **Ongoing Proceedings:** The government has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and the plaintiffs have filed a motion for partial summary judgment regarding the termination of CHNV parole. The court has issued several orders directing DHS to report on its compliance with the May 28 injunction amidst plaintiffs' allegations that processing holds have continued. The government has also appealed the May 28 injunction and class certification order.",
    "46180": "On February 25, 2025, several national and state-level professional organizations for educators and sociologists filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and its senior officials in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel from the Democracy Forward Foundation, were later joined by a public school district from Oregon.\n\nThe case centered on a \"Dear Colleague Letter\" issued by the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights on February 14, 2025. The letter announced a new interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 following the Supreme Court's decision in *Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College*. The plaintiffs alleged that the letter unlawfully misrepresented existing law to prohibit or chill a wide range of educational activities, including teaching about \"systemic and structural racism,\" offering Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, and supporting student affinity groups.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that the letter was an unlawful agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it was arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and was a legislative rule promulgated without the required notice-and-comment period. They also alleged the letter violated the First Amendment's guarantees of free speech and association and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause due to its vagueness.\n\nAfter the initial filing, the case was assigned to Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher. The court questioned whether Maryland was the most appropriate venue but ultimately found it was proper. The scope of the litigation expanded when, on April 3, 2025, the Department of Education demanded that state and local education agencies certify their compliance with the legal interpretation embodied in the letter (the \"Certification Requirement\"). The plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction to block the letter and a second motion to block the certification.\n\nOn April 24, 2025, Judge Gallagher issued a memorandum opinion and an order staying the February 14 Dear Colleague Letter under APA § 705. The court found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their APA claim, concluding the letter was likely a legislative rule that had improperly bypassed notice-and-comment procedures, was arbitrary and capricious, exceeded the Department's statutory authority, and was contrary to the First Amendment. The court denied the motion to enjoin the Certification Requirement at that time because it had not yet been challenged in the operative complaint.\n\nFollowing the ruling, the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint to add claims specifically challenging the Certification Requirement on the same APA and constitutional grounds. The parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nOn August 14, 2025, Judge Gallagher issued a final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on most of their claims. In her memorandum opinion, she held that both the Dear Colleague Letter and the Certification Requirement were unlawful legislative rules that violated the APA's procedural requirements. She further found the actions were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded the Department's statutory authority, and violated the First and Fifth Amendments. The court's final order vacated both the February 14, 2025 Dear Colleague Letter and the April 3, 2025 Certification Requirement.",
    "46119": "On February 13, 2025, a group of 26 current and former employees and contractors of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The suit was brought against a senior presidential advisor, the United States DOGE Service, and the Department of Government Efficiency (collectively “DOGE”), an entity created by Executive Order to improve government efficiency. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and a non-profit advocacy group, alleged that the advisor, acting as the de facto head of DOGE without having been appointed as a principal officer with the advice and consent of the Senate, had begun to unconstitutionally dismantle USAID.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the advisor and his DOGE team took control of USAID’s digital infrastructure, shut down its headquarters and website, placed a majority of its workforce on administrative leave, and began terminating contracts and grants. The plaintiffs claimed these actions caused them financial, professional, and reputational harm, and created anxiety over the security of their sensitive personal data which had been accessed by DOGE personnel. The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting violations of the U.S. Constitution’s Appointments Clause and the separation of powers doctrine.\n\nOn February 18, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. After a hearing, Judge Theodore D. Chuang granted the motion in part on March 18, 2025. In his opinion (*J. Does 1-26 v. Musk*, 2025 WL 840574 (D. Md. Mar. 18, 2025)), Judge Chuang found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims, concluding that the advisor was exercising the authority of a principal officer without a proper appointment and that the executive branch's actions to effectively eliminate a congressionally established agency likely violated separation of powers. The injunction prohibited the defendants from taking further action to shut down USAID and required the reinstatement of employees’ access to agency systems.\n\nThe government immediately appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which granted a stay of the injunction on March 28, 2025, pending the appeal's resolution.\n\nWhile the appeal was pending, the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint on May 30, 2025, which reframed the case as a proposed class action and added new defendants, including USAID itself, the U.S. Department of State, the President, the Secretary of State, and other high-level officials. On August 13, 2025, Judge Chuang granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss, allowing the core constitutional claims against the presidential advisor, DOGE, USAID, and certain officials in their official capacities to proceed. On August 18, 2025, the court certified a class of all persons employed by USAID since January 20, 2025, for the purposes of seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. Following these rulings, the Fourth Circuit granted the government's motion to hold the appeal in abeyance pending further proceedings in the district court.",
    "46099": "On February 10, 2025, two non-profit organizations, later joined by a third, filed a lawsuit against the President of the United States, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the heads of those agencies. The plaintiffs, represented by public interest counsel from Public Citizen Litigation Group, challenged the administration’s suspension of foreign assistance funding. The case was consolidated with a related case, *Global Health Council v. Trump*, and assigned to Judge Amir H. Ali of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nThe lawsuit was precipitated by Executive Order 14169, issued on January 20, 2025, which directed a 90-day \"pause\" on nearly all U.S. foreign development assistance to assess programmatic efficiency and alignment with U.S. foreign policy. Following the order, the State Department and USAID issued directives and stop-work orders to grantees, including the plaintiffs, whose work on global HIV/AIDS prevention, support for investigative journalism, and aid to torture victims is funded by congressional appropriations under statutes like the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024. The plaintiffs alleged that this funding freeze caused immediate and irreparable harm, forcing them to lay off staff and halt critical humanitarian programs.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that the executive order and its implementation exceeded the President's constitutional authority, violated the separation of powers and the Take Care Clause of Article II, and contravened federal statutes including the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), and the Anti-Deficiency Act.\n\nOn February 13, 2025, Judge Ali granted a temporary restraining order (TRO), enjoining the defendant agencies from enforcing the funding freeze and stop-work orders issued between January 20 and February 13 (2025 WL 485324). A contentious period followed, with the plaintiffs filing emergency motions to enforce the TRO, alleging continued non-compliance. The dispute escalated to the Supreme Court, which, after a brief administrative stay, denied the government’s application to vacate the district court's enforcement order on March 5, 2025 (*Dep’t of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal.*, 604 U. S. ____ (2025)).\n\nOn March 10, 2025, Judge Ali granted a preliminary injunction (2025 WL 752378). The injunction had two primary components: it enjoined the government from giving effect to the initial wave of suspensions and terminations, and it further enjoined the government from \"unlawfully impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds,\" ordering it to \"make available for obligation the full amount of funds that Congress appropriated\" in the 2024 appropriations act. Following the injunction, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 2, 2025, to address the mass termination of thousands of foreign aid awards that occurred after the initial freeze. The government subsequently moved to dismiss the amended complaint.\n\nThe government appealed the preliminary injunction. On August 13, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion. The appellate court vacated the portion of the preliminary injunction that required the government to make all appropriated foreign aid funds available for obligation. The court held that the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to enforce the Impoundment Control Act and related appropriations statutes. It reasoned that the ICA's enforcement mechanism, which empowers the Comptroller General to sue the executive branch, impliedly precludes lawsuits by private parties under the APA for the same purpose. The case was remanded for further proceedings on the remaining claims.",
    "46093": "On February 10, 2025, a coalition of individual refugees, their U.S.-based family members, and three nonprofit refugee resettlement organizations filed a class-action lawsuit against the President of the United States and the Secretaries of State, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the International Refugee Assistance Project, challenge an executive order and subsequent agency actions that indefinitely suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).\n\nThe lawsuit was precipitated by Executive Order 14163, signed on January 20, 2025, which halted all refugee admissions and decisions on refugee applications. Federal agencies immediately began implementing the order, canceling travel for refugees already approved for resettlement. Days later, on January 24, 2025, the State Department issued \"Suspension Notices\" to its nonprofit resettlement partners, immediately cutting off federal funding for both overseas refugee processing and domestic resettlement services.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the executive order and the agencies' actions violated the Refugee Act, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The case was assigned to Judge Jamal N. Whitehead in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.\n\nOn February 28, 2025, Judge Whitehead granted a nationwide preliminary injunction, enjoining the government from enforcing key sections of the executive order and from suspending refugee processing and funding. The day after the court's oral ruling, the State Department issued \"Termination Notices,\" permanently terminating the cooperative agreements it had previously suspended. In response, the plaintiffs filed a supplemental complaint, and on March 24, 2025, the court issued a second preliminary injunction ordering the government to reinstate the terminated agreements.\n\nThe government appealed the first preliminary injunction and sought a stay. On March 25, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit partially stayed the injunction, allowing it to remain in effect only for individuals who were conditionally approved for refugee status before January 20, 2025. Following disputes over the scope of this carve-out, the Ninth Circuit issued two clarification orders on April 21 and May 9, 2025. These orders progressively narrowed the injunction's protection to only those refugees who, in addition to having been approved for status, had also been cleared for travel, had \"arranged and confirmable travel plans\" before January 20, 2025, and could demonstrate a \"strong reliance interest... comparable to Plaintiff Pacito\" on a case-by-case basis.\n\nDisputes over compliance with the narrowed injunction continued in the district court. On July 14, 2025, Judge Whitehead issued a Compliance Framework Order establishing a detailed process for identifying and processing potentially protected refugees. The order appointed U.S. Magistrate Judge Michelle L. Peterson to assist with the case-by-case reliance interest assessments. On July 30, 2025, Judge Whitehead granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification and denied the government's motion to dismiss the case.",
    "46065": "On February 7, 2025, the States of Washington, Minnesota, and Oregon, joined by three individual physicians, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against the President of the United States and multiple federal agencies and their secretaries. The suit challenged Executive Order 14,187, which directs federal agencies to terminate research and education grants to medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to individuals under 19 and directs the Department of Justice to prioritize criminal enforcement against providers of such care. The plaintiffs, represented by their state Attorneys General, argued that the executive order is an act of discrimination and an unconstitutional overreach.\n\nThe complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the order violates the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection guarantee, the separation of powers doctrine by usurping Congress's spending authority, and the Tenth Amendment by intruding on the states' power to regulate medicine. On February 19, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding the State of Colorado as a plaintiff and expanding the lawsuit to challenge a second executive order, E.O. 14,168, which restricts federal funding for any program deemed to \"promote gender ideology.\" The amended complaint also added a cause of action, alleging the orders are unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Lauren King. On February 7, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). On February 14, 2025, Judge King granted the TRO, which was effective for 14 days. The order enjoined the federal government from implementing the funding restrictions in E.O. 14,187 and from enforcing the criminal statute referenced in the order to target gender-affirming care providers in the plaintiff states.\n\nFollowing the TRO, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. On February 28, 2025, the court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The preliminary injunction, which remains in effect pending further orders, prohibits the defendants from enforcing the funding restrictions in both E.O. 14,187 and E.O. 14,168 within the four plaintiff states. However, the court denied the request to enjoin the criminal enforcement directive in E.O. 14,187, finding the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a credible threat of prosecution and therefore lacked standing on that specific issue.\n\nA dispute over compliance arose shortly thereafter. On March 6, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt, alleging that the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a subagency of a defendant department, had violated the court's injunctions by terminating a research grant to Seattle Children's Hospital for a study related to gender-affirming care. On March 17, 2025, the court denied the contempt motion, finding the plaintiffs had not yet met the high \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard for contempt. However, the court granted the plaintiffs' alternative request for expedited discovery into the grant termination and issued an order clarifying the broad scope of \"gender-affirming care\" protected by its injunction. On March 28, 2025, the defendants notified the court that the NIH had reinstated the grant in full.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging the preliminary injunction and the order granting expedited discovery. Subsequently, on April 23, 2025, Judge King granted the defendants' motion to stay further proceedings in the district court pending the outcome of the appeal. The stay is limited, allowing the parties to address any issues related to the enforcement of the existing preliminary injunction.",
    "46028": "On February 4, 2025, two national advocacy organizations (one for LGBTQ+ people and their families, another for LGBTQ+ health professionals), along with several transgender individuals under age 19 and their parents, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The suit was brought against the President of the United States, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the heads of those agencies. The plaintiffs are represented by private law firms and legal advocacy groups, including the ACLU and Lambda Legal.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges two Executive Orders issued in January 2025. The first, the \"Gender Identity Order,\" declared gender identity a \"false idea\" and prohibited the use of federal funds to \"promote gender ideology.\" The second, the \"Denial of Care Order,\" directed federal agencies to ensure that institutions receiving federal research or education grants stop providing gender-affirming medical care—which the order termed \"chemical and surgical mutilation\"—to individuals under age 19. Following the issuance of these orders, hospitals across the country that receive federal funding began canceling appointments and halting this medical care for their patients under 19, including for the individual plaintiffs. Additionally, federal agencies like HRSA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued notices to grant recipients instructing them to terminate programs conflicting with the orders; the government later clarified that the CDC had terminated 17 grants on January 31, 2025, and reinstated them on February 11, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the Executive Orders exceed the President's constitutional authority and violate the separation of powers by unilaterally imposing new conditions on funds appropriated by Congress. They also claim the orders violate the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection and Due Process guarantees by discriminating on the basis of sex and transgender status and infringing on parental rights. Finally, they argue the orders conflict with federal anti-discrimination laws, including Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to block the enforcement of the orders' funding restrictions.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Brendan Abell Hurson. On February 5, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). After a hearing, the court granted the TRO on February 13, 2025, finding the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims.\n\nFollowing the TRO, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. On March 4, 2025, Judge Hurson granted the motion, issuing a nationwide preliminary injunction that remains in effect pending further court orders. The injunction prohibits the defendant agencies from \"conditioning, withholding, or terminating federal funding\" based on a healthcare entity providing gender-affirming medical care to a patient under 19. A subsequent emergency motion by the plaintiffs to enforce the injunction, based on new agency notices they argued violated the order, was denied without prejudice on March 28, 2025. The court found the notices did not represent a clear violation of the injunction's command at that time.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, the federal government appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On April 9, 2025, the district court granted a joint motion to stay further proceedings in the district court case pending the outcome of the appeal. The Fourth Circuit has since placed the appeal in abeyance, pending a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in a related case, *U.S. v. Skrmetti*.",
    "46306": "On March 26, 2025, a coalition of eleven non-profit legal services organizations filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), its Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), and the Department of the Interior (DOI). The lawsuit challenges the government's abrupt termination of funding for the legal representation of unaccompanied immigrant children. The plaintiffs, represented by non-profit legal centers, allege that the government's \"Cancellation Order,\" issued on March 21, 2025, violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nThe complaint asserts that the funding termination is contrary to law because it contravenes the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), which mandates that the government \"shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable,\" that unaccompanied children have legal counsel. The action is also alleged to violate the government's own 2024 \"Foundational Rule,\" which requires ORR to fund direct legal representation when appropriations are available. Plaintiffs state that Congress appropriated over $5 billion for these services for fiscal year 2024, with funding available through September 30, 2027. The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the government to resume funding.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On March 27, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction. On April 1, 2025, Judge Martínez-Olguín granted a TRO enjoining the government from withdrawing funds for direct legal representation. The TRO was later extended until April 30, 2025.\n\nThe government pursued multiple avenues to challenge the TRO. It filed a motion to dissolve the order, which the district court denied. On April 9, 2025, the government filed a motion to recuse Judge Martínez-Olguín, citing her prior employment with one of the plaintiff organizations; the court denied this motion on April 17, 2025. The government also appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and sought an emergency stay. On April 18, 2025, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal, ruling the TRO was not an appealable order, and a subsequent petition for rehearing en banc was denied.\n\nOn April 29, 2025, Judge Martínez-Olguín granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The nationwide injunction orders the government to continue funding the legal representation services until a final judgment is issued. The government immediately appealed this preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit and again filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal. On May 14, 2025, in a published order, a Ninth Circuit panel denied the emergency stay, with one judge dissenting.\n\nBack in the district court, the government filed a motion to dismiss the case, which was denied on July 17, 2025. The government filed its answer to the complaint on July 31, 2025, and submitted the administrative record on August 18, 2025.",
    "46201": "On March 6, 2025, eight states, represented by their Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and its leadership. The suit challenges the Department's abrupt termination in February 2025 of approximately $600 million in previously awarded federal grants under the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) and Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) programs. These congressionally authorized programs were designed to address nationwide teacher shortages. The states allege the terminations, executed via boilerplate letters citing new, undefined \"Department priorities\" related to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), were unlawful.\n\nThe complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting that the agency's action was arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). On the same day, the states moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO).\n\nOn March 10, 2025, Judge Myong J. Joun granted the TRO, finding the states were likely to succeed on the merits because the Department failed to provide a reasoned, individualized explanation for its decision. The TRO, effective for 14 days and later extended, ordered the Department to restore the grant funding.\n\nThe Department immediately appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and filed an emergency motion to stay the order, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because the states' claims were essentially contractual and belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. On March 21, 2025, the First Circuit denied the stay, finding the Department was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its appeal.\n\nThe Department then applied for an emergency stay from the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 4, 2025, the Supreme Court granted the stay, halting the district court's TRO. In a per curiam opinion, the Court reasoned that the government was likely to succeed on its jurisdictional argument, characterizing the relief sought as the enforcement of a \"contractual obligation to pay money\" that belongs in the Court of Federal Claims. (Reported as *Dep't of Educ. v. California*, 604 U.S. ___ (2025)).\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's ruling, the states withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction on April 8, 2025, and the government voluntarily dismissed its appeal in the First Circuit. On June 2, 2025, the states filed a First Amended Complaint, adding claims that the Department's actions also violated the U.S. Constitution's Spending Clause and the separation of powers doctrine. The case was subsequently reassigned to Judge Angel Kelley. The Department has filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims.",
    "45984": "On January 28, 2025, a group of current and prospective transgender service members, represented by legal advocacy organizations including GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, filed a lawsuit against the United States government, the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the military departments. The number of individual plaintiffs grew from eight to 32 through several amended complaints. The lawsuit challenges a January 27, 2025, executive order and its subsequent implementing policies, which effectively ban transgender individuals from enlisting or continuing to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nThe factual basis of the case stems from a reversal of military policy. A 2021 policy had permitted transgender individuals to serve openly if they met military standards. The 2025 executive order revoked that policy, stating that transgender status is incompatible with military readiness, cohesion, honesty, and integrity. The plaintiffs allege this ban is not based on evidence but on unconstitutional animus, violating the Equal Protection and Due Process components of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. They seek declaratory judgments that the ban is unconstitutional and preliminary and permanent injunctions to prohibit its enforcement.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Ana C. Reyes of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs filed for a preliminary injunction on February 3, 2025, and a temporary restraining order the following day. After expedited briefing and hearings, Judge Reyes issued a detailed memorandum opinion and order on March 18, 2025, granting a nationwide preliminary injunction (2025 WL 842332). The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, reasoning that the ban was likely motivated by unconstitutional animus rather than legitimate military concerns, noting the policy's derogatory language and lack of supporting evidence. The injunction restored the pre-existing policy, prohibiting the defendants from separating or denying accession to service members based on their transgender status and from denying them medically necessary care.\n\nThe government moved to dissolve the injunction on March 21, 2025, arguing that new guidance clarified the policy was based on the medical condition of gender dysphoria, not transgender status itself. On March 26, 2025, Judge Reyes denied the motion, finding the new guidance did not change the policy's discriminatory nature (2025 WL 914716).\n\nThe government filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on March 26, 2025. The next day, it filed an emergency motion for an administrative stay and a stay of the injunction pending the appeal's outcome. On March 27, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted an administrative stay to give the court time to consider the motion for a stay pending appeal, temporarily pausing the district court's injunction.",
    "45964": "On January 21, 2025, the states of Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon filed a lawsuit against the President of the United States and several federal agencies in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The suit challenged a January 20, 2025 Executive Order, \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\" which declared that children born in the United States would not be recognized as citizens if their mother was unlawfully present or in a lawful but temporary status, and their father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. The states alleged the order violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause and the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1401) and would cause them irreparable harm through the loss of federal funding for programs like Medicaid and CHIP and by imposing significant administrative burdens. They sought a declaratory judgment that the order was unlawful and an injunction to block its enforcement. The states' counsel were their respective Attorneys General.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge John C. Coughenour. Shortly after filing, a separate class-action lawsuit was filed by several pregnant noncitizen women, represented by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, seeking similar relief. On January 27, 2025, Judge Coughenour consolidated the two cases.\n\nOn January 23, 2025, the court granted the states a nationwide temporary restraining order (TRO) against the Executive Order. Following expedited briefing, on February 6, 2025, the court granted a nationwide preliminary injunction. The court found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, reasoning the order was contrary to the plain text of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supreme Court's precedent in *United States v. Wong Kim Ark*. It held that the states had standing due to direct economic and administrative harms and that a nationwide injunction was necessary to provide them complete relief due to the likelihood of interstate travel.\n\nThe federal government appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and sought an emergency partial stay to limit the injunction's scope. On February 19, 2025, a Ninth Circuit panel denied the stay. The government then applied to the U.S. Supreme Court for a partial stay, which was consolidated with similar applications from related cases, *Trump v. CASA, Inc.* and *Trump v. State of New Jersey*. On June 27, 2025, the Supreme Court granted the government's application, holding that universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority of federal courts. The Court stayed the injunction to the extent it was broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the specific plaintiffs, but it did not rule on the underlying constitutionality of the Executive Order.\n\nOn July 23, 2025, the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion on the merits of the preliminary injunction appeal (*State of Washington v. Trump*, No. 25-807). The panel affirmed the district court's order. It held that the states had standing based on direct financial injuries. It dismissed the individual plaintiffs' claims, noting they were covered by a recently certified nationwide class action in a related case in the District of New Hampshire (*\"Barbara,\" et al. v. Trump*). The panel agreed with the district court that the Executive Order was likely unconstitutional. Despite the Supreme Court's stay order, the panel concluded that a universal injunction remained necessary to afford the states complete relief from the administrative and financial harms they would suffer due to interstate mobility. Judge Bumatay dissented in part, arguing the states lacked standing.",
    "VR-LA-0120": "On May 19, 2020, a group of individual Louisiana voters and two non-profit organizations, the League of Women Voters of Louisiana and the Crescent City Media Group, filed a lawsuit against the Louisiana Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, and two parish Registrars of Voters. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel and attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Fair Elections Center. The case was consolidated with a similar case, *Power Coalition for Equity and Justice v. Edwards*, No. 3:20-cv-00283, with this case designated as the lead.\n\nThe lawsuit was a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the safety of the 2020 elections. The plaintiffs argued that several provisions of Louisiana's election laws forced voters to choose between exercising their fundamental right to vote and risking their health. The challenged provisions included: (1) the \"Excuse Requirement,\" which limits eligibility for absentee mail-in voting to specific categories of voters; (2) the \"Witness Requirement,\" which mandates a witness signature on an absentee ballot; and (3) the \"Cure Prohibition,\" an alleged failure to provide voters with notice and an opportunity to fix errors on their absentee ballots.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, bringing their claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution (undue burden on the right to vote, unconstitutional condition on the right to bodily integrity, and procedural due process) and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. They alleged the challenged provisions disproportionately burdened Black voters, who have been more severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the challenged provisions for all 2020 elections. In response, the State of Louisiana, through the Attorney General, successfully moved to intervene as a defendant. The Attorney General and the parish Registrars of Voters then filed motions to dismiss the case, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction due to the plaintiffs' lack of standing and the presence of a non-justiciable political question. Following these motions, the plaintiffs filed amended complaints that removed the parish registrars as defendants.\n\nOn June 22, 2020, Judge Shelly D. Dick granted the defendants' motions to dismiss, finding the plaintiffs lacked standing because their alleged injuries were speculative and not \"certainly impending.\" The court initially dismissed the case with prejudice. However, after the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend, the court issued an amended judgment on June 30, 2020, dismissing the case without prejudice on the grounds that a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is not a ruling on the merits.",
    "46057": "On February 6, 2025, a group of eight active-duty transgender service members, one aspiring transgender service member, and a civil rights organization, Gender Justice League, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. Represented by private counsel and legal services organizations including Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, the plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of Executive Order 14183, the \"2025 Military Ban,\" issued by the President on January 27, 2025. The ban and its related directives categorically prohibit transgender individuals from serving in the armed forces, asserting that being transgender is incompatible with military service. The plaintiffs, many of whom have long and decorated military careers, argued this policy was discriminatory and lacked any rational basis.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against the President, the United States, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the military service branches and their secretaries. The plaintiffs alleged that the ban violated the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Fifth Amendment and the free speech protections of the First Amendment. They also brought a claim for equitable estoppel, arguing they had detrimentally relied on previous policies that allowed open service. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the ban is unconstitutional and an injunction to prevent its implementation and enforcement.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Benjamin H. Settle. On February 19, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to halt the ban's enforcement, arguing they and thousands of other service members faced imminent and irreparable harm, including the loss of their careers, benefits, and healthcare. After the DoD issued guidance on February 26, 2025, detailing a plan to begin separating transgender service members by March 28, 2025, the plaintiffs filed supplemental briefs highlighting the urgency of their motion.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, Judge Settle granted a nationwide preliminary injunction. In his memorandum opinion, the judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, concluding that the ban was not the product of reasoned military judgment and appeared to be based on animus. The opinion stated that the government provided no evidence that open service by transgender individuals under the previous policy had harmed military readiness or unit cohesion. The court's order restored the prior policy, which permitted transgender individuals to serve openly. The case was noted as being related to similar challenges, including *Talbott v. United States*, 2025 WL 842332 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025).\n\nThe government filed an immediate notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 28, 2025, and sought an emergency stay of the injunction. On March 31, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the request for an administrative stay. On April 18, 2025, it denied the motion for a stay pending appeal, finding the government had not demonstrated it would suffer irreparable harm.\n\nFollowing the Ninth Circuit's denial, the government applied to the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay. On May 6, 2025, the Supreme Court granted the application, staying the district court's nationwide injunction pending the disposition of the appeal in the Ninth Circuit and any subsequent petition for a writ of certiorari. The government filed its answer to the plaintiffs' amended complaint on May 19, 2025.",
    "45965": "On January 21, 2025, two immigrant-rights organizations and five pregnant noncitizen mothers filed a lawsuit against the President of the United States, the heads of several federal agencies, and the United States. The suit challenges a January 20, 2025, Executive Order titled “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” which purports to deny birthright citizenship to children born in the U.S. to mothers with unlawful or temporary immigration status whose fathers are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.\n\nThe plaintiffs, represented by legal services organizations and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University, alleged that the Executive Order was an unconstitutional ultra vires action that violated the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and its statutory codification in 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a). They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prohibit the federal government from implementing the order, arguing it would deny their children guaranteed citizenship, render them stateless, and cut off access to essential benefits.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Deborah L. Boardman in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. On February 5, 2025, Judge Boardman granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding they had shown an extremely strong likelihood of success on the merits. The order enjoined the implementation and enforcement of the Executive Order nationwide.\n\nThe federal government appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and moved to stay the injunction's nationwide scope pending appeal. The district court denied the stay on February 18, 2025, and the Fourth Circuit also denied a stay on February 28, 2025.\n\nThe government then filed an emergency application with the U.S. Supreme Court for a partial stay. On June 27, 2025, the Supreme Court issued a landmark opinion in *Trump v. CASA, Inc.*, holding that universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority granted to federal courts by the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Court partially stayed the injunction to the extent it was broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the named plaintiffs but noted that class actions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 remained a viable path for broader relief. The Court also stayed the injunction's prohibition on federal agencies developing implementation guidance.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's decision, the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on June 27, 2025, adding new plaintiffs and class-action allegations. On July 29, 2025, the Fourth Circuit dismissed the government's appeal and remanded the case to the district court. On August 7, 2025, Judge Boardman granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, certifying a nationwide class of all children born in the U.S. on or after February 19, 2025, who are affected by the Executive Order. On the same day, the court granted a new, classwide preliminary injunction, enjoining the federal government from enforcing the Executive Order against all members of the certified class. The court also dissolved its original February 5 injunction. The litigation is related to similar challenges filed against the same Executive Order in other federal districts, including *Washington v. Trump* and *New Jersey v. Trump*.",
    "VR-SC-0078": "On April 22, 2020, several South Carolina voters and a non-profit organization, The Family Unit, Inc., filed a lawsuit against South Carolina's Governor and state election officials. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc., challenged two state election laws amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The first, the \"Excuse Requirement,\" limited absentee voting to those who met one of 15 statutory criteria. The second, the \"Witness Requirement,\" mandated that a voter's signature on a mail-in absentee ballot envelope be witnessed by another person. The plaintiffs argued that these laws unconstitutionally forced voters, particularly the elderly, those with pre-existing medical conditions, and African Americans disproportionately affected by the virus, to choose between their health and their fundamental right to vote. The lawsuit sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and the Voting Rights Act (VRA).\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on April 28, 2020. The South Carolina Republican Party (SCGOP) was granted permission to intervene in the case to defend the state's election laws. Before the court ruled on the injunction, the South Carolina General Assembly passed a temporary law permitting no-excuse absentee voting for the June 9, 2020 primary and any subsequent runoffs, which mooted the plaintiffs' immediate challenge to the Excuse Requirement.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, Judge J. Michelle Childs granted in part the motion for a preliminary injunction. The court enjoined the state from enforcing the Witness Requirement for the June 2020 primaries and runoffs and ordered officials to publicly inform voters of the change. The court found that in the context of the pandemic, the Witness Requirement placed a substantial burden on voters that outweighed the state's asserted interest in preventing fraud, especially since the State Election Commission's director had stated the requirement offered \"no benefit to election officials.\"\n\nFollowing the primary, the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on July 13, 2020, adding the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP as a plaintiff and asserting additional claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives and the President of the South Carolina Senate were also permitted to intervene as defendants. The State Election Commission and the SCGOP filed motions for summary judgment on August 10, 2020.\n\nOn September 15, 2020, the South Carolina General Assembly again acted, passing legislation that suspended the Excuse Requirement for the November 2020 general election. Three days later, in a separate but related case, *Middleton v. Andino*, Judge Childs enjoined the Witness Requirement for the November 2020 election. Citing these developments, which effectively granted the plaintiffs the relief they sought for the 2020 election cycle, Judge Childs issued an order on September 18, 2020, that sua sponte stayed the *Thomas* case, holding all pending motions in abeyance and cancelling the trial scheduled to begin on September 22, 2020. The stay remains in effect until the plaintiffs request it be lifted.",
    "JC-MD-0017": "On April 21, 2020, a group of current and former detainees at the Prince George’s County Jail filed a class action lawsuit against the Director of the Prince George’s County Department of Corrections. The detainees, represented by Civil Rights Corps and WilmerHale, alleged that the jail's response to the COVID-19 pandemic created an unconstitutional risk of serious harm.\n\nThe factual basis for the case was an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19 within the facility. The detainees alleged that the jail failed to implement basic public health measures recommended by the CDC, such as providing free and adequate access to soap and cleaning supplies, enforcing social distancing, and properly sanitizing common areas. They further claimed that medical care was grossly substandard, with symptomatic individuals being denied treatment or returned to the general population, and that those who tested positive were held in filthy, unsanitary isolation cells with minimal monitoring. The complaint also challenged the jail's use of a facility-wide, 23-hour-a-day lockdown and a policy of refusing to release COVID-positive individuals even after they were legally entitled to do so.\n\nThe lawsuit was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. A \"Medically Vulnerable Subclass\" of pretrial detainees with preexisting health conditions also petitioned for writs of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, seeking immediate release. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the jail to comply with constitutional and public health standards.\n\nFiled in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, the case was assigned to Judge Paula Xinis. Concurrent with their complaint, the detainees filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). In response, on May 1, 2020, the court appointed Dr. Carlos Franco-Paredes as an independent medical expert to inspect the jail. Dr. Franco-Paredes's subsequent report concluded that a \"large outbreak\" had occurred, fueled by significant undertesting, inadequately trained medical staff, and a lack of any specific plan to protect high-risk detainees.\n\nOn May 21, 2020, Judge Xinis issued a Memorandum Opinion and a TRO, granting partial relief to the detainees. The court found that the jail's \"undertesting, . . . inadequate treatment and isolation of COVID-19 symptomatic detainees, and . . . no plan for those at high risk\" demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claims. The TRO ordered the jail director to develop and file comprehensive written plans within five days for identifying and protecting high-risk detainees, improving staff training and medical response, and establishing clear criteria for COVID-19 testing and isolation. The director also had to submit follow-up reports on testing and sanitation measures.\n\nThe Director of the Department of Corrections appealed the TRO to the Fourth Circuit and moved to stay the order, which Judge Xinis denied on June 3, 2020. The Fourth Circuit also denied a stay and later dismissed the appeal.\n\nOn July 7, 2020, the detainees filed a First Amended Complaint, adding new claims that the jail's ongoing, indefinite lockdown subjected them to unconstitutional solitary confinement in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. On July 17, 2020, the Director filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, arguing the claims were moot for released plaintiffs, that the remaining plaintiffs had failed to exhaust administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), and that the complaint failed to state a claim. That motion remains pending. The docket indicates that the case was referred to a Magistrate Judge for settlement conferences, and on September 18, 2020, the court stayed all deadlines pending the outcome of those discussions.",
    "IM-FL-0029": "On April 13, 2020, a group of civil immigration detainees filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. government, including the Miami Field Office Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Attorney General. The detainees, held at Krome Service Processing Center, Broward Transitional Center, and Glades County Detention Center in South Florida, alleged that the conditions of their confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic placed them at imminent risk of serious illness or death. Represented by a coalition of private, legal services, and non-profit counsel including the University of Miami School of Law Immigration Clinic and the Southern Poverty Law Center, they argued that crowded dormitory-style housing, inadequate sanitation, and insufficient hygiene supplies made it impossible to comply with CDC guidelines for social distancing and preventing viral transmission.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. The detainees alleged violations of their rights to reasonable safety under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and violations of federal administrative law under the Accardi Doctrine, which requires agencies to follow their own regulations. They sought immediate release from custody and a court order compelling the detention centers to comply with CDC public health protocols.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Marcia G. Cooke. Following an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman issued a Report and Recommendation. On April 30, 2020, Judge Cooke adopted the report in part, issuing a TRO that directed ICE to evaluate detainees for release, reduce facility populations toward a goal of 75% capacity, provide masks and cleaning supplies, and submit regular compliance reports to the court.\n\nOn June 6, 2020, the court issued an omnibus order that granted a preliminary injunction, extending and expanding the requirements of the TRO. The order also certified a class of all civil immigration detainees held at the three facilities from the date the action was filed into the future. Throughout the proceedings, the detainees filed motions to compel compliance, alleging that ICE continued to violate the court's orders, particularly regarding the improper cohorting of COVID-19 positive individuals with uninfected detainees, inconsistent provision of masks and soap, and conducting transfers without adequate safety precautions.\n\nDue to these ongoing disputes over compliance, the court appointed Matthew C. Dates as a Special Master on July 17, 2020, to inspect the facilities and report on conditions. In his September 1, 2020 report, the Special Master found that while the facilities were generally clean and had supplies, social distancing remained insufficient due to the facilities' physical layouts and population levels. After the government filed a motion for summary judgment, the parties entered into a court-enforced settlement agreement on June 28, 2021, resolving all class-wide claims.\n\nThe settlement's significant terms require the detention facilities to:\n*   Comply with all applicable ICE and CDC guidelines.\n*   Implement a COVID-19 vaccination protocol, making vaccines available at no cost to all detainees.\n*   Maintain population density at or below 75% of capacity in each living area.\n*   Test all detainees who exhibit symptoms of or have had close contact with COVID-19.\n*   Properly isolate and quarantine detainees who test positive or have been exposed, prohibiting the housing of COVID-19 positive individuals with those who have not tested positive.\n*   Provide unrestricted access to soap and hand sanitizer and issue new masks three times per week.\n*   Adhere to strict testing and safety protocols before transferring any detainee.\n\nThe court retains jurisdiction to enforce the agreement, which is set to remain in effect for six months or until every detainee has been offered a full vaccination course, whichever is later. The agreement is connected to other related cases, including *Fraihat v. ICE*."
