    "46290": "On March 5, 2025, the Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council (QEC), a student organization, filed a lawsuit against the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents, Chancellor John Sharp, and President Mark Welsh III, alleging violations of the First Amendment. The QEC sought to hold Draggieland, an annual student-funded drag performance, at the Rudder Theatre on March 27, 2025. On February 28, 2025, the Board issued a resolution banning drag shows on campus, citing opposition to “gender ideology” and claims that such events “demean women” or create a “hostile environment.” The QEC argued the ban constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination and a prior restraint on speech, as drag performances are protected expressive conduct under the First Amendment.  \n\nThe court granted a preliminary injunction on March 24, 2025, enjoining the Board from enforcing the ban and allowing Draggieland to proceed as scheduled. Judge Lee H. Rosenthal ruled that the Rudder Theatre functions as a designated public forum for student expression, and the Board’s resolution failed strict scrutiny because it targeted speech based on its perceived message rather than neutral criteria. The court also found the ban overly broad and vague, as it lacked definitions for terms like “lewd” or “sexualized.” The QEC, represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), emphasized that Draggieland, which features clothed performers discussing LGBTQ+ themes, is a core part of the organization’s mission to promote inclusivity.  \n\nThe defendants appealed the decision on March 28, 2025, seeking a stay pending appeal, but the case remains under injunction. The ruling underscores the protection of drag performances as expressive activity under the First Amendment and reaffirms that public universities cannot suppress student speech based on subjective views of offensiveness.",
    "46324": "On March 31, 2025, Inclusiv, Inc., a nonprofit promoting financial security through credit unions, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), its administrator Lee Zeldin, acting deputy administrator W.C. McIntosh, and Citibank, N.A. The lawsuit challenges EPA’s February 2025 freeze and March 2025 termination of Inclusiv’s $1.87 billion grant under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) program established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Inclusiv alleges that EPA’s actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Constitution’s separation of powers and due process clauses, and federal statutes like the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act and the Anti-Deficiency Act. The complaint also asserts that Citibank, as the financial agent holding the funds, breached its contract by refusing to disburse the money despite EPA’s lack of authority to terminate the grant.  \n\nInclusiv, a prime recipient of the GGRF’s Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) grant, had already selected 108 subrecipients to distribute funds for clean energy projects in low-income communities. EPA’s termination letter, issued on March 11, 2025, cited vague claims of “fraud, waste, and abuse” without evidence, while Citibank complied with the freeze, blocking access to the funds. Inclusiv sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the termination and enforce its contractual rights against Citibank, but the court denied the motion as moot after consolidating this case with Case No. 25-cv-698, where similar issues were already under review. The docket reflects that the case was consolidated on April 15, 2025, and all future filings are directed to the lead case. Inclusiv’s claims hinge on EPA’s alleged overreach in unilaterally terminating a congressionally mandated program and Citibank’s failure to follow its ministerial obligations under the Account Control Agreement. The plaintiff seeks a declaration that EPA’s actions are unlawful and an injunction to restore access to the funds.",
    "46391": "On April 11, 2025, five individual plaintiffs—international students in lawful F-1 visa status—filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California against U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials and President Donald J. Trump, alleging unlawful termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs, who are current or former students or post-graduate OPT workers, claim their SEVIS records were terminated between April 4–8, 2025, under vague grounds such as “Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status” linked to criminal records checks or visa revocations, despite having no convictions for crimes of violence or other valid statutory violations. They assert that SEVIS termination, which governs their legal status, was conducted without due process or legal justification, violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment’s due process protections.  \n\nThe plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to block enforcement actions, including arrests, transfers, or deportations, and to restore their SEVIS records and F-1 status. On April 17, 2025, Judge Noel Wise granted the TRO, enjoining defendants for 14 days from taking adverse actions. The case was later reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White, who extended the TRO and set a preliminary injunction hearing for May 13, 2025. The court also consolidated the case with similar lawsuits nationwide, including *Doe v. Trump*. Defendants argued that SEVIS termination does not automatically revoke F-1 status and that plaintiffs had not sought reinstatement under 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(16), but the court found serious questions about the legality of the terminations.  \n\nOn May 14, 2025, Judge White granted preliminary injunctions in this case and related matters, preserving the status quo pending further proceedings. Defendants subsequently appealed, but the court denied a motion to stay the injunction pending appeal on August 22, 2025. The case remains active, with a case management conference scheduled for September 2025. Plaintiffs allege the mass SEVIS terminations, occurring amid threats of federal funding cuts and publicized retaliatory actions, have caused widespread fear and disruption to their education and employment, necessitating judicial intervention to ensure compliance with legal standards and due process.",
    "46509": "On April 29, 2025, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), its Board of Directors, and three board members—Laura G. Ross, Thomas E. Rothman, and Diane Kaplan—filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, the White House Presidential Personnel Office, and related officials. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, alleging that an April 28, 2025, email from Deputy Director Trent Morse purporting to terminate the three board members was unlawful. They argued that the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (PBA) established CPB as a private, nonprofit corporation insulated from federal government control, with the President lacking authority to remove board members. The PBA explicitly prohibits federal agencies or officials from directing, supervising, or controlling CPB, and its statutory framework limits board member removal to cases of nonattendance at meetings, with no provision for presidential termination.  \n\nThe defendants countered that the PBA’s appointment authority for board members implicitly included removal power, consistent with D.C. corporate law. On June 8, 2025, Judge Randolph D. Moss denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, ruling that they had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm. The court noted that while the PBA emphasizes CPB’s independence, it does not explicitly bar presidential removal authority, and D.C. law permits appointing authorities to remove directors unless bylaws restrict this power. CPB’s subsequent bylaw amendment requiring a two-thirds board vote for removal was deemed a post-termination safeguard, not a retroactive shield.  \n\nThe case proceeded with plaintiffs later voluntarily dismissing Ross’s and Rothman’s claims in July and August 2025, respectively. The court’s decision left the issue of CPB’s statutory independence unresolved, permitting further litigation on the matter.",
    "46590": "On April 7, 2025, Harry Wiley, a coal miner diagnosed with black lung disease (pneumoconiosis), filed a class action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., alleging violations of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 (CMHSA) and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act). The case, *Wiley v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services* (Case No. 2:25-cv-00227), was assigned to Judge Irene C. Berger in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. Wiley, representing thousands of similarly situated coal miners, claimed that HHS’s abrupt closure of the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division (RHD) in April 2025—via a Reduction in Force (RIF)—disrupted critical health surveillance and job transfer programs under 30 U.S.C. § 843 and 30 C.F.R. Part 90, which allow miners with early signs of black lung to transfer to low-dust roles. The RHD’s shutdown, allegedly without proper justification or compliance with the Impoundment Control Act, left miners like Wiley unable to access free screenings, Part 90 determinations, or B-Reader certification for diagnosing black lung, despite congressional appropriations for these programs.  \n\nThe lawsuit sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that HHS’s actions were arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and violated the Fifth Amendment’s due process protections. On May 13, 2025, Judge Berger granted Wiley’s motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering the rescission of RIFs and the restoration of the RHD to ensure uninterrupted health surveillance and job transfer services mandated by the Mine Act. The court emphasized that the closure irreparably harmed miners by depriving them of life-saving protections against disease progression and that HHS had failed to demonstrate a lawful basis for the shutdown. The case remains active, with a trial scheduled for May 4, 2026, and no settlement or monitoring mechanisms mentioned. Counsel for Wiley included private attorneys from Petsonk PLLC, Mountain State Justice, Inc., and Appalachian Mountain Advocates.",
    "46605": "On May 17, 2025, Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan, a Venezuelan citizen detained in California, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a class action complaint, alleging violations of due process under the Fifth Amendment and statutory issues related to the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). The petition sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and class certification to block the U.S. government from removing Venezuelan nationals under Proclamation No. 10903, which authorizes the immediate removal of Venezuelan citizens aged 14 or older affiliated with the Tren de Aragua gang. The court granted the TRO and class certification on May 19, 2025, temporarily enjoining the government from removing or transferring class members—defined as noncitizens in the Central District of California subject to the Proclamation—without adequate notice. A preliminary injunction was later issued on June 2, 2025, extending the restraint pending further proceedings. The government argued that Arevalo’s detention was under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), not the AEA, but the court found he faced an imminent risk of AEA-based removal. On June 20, 2025, the court denied Arevalo’s ex parte application for immediate release, ruling that his asylum grant did not conclusively end detention while removal appeals were pending. The case was appealed to the Ninth Circuit (Docket No. 25-4866) on August 1, 2025. The court’s preliminary injunction remains in effect, requiring the government to provide notice before removals under the AEA, while allowing lawful removals under the INA. The case continues with scheduled status reports and potential appeals.",
    "46635": "On May 22, 2025, Shira Perlmutter, the Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, the Executive Office of the President, and several officials, including Todd Blanche (purportedly acting Librarian of Congress) and Paul Perkins (purportedly acting Register of Copyrights). Perlmutter alleged that President Trump’s May 8, 2025, removal of Librarian of Congress Carla D. Hayden and subsequent attempt to appoint Blanche as acting Librarian of Congress, followed by Perkins’s designation as acting Register of Copyrights, violated statutory and constitutional authority. Specifically, she argued that Congress, not the President, vests the Librarian of Congress with exclusive power to appoint and remove the Register of Copyrights under 17 U.S.C. § 701(a), and that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (5 U.S.C. § 3347(a)) does not authorize the President to appoint an acting Librarian of Congress, as the Library of Congress is not an “Executive agency.” Perlmutter sought a preliminary injunction to block her removal and declarations affirming the illegality of the defendants’ actions.  \n\nThe court denied her motion for a temporary restraining order on May 28, 2025, finding she failed to demonstrate irreparable harm. After a hearing on her preliminary injunction motion on July 23, 2025, Judge Timothy J. Kelly again denied relief in a July 30, 2025, memorandum opinion, emphasizing that the loss of a government position, even temporarily, does not constitute irreparable harm absent extraordinary circumstances. Perlmutter appealed to the D.C. Circuit and later sought an injunction pending appeal, which the court denied on August 20, 2025, reiterating the lack of demonstrated irreparable harm. The case remains active, with a scheduled status conference and eventual cross-motions for summary judgment. Counsel for Perlmutter included Democracy Forward Foundation and Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP, with several attorneys admitted pro hac vice. Related cases cited in the opinion include *Aviel v. Gor* (2025 WL 1009035) and *LeBlanc v. U.S. Privacy & Civil Liberties Oversight Board* (2025 WL 1454010).",
    "45143": "On April 20, 2023, Ashley Willey and Sean Willey, parents of a minor student (A.S.) and other children in the Sweetwater County School District No. 1, filed a verified complaint alleging violations of their constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs claimed the school district’s policies—requiring staff to use students’ preferred names and pronouns (even if discordant with their biological sex) and concealing such information from parents without consent—violated their Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights to direct their children’s upbringing and mental health care, as well as their First Amendment free exercise of religion and free speech rights. The district’s administration, including the superintendent and school officials, allegedly enforced these policies despite the plaintiffs’ objections, including their religious belief that gender is biologically fixed and their concern for A.S.’s mental health, which included diagnoses of ADHD, PTSD, and gender dysphoria.  \n\nThe plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prevent the district from treating A.S. as male or using alternate names/pronouns without consent, along with declaratory judgment and damages. On June 30, 2023, the court granted in part and denied in part a motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the district from preventing staff from disclosing students’ preferred names/pronouns to parents but denying relief on other aspects of the policy. Defendants later filed a motion to dismiss the original complaint, which was denied as moot after plaintiffs amended their pleading on July 20, 2023.  \n\nFollowing extensive proceedings, including motions for summary judgment, the court ruled on April 28, 2025, granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment and dismissing all remaining claims against Ashley Willey. Sean Willey was also dismissed from the action. The case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit under docket number 25-8027. The plaintiffs’ appeal focused on challenges to the summary judgment and related orders. The district’s policies, which prioritized student confidentiality over parental notification, remained at the core of the legal dispute throughout the proceedings.",
    "PH-IL-0002": "On May 10, 2016, a class action lawsuit was filed against the Alexander County Housing Authority (ACHA) and former executives James Wilson, Martha Franklin, and others, alleging systemic racial and familial status discrimination, along with rent overcharges, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and the Illinois Civil Rights Act. Plaintiffs, primarily African-American residents of ACHA’s McBride and Elmwood developments, claimed that ACHA segregated housing by race, neglected maintenance leading to unsafe and unsanitary conditions (e.g., pest infestations, mold, and lack of security), and enforced policies barring families with children from certain units. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) had previously found ACHA guilty of racial segregation in 1974 and again in 2014.  \n\nThe case involved multiple amended complaints and motions, with plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief, declaratory judgments, and monetary damages for overpaid rent. However, several plaintiffs, including Latonya Lee, Coretta Cornelius, and Denieshia Childress, failed to comply with court orders or participate in settlement negotiations. On July 27, 2017, the remaining plaintiffs stipulated to dismiss the case with prejudice, and on September 12, 2017, the court dismissed all claims, closing the case. The dismissal applied to all plaintiffs except those who had already withdrawn or were separately dismissed for lack of prosecution. The lawsuit highlighted longstanding allegations of discriminatory housing practices and inadequate maintenance by ACHA, which the court ultimately resolved through a mutual stipulation.",
    "16518": "On April 14, 2022, the United States of America filed a complaint against the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, alleging violations of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause at the Broad River Road Complex (BRRC), a long-term juvenile detention facility. The lawsuit, brought under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (34 U.S.C. § 12601), alleged that DJJ failed to protect youth from excessive force by staff, youth-on-youth violence, and prolonged punitive isolation. The DOJ’s investigations, conducted since 2017, found systemic issues, including inadequate staffing, poor training, insufficient surveillance, and a pattern of unreasonable force, such as chokeholds, physical restraints, and assaults on youth.  \n\nThe case was resolved via a settlement agreement signed April 13, 2022, and approved by the court April 20, 2022, dismissing the complaint without prejudice but retaining jurisdiction for enforcement. The agreement requires DJJ to implement reforms, including revising use-of-force policies, improving staffing and surveillance, providing de-escalation training, and establishing a multidisciplinary team to oversee isolation placements. DJJ must also ensure youth in isolation receive adequate medical care, education, and mental health services, and avoid using isolation for punishment or minor infractions. A Subject Matter Expert, selected by both parties, will monitor compliance, with reports submitted every six months. The agreement lasts five years, with termination contingent on DJJ achieving “substantial compliance” and maintaining it for one year. The court may reinstate the case if DJJ materially breaches the agreement.",
    "46815": "On May 21, 2025, the government indicted Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia for one count of conspiring to unlawfully transport undocumented aliens for financial gain and one count of illegally transporting them, both under 8 U.S.C. § 1324. The indictment was initially sealed but unsealed on June 6, 2025, after the government’s motion. Abrego was arrested in Nashville on June 6, 2025, and the government immediately filed a motion for detention, arguing that the case involved a minor victim under the Bail Reform Act (18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(1)(E)) and posed a serious risk of flight or obstruction of justice.  \n\nA detention hearing was held on June 13, 2025, where the government presented evidence, including body camera footage from a 2022 traffic stop, passenger rosters, and hearsay testimony from cooperating witnesses. The court denied the motion for detention, finding no conclusive evidence that Abrego’s offenses involved minor victims or that he posed a serious risk of flight or obstruction. The government’s reliance on hearsay about alleged gang ties to MS-13 and interactions with minors was deemed unreliable, as cooperating witnesses provided conflicting accounts, and no direct evidence of Abrego’s gang membership or harm to minors was established.  \n\nThe government appealed the detention ruling, leading to an evidentiary hearing on July 16, 2025. Despite additional testimony from Agent Peter Joseph about Abrego’s alleged involvement in human smuggling and references to protective orders against him, the district court affirmed the magistrate judge’s decision, emphasizing the lack of reliable evidence and the presumption of innocence. The court concluded that the government failed to meet its burden under § 3142(g) to justify detention, as conditions of release (e.g., electronic monitoring, travel restrictions, third-party custody) could reasonably ensure his appearance and community safety.  \n\nOn August 22, 2025, the magistrate judge issued a release order with conditions, which the government sought to revoke but was denied by the district court on July 23, 2025. Abrego was released pending trial, with a jury trial scheduled for January 27, 2026. The court reiterated that the Bail Reform Act requires individualized assessments and that the government’s arguments about flight risk or danger were speculative and unsupported by credible evidence.",
    "46755": "On July 1, 2025, the City of Columbus, Ohio; the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland; the City of Chicago, Illinois; Doctors for America (DFA); and Main Street Alliance (MSA) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs allege that CMS’s 2025 Rule, titled “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability,” violates the ACA by imposing unlawful and arbitrary provisions that increase health insurance premiums, reduce coverage benefits, and create administrative barriers to enrollment. Key challenged provisions include a $5 monthly surcharge on re-enrolled low-income enrollees, expanded permissible variations in actuarial value calculations, and income verification policies that limit access to subsidized coverage. The Rule also shortens open enrollment periods and revokes a special enrollment period for low-income individuals, which plaintiffs argue will deter enrollment and destabilize insurance markets.  \n\nThe court granted in part and denied in part a motion for a stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705, enjoining seven provisions of the Rule from taking effect on August 25, 2025, pending further review. These include the $5 surcharge, changes to actuarial value ranges, and income verification requirements. However, the court declined to stay two provisions: the revised methodology for calculating premium adjustments and the elimination of the 60-day extension for income verification. The plaintiffs, representing cities and organizations that provide health care to uninsured and underinsured residents, argue the Rule’s changes will force them to bear increased uncompensated care costs and strain municipal budgets. The court found that CMS failed to adequately justify its rulemaking, particularly in addressing concerns about data accuracy and the impact of administrative burdens on eligible enrollees. The case is related to prior litigation, *City of Columbus v. Trump* and *City of Columbus v. Cochran*, where similar ACA-related challenges were considered. The ruling underscores the APA’s requirement that agency actions must be reasoned and aligned with statutory mandates, and it highlights the plaintiffs’ standing based on predictable financial harm from the Rule’s implementation.",
    "46576": "On April 10, 2025, a class action lawsuit was filed by 16 states and the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging ED’s March 28, 2025, rescission of previously approved extensions for liquidating funds under the Education Stabilization Fund (ESF), which includes programs like ESSER, HCY, and EANS. These funds, awarded under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) and Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSA), were intended to address pandemic-related education disruptions, such as lost instructional time, infrastructure upgrades, and support for vulnerable students. Plaintiffs had obtained extensions through March 2026, relying on ED’s prior approvals to continue projects and services. ED’s rescission, justified solely on the pandemic’s “end,” caused immediate harm by cutting off reimbursement for ongoing efforts, leading to program cancellations, staff layoffs, and incomplete infrastructure projects. The Southern District of New York issued a preliminary injunction on May 6, 2025, and June 3, 2025, blocking enforcement of the rescission and requiring ED to process liquidation requests without delay. Defendants appealed, arguing the district court lacked jurisdiction under the APA and that the rescission was lawful, but the appeal was later withdrawn. The case centers on whether ED’s abrupt reversal of its extension policy violated the APA by being arbitrary, failing to consider reliance interests, and misapplying statutory authority. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement of the extensions and injunctive relief to prevent further disruptions to pandemic recovery programs.",
    "46637": "On May 27, 2025, National Public Radio, Inc. (NPR) and three local public radio stations—Aspen Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio (CPR), and KSUT Public Radio—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Besent, OMB Director Russell Vought, and others, challenging Executive Order 14290 (“Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media”) issued by the President on May 1, 2025. The Order directed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and federal agencies to cease all direct and indirect funding to NPR and PBS, citing their alleged “bias” in news coverage. Plaintiffs argue the Order violates the First Amendment by retaliating against protected speech, engaging in viewpoint discrimination, and infringing on freedom of association, as well as the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (PBA), which insulates CPB and its grantees from governmental interference. The complaint also asserts that the Order breaches the Spending Clause and Separation of Powers by overriding congressional appropriations.  \n\nThe case is before Judge Randolph D. Moss. It is consolidated with *Corporation for Public Broadcasting v. Trump* (No. 25-cv-1305), where CPB challenges the President’s authority to remove its board members. Plaintiffs sought summary judgment, arguing the Order is unlawful and unconstitutional, while federal defendants countered that the claims are unripe, as no final agency action had been taken against them. Defendants noted that CPB had not yet terminated funding, and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) had only ended two expired grants. Plaintiffs emphasized irreparable harm from the Order’s chilling effect on their operations and the threat of future funding cuts, while defendants asserted that government funding decisions are not subject to strict First Amendment scrutiny.  \n\nKey statutory arguments include the PBA’s prohibition on federal control over CPB’s funding and its mandate to distribute satellite interconnection funds to NPR as the designated national entity. Plaintiffs also contend the Order’s vague language fails to provide fair notice, violating due process. The case remains in the summary judgment phase, with no reported opinions or trials to date. The parties have filed amicus briefs, and the court has set a deadline for completing briefing on August 8, 2025, after which a hearing may be held. The outcome hinges on whether the Order’s content-based funding restrictions constitute unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination or retaliation, and whether plaintiffs’ claims are justiciable without final agency action.",
    "46340": "On April 3, 2025, six federal employee unions—American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees (AFSCME), National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United (NNOC/NNU), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), National Association of Government Employees (NAGE), and National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE)—filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against President Donald J. Trump and multiple federal agencies and officials. The complaint alleges that Executive Order 14251, issued by Trump on March 27, 2025, and titled “Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs,” unlawfully stripped over 40 federal agencies and subdivisions of collective bargaining rights under Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code (the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, or FSLMRS). The unions argue the order violates the First Amendment by retaliating against their protected speech and petitioning activities opposing Trump’s policies, constitutes ultra vires executive action exceeding statutory authority, and breaches Fifth Amendment protections by abrogating contractual rights without due process or equal protection. The order also excludes agencies like the Department of State, Defense, and Veterans Affairs, except for limited exceptions, and delegates authority to agency heads to further exclude subdivisions.  \n\nOn April 7, 2025, the plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order, which the court converted into a motion for a preliminary injunction. On June 24, 2025, Judge James Donato granted the preliminary injunction, enjoining enforcement of the Exclusion Order’s provisions under Section 2 pending litigation, citing serious First Amendment questions and irreparable harm to union operations, including loss of dues revenue, collective bargaining rights, and representational functions. The government appealed, and on August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit granted an administrative stay of the injunction pending resolution of the appeal. The case remains active, with a joint case management statement due by July 10, 2025, and a trial date to be set. The unions represent hundreds of thousands of federal employees across agencies, and the litigation centers on whether the Exclusion Order’s broad exclusions are pretextual retaliation against politically disfavored unions rather than legitimate national security measures.",
    "46805": "On July 21, 2025, multiple state and national nonprofit organizations focused on domestic violence, sexual assault, and homelessness services (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against federal officials and agencies, including Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Secretary Scott Turner of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and related entities. The Plaintiffs allege that HUD and HHS imposed unlawful conditions on federal grants, such as prohibiting the use of funds to promote “gender ideology” (as defined in Executive Order 14168), certifying compliance with anti-discrimination laws as material to payment decisions under the False Claims Act, and banning support for elective abortions (per Executive Order 14182). These conditions, the Plaintiffs argue, conflict with statutory obligations to serve underserved populations, violate the First Amendment by restricting protected speech, and contravene the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by exceeding agency authority and being arbitrary, capricious, and unconstitutional.  \n\nThe case centers on HUD’s Continuum of Care (CoC) grants and HHS’s Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) grants, which Plaintiffs rely on to provide critical services to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and homelessness. The Defendants’ policies, including updated grant terms and certifications, are challenged as unauthorized by Congress and inconsistent with existing regulations requiring equal access based on gender identity. Judge Melissa R. DuBose granted a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on July 28, 2025, enjoining HUD and HHS from enforcing these conditions on specified grants, with the TRO initially set to expire on August 11, 2025. Subsequent revised orders extended the TRO pending further proceedings, including a scheduled hearing for a preliminary injunction on September 4, 2025. The Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the conditions are unlawful, a permanent injunction against their enforcement, and an end to the threat of funding loss under the False Claims Act, arguing that compliance would force them to abandon programs aligned with their missions and expose them to liability.",
    "46375": "On April 9, 2025, the Southern Education Foundation, Inc. (“SEF”), a 150-year-old nonprofit dedicated to advancing equitable education in the Southern U.S., filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon, and President Donald J. Trump, challenging the abrupt termination of its federal grant to operate the Equity Assistance Center for the South (“EAC-South”). The grant, awarded in 2022 under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, was terminated on February 13, 2025, via a letter citing alleged inconsistencies with the Trump Administration’s priorities under Executive Orders 14151 and 14173, which targeted diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives as “illegal discrimination.” SEF argued the termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being arbitrary and capricious, failing to follow required notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, and disregarding due process protections. The Department’s actions, SEF claimed, also conflicted with the Constitution’s Fifth and First Amendments and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibit discrimination in federally funded programs.  \n\nThe case proceeded to a motion for a preliminary injunction, which the court granted on May 21, 2025, finding that the termination caused irreparable harm to SEF’s operations, reputation, and the school districts relying on its services. The court ruled the Department’s decision lacked reasoned explanation and violated statutory requirements for grant termination, including failure to provide SEF with a hearing or factual basis for the termination. The order mandated reinstatement of the grant under its original terms and reimbursement of $293,681.78 in outstanding expenses. Defendants appealed the decision to the D.C. Circuit Court on July 18, 2025, but the district court’s order remains in effect. The case centers on whether the executive branch can unilaterally terminate federally authorized grants based on policy disagreements without adhering to legal procedures, with SEF seeking to preserve its mission of addressing unresolved desegregation cases in the South.",
    "46284": "On March 24, 2025, Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old lawful permanent resident (LPR) and Columbia University junior, filed a complaint and petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Chung alleges that federal officials, including President Donald J. Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and others, violated her First and Fifth Amendment rights by targeting her for immigration enforcement actions—including arrest, detention, and deportation—due to her participation in pro-Palestinian protests and criticism of U.S. policies regarding Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. The government claims it acted under the “Foreign Policy Ground” provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(4)(C)(i), 1182(a)(3)(C)(iii), which allow the Secretary of State to revoke LPR status if a noncitizen’s presence or activities are deemed to have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the U.S. However, Chung argues this policy is unconstitutionally vague and amounts to retaliation for protected speech, as she was arrested during a protest over university disciplinary actions against pro-Palestinian activists but did not engage in unlawful activity or hold a visa.  \n\nThe complaint highlights a broader pattern of government action against noncitizen students, including the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia LPR, and the targeting of Ranjani Srinivasan and Leqaa Kordea, who faced similar immigration measures. It also references Executive Orders 14161 and 14188, which prioritize cracking down on “anti-Semitism” and “leftist, anti-American” campuses, and the use of an AI-driven program called “Catch and Revoke” to identify individuals perceived to support Hamas.  \n\nOn March 25, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the defendants from detaining, transferring, or deporting Chung pending further proceedings. A preliminary injunction was issued on June 5, 2025, with similar terms, requiring the government to provide 72 hours’ advance notice if it sought to detain Chung on grounds other than removal under the Foreign Policy Ground. The defendants moved to dismiss the case, arguing lack of jurisdiction, but the motion was denied in part and granted in part, with the court retaining authority over the preliminary injunction. The government appealed the injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on July 3, 2025, citing jurisdictional concerns.  \n\nChung’s case is part of a larger litigation landscape, including related actions by other students (e.g., Khalil v. Joyce and Taal et al. v. Trump), and hinges on claims that the Foreign Policy Ground is being misapplied to suppress political dissent, violating constitutional protections against viewpoint discrimination and due process. The court’s orders emphasize that any detention must not be a pretext for retaliating against her protected speech.",
    "46735": "On June 20, 2025, the Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools (Plaintiff) filed a Verified Complaint against Linda McMahon (as Secretary of Education), the U.S. Department of Education, and Donald J. Trump (as President) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants unlawfully terminated a $6 million federal mental health grant awarded under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022, which allocated $1 billion over five years to expand school-based mental health services. The termination, effective April 29, 2025, was justified by the Department’s “Dear Colleague Letter” (DCL) and subsequent policies targeting “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) programs, which the Plaintiff claims violate the First and Fifth Amendments, the Spending Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that the termination was unlawful, a preliminary injunction to reinstate funding, and reimbursement for expenditures incurred since the termination.  \n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge William P. Johnson, who denied the motion for a preliminary injunction on July 18, 2025, ruling that the dispute over grant non-continuation falls under the Tucker Act and must be resolved in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, not a district court. The Judge emphasized that the grant’s terms allowed the Secretary of Education to discontinue funding based on the “best interest of the Federal Government” and that the DCL’s restrictions on DEI programs did not constitute unlawful agency action. The Court found no irreparable harm to the Plaintiff, noting that monetary damages (e.g., future grant payments) could address any losses, and concluded that the essence of the claim was contractual, not constitutional or statutory. The case was dismissed without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. The Plaintiff’s arguments centered on the abrupt termination’s adverse effects on student mental health services, staff training, and community programs, but the Court held that such claims require a different legal forum.",
    "46342": "On April 4, 2025, the Association for Education Finance and Policy (AEFP) and the Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Linda McMahon, in her official capacity as Secretary of Education, and the U.S. Department of Education (ED). The plaintiffs allege that ED’s termination of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) programs, including statutorily mandated studies like the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:20/25), the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 2022 (HS&B:22), and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten: 2024 (ECLS-K:2024), violates the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (ESRA) and other federal statutes. These actions, including mass contract cancellations, a 90% reduction in IES staff, and termination of remote access to restricted-use data, are claimed to disrupt data collection, analysis, and dissemination critical to the plaintiffs’ research and advocacy work. The complaint also challenges the abrupt ending of IES’s peer review program for grants and delays in processing disclosure risk reviews for restricted data.  \n\nPlaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to halt these actions, restore terminated programs, and enforce statutory compliance. However, on June 3, 2025, Judge Trevor N. McFadden denied the motion, ruling that the plaintiffs’ claims constituted broad “programmatic challenges” rather than specific agency actions reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The court emphasized that the APA does not permit wholesale judicial intervention in agency operations, noting that the plaintiffs failed to isolate discrete decisions for review, as required by precedents like *Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation* and *Sierra Club v. Peterson*. The denial followed a hearing on May 16, 2025, and a series of amended complaints filed by plaintiffs to narrow their claims. The case remains active, with defendants having responded to the second amended complaint and procedural deadlines set for further filings. Plaintiffs argue that the termination of IES functions undermines congressional mandates to provide reliable education data, while defendants contend the actions fall within their authority and reflect policy decisions not subject to judicial review.",
    "46322": "On March 31, 2025, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Secure Families Initiative, Arizona Students’ Association, and other nonpartisan organizations, along with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and related entities, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging Executive Order 14248 issued by President Donald J. Trump on March 25, 2025. The order purported to require the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to amend the federal mail voter registration form to include documentary proof of citizenship (DPOC) and to enforce strict ballot receipt deadlines for federal elections. Plaintiffs argued these provisions violated the Constitution’s separation of powers by unlawfully delegating authority to the President over election regulation, which the U.S. Constitution reserves to Congress and the states. They also claimed the EAC lacked statutory authority to implement the DPOC requirement under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and Help America Vote Act (HAVA), and that the changes would burden eligible voters, particularly military and overseas citizens, and hinder their voter registration and mobilization efforts. The case was consolidated with two related lawsuits (25-cv-0952 and 25-cv-0955) due to overlapping issues. On April 24, 2025, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, barring the EAC from implementing the DPOC requirement under Section 2(a) of the order, but denied relief for other sections. The court found that the President had no constitutional or statutory authority to unilaterally alter the Federal Form’s content, emphasizing that such changes require bipartisan EAC approval and compliance with procedural laws like the Administrative Procedure Act. The ruling highlighted the risk of disenfranchisement for voters unable to provide DPOC and underscored the importance of preserving the NVRA’s framework for accessible voter registration.",
    "46510": "On April 28, 2025, the Washington State Association of Head Start and Early Childhood Assistance and Education Program, along with state-level Head Start Associations from Illinois, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and parent advocacy groups Family Forward Oregon and Parent Voices Oakland, filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Andrew Gradison (Acting Assistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families), and Tara Hooban (Acting Director of the Office of Head Start). The plaintiffs allege that the defendants’ actions—mass closures of regional Head Start offices, layoffs of staff, and implementation of a vague ban on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEI) initiatives—violate the Head Start Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and constitutional principles like the First and Fifth Amendments, as well as the Separation of Powers and Spending Clause. The Complaint highlights that the defendants’ policies, including a March 14, 2025, letter prohibiting DEI-related expenditures and an April 16, 2025, amendment to the Grants Policy Statement requiring agencies to certify non-DEI compliance, have caused confusion, disrupted funding, and threatened the existence of Head Start programs, which serve over 800,000 children annually, including many from marginalized communities. On May 16, 2025, plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, seeking to block the defendants’ actions until the court can resolve the merits of the case. The motion argues that the DEI bans are unconstitutionally vague, suppress protected speech, and conflict with statutory mandates to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services, inclusive classrooms for children with disabilities, and support for homeless and foster care children. The defendants responded on June 6, 2025, but the court has not yet ruled on the motion. The case is overseen by Judge Ricardo S. Martinez, who also issued a Joint Status Report deadline on June 24, 2025. The plaintiffs assert that the defendants’ policies risk irreparable harm to families reliant on Head Start for childcare, education, and healthcare, and that Congress has not authorized such disruptions to the program’s funding or operations.",
    "46734": "On May 29, 2025, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle and Dioceses of Spokane and Yakima (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against Governor Robert W. Ferguson, Attorney General Nicholas W. Brown, and Washington county prosecutors, alleging violations of the First Amendment’s Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. The lawsuit challenges Senate Bill 5375, enacted by Washington on May 2, 2025, which mandates that clergy report suspected child abuse or neglect to authorities, even if learned during confidential sacramental confessions, under threat of criminal penalties (up to 364 days in jail and $5,000 fines) and civil liability. Plaintiffs argue that this requirement forces them to violate the “sacramental seal,” a centuries-old Catholic doctrine prohibiting priests from disclosing confessions, which risks automatic excommunication and eternal damnation under Church teaching. The bill also removes clergy from state-law privileges protecting confidential communications, unlike secular professionals such as attorneys, who were recently granted similar exemptions under Substitute House Bill 1171.  \n\nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. 65), filed on June 5, 2025, sought to block enforcement of SB 5375’s provisions related to confessional secrecy pending litigation. They emphasized that the law impermissibly burdens religious exercise by targeting clergy uniquely, fails strict scrutiny as it is not neutral or generally applicable, and causes irreparable harm to both religious practices and the public interest in constitutional rights. On July 18, 2025, Judge David G. Estudillo granted the motion, enjoining Defendants from enforcing SB 5375 against Plaintiffs and Roman Catholic priests in Washington under their supervision. The court concluded that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Free Exercise claim, as the law compels them to choose between violating their faith or facing severe penalties, and noted that the state had not demonstrated narrow tailoring to a compelling interest. The United States Department of Justice later intervened (Dkt. 122), aligning with Plaintiffs’ arguments that SB 5375 violates equal protection by disadvantaging religion, though the court deferred addressing broader claims at that stage. The injunction applies specifically to the Sacrament of Confession and remains in effect until final judgment.",
    "46678": "On June 9, 2025, the State of California and Governor Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and the U.S. Department of Defense, alleging that the federal government unlawfully federalized 4,000 members of the California National Guard under 10 U.S.C. § 12406 without meeting the statute’s required conditions or consulting the Governor. The plaintiffs argued that the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to protect federal immigration enforcement operations violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from engaging in civilian law enforcement, and infringed on state sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment. The complaint also claimed the defendants exceeded their statutory authority by bypassing the Governor’s role in authorizing National Guard mobilizations. On June 12, 2025, the district court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO), finding that the President’s actions were likely ultra vires because the statutory predicates for federalization—rebellion, invasion, or inability to execute laws—were not satisfied and the orders were not issued through the Governor as required. The court temporarily enjoined the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles and directed the return of control to the Governor. Defendants appealed the TRO to the Ninth Circuit, which granted a stay pending appeal. A preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled for June 20, 2025, with a bench trial set for August 11–13, 2025. The case centers on whether the President’s use of the National Guard under § 12406 complies with constitutional and statutory limits on federal military power in domestic law enforcement.",
    "46287": "On March 25, 2025, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against multiple federal agencies and officials, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the General Services Administration. The plaintiffs alleged that the Trump administration’s termination of approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University, along with demands for structural changes to its operations, violated the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by coercing the university to suppress academic freedom and free speech. They claimed the actions were unlawful under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which requires specific procedural steps before terminating federal funding, and that the government failed to follow these requirements.  \n\nThe plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to restore the funding and prevent further termination of over $5 billion in active federal grants and contracts to Columbia, arguing that the loss of funding and the threat of additional cuts caused irreparable harm to their members’ research, academic freedom, and reputations. The motion for a preliminary injunction, filed on April 3, 2025, emphasized the government’s disregard for Title VI’s procedural mandates and its unconstitutional conditioning of federal funds on suppressing disfavored viewpoints.  \n\nOn June 16, 2025, the court denied the preliminary injunction and dismissed the case for lack of standing. The court held that the plaintiffs, as labor unions, could not enforce the rights of Columbia University (a non-party) to recover funding or challenge the government’s actions, as they were not direct recipients of the grants or contracts. The court emphasized that the Supreme Court’s recent decision in *Dep’t of Educ. v. California* (2025) confirmed that claims involving federal funding termination are contract-based and must be resolved in the Court of Federal Claims, not district courts under the APA. Additionally, the court found that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a direct, concrete injury traceable to the government’s actions, as Columbia had already taken steps to address antisemitism and the funding cuts were based on agency discretion under existing contractual terms. The dismissal was without prejudice, leaving the door open for the plaintiffs to pursue claims in the appropriate forum.",
    "46580": "On May 7, 2025, a coalition of 16 U.S. states, including Washington, California, and New York, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit in the Western District of Washington against the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), its Secretary Sean Duffy, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and Acting Administrator Gloria M. Shepherd. The states allege that the FHWA unlawfully suspended the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program on February 6, 2025, by rescinding its guidance, revoking approvals of state EV infrastructure deployment plans, and withholding $2.74 billion in congressionally appropriated funds. This action, they argue, violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by exceeding statutory authority, is arbitrary and capricious, and contravenes the Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine by usurping Congress’s spending authority. The states claim they relied on FHWA approvals to develop EV infrastructure plans, award contracts, and secure funding for projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting clean transportation. The court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction on June 24, 2025, enjoining the defendants from suspending or revoking the states’ approved plans or withholding NEVI funds absent compliance with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)’s procedures. However, the injunction was stayed for seven days, pending potential appeals. The order emphasized that the NEVI Program’s funds must be distributed according to statutory formulas and that the defendants’ actions caused irreparable harm by halting infrastructure projects and creating administrative chaos. The injunction applies to 14 states but was denied for the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont due to insufficient evidence of harm. Public interest organizations, including the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council, were granted leave to intervene as party plaintiffs, expanding the scope of the litigation to include broader environmental and consumer interests.",
    "46259": "On March 13, 2025, students at Columbia University and Barnard College (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against the university’s trustees, presidents, the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce, and federal officials, alleging violations of the First Amendment. The Plaintiffs, who use pseudonyms to protect their identities, claim that the Committee’s February 13, 2025, demand for student disciplinary records related to 11 campus incidents—ranging from protests against Israeli policies to events involving university trustees—constitutes unlawful “jawboning,” where the government coerces private entities to suppress protected speech through threats of withholding federal funding. They argue that the Committee’s actions, including publicizing redacted disciplinary records and pressuring Columbia to adopt restrictive policies like mask bans and expanded law enforcement presence, chill their rights to free expression, association, and academic freedom, and expose them to doxxing, harassment, and reputational harm.  \n\nThe university defendants initially agreed to produce redacted records but later faced a motion to dismiss from the Committee and federal agency defendants, who asserted immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause and sovereign immunity. On April 4, 2025, Judge Arun Subramanian denied the Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order without prejudice, requiring Columbia to notify the court and Plaintiffs 30 days before producing any further student records. After multiple procedural filings, including a second amended complaint and a stipulated protective order to safeguard Plaintiffs’ identities, the case proceeded. On June 18, 2025, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed federal agency defendants (Pam Bondi, Linda McMahon, Leo Terrell, Sean Keveney, and Josh Gruenbaum) in their individual capacities without prejudice, emphasizing they remain in their official capacities. The court’s jurisdiction over the remaining claims hinges on whether the Committee’s legislative inquiries and Columbia’s compliance violate the First Amendment, with motions to dismiss and oppositions still pending. The case underscores tensions between congressional oversight, institutional autonomy, and free speech protections in higher education.",
    "46557": "On May 5, 2025, multiple U.S. states (including New York, Washington, Rhode Island, and others) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and several HHS agencies and officials. The plaintiffs allege that the March 27, 2025, “HHS Announces Transformation to Make America Healthy Again” directive, which triggered mass layoffs of 10,000 employees and reorganization of HHS, violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the U.S. Constitution by being arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The directive, issued under Executive Order 14,210, purportedly aimed to streamline HHS operations but instead crippled critical public health functions, including those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and other sub-agencies. Plaintiffs argue that the abrupt terminations and restructurings disrupted statutorily mandated programs, such as infectious disease surveillance, maternal health monitoring, occupational safety research, and tobacco regulation, causing irreparable harm to state health systems and residents. The case was assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose, who granted a preliminary injunction on July 1, 2025, enjoining HHS from implementing the reorganization and layoffs affecting specific agencies and programs until further order. Defendants sought to vacate the injunction and a stay pending appeal, but both motions were denied on July 18, 2025. The lawsuit remains active, with ongoing proceedings to address the legality of the HHS restructuring under congressional mandates and constitutional limits on executive authority.",
    "46511": "On April 29, 2025, a group of 24 U.S. states and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against the Corporation for National and Community Service (operating as AmeriCorps) and its interim head, Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine. The plaintiffs, represented by their respective attorneys general, claimed that the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) unit unilaterally terminated nearly 1,031 AmeriCorps programs, removed over 750 National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) members from service, and placed 85% of AmeriCorps staff on administrative leave, all without required public notice-and-comment rulemaking or justification under federal law. The complaint emphasized that these actions disrupted critical services, including disaster relief, education, and healthcare, for vulnerable populations, and violated statutory mandates requiring AmeriCorps to allocate funds and operate programs in accordance with congressional directives.  \n\nOn May 6, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to block the agency actions. The court granted the motion in part on June 5, 2025, enjoining the defendants from terminating AmeriCorps grants, exiting members, or removing NCCC volunteers in the plaintiff states, and requiring compliance with notice-and-comment procedures before making significant changes to service delivery. The injunction was modified on July 10, 2025, to narrow its scope to actions affecting only the plaintiff states, following the Supreme Court’s ruling in *Trump v. CASA*, which limited the power of federal courts to issue universal injunctions. The court also denied the defendants’ request to stay the injunction for seven days and rejected their argument that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims, emphasizing that the plaintiffs sought equitable relief, not monetary damages. The defendants were ordered to restore terminated programs and reengage affected members, while retaining the authority to terminate individual grants or dismiss staff for cause. The injunction remains in effect pending further court orders.",
    "46350": "On April 7, 2025, the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), its Acting Director Keith Sonderling, President Donald Trump, and other federal entities, alleging violations of the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs argued that an executive order issued by President Trump on March 14, 2025—titled “Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy”—unlawfully directed IMLS to cease operations, terminate grants, and reduce its workforce, thereby violating the separation of powers, the Take Care Clause, and statutory mandates under the Museum and Library Services Act (MLSA). They sought a preliminary injunction to halt these actions and restore IMLS’s operations, citing irreparable harm to libraries, library patrons, and their own programs reliant on IMLS funding and expertise.  \n\nThe complaint detailed IMLS’s statutory role in supporting library services nationwide, including grants for technology, data collection, and programs targeting underserved communities. Following the executive order, IMLS staff were placed on administrative leave, grants were canceled, and the National Museum and Library Services Board was disbanded. Plaintiffs emphasized that these actions disrupted critical services, such as digital resource access and literacy programs, and threatened library closures. Defendants countered that the APA and Tucker Act barred the court from reviewing grant terminations, which are contractual matters under the Court of Federal Claims, and that the executive order fell within the President’s authority to manage federal agencies. They also argued that plaintiffs lacked standing to seek broad injunctive relief and that their claims were unripe or not justiciable.  \n\nOn May 1, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) in part but later denied the preliminary injunction on June 6, 2025, finding plaintiffs had not met the jurisdictional requirements. The court directed the parties to submit a joint status report by June 13, 2025, and set deadlines for dispositive motions, including a motion to dismiss by June 30, 2025, and summary judgment briefing by August and September 2025. The case centers on whether the executive branch’s restructuring of IMLS exceeds its authority and whether the court can intervene in disputes over federal grant funding and agency operations.",
    "46746": "On June 27, 2025, environmental organizations Friends of the Everglades, Inc., and the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) Executive Director Kevin Guthrie, and Miami-Dade County. The plaintiffs alleged that the conversion of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (“TNT Site”) in Big Cypress National Preserve into a mass migrant detention and deportation facility violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and Florida environmental and land-use laws. The complaint highlighted the site’s ecological sensitivity, including habitat for endangered species like the Florida panther and Florida bonneted bat, and its role in the $20 billion Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP).  \n\nThe plaintiffs sought an injunction to halt construction and operations at the TNT Site until environmental reviews were completed. On August 6–7, 2025, the court held an evidentiary hearing, during which plaintiffs presented testimony about environmental harms, including increased light pollution, runoff risks, and disruption of wildlife. Defendants countered that the facility was state-operated, not federally controlled, and that NEPA did not apply. On August 21, 2025, the court issued a preliminary injunction, halting further construction and requiring removal of infrastructure within 60 days, citing NEPA violations. Defendants appealed, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction and that the injunction was improperly issued.  \n\nOn August 26, 2025, the Eleventh Circuit granted a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal, recognizing that the facility’s construction was a state action not subject to NEPA, and that the injunction risked irreparable harm to Florida’s immigration enforcement capacity. The appellate court emphasized that NEPA applies only to federal actions and that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate imminent, irreparable environmental harm. The stay allowed the appeal to proceed while preserving the facility’s operations. The case remains active in the Eleventh Circuit, with no settlement or decree terms finalized as of the documents’ date.",
    "46388": "On April 11, 2025, the American Association of University Professors–Harvard Faculty Chapter and the American Association of University Professors (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against multiple federal agencies and officials, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the General Services Administration. The lawsuit challenges the Trump administration’s alleged unlawful use of federal funding and civil rights enforcement authority to coerce Harvard University into implementing sweeping changes to its governance, admissions, hiring, and disciplinary policies, purportedly to combat antisemitism. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to follow required procedural steps, such as providing findings of noncompliance, attempting voluntary compliance, and offering hearings before threatening funding cuts. The complaint also asserts that these actions infringe on Harvard’s First Amendment rights by targeting protected speech and academic freedom.  \n\nDefendants initiated a “comprehensive review” of Harvard’s federal funding in March 2025, culminating in a $2.2 billion funding freeze and termination of grants in April 2025 after Harvard rejected their demands. The Trump administration reportedly expanded this campaign to other universities, such as Columbia, Northwestern, and Cornell, using similar tactics. Plaintiffs highlight that Harvard had already taken steps to address antisemitism, including adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism and settling prior lawsuits related to discrimination. However, Defendants’ actions, they claim, lack a reasoned basis, ignore statutory requirements, and create a climate of fear, chilling free speech and academic inquiry.  \n\nThe case includes multiple motions, including an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (withdrawn), an amended complaint, and a motion for summary judgment. On May 20, 2025, the court granted leave to file a second amended complaint, which expanded the defendant list to include additional agencies like the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense. On June 2, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Defendants’ actions are arbitrary, capricious, and unconstitutional. The court scheduled oral argument for July 21, 2025, and set deadlines for briefing. The case remains active, with no settlement or decree issued yet, and Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction to halt Defendants’ actions and a declaration that they are unlawful.",
    "46625": "On May 21, 2025, the Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Affirmative Action (doing business as Stop AAPI Hate), FORCE Detroit, Health Resources in Action (HRiA), and Vera Institute of Justice filed a class action complaint against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi, and OJP, alleging that the abrupt termination of over 370 multi-year federal grants in April 2025 violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The plaintiffs, non-profit organizations providing critical public safety services such as community violence intervention, victim support, and training for law enforcement, claimed the terminations were arbitrary and capricious, as OJP provided no individualized rationale and relied on vague assertions that the grants no longer aligned with “agency priorities.” The complaint sought a preliminary injunction to reinstate funding, a declaration that the terminations were unlawful, and class certification for all affected grantees.  \n\nOJP defended the terminations under 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4), which allows agencies to terminate grants if they no longer serve program goals or priorities. However, the plaintiffs argued that this provision requires explicit contractual language permitting termination based on changing priorities, which was absent in their grant agreements. The court denied the preliminary injunction and dismissed the case on July 7, 2025, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction under the APA because the claims were essentially contractual in nature, governed by the Tucker Act, which grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of Federal Claims for such disputes. The court also found that the plaintiffs failed to establish irreparable harm or a likelihood of success on constitutional claims.  \n\nFollowing this, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, arguing that the terminations caused immediate harm to vulnerable communities and that the court should intervene to prevent further damage. The court denied this motion on July 21, 2025, stating that the case was not among the rare exceptions warranting such relief and that the appeal could proceed without it. The defendants’ motion to dismiss was granted, and the motion for class certification was deemed moot. The case centers on whether federal agencies can unilaterally terminate grants based on shifting priorities without contractual authorization, and whether the APA permits judicial review of such actions.",
    "46387": "On April 11, 2025, Susman Godfrey LLP, a Houston-based trial law firm, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging Executive Order 14263 issued by President Donald J. Trump on April 9, 2025. The Order, titled *Addressing Risks from Susman Godfrey*, accused the firm of retaliating against its clients and engaging in activities deemed “detrimental to critical American interests,” including defending the integrity of the 2020 presidential election and administering a diversity program offering awards to “students of color.” The Order directed federal agencies to suspend security clearances of Susman employees, terminate contracts with the firm or its clients, and restrict access to government buildings and hiring of its personnel.  \n\nSusman sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging violations of the First Amendment (retaliation, viewpoint discrimination, and unconstitutional conditions on government contracts), the Fifth Amendment (due process and right to counsel), and the separation of powers. The court granted a temporary restraining order on April 15, 2025, enjoining enforcement of Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the Order. After a hearing and extensive briefing, the court ruled on June 27, 2025, that the Order was unconstitutional, granting summary judgment to Susman on claims related to the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and separation of powers. The court permanently enjoined Defendants from implementing the Order and declared it void. The decision emphasized that the President’s actions exceeded his authority and chilled protected legal advocacy, citing precedents such as *NRA v. Vullo* and *Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez*. The ruling followed similar cases against other law firms, where courts uniformly found comparable executive orders unconstitutional and issued permanent injunctions.",
    "46245": "On March 18, 2025, the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) and five of its appointed board members filed a lawsuit against President Donald J. Trump, senior administration officials, and the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged that the President’s February 19, 2025, Executive Order 14217—labeling USIP as part of the “Federal bureaucracy” and directing its reduction—was unlawful. They further claimed that the removal of their board members and the Acting President, Ambassador George Moose, violated the USIP Act’s statutory protections, which require specific procedures for presidential removals, including consultation with the board or congressional committee approvals.  \n\nThe case escalated when DOGE officials, accompanied by law enforcement, forcibly entered USIP’s headquarters on March 17, 2025, causing property damage and attempting to seize control. Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to halt these actions, but the court denied the TRO on March 19, 2025, citing insufficient evidence of irreparable harm or likelihood of success on the merits. However, on May 19, 2025, the district court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs, declaring the removal of the board members and Acting President unlawful under the USIP Act, nullifying subsequent actions by DOGE, and ordering the reinstatement of the plaintiffs’ leadership roles. The court emphasized that USIP, while a federally chartered entity, does not exercise executive power and is thus not subject to presidential removal authority under Article II.  \n\nDefendants appealed, requesting a stay pending resolution. On June 27, 2025, a motions panel of the D.C. Circuit granted the stay, citing the government’s likelihood of success on the merits and the risk of irreparable harm to USIP if the district court’s order remained in effect. The panel’s decision, however, drew criticism for conflating USIP’s status as a government entity with executive branch authority, despite the court’s finding that USIP operates independently of the Executive Branch. The case remains under appellate review, with en banc reconsideration sought to address constitutional questions about the scope of presidential removal power.",
    "46274": "On March 8, 2025, Climate United Fund (a nonprofit financial institution) filed a complaint against Citibank, N.A., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, alleging violations of contract law, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the U.S. Constitution’s Due Process Clause. The case arose after EPA terminated Climate United’s $6.97 billion National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) grant under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), which appropriated $27 billion for clean energy projects. Climate United argued that EPA’s termination was unlawful, as the grant required funds to be held at Citibank under an Account Control Agreement (ACA) and Financial Agency Agreement (FAA), which EPA had not properly invoked. Citibank, acting as a financial agent, had paused disbursements at EPA’s direction, citing investigations into potential fraud and lack of oversight, but plaintiffs contended this violated their contractual rights and APA requirements.  \n\nOn March 18, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent EPA from enforcing its termination and Citibank from withholding funds. Subsequently, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, which the court granted on April 15, 2025, enjoining EPA and Citibank from interfering with Climate United’s access to its NCIF grant funds. Federal Defendants appealed, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction and that the TRO and injunction were improper. However, the court rejected these claims, affirming jurisdiction over APA and constitutional challenges and emphasizing that the plaintiffs’ rights stemmed from statutory and regulatory frameworks, not just contracts. The case involves consolidated suits from other grantees and subgrantees, with the central issue being whether EPA’s termination of the grants adhered to the IRA’s requirements, APA standards, and the ACA’s terms. The court’s orders prioritized restoring access to funds to prevent irreparable harm to plaintiffs’ operations and programs, which support clean energy and affordable housing initiatives.",
    "46142": "On February 19, 2025, the National Urban League, National Fair Housing Alliance, and AIDS Foundation of Chicago (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump and multiple federal agencies, alleging violations of the First and Fifth Amendments and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The lawsuit challenges Executive Orders 14151, 14168, and 14173, which prohibit federal contractors and grantees from engaging in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (“DEIA”) initiatives, restrict speech acknowledging transgender identities, and mandate the termination of “equity-related” grants and contracts. Plaintiffs, which rely on federal funding to advance civil rights and support marginalized communities, argue the orders are unconstitutionally vague, chill protected speech, and impose arbitrary penalties, including funding cuts and enforcement actions under the False Claims Act.  \n\nThe complaint highlights that the executive orders lack clear definitions of prohibited terms like “DEI,” “DEIA,” and “gender ideology,” leaving Plaintiffs uncertain about compliance. Federal agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), issued memoranda and directives to implement the orders, freezing funds and threatening termination of grants. Courts in Maryland and Illinois previously granted preliminary injunctions against similar provisions, finding them unconstitutional for vagueness and viewpoint discrimination. However, the District of Columbia court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction on March 12, 2025, ruling they failed to establish standing or show a likelihood of success on the merits. The court emphasized that the orders’ enforcement against Plaintiffs was not yet ripe for adjudication and that the government’s actions did not necessarily violate constitutional rights.  \n\nPlaintiffs also opposed Do No Harm’s motion to intervene as a defendant, arguing it lacked Article III standing and sought to introduce unrelated policy disputes. The court denied the intervention request without prejudice but allowed Do No Harm to participate as an amicus. The case remains active, with ongoing litigation and potential appeals, as Plaintiffs continue to assert that the executive orders undermine civil rights protections and federal funding for programs addressing systemic inequities.",
    "46110": "On February 12, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and senior officials from multiple federal agencies. The unions allege that executive actions—namely, a February 11, 2025, Executive Order directing large-scale reductions in force (RIFs) targeting nonessential and probationary employees, OPM’s guidance to fire probationary workers, and a “deferred resignation program” offering voluntary exits with continued pay—violate constitutional separation of powers principles and statutory requirements governing RIFs, including 5 U.S.C. § 3502 and the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS).  \n\nThe unions argue that Congress retains plenary authority over the creation, funding, and operational structure of federal agencies, and the Executive Branch’s mass firings undermine statutory mandates and congressional appropriations. They sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to halt the actions, citing irreparable harm to their bargaining power and revenue. The court held a hearing on February 18, 2025, but denied the motion on February 20, 2025, ruling it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The court emphasized that challenges to federal employment policies must first go through administrative review under the FSLMRS, not directly to district court. Defendants later filed a motion to dismiss, reinforcing that the unions’ claims were procedural and not justiciable in this forum. The case remains active, with the unions amending their complaint on February 17, 2025, and the court setting deadlines for responses. The dispute centers on whether the executive’s workforce reforms infringe on congressional authority or comply with existing legal frameworks.",
    "46098": "On February 11, 2025, the Global Health Council, Small Business Association for International Companies, HIAS, Management Sciences for Health, Chemonics International, DAI Global, Democracy International, and the American Bar Association filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and other executive officials, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and constitutional separation-of-powers principles. The plaintiffs, which include nonprofits and businesses reliant on U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Department of State funding, claimed that Executive Order 14,169—issued on January 20, 2025, titled “Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid”—unlawfully froze congressionally appropriated foreign assistance, causing irreparable harm by halting payments, terminating contracts, and disrupting humanitarian programs.  \n\nThe court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 13, 2025, enjoining the defendants from enforcing the funding freeze for programs existing as of January 19, 2025, but allowed continued termination of awards under contractual terms. Subsequent motions to enforce the TRO were filed, with the court ordering defendants to resume payments for completed work by February 26, 2025. Defendants appealed, but the D.C. Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, and the Supreme Court denied a stay. On March 10, 2025, the court issued a memorandum opinion granting a preliminary injunction in part, finding that the defendants likely violated the APA and separation-of-powers principles by unilaterally withholding funds without proper congressional consultation. However, the court also held that plaintiffs lacked standing to seek broader constitutional claims unrelated to statutory violations.  \n\nThe case involved consolidated proceedings with *AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. U.S. Department of State* (No. 25-cv-00400). Defendants argued that plaintiffs’ claims were contract-based and should be resolved in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, but the court rejected this, emphasizing that the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity applied to the challenged agency actions. Compliance with the preliminary injunction remained disputed, with defendants claiming feasibility issues, though the court mandated specific benchmarks for payment resumption. The litigation ultimately hinged on whether the executive branch’s actions exceeded statutory authority and whether plaintiffs could enforce their claims under the APA, with the court concluding that they lacked a cause of action for constitutional claims but retaining jurisdiction over statutory violations.",
    "46090": "In February 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) and several other organizations, including the National Consumer Law Center, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Virginia Poverty Law Center, and individual plaintiff Rev. Eva Steege, filed a lawsuit against Russell Vought, then-Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the CFPB itself. The plaintiffs alleged that the CFPB’s leadership, under President Trump’s directives, unlawfully suspended statutorily mandated activities, terminated employees, cancelled contracts, and planned to shut down the agency, violating separation of powers principles and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The case centered on whether the CFPB’s actions constituted final agency decisions reviewable under the APA and whether the plaintiffs had standing to challenge them.  \n\nThe district court granted a preliminary injunction on March 28, 2025, ordering the CFPB to maintain its operations, reinstate terminated employees, and avoid work stoppages. However, the defendants appealed, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction over employment-related claims under the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) and that the APA did not permit review of abstract agency decisions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit partially stayed the injunction, allowing the CFPB to conduct reductions-in-force (RIFs) if deemed necessary by a “particularized assessment” of statutory duties. Despite this, the CFPB proceeded to terminate over 1,400 employees, prompting plaintiffs to seek enforcement of the injunction.  \n\nOn August 15, 2025, the appellate court vacated the preliminary injunction, holding that the APA does not authorize review of unrecorded, abstract decisions to shut down an agency and that the CSRA provides the exclusive remedy for employment disputes. The court emphasized that the CFPB’s actions—such as emails directing work pauses and RIFs—were not final agency decisions but discretionary measures within its statutory authority. The plaintiffs’ claims were deemed too broad and programmatic to qualify for APA review or equitable relief, as they did not target specific, final agency actions. The case underscores the limits of judicial review over executive agency operations and the primacy of statutory review schemes like the CSRA.",
    "PN-NY-0014": "On March 28, 2012, a class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, challenging the New York City Police Department’s (“NYPD”) unconstitutional stop, question, search, citation, and arrest practices under the Trespass Affidavit Program (“TAP”), previously known as Operation Clean Halls. The plaintiffs, African-American and Latino residents of the Bronx and their minor children, alleged that the NYPD routinely subjected residents and visitors of TAP-enrolled private buildings to suspicionless stops and searches, often resulting in arrests or summonses without probable cause, and that these practices disproportionately targeted Black and Latino individuals, violating the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.  \n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, who granted a preliminary injunction on January 8, 2013, finding a clear likelihood of success on the merits due to the NYPD’s deliberate indifference to unlawful trespass stops. However, the Second Circuit later ordered the case reassigned to Judge Analisa Torres, citing concerns about impartiality, and the City withdrew its appeals in 2017, settling the matter. The settlement, effective July 19, 2017, required the NYPD to implement reforms, including revised written policies for stops and frisks, mandatory training on constitutional standards and racial profiling, supervisory review of stops, and the appointment of a court-appointed monitor, Peter L. Zimroth, to oversee compliance. The NYPD was also directed to adopt a standardized stop report form, limit stops to those with reasonable suspicion, and ensure that arrests and searches met constitutional and legal thresholds.  \n\nThe settlement included a “Joint Remedial Process” involving community stakeholders and required the NYPD to address underreporting of stops, improve training, and conduct audits. The monitor’s reports evaluated the NYPD’s progress, highlighting challenges such as inconsistent implementation of policies and residual racial disparities in enforcement. The City agreed to maintain these reforms for a period tied to substantial compliance, with the monitor retaining authority to assess adherence. The case was ultimately closed on July 19, 2017, with the City committing to ongoing compliance measures and periodic reviews to ensure lawful policing practices.",
    "PB-CT-0007": "On November 9, 2010, plaintiffs Joanne Pedersen, Ann Meitzen, Gerald V. Passaro II, Lynda DeForge, Raquel Ardin, Janet Geller, Joanne Marquis, Suzanne and Geraldine Artis, Bradley Kleinerman, James Gehre, and Damon Savoy, John Weiss filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut challenging Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 1 U.S.C. § 7, as a violation of the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. The plaintiffs, all legally married same-sex couples under Connecticut, Vermont, or New Hampshire law, alleged that DOMA’s definition of marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman excluded them from federal benefits and protections available to opposite-sex married individuals, including health insurance coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB), Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave for spousal care, Social Security lump-sum death benefits, tax filing status under the Internal Revenue Code, and pension benefits under the New Hampshire Retirement System. The case was assigned to Judge Vanessa L. Bryant, who denied the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives’ (BLAG) motion to dismiss and granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on July 31, 2012, holding that DOMA’s discrimination based on sexual orientation violated the Fifth Amendment. The district court’s judgment was entered on August 2, 2012, and the plaintiffs appealed to the Second Circuit, which docketed the case as No. 12-3273. The case is part of a broader legal landscape involving DOMA, with related challenges such as *Gill v. Office of Personnel Management* and *Windsor v. United States* pending in other courts. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including a permanent injunction against DOMA’s enforcement, which the district court granted, concluding that DOMA’s provisions lacked a rational basis and failed to meet constitutional scrutiny.",
    "PC-AL-0034": "On May 28, 2015, the United States of America filed a lawsuit against the State of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (42 U.S.C. § 1997), alleging violations of the Eighth Amendment by failing to protect female inmates at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women from sexual abuse and harassment by staff and other prisoners. The case was initially assigned to Judge Myron H. Thompson, who later referred it to Judge Terry F. Moorer. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) had previously investigated Tutwiler, finding systemic failures dating back over 18 years, including insufficient staffing, inadequate policies, and a toxic environment enabling sexual misconduct.  \n\nThe parties reached a settlement on May 28, 2015, which was approved by the court as a consent decree on June 18, 2015. The decree conditionally dismissed the complaint without prejudice, contingent on compliance with remedial measures. The agreement required ADOC to implement gender-responsive policies, ensure access to hygiene products, improve staffing levels, enhance training for staff and contractors, and establish a court-appointed monitor (Kathleen Dennehy) to oversee compliance. ADOC was also mandated to address architectural deficiencies, revise disciplinary practices, and conduct regular audits.  \n\nThe settlement included a grievance system, mandatory reporting of abuse, and protections for transgender and gender-nonconforming inmates. ADOC and Tutwiler faced ongoing challenges in staffing, with correctional officer vacancies remaining high, and relied on overtime and temporary assignments to mitigate risks. The monitor’s reports through 2019 highlighted progress in policy development and training but noted persistent issues, including inconsistent staff adherence to protocols, racial disparities in treatment, and delays in medical care. ADOC retained jurisdiction over the decree, with the monitor submitting periodic compliance assessments. The case was formally closed on February 27, 2019, after the parties addressed most requirements, though some provisions remained under review.",
    "ED-MI-0001": "In November 2006, Michigan voters approved Proposal 2, a constitutional amendment banning race and gender-based preferences in public university admissions, employment, and contracting. The Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (BAMN), along with students, faculty, and civil rights organizations, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on November 8, 2006, challenging Proposal 2 as unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and federal civil rights laws (Titles VI, VII, and IX). The plaintiffs argued that the amendment imposed an unequal political burden on racial and gender minorities by requiring them to seek constitutional changes—a difficult and costly process—to restore affirmative action policies, unlike other groups that could lobby universities directly. The case was consolidated with a similar suit by Chase Cantrell and others, who alleged that Proposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause by restructuring the political process to disadvantage minorities.  \n\nThe University of Michigan and other public universities initially sought a preliminary injunction to delay enforcement of Proposal 2, leading to a stipulated temporary injunction effective until July 1, 2007. The Michigan Attorney General intervened as a defendant, and the case proceeded through motions, including class certification and summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment for the Attorney General, ruling that Proposal 2 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Sixth Circuit initially reversed this decision, citing *Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1* and *Hunter v. Erickson*, which prohibit laws that disproportionately burden minorities by altering political processes. However, the Supreme Court ultimately reversed the Sixth Circuit’s judgment in *Schuttte v. BAMN* (2014), holding that Proposal 2 was a valid exercise of Michigan voters’ democratic authority to end race-based preferences, emphasizing that the Constitution does not compel states to maintain such policies. The Supreme Court clarified that while the Equal Protection Clause prohibits discriminatory state action, it does not invalidate voter-enacted measures that neutralize race-conscious admissions policies, even if they reduce diversity, as long as they do not reflect a discriminatory purpose. The case concluded with the affirmation of Proposal 2’s constitutionality, allowing Michigan’s public universities to comply with the amendment.",
    "DR-CA-0033": "On August 22, 2005, Maurizio Antoninetti, a paraplegic using a wheelchair, filed a lawsuit against Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California’s Disabled Persons Act (CDPA) due to architectural barriers at two Chipotle restaurants in San Diego and Encinitas. Specifically, Antoninetti claimed that a 44-inch-high wall separating customers from food preparation counters obstructed his view of ingredients and the assembly of his meal, denying him equal access to the “Chipotle Experience.” Chipotle initially answered the complaint and later filed motions for summary judgment, arguing its written “Customers with Disabilities Policy” provided “equivalent facilitation” under ADA guidelines. The district court granted partial summary judgment, finding Chipotle’s prior unwritten policy inadequate but its written policy compliant, and awarded Antoninetti $5,000 in damages for five “bona fide” visits. However, the court denied injunctive relief, deeming the wall’s height not a barrier to equivalent facilitation.  \n\nAntoninetti appealed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Chipotle’s written policy also violated the ADA by failing to ensure wheelchair users could observe food preparation comparable to standing customers. The appellate court vacated the damages award and remanded for determination of injunctive relief and fees. On remand, the district court ruled Antoninetti’s death in 2011 mooted the injunctive relief claim but upheld the $5,000 damages. The court also addressed attorney’s fees, initially awarding $136,537.83, which Antoninetti appealed, arguing the fees were disproportionately low given the legal significance of the case. The Ninth Circuit further vacated the fees award, directing reconsideration in light of its ruling that Chipotle’s policy violated the ADA. Ultimately, the case highlighted the ADA’s requirement for accessible design in new construction, rejecting reliance on policies alone to overcome physical barriers.",
    "CJ-FL-0009": "In 2019, multiple plaintiffs, including individuals with felony convictions and organizations like the Florida State Conference of the NAACP and the League of Women Voters of Florida, filed a class action lawsuit challenging Florida’s Senate Bill 7066 (SB7066), which imposed payment of legal financial obligations (LFOs)—such as fines, restitution, and court costs—as a prerequisite for restoring voting rights under Amendment 4 of the Florida Constitution. Amendment 4, approved by voters in 2018, automatically restored voting rights to most felons upon completing their sentences, including parole or probation. However, SB7066, enacted in July 2019, redefined “completion of all terms of sentence” to include LFOs, effectively disenfranchising many low-income individuals unable to pay these fees. Plaintiffs argued this created a wealth-based disparity, violating the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and the Twenty-Fourth Amendment by functioning as a modern poll tax, while also causing procedural due process concerns due to unclear eligibility criteria and inconsistent enforcement across counties.  \n\nThe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida granted a preliminary injunction in October 2019, allowing plaintiffs to register and vote if they demonstrated genuine inability to pay LFOs. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed this injunction in January 2020, applying heightened scrutiny to the wealth discrimination claim. However, the district court later issued a permanent injunction, which was partially stayed pending appeal. After an 8-day trial, the district court ruled SB7066 unconstitutional as applied to indigent felons, citing wealth discrimination and a tax on voting. The Eleventh Circuit, in a September 2020 en banc decision, reversed this, holding that Florida’s classification of felons who completed all sentence terms (including LFOs) survived rational basis review and that LFOs were not “taxes” under the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. The court emphasized that disenfranchisement based on unpaid LFOs was a legitimate exercise of state authority to set voter qualifications, not a poll tax. The case highlights tensions between voter rights restoration and financial obligations, with the plaintiffs asserting that indigent felons are unfairly burdened, while the state maintains compliance with constitutional standards.",
    "CW-CA-0005": "In December 2002, a class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (Case No. CV-02-05662 AHM (SHx)) by five pseudonymously named foster children, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other advocacy groups, against the California Department of Health Services (DHS), the California Department of Social Services (DSS), Los Angeles County, and its Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). The plaintiffs alleged that Defendants violated the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions of the Medicaid Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, and California state law by failing to provide medically necessary mental health services, such as wraparound services and therapeutic foster care (TFC), to foster children with behavioral, emotional, or psychiatric impairments. The lawsuit sought declaratory and injunctive relief to compel compliance with these obligations, not monetary damages.  \n\nOn June 18, 2003, the court certified a class of California children in foster care or at imminent risk of placement who required individualized mental health services. A settlement was reached in July 2003, approved by the court on July 16, 2003, requiring Defendants to provide wraparound and TFC services through Medi-Cal or other means. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. However, the Ninth Circuit reversed the 2006 preliminary injunction in 2007, finding the district court had applied an incorrect legal standard to the EPSDT requirements. The case was remanded, and subsequent orders in 2008 and 2011 mandated revisions to the implementation plan, including developing a Medi-Cal Documentation Manual and establishing a Shared Management Structure between DSS and DHCS.  \n\nA stipulated judgment was entered in December 2011, finalizing the settlement. The court-appointed Advisory Panel, tasked with monitoring compliance, reported in 2018 that progress remained uneven: while some systems improved staffing and CFT facilitator training, critical gaps persisted, such as low rates of timely CFT meetings, underutilization of intensive services, and data system limitations hindering tracking of outcomes. Defendants faced ongoing challenges in meeting settlement obligations, including ensuring placement stability, adequate service delivery, and adherence to the Core Practice Model. The case highlights systemic failures in California’s foster care and mental health systems to meet legal mandates for community-based care, with monitoring efforts underscoring the need for sustained reforms.",
    "PC-VA-0022": "On December 19, 2014, Eric J. DePaola, a Virginia prisoner, filed a civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) and multiple officials, alleging violations of the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment and the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause. DePaola, who was sentenced to 38 years in prison at age 16 for crimes including malicious wounding and abduction, has been confined to Red Onion State Prison’s solitary confinement unit since 2007. After a 2009 incident where he stabbed a guard, he was classified as a “Level S” inmate under VDOC’s administrative segregation policy, which subjects prisoners to intensive management (IM) or special management (SM) status, involving prolonged isolation in single cells with minimal human contact, restricted environmental stimuli, and limited access to programs. DePaola argued that this classification, which he claims is permanent despite his compliance with rules, violates constitutional protections by inflicting psychological and physical harm without meaningful review or opportunity for reintegration into the general population.  \n\nThe case initially included co-plaintiffs Denis Rivera and Luis Velazquez but was later severed into three separate actions. The district court denied motions to appoint counsel and dismiss, allowing DePaola to amend his complaint. In May 2016, the court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss and ordered them to file a motion for summary judgment. VDOC and officials moved for summary judgment in July 2016, asserting that their policies were justified and did not violate constitutional rights. DePaola opposed the motion, citing evidence of the severe conditions of his solitary confinement, including constant bright lights, lack of privacy, and minimal social interaction, as well as expert testimony on the harm of prolonged isolation.  \n\nOn September 28, 2016, the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, dismissing all claims against VDOC as legally frivolous. DePaola appealed, arguing the court erred by granting summary judgment before discovery and that genuine disputes of material fact existed regarding the constitutionality of his indefinite solitary confinement. Amici curiae from psychiatry, psychology, and correctional experts supported the appeal, emphasizing that solitary confinement for over eight years causes severe psychological and physical harm, lacks meaningful review, and has feasible alternatives. The Fourth Circuit heard the appeal, but the case remains unresolved in the provided documents.",
    "CJ-MD-0001": "On January 19, 2006, Vernon Evans, Jr., a death-row inmate in Maryland, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the state’s lethal injection protocol violates his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by creating an unnecessary risk of conscious suffering during execution. The complaint targeted the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS), its Division of Correction (DOC), and various officials, including wardens and the DOC Commissioner, who were sued in their official capacities. Evans argued that the DOC’s use of a three-drug cocktail—sodium pentothal (an anesthetic), pancuronium bromide (a paralytic agent), and potassium chloride (a cardiac arrest agent)—deviates from Maryland law and constitutional standards. Specifically, the DOC’s protocol allegedly fails to ensure adequate anesthesia, uses unqualified personnel, and lacks safeguards for complications like IV leaks or failed venous access, which could leave Evans conscious and in excruciating pain.  \n\nThe case involved motions for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to halt Evans’s scheduled execution in February 2006, pending judicial review of the protocol. The court denied these motions, concluding that while the DOC’s procedures posed risks, the balance of harms favored the state, and Evans had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. However, the parties later filed a consent motion in February 2007, permitting a delay in compliance with court orders to address concerns about the availability of qualified medical personnel for executions. This motion was granted, reflecting an agreement to revisit procedural adequacy.  \n\nThe litigation drew on prior cases, including *Oken v. Sizer* (2004) and *Baker v. Saar* (2005), where similar challenges to Maryland’s lethal injection practices were dismissed. Evans’s claims also referenced veterinary standards prohibiting pancuronium bromide in animal euthanasia and highlighted inconsistencies between the DOC’s manual and statutory requirements under Maryland’s Death Penalty Procedures Statute (Md. Code Ann., Corr. Servs. § 3-905). The case was ultimately stayed and closed in 2012, with no final decree issued. Key documents included expert declarations from medical professionals critiquing the protocol’s risks, as well as redacted versions of the DOC’s Execution Operations Manual. The dispute centered on whether the state’s procedures met constitutional standards for humane execution and adhered to Maryland’s Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requirements for regulatory transparency and public input.",
    "CW-DC-0001": "In 1989, a class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of children in foster care and those reported to be abused or neglected, alleging violations of federal and local laws, including the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and the District’s Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act. The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and other counsel, argued that the District of Columbia’s Department of Human Services (DHS) systematically failed to investigate abuse/neglect reports promptly, provide adequate family services to prevent foster care placements, ensure appropriate care for children in foster care, and secure permanent homes through reunification or adoption. The court, presided over by Judge Thomas F. Hogan, found the DHS in violation of statutory and constitutional requirements, including the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, and ordered reforms. A remedial consent decree was entered in 1991, requiring the DHS to improve investigative timeliness, case planning, foster care placement practices, and oversight. The decree was later modified in 1994 to align with local law after appellate review, and the court appointed a monitor to ensure compliance. Despite progress, the DHS faced repeated contempt findings and receivership orders due to ongoing failures, including excessive caseloads, delayed investigations, and inadequate medical/dental care. By 2019, the parties proposed an Exit and Sustainability Plan to replace earlier implementation measures, reflecting continued efforts to address systemic deficiencies. The case underscores persistent challenges in reforming the District’s child welfare system, with the court retaining authority to enforce compliance through sanctions or injunctive relief."
