    "46567": "On May 5, 2025, G.M.G., a Venezuelan national detained in Rhode Island, filed a habeas corpus petition challenging a U.S. government proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to remove noncitizens designated as members of the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) to El Salvador without due process. The petition alleges the proclamation violates the AEA’s statutory requirements, as TdA is not a foreign government or nation, nor has it committed an invasion or predatory incursion against the U.S. It further claims the proclamation bypasses procedural protections under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including asylum and withholding of removal provisions, and contravenes the Convention Against Torture (CAT) by risking deportation to a country where torture is likely. The case involves multiple federal agencies and officials, including President Donald Trump, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, and is represented by the ACLU.  \n\nThe court issued orders on May 5 and May 7, 2025, requiring the government to provide at least 48 hours (later amended to 72 business days) of advance notice before transferring G.M.G. out of Rhode Island. The petition highlights prior unlawful removals of Venezuelans under the proclamation, including individuals mistakenly identified as TdA members, and cites rulings from other districts (e.g., *J.G.G. v. Trump*, *D.B.U. v. Trump*) that found the proclamation likely unlawful. The government’s process for designating TdA members relies on unreliable criteria like tattoos and hand gestures, and provides minimal notice (12–24 hours) before removal, violating due process under the Fifth Amendment. The case remains pending, with the petitioner seeking injunctive relief to block summary deportation and a declaration that the proclamation is unlawful.",
    "46582": "On April 30, 2025, Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian woman lawfully residing in the U.S. since 2016, filed a habeas corpus petition in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, challenging her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the Prairieland Detention Facility in Texas. Kordia was arrested in March 2025 after attending a peaceful protest near Columbia University in New York City to mourn family members killed in the Gaza conflict and sending a single financial payment to a relative in Palestine. She alleges that her detention violates the First Amendment (due to retaliation for protected speech and association) and the Fifth Amendment (procedural and substantive due process), as well as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), citing failures to accommodate her Muslim faith, including denial of halal meals and prayer accommodations.  \n\nThe case involves multiple government officials, including Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, and ICE personnel, who are named in their official capacities. Kordia’s legal team includes counsel from the Texas Civil Rights Project, Southern Poverty Law Center, and Muslim Advocates. The court granted a motion for a remote hearing on her preliminary injunction request, allowing public access via live stream but denying her request to attend in person due to ICE custody. A magistrate judge recommended her release pending final judgment, but the case was recommitted to address new objections raised by the government.  \n\nThe petition highlights a broader pattern of ICE targeting noncitizens for advocacy related to Palestinian rights under policies linked to President Trump’s executive orders, including the revocation of visas and detention of others like Mahmoud Khalil, Ranjani Srinivasan, and Dr. Badar Khan Suri, each with their own pending litigation. Kordia’s claims center on unlawful confinement, religious discrimination, and lack of due process, with the court ordering respondents to show cause why she should not be released within three days. The case remains active, with ongoing proceedings to resolve her detention and constitutional grievances.",
    "46496": "On April 24, 2025, the Southern Border Communities Coalition, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, and Urban Justice Center filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Secretary Kristi Noem, alleging that the defendants unlawfully eliminated three statutory DHS oversight offices—the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman Office (CISOM), and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO)—on March 21, 2025. The plaintiffs, nonprofit organizations advocating for immigrant rights and civil liberties, argued that the closures violated congressional statutes, including the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which mandated the existence and functions of these offices, such as investigating civil rights complaints, overseeing immigration detention conditions, and ensuring compliance with anti-discrimination laws. The defendants asserted the closures were necessary to streamline operations but faced immediate legal challenges. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to halt the closures and restore operations, citing irreparable harm to their ability to advocate for immigrants and enforce statutory protections. The court denied the temporary restraining order on May 23, 2025, but the motion for a preliminary injunction remained under advisement. After a hearing, the court granted a scheduling order on July 11, 2025, and denied the preliminary injunction as moot, directing the parties to proceed with expedited discovery and summary judgment motions. The case continues with procedural deadlines set for late 2025, including the submission of an administrative record and cross-motions for summary judgment.",
    "46432": "On April 18, 2025, Mohammed H., a 20-year-old Bangladeshi national and student at Minnesota State University, filed a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, challenging his detention by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Freeborn County Jail. He alleged violations of the First Amendment (retaliatory enforcement based on his pro-Palestinian social media posts), the Fifth Amendment (due process concerns from prolonged detention without individualized justification), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (unlawful termination of his SEVIS record without proper process). The case involved private counsel from Fredrikson & Byron, the ACLU of Minnesota, The Advocates for Human Rights, and the University of Minnesota Detainee Rights Clinic, opposing the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Freeborn County Attorney’s Office.  \n\nOn April 22, 2025, the court granted a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent ICE from transferring Mohammed H. out of Minnesota pending further proceedings. The TRO was extended multiple times, most recently until June 3, 2025. On May 5, 2025, the court ordered his release on a $7,500 bond after an immigration judge found him not a danger to the community. The Government appealed this decision to the Eighth Circuit on July 29, 2025.  \n\nIn a June 17, 2025, order, U.S. District Judge Jerry W. Blackwell granted Mohammed H.’s habeas petition, ruling that his detention violated constitutional and statutory protections. The court found that his SEVIS termination and visa revocation lacked lawful basis, his arrest appeared motivated by protected speech, and the automatic stay invoked by ICE to block his release was arbitrary. The judgment released him from custody under the previously imposed bond conditions. The case remains subject to appeal.",
    "46477": "On April 14, 2025, ten international students (later expanded to 31 plaintiffs) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against Kristi Noem (DHS Secretary), Todd Lyons (Acting ICE Director), and other officials, alleging that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unlawfully terminated their F-1 student records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) without valid statutory or regulatory grounds. The plaintiffs, who were enrolled in U.S. universities or in Optional Practical Training (OPT) or STEM OPT employment, claimed this action violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being arbitrary and capricious and infringed their constitutional due process rights.  \n\nOn April 15, 2025, plaintiffs sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to prevent further harm, including potential deportation and loss of employment authorization. The court granted the TRO on April 23, 2025, ordering DHS to restore the terminated SEVIS records retroactively, prohibit future terminations absent valid grounds, and halt removal proceedings based on the terminations. After additional briefing and an evidentiary hearing on May 6, 2025, the court issued a preliminary injunction on May 7, 2025, extending the relief. Defendants argued the terminations were lawful under immigration statutes but provided no satisfactory justification for the actions.  \n\nThe plaintiffs highlighted that none had been convicted of crimes of violence or violated immigration laws, yet their records were terminated based on vague reasons like “criminal records checks” or visa revocations. Defendants later restored the records but faced claims of insufficient compliance, as notations of restoration were not visible to schools. Defendants appealed the preliminary injunction on July 9, 2025, but the case remains active. Two plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims in July 2025. The court waived security requirements for the injunctions and emphasized the need to preserve the status quo to prevent irreparable harm to the students’ academic and professional opportunities.",
    "46239": "On March 17, 2025, Erie County, New York, filed a complaint against the Corporation for National and Community Service (Americorps) and its interim agency head, Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Constitution’s Spending Clause. The dispute arose after Americorps, in response to President Trump’s January 2025 Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 (which targeted “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) initiatives), demanded that Erie County revise its RSVP grant application or certify compliance with the orders, which conflicted with Americorps’ own 1999 regulations requiring grantees to promote diversity through advisory councils. Erie County argued that complying with the executive orders would force it to abandon its diversity-focused efforts, risking False Claims Act liability or loss of critical federal funding for senior services.  \n\nOn March 21, 2025, Erie County sought a preliminary injunction to block Americorps from enforcing the new certification requirements, asserting that the agency’s actions were arbitrary, violated its own rules, and imposed vague conditions on federal funding. Americorps opposed the motion, contending that the court lacked jurisdiction due to sovereign immunity and that the claim was not ripe, as no grant termination had occurred. Americorps also emphasized its discretion in administering grants and noted that plaintiffs could amend their applications to align with the executive orders.  \n\nOn April 14, 2025, Erie County voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice, citing that Americorps had revised its certification requirements post-filing. The court issued a minute order confirming the dismissal. The case did not proceed to trial or appeal, and no settlement or decree was finalized.",
    "46230": "On March 14, 2025, Jane Doe 1–6 and John Doe 7–12, nonpartisan career civil servants employed in the Veterans Benefits Administration’s Office of Equity Assurance (OEA), filed a complaint against Douglas A. Collins, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, alleging violations of the First and Fifth Amendments and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs claimed that the OEA was erroneously designated as a diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) office under Executive Order 14151, leading to their sudden placement on administrative leave, termination, and denial of reassignment opportunities without due process. They argued that the DEIA label was politically motivated, stigmatizing their work as “divisive” and “shameful,” and that the Veterans Affairs Department (VA) violated procedural requirements for reductions in force (RIF), including failing to provide proper notice, retention registers, or reassignment options. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to block the DEIA designation and restore their employment rights. On April 18, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which was denied by Judge Rudolph Contreras on May 2, 2025, following a hearing. The case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on July 17, 2025, after the parties submitted a status report. The court had initially considered a related case (Perkins Coie LLP v. U.S. Department of Justice) but later ruled the cases unrelated. No settlement or decree was issued, and the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction was not addressed before dismissal.",
    "46242": "On March 5, 2025, the BlueRibbon Coalition, Inc., Sage Riders Motorcycle Club, and Paul Wells (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Department of the Interior, challenging the legality of the BLM’s December 31, 2024, San Rafael Swell Travel Management Plan (“TMP”). The TMP closed 665 miles of motorized routes in the San Rafael Swell Travel Management Area (TMA), a region renowned for its scenic landscapes and recreational value. Plaintiffs allege the TMP violates the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act (Dingell Act) by creating de facto wilderness buffer zones around designated areas, contravening the Act’s prohibition on such restrictions. They further contend the BLM’s decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), as it failed to adequately address public comments, relied on invalid Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA guidelines, and bypassed standard administrative appeal processes by having the Secretary of the Interior directly approve the plan. Additionally, Plaintiffs argue the BLM violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by not conducting a required Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and instead relying on an insufficient Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI).  \n\nThe Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA) intervened as a defendant, seeking to protect the TMA’s natural and cultural resources from off-highway vehicle (OHV) damage. The court granted SUWA’s motion to intervene on April 21, 2025, recognizing its longstanding interest in the area and potential conflict with the federal defendants’ broader public interest obligations. The case is proceeding under Judge David Nuffer, with a scheduling order setting deadlines for briefing on the Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the TMP is unlawful, a permanent injunction blocking its enforcement, and costs, including attorney fees. The BLM and DOI have not yet filed a responsive pleading, and the litigation remains in its early stages.",
    "46039": "On February 4, 2025, the Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association (FBIAA) and several FBI agents (John and Jane Does 1–4) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the United States of America. The plaintiffs allege that the DOJ is retaliating against FBI personnel who investigated the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack and the Mar-a-Lago case by compiling and potentially disseminating their personal information, risking safety, reputational harm, and employment consequences. They claim violations of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a), the First Amendment (retaliation based on perceived political affiliation), and due process rights, seeking injunctive relief to block the disclosure of their identities and employment details.  \n\nThe DOJ responded on February 6, 2025, arguing that the information request was lawful under the Privacy Act for intra-agency reviews and that termination would only apply to employees with misconduct or partisan actions, not those who followed lawful orders. On February 7, 2025, Judge Jia M. Cobb deferred ruling on the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and ordered the government to halt public dissemination of the list until a preliminary injunction hearing scheduled for March 27, 2025. The court also set deadlines for briefing on the preliminary injunction. The cases were consolidated under Civil Action No. 25-0325, with the FBIAA and individual plaintiffs pursuing claims against the DOJ. The plaintiffs later voluntarily dismissed some claims, but the core dispute over the DOJ’s handling of personnel data remains unresolved.",
    "46681": "On February 3, 2025, Gary L. Barnes, a pro se plaintiff, filed a complaint in the U.S. Court of International Trade against the United States, challenging President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China under Executive Orders issued in February 2025. Barnes argued that the tariffs violated the U.S. Constitution by usurping Congress’s exclusive authority to levy duties (Article I, Sections 7 and 8) and undermining the separation of powers. He sought declaratory relief, injunctions to halt the tariffs, and an order compelling the President to uphold constitutional duties.  \n\nThe defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on March 21, 2025, asserting Barnes lacked Article III standing due to the absence of a concrete, particularized injury. The court agreed, ruling that Barnes’s generalized claims about economic harm and constitutional breaches—such as alleged “hidden taxes” on consumers or violations of the “Constitutional Contract”—were insufficient to establish standing. The court emphasized that standing requires a direct, personal injury traceable to the defendant’s actions and redressable by the court, which Barnes failed to demonstrate.  \n\nIn an opinion and order issued May 23, 2025, Judge Jennifer Choe-Groves dismissed the complaint without prejudice but allowed Barnes to file an amended complaint by June 23, 2025, to address pleading deficiencies. The court noted that while it had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i) to review tariffs, Barnes’s lack of standing precluded adjudication of the merits. Subsequent docket entries show Barnes requested reconsideration, and the court set deadlines for the defendant to respond to an amended complaint, if filed.",
    "46758": "On June 20, 2025, in the Central District of California, a putative class action was filed by individual plaintiffs and organizational plaintiffs, including the United Farm Workers of America and the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), against federal immigration officials led by Kristi Noem, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and others. The plaintiffs alleged that federal agents conducting “Operation At Large” in Los Angeles engaged in unlawful detentive stops and arrests without reasonable suspicion, violating the Fourth Amendment. Specific incidents included the detention of U.S. citizen Jason Brian Gavidia at a carwash, where agents ignored his assertions of citizenship and physically restrained him, and the arrest of three individuals—Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Carlos Osorto, and Isaac Villegas Molina—at a bus stop after agents pointed a taser at Osorto and failed to show warrants. The plaintiffs also claimed that the government’s practice of targeting locations like carwashes and bus stops, combined with factors such as race, language, and occupation, created a pattern of unconstitutional profiling.  \n\nOn July 11, 2025, the district court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining defendants from conducting detentive stops based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, language, location, or occupation, finding these practices lacked reasonable suspicion and constituted a broader pattern of misconduct. The TRO was later extended beyond its initial 14-day term. Defendants appealed, arguing the TRO was impermissibly vague and exceeded the court’s jurisdiction, but the Ninth Circuit denied their motion for a stay pending appeal, except for a narrow exception regarding the phrase “except as permitted by law.” On July 30, 2025, a magistrate judge ordered the release of petitioner Carlos Osorto on a $5,000 bond with ankle monitoring after finding his health was at risk due to prior detention conditions and inconsistent government positions on jurisdiction.  \n\nThe case involves significant procedural filings, including motions to intervene by multiple cities and counties, and a preliminary injunction hearing scheduled for September 24, 2025. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin ongoing unlawful stops, certify a class action, and address constitutional violations of due process and access to counsel. The Ninth Circuit’s August 1, 2025, order clarified that while the TRO was appealable, the defendants failed to demonstrate irreparable harm from its enforcement. The district court’s TRO remains in effect, prohibiting suspicionless stops in the Central District unless supported by reasonable suspicion. The case highlights tensions over immigration enforcement practices and their compliance with constitutional safeguards against racial profiling and arbitrary detention.",
    "46378": "On April 10, 2025, four international students (Chinmay Deore, Yogesh Joshi, Xiangyun Bu, and Qiuyi Yang) studying at Michigan universities filed a verified complaint and emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Acting Director of U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (Todd Lyons), and the Detroit Field Office Director (Robert Lynch). The plaintiffs alleged that DHS unilaterally terminated their F-1 student status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) without providing notice, an opportunity to contest the decision, or a valid legal basis under 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d). They claimed this violated their Fifth Amendment procedural due process rights and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), as the terminations were arbitrary, lacked individualized review, and risked immediate detention or deportation. The plaintiffs’ counsel included the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Michigan and private attorneys.  \n\nThe defendants responded on April 14, 2025, arguing that SEVIS terminations do not automatically revoke F-1 status and that the students’ records were terminated due to criminal history matches or prudential visa revocations by the Department of State. They emphasized that the students had not been charged with crimes (except for minor infractions like traffic violations) and that DHS had not initiated removal proceedings. The court denied the TRO on April 17, 2025, finding insufficient evidence that SEVIS record termination equated to a loss of F-1 status or that the students faced irreparable harm. The court noted that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a final agency action under the APA or a constitutional violation, as SEVIS is an administrative tool, not a direct determinant of immigration status. A preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled for May 19, 2025, with a stipulated deadline extension for discovery. The case remains pending, with the court requiring further briefing and evidence to assess the plaintiffs’ claims. Related lawsuits in New Hampshire and other districts had previously sought similar relief, with one court issuing a TRO on April 9, 2025.",
    "46385": "On April 9, 2025, Sheila Bedi and Lynn Cohn, clinical professors at Northwestern University’s Pritzker School of Law, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce, its chairs Tim Walberg and Burgess Owens, and Northwestern University officials. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that the Committee’s demands for sensitive documents—targeting their clinical work, donor information, and job records—violated their First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment rights. Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that the demands constituted viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment, as the Committee purportedly sought to punish their “left-wing political advocacy” and the legal representation of clients critical of Israel and other causes disfavored by the Trump Administration. The Committee’s letter, dated March 27, 2025, cited an alleged link between some of Bedi’s clients and antisemitic conduct as a pretext for its broad inquiry, which plaintiffs contended had no legitimate legislative purpose and chilled academic freedom, donor support, and client access to legal services.  \n\nThe plaintiffs highlighted their roles in teaching and litigating on issues like police reform, wrongful convictions, and restorative justice, emphasizing that the Committee’s actions threatened their ability to represent clients, teach controversial topics, and maintain donor confidentiality. They also referenced the Trump Administration’s prior targeting of universities and law firms through executive orders and sanctions, including freezing federal funding for Northwestern University ($790 million) and revoking security clearances for law firms and individuals.  \n\nOn April 10, 2025, the court denied the plaintiffs’ emergency motion for a temporary restraining order without prejudice, deeming it moot. Later, on June 24, 2025, Judge Elaine E. Bucklo granted a joint motion to stay proceedings until further order, with a status hearing set for September 22, 2025. The case remains active, with the plaintiffs arguing that the Committee’s demands exceed its authority and violate constitutional protections against government retaliation for protected speech and association. Related cases, such as Perkins Coie LLP v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice and Jenner & Block LLP v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, were cited as precedents where similar executive actions were found unconstitutional. The plaintiffs’ counsel included private attorneys from the Center for Constitutional Rights and People’s Law Office, with multiple pro hac vice motions granted for additional representation.",
    "46353": "On April 7, 2025, John Doe, an F-1 international student from a predominantly Muslim country working in post-graduate STEM Optional Practical Training (OPT) employment in California, filed a complaint against President Donald J. Trump, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials Moises Becerra and Todd M. Lyons, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem. Doe alleged that his SEVIS record was unlawfully terminated by ICE on March 28, 2025, under Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 237(a)(1)(C)(i) (failure to maintain status), citing a criminal records check, despite his compliance with F-1 status requirements and a minor misdemeanor conviction that does not trigger deportation under federal law. He sought a declaration that the termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment’s due process protections, along with injunctive relief to prevent enforcement actions like arrest, detention, or deportation.  \n\nDoe’s motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) was granted on April 17, 2025, enjoining Defendants from enforcing the SEVIS termination’s legal consequences for 14 days. The Court later extended the TRO until May 15, 2025, after hearings on April 25, 2025, during which Defendants stated they had begun reactivating SEVIS records for affected individuals but did not clarify whether termination impacts F-1 status. Defendants argued that SEVIS termination is a clerical action, not a final agency decision, and that Doe had no property interest in his SEVIS record. They also emphasized that F-1 status is determined by immigration courts, not SEVIS updates, and that the APA does not apply to discretionary immigration enforcement.  \n\nOn May 13, 2025, the Court held a preliminary injunction hearing, and on May 22, granted preliminary injunctions in related cases, including Doe’s, enjoining Defendants from enforcing SEVIS terminations pending litigation. However, Defendants appealed the preliminary injunctions to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025, and later sought a stay of proceedings pending appeal, which the Court partially granted on August 22, 2025. The case remains active, with a motion to stay hearing scheduled for September 12, 2025, and a joint case management statement due by July 25, 2025. The dispute centers on whether SEVIS termination constitutes final agency action under the APA and whether it violates due process by denying notice and opportunity to respond.",
    "46337": "On April 3, 2025, multiple U.S. states (including California, Nevada, Massachusetts, Arizona, and others) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against President Donald J. Trump, the U.S. Attorney General, and members of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), seeking a declaratory judgment and preliminary injunction to block provisions of Executive Order No. 14248, titled “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections.” The states alleged that the Executive Order unlawfully commandeered their election administration authority by mandating documentary proof of citizenship for federal voter registration, altering the Federal Post Card Application for military and overseas voters, and conditioning federal election funding on compliance with strict ballot receipt deadlines. These provisions, they argued, violated the Constitution’s Elections Clause (reserving federal election regulation to states and Congress) and the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which requires the EAC to consult with states and use attestation, not documentary proof, for citizenship verification. The court, in a June 13, 2025, order (amended July 18, 2025), granted the preliminary injunction, finding the states likely to succeed on the merits, emphasizing irreparable harm from compliance costs and voter disenfranchisement, and noting the public interest in preserving lawful election procedures. The injunction barred defendants (except the President) from implementing the challenged sections of the Executive Order, including §§ 2(a), 2(d), 3(d), 7(a), and 7(b), which the court deemed unconstitutional and ultra vires. The case remains active, with defendants appealing the preliminary injunction to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "46238": "On March 17, 2025, Master Sergeant Logan Ireland and Staff Sergeant Nicholas Bear Bade, both transgender men serving in the U.S. Air Force, filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald J. Trump’s Executive Order 14183 and related policies issued by the Department of Defense (DoD) and Air Force, which banned transgender individuals from military service and required them to adhere to regulations based on their birth sex. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, arguing the policies discriminated against transgender service members without lawful justification and failed to meet constitutional standards. They sought a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction to block enforcement of the orders, emphasizing that the policies would force them to live as women, use sex-segregated facilities inconsistent with their identity, and face involuntary separation from the military, which would irreparably harm their careers, benefits, and reputations.  \n\nOn March 18, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent administrative separation proceedings, which the court ordered to show cause. Defendants opposed the TRO, asserting that the military’s decision to disqualify transgender individuals with gender dysphoria or a history of transition was entitled to deference under the Constitution, citing prior policies and studies, including the 2018 DoD Report and RAND Corporation analyses, which they claimed supported the policy’s rationale. They also argued that plaintiffs had not exhausted administrative remedies and that the harms alleged (loss of employment, reputational damage) were not irreparable, as administrative separation boards and judicial review could address them.  \n\nThe court granted the TRO on March 24, 2025, finding plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm from immediate separation, and a public interest in preventing unconstitutional discrimination. The TRO prohibited defendants from initiating separation proceedings against the plaintiffs based on their transgender status and required compliance with the order for 14 days. Defendants later sought a stay of the TRO, arguing for coordination across parallel litigation, but the court denied the request, emphasizing the plaintiffs’ risk of irreparable harm and the lack of demonstrated burden on defendants.  \n\nThe case was voluntarily dismissed on May 15, 2025, without prejudice, as plaintiffs opted to withdraw their action. Key related cases included *Talbott v. Trump* (D.D.C.), where a nationwide preliminary injunction was issued but remained subject to appeal, and *Shilling v. United States* (W.D. Wash.), which was pending resolution. The litigation centered on whether the executive orders’ restrictions on transgender service members constituted unlawful sex-based discrimination under the Fifth Amendment, with the court ultimately deferring to the plaintiffs’ need for immediate relief until broader judicial review could proceed.",
    "46234": "On March 15, 2025, Momodou Taal, a non-citizen Ph.D. student at Cornell University, along with U.S. citizens Mũkoma Wa Ngũgĩ (a professor) and Sriram Parasurama (a graduate student), filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York against President Donald J. Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and Secretary Kristi Noem. The plaintiffs challenged Executive Orders 14161 and 14188, which purportedly restrict speech critical of the U.S. government, its institutions, American culture, or the Israeli government, alleging violations of the First Amendment’s free speech and association rights and the Fifth Amendment’s due process protections. The orders, according to the plaintiffs, created a “chilling effect” by threatening deportation or criminal prosecution for protected expression, particularly targeting pro-Palestinian advocacy and conflating criticism of Israel with antisemitism.  \n\nPlaintiff Taal, a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and The Gambia, had been lawfully admitted to the U.S. on an F-1 student visa and faced visa revocation and removal proceedings after participating in pro-Palestinian protests. The court denied the plaintiffs’ emergency motion for a temporary restraining order on March 20, 2025, citing jurisdictional bars under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and insufficient standing to challenge the orders. The court emphasized that removal proceedings are governed by immigration courts, not federal district courts, and that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated irreparable harm or a clear right to judicial intervention.  \n\nThe case was further amended on March 27, 2025, to include a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, but the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action on April 1, 2025, without prejudice. The dismissal followed the court’s denial of preliminary injunctive relief and the plaintiffs’ decision not to pursue further proceedings. The case highlights tensions between executive authority over immigration and constitutional protections for free speech, with the court deferring to statutory frameworks limiting judicial review in removal matters. Relatedly, a separate case involving Columbia University student Yunseo Chung faced similar enforcement actions under the same executive orders.",
    "46216": "On March 12, 2025, Dr. Gordon Schiff and Dr. Celeste Royce, both physicians and Harvard Medical School professors, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The plaintiffs alleged that the removal of their peer-reviewed articles from PSNet—a patient safety resource operated by AHRQ—violated their First Amendment rights by imposing viewpoint-based restrictions and contravened the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) due to arbitrary enforcement and overreach by OPM. The articles, which discussed suicide risk assessment and endometriosis diagnosis, were taken down in January 2025 following Executive Order 14168, issued by President Trump on January 20, 2025, which directed federal agencies to remove content “promoting or inculcating gender ideology.” OPM’s January 29, 2025, guidance to agencies, including HHS, mandated the removal of such content by January 31, 2025. AHRQ staff, acting on this directive, removed the plaintiffs’ articles unless they deleted references to “transgender” and “LGBTQ,” which the plaintiffs refused, citing scientific accuracy and ethical concerns.  \n\nOn April 1, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to block further removals and restore their articles. After a hearing on May 21, 2025, Judge Leo T. Sorokin granted the motion in part on May 23, 2025, ruling that the removals constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment and arbitrary agency action under the APA. The court ordered defendants to restore the plaintiffs’ articles and other private-party content removed from PSNet under the same policy. Defendants later filed a motion to dismiss on June 16, 2025, arguing mootness and jurisdictional issues, but this motion was not resolved in the documents provided. The preliminary injunction remains in effect until final judgment, with the court emphasizing that the restoration is necessary to prevent ongoing constitutional harm and uphold the integrity of PSNet as a public resource for patient safety. The case is connected to a parallel litigation in the District of Columbia, *Doctors for America v. OPM*, which also challenges the executive order’s implementation.",
    "46207": "On March 7, 2025, transgender inmates Alishea Kingdom, Solo Nichols, and Jas Kapule filed a class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, and officials of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), challenging Executive Order 14168, which bans federal funding for medical treatments or accommodations that conform an inmate’s appearance to the opposite sex. The plaintiffs, diagnosed with gender dysphoria, alleged that the BOP’s implementing memoranda discontinued their gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy and clothing accommodations, causing severe psychological harm. The case was certified as a class action on June 3, 2025, representing all BOP inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria who face similar restrictions. The court granted a preliminary injunction, blocking enforcement of the EO’s provisions against providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to class members from September 1 to November 30, 2025. The legal claims centered on violations of the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing the EO’s categorical ban lacked reasoned justification and conflicted with established medical standards. The case was consolidated with Doe v. McHenry (Case No. 1:25-cv-00286-RCL), and the defendants included state attorneys general from multiple states supporting the EO. The plaintiffs were represented by the ACLU, Transgender Law Center, and other legal organizations. The court found the BOP’s actions arbitrary and capricious under the APA and emphasized that the plaintiffs’ injuries stemmed from a uniform policy denying medically necessary care, which could not be resolved through individualized assessments. The ruling allowed the class to pursue injunctive relief to restore access to gender-affirming health care consistent with pre-E.O. 14168 BOP policies.",
    "46104": "On February 11, 2025, American Oversight, a nonpartisan, non-profit organization under the District of Columbia’s jurisdiction, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), U.S. DOGE Service, U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, U.S. Digital Service (renamed as USDS under Executive Order 14158), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The complaint alleges violations of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552, stemming from Defendants’ failure to expedite processing of FOIA requests and conduct adequate searches for responsive records. American Oversight sought records related to DOGE’s communications involving Elon Musk and his staff, including interactions with federal agencies, personnel actions, and decisions to withhold or destroy documents. The case was initially assigned to Judge Beryl A. Howell, who issued a Standing Order governing proceedings and a Preservation Order on April 2, 2025, requiring Defendants to retain records responsive to the FOIA requests.  \n\nThe lawsuit arose after President Trump established DOGE via executive orders in January 2025, appointing Elon Musk as its leader, and directed it to modernize federal technology, oversee agency operations, and implement cost-cutting measures. American Oversight submitted multiple FOIA requests in January and February 2025, including searches for communications with Senators and agencies, and records of Musk’s employment and authority. Defendants did not respond within statutory timeframes, prompting American Oversight to argue constructive exhaustion of administrative remedies. The First Amended Complaint, filed on March 5, 2025, clarified that DOGE’s structure and operations—such as deploying staff to agencies, accessing sensitive systems, and overriding Cabinet decisions—warrant its classification as a federal agency subject to FOIA.  \n\nRelated cases include *CREW v. U.S. DOGE Service* (No. 25-cv-511), where a court ruled DOGE likely subject to FOIA, and *AFL-CIO v. Department of Labor* (2025 WL 542825), which referenced DOGE’s ambiguous agency status. Procedurally, Defendants sought extensions to respond to the Complaint, but the court mandated a Scheduling Order on May 23, 2025, requiring American Oversight to file a motion for limited discovery by June 2, 2025, to determine DOGE’s agency status. The motion, filed on June 2, 2025, requested discovery into DOGE’s leadership, authority, and operations, as Defendants had contradicted public records and White House statements about Musk’s role. The court’s Preservation Order emphasized the risk of record loss due to DOGE’s use of ephemeral messaging platforms like Signal and alleged noncompliance with federal records laws. The case remains active, with pending discovery motions and no resolution on agency status or record production.",
    "46602": "On May 15, 2025, the Oregon Council for the Humanities (doing business as Oregon Humanities) and the Federation of State Humanities Councils filed a lawsuit against the United States DOGE Service, Amy Gleason (Acting Administrator of DOGE), the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and Michael McDonald (Acting Chairman of NEH). The plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and constitutional separation-of-powers principles by unilaterally terminating or reducing funding for general operating support grants and other NEH programs under the Federal/State Partnership, which Congress mandated to distribute humanities funding to state and territorial councils. The defendants, acting through DOGE, reportedly terminated nearly all open grants issued under the Biden Administration in April 2025 without providing required notice, opportunity for hearing, or reasoned justification, citing Executive Order 14217 and a shift in agency priorities. This disrupted the plaintiffs’ operations, leading to program cancellations, staff layoffs, and financial instability. The NEH’s June 2, 2025, partial rescission of terminations did not address these statutory deficiencies, as it still reduced funding to 20% of appropriated amounts without proper process. On August 6, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, halting the grant terminations and ordering compliance with statutory requirements for funding distribution and procedural due process. The court rejected the defendants’ argument that the Tucker Act barred jurisdiction, emphasizing that the plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, not monetary damages, and that the APA’s “strong presumption of judicial review” applied. The ruling also found that the NEH’s actions were arbitrary and capricious, as they failed to follow mandatory funding formulas, ignored reliance interests, and lacked individualized analysis. The injunction aims to preserve the Federal/State Partnership’s statutory mandate and prevent irreparable harm to humanities programming nationwide.",
    "46478": "On April 22, 2025, Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc.—family-owned Illinois-based educational toy companies—filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump and federal agencies, alleging that executive orders imposing tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) exceeded the President’s statutory and constitutional authority. The plaintiffs argued that IEEPA, enacted in 1977 to address national emergencies through economic sanctions, does not authorize the imposition of tariffs, which are exclusively a legislative power under Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution. They claimed the tariffs, including a 10% universal rate and up to 145% on Chinese imports, caused irreparable harm by drastically increasing their costs and threatening their business viability.  \n\nThe defendants moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade, asserting exclusive jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i). However, the court denied the motion, ruling that IEEPA’s text does not “provide for” tariffs, and granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the challenged tariffs. The court emphasized that the President’s use of IEEPA to impose tariffs was ultra vires, as the statute’s “regulate importation” language was not intended to authorize revenue-raising duties. The injunction was stayed pending appeal after the Federal Circuit temporarily halted a parallel CIT case, but the district court’s order remained in effect until June 12, 2025, allowing time for appellate review. The case centered on whether IEEPA’s emergency powers could be interpreted to permit sweeping tariff actions, which the court concluded they could not, given Congress’s deliberate separation of tariff authority from regulatory powers and the absence of clear statutory authorization.",
    "46390": "On April 12, 2025, two Venezuelan civil immigration detainees, D.B.U. and R.M.M., filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado against President Donald J. Trump and various federal officials, challenging the legality of the March 14, 2025, Presidential Proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to summarily remove Venezuelan nationals affiliated with the criminal gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) from the United States. The plaintiffs argued the Proclamation failed to meet the AEA’s requirements, as it did not involve a declared war or invasion by a foreign nation or government, and TdA was not a sovereign entity. They also contended that the Proclamation violated due process by allowing removal without adequate notice or opportunity to contest the designation.  \n\nThe court granted an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 22, 2025, prohibiting removal of the named petitioners and a provisionally certified class of noncitizens in Colorado subject to the Proclamation. The TRO required 21 days’ notice in a language the individual understood and mandated judicial review before removal. The government appealed the TRO to the Tenth Circuit, which denied a stay, and then to the Supreme Court, which stayed the TRO pending appeal but emphasized the need for due process. On May 6, 2025, the court granted class certification, defining the class as all noncitizens in Colorado custody subject to the Proclamation. The case highlights tensions between executive authority under the AEA and judicial oversight of due process, with plaintiffs asserting that the Proclamation’s application to TdA members lacks statutory or constitutional basis and risks wrongful removal to El Salvador’s CECOT prison without legal safeguards. The litigation remains active, with the government disputing the court’s jurisdiction and the adequacy of its notice procedures.",
    "46499": "In April 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), terminated the SEVIS records of hundreds of international students with F-1 visas nationwide, including Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo. These terminations, conducted without notice, due process, or individualized review, allegedly violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. Plaintiffs, all lawful F-1 students with no criminal convictions, faced immediate loss of legal status, employment authorization, and risk of deportation, with some unable to complete their studies or care for dependents. The terminations were linked to a covert “Student Criminal Alien Initiative” (SCAI) involving mass checks of F-1 students against the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database, with ICE and the State Department allegedly revoking visas based on NCIC hits, even for individuals already in the U.S.  \n\nPlaintiffs initially sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to halt the terminations, which was granted on April 18, 2025, by Judge Susan Illston. The case was later reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White, who issued a nationwide preliminary injunction on May 22, 2025, enjoining DHS and the State Department from arresting, transferring, or imposing legal consequences on Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals pending resolution of the case. However, Defendants appealed, arguing the injunction exceeded judicial authority under *Trump v. CASA* (2025), which restricted federal courts from issuing universal injunctions. In August 2025, Defendants moved for a stay pending appeal, citing irreparable harm to their enforcement operations and the lack of statutory basis for the injunction’s broad scope. The court’s order remains in effect, with ongoing proceedings in the Ninth Circuit. The case centers on whether SEVIS terminations and visa revocations under SCAI comply with federal law and due process requirements.",
    "46319": "On March 31, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump and multiple federal agency heads, challenging the legality of Executive Order 14251, which excluded numerous agencies from the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). NTEU alleged the order exceeded presidential authority under 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) by improperly invoking national security concerns to strip collective bargaining rights from agencies that do not primarily engage in intelligence, investigative, or national security work, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Department of Justice (DOJ) divisions. The union also claimed the order violated its First Amendment rights by retaliating against its legal challenges to the Trump Administration’s policies. On April 25, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction blocking the order’s implementation, citing clear evidence that the President’s rationale was retaliatory and politically motivated, not based on statutory criteria. The government appealed, and on May 16, 2025, the D.C. Circuit stayed the injunction pending appeal, emphasizing the need to defer to the President’s national security determinations and the lack of jurisdiction in the district court. The case centers on whether the Executive Order’s broad exclusions are lawful under the FSLMRS, with NTEU arguing the President’s interpretation of “primary function” and “national security work” was overly expansive and pretextual, while the government contends the exclusions are within the President’s statutory discretion and necessary for efficient agency operations. The dispute remains unresolved, with the stay in effect as the appeal proceeds.",
    "46285": "On March 24, 2025, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), UndocuBlack Network, and CASA, Inc.—nonprofit immigrant rights organizations—filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Trump administration’s policies expanding expedited removal to individuals previously granted parole at U.S. ports of entry. The plaintiffs alleged that these policies, including the January 23, 2025 Huffman Memorandum, February 18, 2025 ICE Directive, and March 25, 2025 CHNV Parole Termination Notice, violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause by subjecting parolees to summary deportation without adequate legal process. The complaint highlighted that expedited removal, authorized under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A), historically applied only to individuals arriving at ports of entry or recently encountered near borders, but the challenged actions extended it to parolees who had lived in the U.S. for less than two years. Plaintiffs described members at risk of deportation, including Afghan nationals, Venezuelans with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and Haitian parolees, who faced severe harm, including family separation and persecution in their home countries.  \n\nThe defendants moved to dismiss, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1) and (g), which restrict judicial review of immigration enforcement. However, the court denied the motion as moot after plaintiffs amended their complaint and granted a stay of the agency actions on August 1, 2025, finding the policies likely exceeded DHS’s statutory authority and were arbitrary and capricious. The stay applied to all noncitizens paroled into the U.S. at ports of entry, pending resolution of the litigation. The court emphasized that the challenged actions conflicted with longstanding regulations and statutory interpretations, which defined “arriving aliens” as those entering at ports of entry, even if later paroled, and that the plaintiffs’ members had a concrete, redressable injury from the abrupt application of expedited removal. The case remains active, with the stay in effect as of the opinion’s issuance.",
    "46179": "On February 24, 2025, Travis LeBlanc and Edward Felten, Senate-confirmed members of the United States Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), filed a complaint against the PCLOB, its Executive Director Jenny Fitzpatrick, Board member Beth Williams, Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel Trent Morse, and President Donald Trump, alleging unlawful removal without cause. The PCLOB, established by Congress as an independent, nonpartisan agency to oversee counterterrorism policies and advise on privacy and civil liberties protections, was amended in 2007 to remove language allowing presidential removal at will and to mandate six-year terms for members. Plaintiffs argued that the President’s termination of their positions on January 27, 2025, violated these statutory protections and the Constitution’s separation of powers.  \n\nThe case proceeded to summary judgment, with the plaintiffs asserting that the PCLOB’s structure and function—requiring bipartisan membership, staggered terms, and oversight of executive actions—implied removal protections. Defendants countered that the statute lacked explicit restrictions and that the President’s removal authority was unbounded. On May 21, 2025, the district court granted plaintiffs’ motion, ruling their removals unlawful under 42 U.S.C. § 2000ee, which bars at-will removal of PCLOB members. The court ordered reinstatement, enjoining defendants (excluding the President) from treating plaintiffs as removed and requiring them to restore the members’ rights and duties. The court also closed the case.  \n\nThe defendants appealed, seeking a stay pending resolution. On July 1, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted the stay, citing the government’s likelihood of success on the merits and potential irreparable harm to executive authority. However, the district court’s order remains in effect unless further modified by the appellate court. The case centers on whether Congress intended to insulate PCLOB members from presidential removal through statutory structure, a question left unresolved pending appeal.",
    "46106": "On February 11, 2025, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the Association of Administrative Law Judges (AALJ), and three individual plaintiffs—Vanessa Barrow, George Jones, and Deborah Toussant—filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the U.S. DOGE Service, its temporary organization, and Elon Musk, alleging violations of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs claimed that OPM unlawfully disclosed sensitive personal and employment data of tens of millions of federal employees, retirees, and contractors to DOGE agents without proper vetting, security training, or legal justification, risking cybersecurity breaches, identity theft, and retaliation. The case was initially assigned to Judge Victor Marrero but later reassigned to Judge Denise L. Cote. On February 14, 2025, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to halt the disclosures, which the court scheduled for a hearing on February 27. Defendants opposed the TRO, arguing plaintiffs lacked standing and that the disclosures were lawful under the Privacy Act and executive orders. The court denied the motion to dismiss in part on April 3, finding plaintiffs had plausibly alleged Privacy Act violations. On April 25, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, supported by declarations from cybersecurity experts and documents showing OPM’s lax security practices. After a hearing on May 29, Judge Cote granted the preliminary injunction on June 9, requiring OPM to restrict access to its systems, ensure compliance with Privacy Act safeguards, and file a status report on measures taken since March 6, 2025. The injunction was stayed for 14 days, and plaintiffs posted a $1,000 bond. The court emphasized that plaintiffs had standing due to concrete injuries from unauthorized access and that defendants’ actions were arbitrary and violated statutory obligations. The case remains active, with further proceedings to finalize the injunction’s terms.",
    "46095": "On February 10, 2025, the Association of American Universities (“AAU”), American Council on Education (“ACE”), Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (“APLU”), and multiple universities (including Brown, MIT, and Johns Hopkins) filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), NIH, and their officials, challenging the NIH’s February 7, 2025, Supplemental Guidance that imposed a uniform 15% cap on indirect costs for all existing and future grants. Plaintiffs alleged the Guidance violated the APA by exceeding statutory authority, being arbitrary and capricious, and disregarding procedural requirements like notice-and-comment rulemaking. They also claimed it contravened Section 224 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, which prohibits NIH from modifying indirect cost reimbursement policies without congressional approval, and the Appropriations Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which bars the use of appropriated funds for unauthorized purposes.  \n\nThe court granted a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) on February 10, 2025, and later issued a 76-page preliminary injunction on March 5, 2025, finding plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on their claims and that the Guidance caused irreparable harm to research infrastructure, clinical trials, and institutional budgets. Defendants opposed the injunction, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act and that the Guidance was permissible under existing regulations. However, the court rejected these arguments, emphasizing that the APA, not contract law, governed the dispute and that the Guidance’s abrupt implementation failed to comply with required procedures. On April 4, 2025, the court converted the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction and entered final judgment, prohibiting defendants from enforcing the 15% cap and requiring compliance with negotiated indirect cost rates under federal law. Defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit on April 8, 2025, but the permanent injunction remains in effect pending appellate review. The case was consolidated with two related lawsuits (Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. NIH and AAMC v. NIH) due to overlapping legal issues and shared factual context.",
    "46023": "On February 3, 2025, the Alliance for Retired Americans, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) filed a lawsuit against Scott Bessent, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Treasury, the Department of the Treasury, and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). The plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) by granting unauthorized access to sensitive personal and financial information held by BFS to members of the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), including Elon Musk and affiliated individuals. The complaint asserts that Defendants acted contrary to law and in excess of their statutory authority by implementing a system allowing DOGE access without proper notice, consent, or safeguards.  \n\nThe case arose after President Trump’s January 20, 2025, executive order establishing DOGE and renaming the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. DOGE Service. Shortly after taking office, Secretary Bessent allegedly removed a senior Treasury official, David Lebryk, who had previously resisted DOGE’s requests for access to BFS systems, and appointed Thomas Krause and Marko Elez to the Treasury DOGE Team. Plaintiffs argue that this team was granted broad access to BFS systems, including payment records containing Social Security numbers, banking details, and other private data, without adherence to legal requirements for disclosure.  \n\nPlaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and later converted it to a motion for a preliminary injunction to halt the unauthorized access and ensure compliance with privacy laws. On February 6, 2025, the court issued an order deferring ruling on the TRO and limiting access to BFS systems to specific Treasury employees with “read-only” permissions. However, the court denied the preliminary injunction on March 7, 2025, concluding that plaintiffs had not established a “substantial likelihood” of irreparable harm. The court later directed Defendants to file an administrative record by March 10, 2025, which they did, though plaintiffs objected to certain omissions.  \n\nDiscovery was permitted in limited scope on March 20, 2025, but Defendants opposed further expedited discovery, arguing that the administrative record was sufficient and that plaintiffs lacked standing. On April 11, 2025, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, contending that plaintiffs’ claims fail as a matter of law due to insufficient injury-in-fact, lack of final agency action, and the availability of alternative remedies under the Privacy Act and IRC. Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on April 25, 2025, asserting that Defendants’ actions were unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious.  \n\nThe court also issued a stipulated protective order on April 1, 2025, to govern the handling of confidential information during discovery. The case remains active, with pending motions and ongoing litigation over the legality of DOGE’s access to federal payment systems. Plaintiffs emphasize that Defendants’ actions risk exposing millions of individuals’ private data to unauthorized parties, undermining statutory privacy protections and creating a “substantial risk of harm” to personal information. Defendants maintain that their decisions were lawful, within statutory authority, and consistent with the President’s executive order, which mandates agency cooperation with DOGE for efficiency and modernization. The dispute hinges on whether the challenged actions constitute “final agency action” reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and whether plaintiffs have standing to seek injunctive relief.  \n\nRelated cases include *New York v. Trump* (S.D.N.Y.), where a preliminary injunction similarly restricted DOGE’s access to agency records, and *AFL-CIO v. Department of Labor* (D.D.C.), which addressed similar legal questions. The court’s March 7, 2025, memorandum opinion emphasized that plaintiffs’ alleged injury—unauthorized access to private data—must be “concrete and particularized” to satisfy Article III standing, a threshold plaintiffs failed to meet. The case continues with pending motions for summary judgment, as the court evaluates whether Defendants’ actions violated federal law and whether injunctive relief is warranted.",
    "46563": "On May 2, 2025, a group of U.S. counties and cities, including King County, Pierce County, San Francisco, Boston, New York, and others, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) unlawfully imposed new conditions on federal grant agreements. These conditions, introduced in March and April 2025, require recipients to oppose Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, comply with immigration enforcement policies, use specific verification systems for immigration status, and refrain from promoting gender ideology or elective abortions. Plaintiffs argue that these conditions violate the Constitution’s separation of powers, the Fifth Amendment’s void-for-vagueness doctrine, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), as they exceed statutory authority and lack congressional authorization. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to block enforcement of the conditions.  \n\nThe case involves a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and later a preliminary injunction, both granted by Judge Barbara J. Rothstein on May 7 and May 23, 2025, respectively. Defendants, including HUD Secretary Scott Turner, DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, and other federal officials, opposed the motions, arguing that the Tucker Act grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of Federal Claims for contract-related disputes and that the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply. However, the court rejected these arguments, emphasizing that plaintiffs’ claims are statutory and constitutional challenges to agency action, not contract disputes, and that injunctive relief is appropriate to prevent irreparable harm to critical services for homeless residents and transportation infrastructure.  \n\nThe Amended Complaint, filed on May 21, 2025, expanded the number of plaintiffs and defendants, adding more local governments and federal agencies, including the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Plaintiffs highlighted that the challenged conditions were not included in the original Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) or authorized by statutes such as the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The court’s orders temporarily enjoin HUD and DOT from enforcing the new conditions, citing the plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of irreparable harm to their budgets and services, and the public interest in preserving lawful grant programs. Related litigation, such as *City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump* (2025 WL 1186310), previously addressed similar claims against the Trump administration’s immigration-related funding restrictions.",
    "46484": "On April 23, 2025, the American Bar Association (ABA) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, alleging violations of the First Amendment and other legal claims. The ABA sought a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to block DOJ from enforcing the termination of five active grants totaling $3.2 million awarded to its Commission on Domestic and Sexual Violence (ABA CDSV) under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). These grants, which fund training and technical assistance for legal professionals working with survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking, were terminated by DOJ on April 10, 2025, citing a shift in “agency priorities” following the ABA’s public criticism of the Trump Administration and its participation in a separate lawsuit challenging the Administration’s freeze on international development grants.  \n\nThe ABA argued that the termination constituted unlawful retaliation for exercising its First Amendment right to petition the courts and engage in protected speech. DOJ did not contest the merits of this claim but challenged the court’s jurisdiction, asserting the dispute should be resolved in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. Judge Christopher R. Cooper ruled that the First Amendment retaliation claim falls within this court’s jurisdiction and granted the preliminary injunction on May 14, 2025, after finding the ABA likely to succeed on the merits, risk of irreparable harm, and equitable balance favoring the plaintiff. The court directed DOJ to reinstate the grants, disburse funds in the customary manner, and refrain from re-obligating terminated funds. The ABA’s other claims, including unconstitutional conditions and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, were not decided at this stage. The case remains active, with DOJ’s motion to dismiss pending resolution for those additional claims.",
    "46279": "On March 23, 2025, a class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts by noncitizens with final removal orders, challenging the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) practice of deporting individuals to third countries—countries not designated in their removal orders—without providing meaningful notice or an opportunity to assert claims of fear of persecution, torture, or death under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) or the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The plaintiffs, including D.V.D., M.M., E.F.D., and O.C.G., allege that DHS violated statutory and constitutional requirements by re-detaining and deporting them to countries like Mexico and South Sudan without prior procedural safeguards. The case involves a class of individuals subject to final removal orders who were or would be deported to third countries after February 18, 2025, without compliance with notice and fear-based review protocols.  \n\nThe court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on March 28, 2025, and later certified the class and issued a preliminary injunction on April 18, 2025, enjoining DHS from deporting class members to third countries without providing written notice in their language and a meaningful opportunity to seek CAT protection. However, the First Circuit denied a stay pending appeal on May 16, 2025, and the Supreme Court stayed the preliminary injunction on June 23, 2025, pending resolution of the appeal. Plaintiffs argue that DHS’s February 2025 directive to re-detain individuals for third-country removals bypasses required legal procedures, risking irreparable harm. Specific examples include O.C.G., a Guatemalan man granted withholding of removal to Guatemala but deported to Mexico without notice, and others facing similar risks. The case highlights tensions between executive enforcement discretion and judicial mandates for procedural due process, with ongoing disputes over compliance and the scope of judicial review under immigration law.",
    "46186": "On February 28, 2025, a class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts by individuals and the Haitian Bridge Alliance, challenging the Trump administration’s termination of humanitarian parole programs for Ukrainians, Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, and Afghans. The plaintiffs allege that the termination of programs like Uniting for Ukraine (U4U), the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan parole processes (CHNV), and Operation Allies Welcome (OAW) violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), specifically 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A), which grants the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to parole noncitizens for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit on a case-by-case basis. The administration’s January 20, 2025, executive orders and memoranda directed the cessation of categorical parole programs and suspended processing of immigration benefits for parolees, including asylum, Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and work authorization, without individualized review. Plaintiffs argue these actions are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), as they disrupt established practices and ignore statutory provisions allowing for programmatic parole.  \n\nThe court granted a preliminary injunction on April 14, 2025, staying the mass termination of CHNV parole grants pending appeal, finding that the Secretary’s categorical revocation of parole without case-by-case review likely violated the statute. On May 5, 2025, the Supreme Court stayed the district court’s order, allowing the termination to proceed while the appeal was pending. Subsequently, the district court certified a class of individuals affected by the termination of CHNV parole and related benefit suspensions, appointing multiple plaintiffs as class representatives. The case centers on whether the administration’s termination of these programs and suspension of immigration relief comply with statutory requirements and APA standards, with plaintiffs emphasizing the irreparable harm caused by loss of legal status, employment authorization, and potential deportation. The defendants assert broad discretion under the INA and argue the plaintiffs lack standing, but the court’s initial rulings underscored the need for individualized determinations under the parole statute. The litigation remains active, with ongoing proceedings in the First Circuit and potential Supreme Court review.",
    "46180": "On February 25, 2025, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), American Sociological Association (ASA), AFT-Maryland, and Eugene School District 4J (District 4J) filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), Secretary Linda McMahon, and Acting Assistant Secretary Craig Trainor, challenging the legality and constitutionality of a February 14, 2025, Dear Colleague Letter (Letter) and an April 3, 2025, Certification Requirement. The Letter, issued by DOE’s Office for Civil Rights, purported to clarify Title VI obligations under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Supreme Court’s *Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College* (SFFA) decision, but plaintiffs argued it unlawfully restricted teaching about race, systemic racism, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, violating the First Amendment’s free speech protections and the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause due to vagueness. The Certification Requirement compelled states and school districts to affirm compliance with DOE’s interpretations of Title VI and SFFA under threat of federal funding loss, False Claims Act liability, and enforcement actions.  \n\nPlaintiffs claimed the Letter and Certification were **final agency actions** under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) that failed to undergo required notice-and-comment rulemaking and conflicted with existing federal statutes and case law, including provisions limiting federal control over school curricula. They also argued the Certification violated the Paperwork Reduction Act by lacking an OMB control number and procedural safeguards. After a motions hearing on April 18, 2025, the court stayed enforcement of the Letter pending final resolution but initially denied relief on the Certification due to insufficient pleadings. Plaintiffs later filed a Second Amended Complaint and moved for summary judgment, asserting standing based on the chilling effect on educators’ speech and threats of financial penalties.  \n\nIn its **Memorandum Opinion** and **Order of Judgment** dated August 14, 2025, the court held that the Letter and Certification Requirement were **unlawful** under the APA and Constitution. The Letter was deemed a legislative rule that arbitrarily expanded Title VI’s scope without proper procedure, while the Certification imposed binding obligations without compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. The court vacated both documents and granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on APA and constitutional claims, finding no genuine dispute over their unlawfulness. The ruling emphasized that DOE’s actions created a “chilling effect” on protected speech and imposed vague, overbroad restrictions, violating procedural and substantive legal requirements. The case underscores the tension between federal enforcement priorities and the constitutional rights of educational institutions and their staff.",
    "46119": "On February 13, 2025, a class action lawsuit was filed by current and former employees and contractors of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), collectively referred to as J. Doe 1-26, against Elon Musk in his official capacity as the de facto leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the United States DOGE Service, and the Department of Government Efficiency. The plaintiffs allege that Musk’s actions in directing DOGE to dismantle USAID violate the U.S. Constitution’s Appointments Clause and separation-of-powers principles. They argue that Musk, as a Special Government Employee, lacks the formal constitutional appointment required for significant governmental duties, such as ceasing congressionally approved funds, accessing sensitive data, and terminating contracts and personnel.  \n\nThe lawsuit details DOGE’s efforts to restructure federal agencies, including USAID, through unauthorized personnel actions, such as placing employees on administrative leave, cutting off access to critical systems, and canceling contracts. Plaintiffs claim reputational harm, loss of livelihood, and risks to their safety due to Musk’s public denigration of USAID staff and breaches of privacy laws. The district court granted a preliminary injunction on March 18, 2025, enjoining Musk and DOGE from further actions against USAID and requiring reinstatement of access to agency systems. However, the Fourth Circuit stayed the injunction pending appeal on March 28, 2025, citing procedural deficiencies and lack of jurisdiction over certain claims.  \n\nThe case involves multiple motions, including a request for class certification to represent all USAID personnel affected by DOGE’s actions, and the government’s motion to dismiss, which argues that statutory frameworks like the Civil Service Reform Act preclude judicial review of employment disputes and that plaintiffs lack standing. The district court denied the motion to dismiss, but the Fourth Circuit’s stay highlights ongoing disputes over the scope of Musk’s authority and the legality of USAID’s reorganization. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to halt what they describe as unconstitutional dismantling of USAID and restore its operations. The case remains active, with appeals and further motions pending.",
    "46099": "On February 10, 2025, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) and Journalism Development Network, Inc. (JDN)—both nonprofit organizations receiving federal foreign assistance grants—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging President Donald Trump’s Executive Order No. 14169, which imposed a 90-day freeze on U.S. foreign development assistance. The order, issued on January 20, 2025, directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to pause funding and required the Secretary of State and USAID to suspend or terminate grants and contracts, citing alignment with foreign policy. Plaintiffs alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and constitutional separation-of-powers principles, as well as the Take Care Clause, arguing the freeze and terminations exceeded executive authority and disregarded congressional appropriations.  \n\nThe court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 13, 2025, temporarily halting the defendants’ blanket suspension of funds for grants and contracts existing as of January 19, 2025, but allowed individualized terminations based on statutory authority. Subsequent motions to enforce the TRO and hold defendants in contempt were partially granted, requiring compliance by February 26, 2025. Defendants appealed, seeking a stay pending review, but the D.C. Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, noting the TRO was not appealable. The Supreme Court denied the government’s request to vacate the enforcement order and directed the district court to clarify compliance timelines.  \n\nOn March 10, 2025, the court issued a preliminary injunction, enjoining the government from unlawfully impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and requiring the resumption of payments under the 2024 Appropriations Act. However, the D.C. Circuit later held that the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action for their constitutional and APA claims, emphasizing that statutory disputes over impoundment must be resolved through the Comptroller General, not private litigation. The Supreme Court’s decision in *Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition* (2025) further clarified that the ICA and APA precluded judicial review of the executive’s actions, leading to the vacatur of the preliminary injunction’s impoundment provisions. The case underscores tensions between executive discretion in foreign affairs and congressional spending authority, with the court ultimately deferring to statutory processes for resolving disputes over fund allocations.",
    "46093": "On February 10, 2025, plaintiffs—including refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, and Afghanistan, as well as nonprofit resettlement agencies like HIAS, Inc., Church World Service, Inc., and Lutheran Community Services Northwest—filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald J. Trump’s Executive Order 14163, which indefinitely suspended refugee admissions under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) and halted federal funding for resettlement partners. The plaintiffs alleged the order violated the Refugee Act of 1980, the Administrative Procedure Act, and constitutional principles by overriding congressional authority and causing irreparable harm, including stranded refugees, family separations, and financial collapse of resettlement agencies. The case initially proceeded with a preliminary injunction issued on February 25, 2025, blocking the order’s enforcement, but the Ninth Circuit partially stayed the injunction on March 25, 2025, limiting its scope to refugees with “strong reliance interests” akin to Plaintiff Pacito, whose family sold possessions and lost housing after their travel was canceled. Further clarification by the Ninth Circuit on May 9, 2025, narrowed protections to those who met specific criteria, including confirmed travel arrangements by January 20, 2025. The district court later rescinded its compliance framework order and appointed U.S. Magistrate Judge Michelle L. Peterson to assess reliance interests on a case-by-case basis. Defendants argued the order’s suspension was lawful under INA § 1182(f), but plaintiffs contended it was ultra vires and arbitrary. The case remains active, with ongoing disputes over the implementation of the injunction and the scope of relief for affected refugees and agencies.",
    "46065": "On February 7, 2025, the states of Washington, Minnesota, Oregon, and later Colorado, along with three physician plaintiffs, filed a lawsuit challenging two Executive Orders issued by President Donald J. Trump on January 20 and 28, 2025. The orders, titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism” (EO 14,168) and “Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation” (EO 14,187), targeted gender-affirming care for transgender and gender-diverse individuals under 19 by conditioning federal research and education grants on the cessation of such care and threatening criminal prosecutions under 18 U.S.C. § 116 (female genital mutilation). The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, the separation of powers, and the Tenth Amendment, arguing that the orders unlawfully defunded medical institutions, criminalized lawful medical treatments, and usurped states’ authority to regulate healthcare.  \n\nThe court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 14, 2025, enjoining enforcement of the orders against the plaintiff states and physicians. A preliminary injunction (PI) was issued on February 28, 2025, covering most provisions of the orders but excluding Section 8(a) of EO 14,187 due to insufficient evidence of prosecution threats. Defendants later moved to stay proceedings pending appeal, which the court granted on April 23, 2025, but allowed plaintiffs to continue enforcing the PI, amending their complaint, and seeking discovery. The case centers on the constitutionality of the executive orders, with plaintiffs emphasizing the harm to medical institutions, providers, and patients, and defendants contending the orders were lawful under existing statutes and did not violate constitutional principles. No settlement was reached, and the case remains in appellate review.",
    "46028": "On February 4, 2025, PFLAG, Inc., GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ+ Equality, and six individual plaintiffs—transgender minors and their parents—filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against President Donald J. Trump, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and several HHS agencies, including HRSA, NIH, and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and later a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of two executive orders: (1) Executive Order 14168, titled *Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government*, which declared that federal funds “shall not be used to promote gender ideology”; and (2) Executive Order 14187, titled *Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation*, which mandated that federal agencies “immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end” gender-affirming medical care for patients under 19.  \n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that these orders violated the Constitution’s separation of powers by allowing the President to unilaterally impose conditions on federal grants without congressional authorization, and that they conflicted with statutory prohibitions on sex discrimination under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Public Health Service Act (PHSA). They also claimed the orders violated the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause by targeting transgender minors based on sex and gender identity. The individual plaintiffs, who are transgender adolescents, described severe disruptions to their medical care, including the cancellation of hormone therapy and puberty-delaying treatments, leading to mental health crises and physical distress.  \n\nOn February 13, 2025, Judge Brendan Abell Hurson granted the TRO, enjoining the agencies from conditioning federal funding on the denial of gender-affirming care for minors. A preliminary injunction was issued on March 4, 2025, with similar terms. However, on March 28, 2025, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion to enforce the preliminary injunction, stating that the challenged notices from federal agencies did not explicitly condition funding on the denial of care but instead expressed concerns about policies, which did not violate the injunction’s terms. Defendants argued the notices were internal policy discussions, not actionable funding restrictions. The court noted that while the preliminary injunction was granted, its enforcement was complicated by the agencies’ claims of compliance with existing legal frameworks. The case remains active as defendants appealed the preliminary injunction, and deadlines were partially stayed pending appellate resolution.",
    "46306": "On March 26, 2025, multiple legal service providers—collectively described as Plaintiffs—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), its Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), and the Department of the Interior (DOI), alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The Plaintiffs, including organizations like Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, and others, provide legal representation to unaccompanied children (UCs) in immigration proceedings under contracts funded by HHS and DOI. Congress mandated through the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA) that UCs receive legal counsel “to the greatest extent practicable,” and ORR’s 2024 Foundational Rule (45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4)) required funding for legal services consistent with available appropriations.  \n\nOn March 21, 2025, DOI issued a “Cancellation Order” terminating funding for direct legal representation services for UCs, effectively halting Plaintiffs’ ability to provide such counsel. This action disrupted ongoing cases, including those with imminent immigration court hearings, and threatened the rights of UCs to asylum, withholding of removal, and protection from trafficking. Plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on March 27, 2025, and a preliminary injunction on April 4, 2025, arguing that the termination violated the TVPRA and Foundational Rule. On April 1, 2025, the court granted the TRO, enjoining Defendants from cutting off funding for UC legal representation. The TRO was extended to April 30, 2025, pending resolution of a motion to recuse Judge Araceli Martinez-Olguin, which was denied on April 17, 2025.  \n\nOn April 29, 2025, the court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering Defendants to maintain funding for direct legal services under the TVPRA and Foundational Rule. Defendants appealed, arguing the district court lacked jurisdiction under the APA and that the decision to terminate funding was within ORR’s discretionary authority. The Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal on April 18, 2025, citing lack of jurisdiction, but Defendants petitioned for rehearing en banc. Despite this, the preliminary injunction remains in effect, ensuring UCs continue to receive legal representation funded by the government. The case centers on the statutory and regulatory obligation to provide legal access for UCs and the potential irreparable harm to vulnerable children if such services are discontinued.",
    "46201": "On March 6, 2025, a group of U.S. states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Wisconsin) filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and two senior officials, Linda McMahon and Denise Carter, alleging that the abrupt termination of $600 million in federal grants for teacher training programs violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The grants, under the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) and Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) programs, were terminated in February 2025 via form letters citing vague “Department priorities” without individualized review, disrupting teacher workforce pipelines and exacerbating nationwide shortages. The states sought declaratory and injunctive relief to reinstate the grants. On March 10, 2025, Judge Myong J. Joun granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) requiring the Department to restore the grants, but the government appealed, arguing the TRO was unappealable and that the APA did not apply to discretionary funding decisions. The Supreme Court stayed the TRO pending appeal on April 4, 2025, and the states withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction on April 8, 2025, after the appeal was filed. The case remains pending in the First Circuit and Supreme Court, with the Department asserting jurisdictional grounds and the states contending the terminations were arbitrary and inconsistent with congressional mandates to address teacher shortages and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in education.",
    "46057": "On February 6, 2025, seven transgender active-duty service members and the Gender Justice League, a Washington-based civil rights organization, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington challenging the constitutionality of Executive Order No. 14183, titled “Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness” (the “2025 Military Ban”), issued by President Donald J. Trump on January 27, 2025. The order prohibits transgender individuals from military service, citing claims that gender dysphoria conflicts with military readiness, unit cohesion, and standards of “honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity.” Plaintiffs, including senior Naval officers and enlisted personnel with decades of honorable service, allege that the ban violates their Fifth Amendment equal protection and due process rights, as well as their First Amendment free speech rights by enforcing sex-based standards for pronoun use and military conduct. They also assert equitable estoppel, arguing the government’s prior policies under Secretaries Ashton Carter (2016) and Lloyd Austin (2021) allowed transgender service members to serve openly, and the 2025 ban abruptly reverses this.  \n\nThe court granted a preliminary injunction on March 27, 2025, enjoining nationwide enforcement of the Military Ban and requiring the government to maintain the 2021 Austin Policy, which permitted transgender service members to serve provided they met medical and operational standards. The injunction was based on findings that the 2025 policy subjected plaintiffs to irreparable harm, failed constitutional scrutiny under intermediate and rational basis tests, and lacked justification for its sweeping restrictions. The government appealed, seeking a stay pending appeal, but the Ninth Circuit denied the request on April 18, 2025, and the Supreme Court has not yet ruled. Plaintiffs argue that the ban’s reliance on outdated studies and its disregard for military experience under the Austin Policy render it unconstitutional, while the government contends the policy is rationally justified and warrants deference to military judgment. The case remains active, with the preliminary injunction in place, pending further appellate review.",
    "45984": "On January 28, 2025, eight transgender service members and prospective enlistees filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging President Donald J. Trump’s January 27, 2025, Executive Order 14183, which prohibits transgender individuals from serving in the military and mandates that they adhere to their birth sex for medical, grooming, and facility use. The plaintiffs, including active-duty personnel with decades of service and commendations, allege the order violates the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause by singling out transgender individuals based on stereotypes and medical conditions, not military fitness. The court granted a preliminary injunction on March 18, 2025, barring implementation of the policy to prevent irreparable harm, such as loss of employment, benefits, and career opportunities. Defendants, including the Department of Defense and senior military officials, opposed the injunction, arguing the policy addresses medical readiness and unit cohesion. The court stayed the injunction until March 21, 2025, to allow defendants to seek an emergency stay with the D.C. Circuit. The case involves ongoing litigation over whether the military’s policy constitutes unconstitutional discrimination, with plaintiffs emphasizing their service records and the lack of evidence supporting the order’s claims. The defendants’ motion to dissolve the injunction was denied, and the court reiterated that the policy’s reliance on gender dysphoria as a disqualifying factor lacks sufficient justification under constitutional scrutiny. The plaintiffs’ legal team includes private counsel and attorneys from organizations like the ACLU, while the defendants are represented by the Department of Justice. The case remains active pending appellate review.",
    "45964": "On January 21, 2025, the States of Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon, along with individual plaintiffs Cherly Norales Castillo and Alicia Chavarria Lopez, filed a lawsuit challenging Executive Order No. 14160, issued by President Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, which purported to deny U.S. citizenship to children born in the United States to parents who are undocumented or have lawful but temporary immigration status. The plaintiffs allege the order violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause and Section 1401 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which automatically confer citizenship on individuals born in the U.S. and subject to its jurisdiction. They argue the order would cause irreparable harm by stripping children of citizenship rights, leading to ineligibility for federal benefits like Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and Social Security numbers, as well as administrative burdens on state programs. The district court granted a nationwide preliminary injunction on February 6, 2025, barring enforcement of the order, finding the states had standing due to financial and operational harms. Defendants appealed, contending the injunction was overbroad and that the states lacked standing to assert third-party rights. The Supreme Court later addressed the scope of universal injunctions, ruling they exceed equitable authority in most cases but left open whether they could be justified for the states. The case remains active, with the district court’s preliminary injunction in effect pending further appellate review.",
    "45965": "On January 21, 2025, CASA, Inc., Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, Inc., and five individual plaintiffs (using pseudonyms like Maribel, Juana, Trinidad Garcia, Monica, and Liza) filed a class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against President Donald J. Trump and federal officials, challenging Executive Order 14,160, titled “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.” The plaintiffs alleged the order violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause and 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a), which guarantee birthright citizenship to all persons born in the U.S. and subject to its jurisdiction. They argued the order would deny citizenship to children born to undocumented parents or those with temporary legal status, creating statelessness and depriving families of legal protections and benefits.  \n\nThe district court granted a nationwide preliminary injunction on February 5, 2025, enjoining enforcement of the order pending resolution of the merits. Defendants appealed, seeking a partial stay to limit the injunction to named plaintiffs and organizational members identified in the complaint. The Fourth Circuit denied the stay, and the Supreme Court, in a consolidated decision on June 27, 2025, partially stayed the injunctions only to the extent they exceeded necessary relief for plaintiffs with standing, while also staying portions that blocked federal agencies from issuing implementation guidance. The Supreme Court emphasized that universal injunctions lack historical basis under the Judiciary Act of 1789 but directed lower courts to consider class actions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 as an alternative.  \n\nOn July 29, 2025, the Fourth Circuit dismissed the government’s appeal to expedite compliance with the Supreme Court’s directions, allowing the district court to issue a classwide preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs, representing a class of children born or expected to be born in the U.S. after February 19, 2025, to parents without lawful status or temporary visas, sought to preserve birthright citizenship rights. The case highlights tensions over judicial authority to issue broad injunctive relief and underscores the constitutional and statutory protections for birthright citizenship affirmed in *United States v. Wong Kim Ark*, 169 U.S. 649 (1898), and the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Supreme Court’s ruling curtailed the use of universal injunctions but left open the path for class certification to address the plaintiffs’ claims.",
    "VR-LA-0120": "In May 2020, Telisa Clark, Lakeshia Barnett, Martha Christian Green, Crescent City Media Group, and the League of Women Voters Louisiana (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana against Governor John Bel Edwards, Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, Attorney General Jeff Landry, and Parish Registrars Charlene Meaux Menard and Rhonda R. Rogers. The Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that Louisiana’s absentee voting laws—specifically, the Excuse Requirement (limiting absentee voting to voters with one of 15 excuses), the Witness Requirement (mandating a witness signature for absentee ballots), and the Cure Prohibition (denying voters notice or opportunity to correct ballot defects)—violated their constitutional rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. They argued that these provisions forced voters with health conditions, including those at high risk for severe COVID-19 complications, to choose between their safety and exercising their right to vote during the pandemic. The lawsuit was consolidated with *Power Coalition for Equity & Justice v. Edwards* (Case No. 3:20-cv-00283).  \n\nPlaintiffs emphasized that the pandemic heightened risks of infection at polling places and through in-person ballot procedures, disproportionately affecting Black Louisianans, who are more likely to live alone, have underlying health conditions, or face systemic barriers. They cited epidemiological evidence and public health guidance, including from the CDC, to argue that Louisiana’s laws were incompatible with safe voting practices. The State of Louisiana and Parish Registrars moved to dismiss, asserting that the pandemic itself—not state action—caused the alleged harms and that the Plaintiffs lacked standing. They also invoked the *Purcell doctrine*, warning that last-minute judicial intervention would disrupt elections and create confusion.  \n\nOn June 22, 2020, the court dismissed the case with prejudice, ruling that the Plaintiffs’ claims were not sufficiently tied to state action and that the pandemic’s risks were not “certainly impending” enough to confer standing. The judgment was later amended to clarify that the dismissal applied to all claims. Plaintiffs moved to amend the judgment, but the court denied the motion, affirming the dismissal. The case remains closed, with no further proceedings.",
    "VR-SC-0078": "On April 22, 2020, Mary T. Thomas, Nea Richard, Jeremy Rutledge, Trena Walker, Dr. Brenda Williams, and The Family Unit, Inc. (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, challenging South Carolina’s election laws during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs alleged that two provisions—(1) the \"Excuse Requirement,\" which limits absentee ballot eligibility to specific categories, and (2) the \"Witness Requirement,\" mandating a third-party signature on absentee ballots—unconstitutionally burdened their fundamental right to vote under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and violated the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). They argued that these requirements forced voters at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19, including elderly and immunocompromised individuals, to choose between exposing themselves to the virus or being disenfranchised. The case was initially stayed by the court on September 18, 2020, pending resolution of related issues, but the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to suspend enforcement of the Witness Requirement for the June 2020 primary elections.  \n\nThe court granted the preliminary injunction on May 25, 2020, temporarily blocking the Witness Requirement for the June primary, but the stay remained in effect. Defendants, including Marci Andino (Executive Director of the South Carolina State Election Commission) and Governor Henry D. McMaster, argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that the laws were constitutional under rational basis review, emphasizing election integrity and fraud prevention. The South Carolina Republican Party intervened, claiming the plaintiffs’ challenges threatened the state’s electoral processes. Multiple motions for summary judgment were filed by defendants, asserting that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a severe burden on their rights or that the laws violated the VRA or ADA.  \n\nPlaintiffs, including elderly voters, individuals with preexisting conditions, and a caregiver living alone, highlighted the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Black South Carolinians and the risks posed by in-person voting. Defendants countered that the laws were neutral, that the General Assembly had authority to regulate elections, and that the plaintiffs could still vote absentee under existing categories, such as age or disability. The case was later consolidated with another lawsuit, *Middleton v. Andino*, which also challenged absentee voting rules. By August 2020, the court had scheduled a trial but stayed it, citing overlapping issues with the *Middleton* case. Defendants argued that the plaintiffs’ claims were non-justiciable political questions and that the state’s interest in preventing fraud justified the Witness Requirement. The motion to reconsider the stay, filed in September 2020, sought to lift the stay and dismiss the case, emphasizing the lack of evidence for a \"severe burden\" and the need for legislative, not judicial, resolution of election policies. The case remained pending as of the documents, with the court weighing whether to proceed to trial or dismiss the claims as outside federal jurisdiction.",
    "JC-MD-0017": "On April 21, 2020, a class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland by Keith Seth, David Smith, Mario Burch, and John Does 1–5, challenging the Prince George’s County Jail’s (“Jail”) response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs, predominantly pretrial detainees, alleged that the Jail’s conditions violated their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by exposing them to severe health risks, including inadequate hygiene, lack of medical care, and failure to isolate infected individuals. A subset of plaintiffs also sought habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, arguing that medically vulnerable detainees faced imminent danger due to the Jail’s policies.  \n\nThe complaint detailed a widespread outbreak at the Jail, with at least 18 confirmed cases among detainees and staff by April 2020, despite the Jail’s refusal to adopt CDC-recommended measures such as free access to soap, social distancing, or proper sanitation. Plaintiffs described filthy isolation cells, delayed medical attention, and the detention of COVID-positive individuals even after bail was paid, which they claimed constituted unlawful overdetention. The Jail’s response included a full lockdown, limiting detainees to their cells for 23 hours daily, and inconsistent implementation of safety protocols.  \n\nOn May 21, 2020, the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) requiring the Jail to improve testing, isolation, and medical care for high-risk detainees but denied preliminary injunctive relief and habeas corpus petitions. The TRO was later allowed to expire. The defendant, Mary Lou McDonough, Director of the Prince George’s County Department of Corrections, filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint on July 17, 2020, arguing that plaintiffs’ claims were moot (as some had been released), failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and did not state valid legal claims under § 1983 or § 2241. Plaintiffs opposed the motion, asserting that the Jail’s lockdown conditions and lack of procedural safeguards violated their constitutional rights, including substantive and procedural due process.  \n\nThe case involves ongoing disputes over the Jail’s compliance with public health guidelines and constitutional standards, with the court having ordered a report from a court-appointed monitor, Dr. Franco-Paredes, to assess conditions. The defendant’s Motion to Dismiss remains pending, and the case highlights tensions between emergency pandemic measures and detainees’ rights to adequate medical care and freedom from unlawful detention.",
    "IM-FL-0029": "On April 13, 2020, a class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida by 34 immigration detainees at three South Florida facilities—Krome Service Processing Center, Broward Transitional Center (BTC), and Glades County Detention Center. The petitioners, representing a putative class of approximately 1,400 individuals, alleged that continued detention violated their Fifth Amendment right to due process by exposing them to severe risks of contracting COVID-19 due to overcrowded conditions, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), inadequate hygiene supplies, and failure to implement social distancing or individual quarantine protocols as mandated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ICE’s detention standards. The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman, who recommended a temporary restraining order (TRO) and partial class certification for conditions-of-confinement claims but denied certification for habeas corpus release requests. Judge Marcia G. Cooke adopted the TRO, later extending it, and issued a preliminary injunction requiring ICE to comply with CDC guidelines, including reducing overcrowding, providing PPE, and ceasing unsafe cohorting of confirmed and unconfirmed COVID-19 cases.  \n\nICE contested compliance, arguing it had implemented measures to mitigate risks, but the court found its actions demonstrated deliberate indifference to detainees’ safety. A special master, Matthew C. Dates, inspected the facilities and confirmed ongoing violations of social distancing and hygiene standards. In June 2021, the parties reached a settlement agreement, which required ICE to fully implement CDC guidelines, provide free COVID-19 vaccinations, and ensure seasonal flu vaccinations at no cost. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, and a special master continued to monitor compliance. The case highlighted systemic failures in ICE detention practices during the pandemic, with the court emphasizing that constitutional rights protections apply to civil detainees, even in the absence of criminal convictions. Key related cases, such as *Savino v. Souza* and *Fraihat v. ICE*, reinforced the precedent for injunctive relief in similar contexts. The settlement marked the resolution of claims related to unsafe detention conditions, though individual habeas petitions remained permissible."
