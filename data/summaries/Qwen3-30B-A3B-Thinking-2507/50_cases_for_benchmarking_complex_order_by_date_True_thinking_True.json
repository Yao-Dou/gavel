    "46567": "On May 5, 2025, G.M.G., a Venezuelan national in immigration custody at the Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus against various U.S. government officials, including the President, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. G.M.G. alleged that the government had falsely designated him as a member of the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua (TdA), leading to his denial of bond in immigration court. The plaintiff challenged a presidential Proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to target Venezuelan noncitizens allegedly affiliated with TdA for summary removal to El Salvador. G.M.G. argued the Proclamation was unlawful because TdA is not a \"foreign nation or government\" and is not engaged in an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" as required by the AEA; the Proclamation provided inadequate notice (12 hours before removal) that violated due process; and the Proclamation bypassed statutory protections for noncitizens seeking asylum, withholding of removal, and protection from torture under the Convention Against Torture. The plaintiff sought a temporary restraining order to prevent his removal under the Proclamation and to bar his transfer out of the District of Rhode Island. On May 5, 2025, District Judge Melissa R. DuBose issued an order requiring the government to provide the court with at least 48 hours' advance notice before moving G.M.G. outside the District of Rhode Island. This order was amended on May 7, 2025, to require 72 hours' advance notice, with notice periods running only on business days. The plaintiff's counsel cited recent court decisions in other cases (G.F.F. v. Trump and D.B.U. v. Trump) that had similarly found the Proclamation unlawful. The case was filed by attorneys from the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation.",
    "46582": "Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian noncitizen lawfully residing in the United States since 2016, filed a habeas corpus action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on April 30, 2025, seeking immediate release from immigration detention at the Prairieland Detention Facility in Texas. Kordia alleges she was detained solely because of her protected First Amendment activities: attending a peaceful protest in New York City in support of Palestinian rights and sending financial assistance to family members in Palestine. The complaint details that after the protest, New York City police arrested her and charged her with a local ordinance violation, but prosecutors dismissed the charges. In March 2025, following President Trump's executive orders targeting noncitizens engaged in advocacy for Palestinian rights, ICE detained Kordia, transferred her over 1,500 miles from her home in New Jersey to Texas, and refused to release her on bond despite an immigration judge finding she posed no danger to the community and was not a flight risk. Kordia further alleges that detention facility officials have denied her halal meals, prayer mats, and appropriate religious clothing, causing significant weight loss and violating her religious liberty under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The plaintiff's counsel filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking her immediate release, which was heard on June 5, 2025. Magistrate Judge Rebecca Rutherford issued a recommendation that Kordia be released pending final judgment, but the case remains pending before the district court following objections from the government. The case is being prosecuted by a coalition of civil rights organizations including the Texas Civil Rights Project, Southern Poverty Law Center, and Muslim Advocates.",
    "46496": "On April 24, 2025, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, Southern Border Communities Coalition, and Urban Justice Center filed a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) abrupt closure of three statutory oversight offices: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS Ombudsman), and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO). The complaint alleged that Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to place nearly all employees of these offices on administrative leave with separation dates of May 23, 2025, violated Congress's statutory mandates requiring their existence and functions under 6 U.S.C. § 345 (CRCL), 6 U.S.C. § 272 (CIS Ombudsman), and 6 U.S.C. § 205 (OIDO), making the action ultra vires. The plaintiffs argued that DHS's actions also violated the Administrative Procedure Act by being arbitrary and capricious, lacking reasoned explanation, and contrary to specific statutory requirements. The organizations, which regularly filed complaints with these offices regarding civil rights violations in immigration enforcement, contended that the closure deprived them of essential channels for addressing human rights abuses, particularly in immigration detention facilities. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to reverse the closures and restore the offices' statutory functions. The court denied a motion for a temporary restraining order on May 23, 2025, but ordered a joint status report. On July 11, 2025, the court denied the motion for preliminary injunction, instead ordering expedited discovery and briefing of cross-motions for summary judgment, effectively placing the preliminary injunction motion on hold while the parties prepared for further proceedings.",
    "46432": "Mohammed H., a 20-year-old Bangladeshi national studying Management Information Systems at Minnesota State University, Mankato, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota on April 18, 2025, challenging his detention by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, The Advocates for Human Rights, and the University of Minnesota Detainee Rights Clinic, Mohammed H. alleged that federal authorities arrested and detained him solely because of his social media posts advocating for Palestinian human rights, violating his First Amendment free speech rights, Fifth Amendment due process rights, and the Administrative Procedure Act. He claimed the Government was engaged in a broader campaign targeting international students for expressing pro-Palestinian views.\n\nThe Government initially sought to dismiss the case on jurisdictional grounds, but on April 22, 2025, Judge Jerry W. Blackwell granted Mohammed H.'s motion for a temporary restraining order, preventing the Government from transferring him outside the District of Minnesota. The Court later ordered the Government to file an answer by April 25, 2025. On May 5, 2025, Judge Blackwell granted Mohammed H.'s request for release on bail pending adjudication, ordering his immediate release from ICE custody subject to a $7,500 bond, while extending the temporary restraining order to prevent his transfer. The Court found the Government's shifting justifications for detention (from \"failure to maintain status\" to \"visa revocation\" to \"foreign policy grounds\"), the lack of evidence supporting a public safety threat from a 2023 misdemeanor that had already been resolved, and the timing of the arrest following his pro-Palestinian social media posts raised serious constitutional concerns.\n\nAfter reviewing the parties' submissions, Judge Blackwell issued a comprehensive order on June 17, 2025, granting Mohammed H.'s petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Court found the Government's actions violated the First Amendment by targeting Mohammed H. for his protected speech, violated the Fifth Amendment due process rights by detaining him without individualized justification or legitimate immigration purpose, and violated the Administrative Procedure Act by terminating his SEVIS record without lawful basis or compliance with agency policy. The Court ordered Mohammed H. to remain released from custody subject to the $7,500 bond conditions previously imposed by the Immigration Judge. The Government appealed the decision to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on July 29, 2025.",
    "46477": "On April 14, 2025, ten international students filed a lawsuit against Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Todd Lyons, the Acting ICE Director, and Robert Lynch, the Detroit-ICE Field Office Director. The students alleged that DHS had unlawfully terminated their F-1 student records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) without valid grounds, despite having no convictions for crimes of violence that would justify termination under immigration regulations. The plaintiffs, who were enrolled at universities across multiple states, received notices stating their records were terminated due to \"failure to maintain status,\" which they claimed was based on minor criminal contacts like speeding tickets and dismissed charges. The students were ordered to \"stop working immediately\" and make arrangements to leave the country.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for arbitrary and capricious action and violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. On April 15, 2025, they filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which the court granted on April 23, 2025. The TRO required DHS to restore the students' SEVIS records retroactively to the date of termination, refrain from terminating the records without valid grounds, and prohibit revoking their Optional Practical Training authorizations. The court found the plaintiffs had a strong likelihood of success on their APA claim and would suffer irreparable harm without relief.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, the court held an evidentiary hearing on the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction, which it granted on May 7, 2025. The court determined that DHS had not demonstrated the challenged conduct would not recur, making the plaintiffs vulnerable to future harm. The preliminary injunction required DHS to maintain the students' records as active and provide documentation of the restoration to their Designated School Officials. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal on July 7, 2025, which was assigned case number 25-1611. The case is pending before the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, with Judge Jane M. Beckering presiding.",
    "46239": "Erie County, New York, filed a lawsuit against the Corporation for National and Community Service (Americorps) and its interim agency head, Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, on March 17, 2025, challenging Americorps' requirement that grantees certify they do not promote \"DEI\" (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) in their programs. The case arose after Erie County received a $250,000 grant in January 2024 for its Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), which had operated continuously since 1973 and served over 450 volunteers providing 37,000 hours of service annually to seniors in Erie County. Americorps, following two executive orders signed by President Trump in January 2025, sent Erie County a letter on February 14, 2025, requiring certification that its RSVP program did not promote DEI, despite Erie County's application having included language about recruiting a diverse Advisory Council and implementing diversity-focused initiatives as required by Americorps' longstanding regulations. Erie County argued that this new requirement was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) and violated the Spending Clause of the Constitution (U.S. Const., Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 1) by imposing an impermissibly vague condition on federal funding. Erie County filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on March 21, 2025, seeking to prevent Americorps from enforcing the certification requirement. Americorps opposed the motion, arguing the Court lacked jurisdiction over the dispute. The case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on April 14, 2025, when Erie County informed the Court that Americorps had changed its certification requirements. The dismissal was entered by Chief Judge James E. Boasberg, with the case being terminated without any court ruling on the merits of the claims.",
    "46230": "On March 14, 2025, Jane Doe 1-6 and John Doe 7-12, twelve nonpartisan career civil servants employed in the Veterans Affairs Department's Office of Equity Assurance (OEA), filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Secretary of Veterans Affairs Douglas A. Collins. The plaintiffs alleged that the VA's designation of the OEA as a \"DEIA office\" and their classification as \"DEIA employees\" following Executive Order 14151 (signed January 20, 2025) violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights and the Administrative Procedure Act. The complaint challenged the closure of the OEA on January 22, 2025, their placement on administrative leave, subsequent termination through a reduction in force (RIF), and the denial of reassignment opportunities. The plaintiffs claimed they were targeted for their work to address disparities in veterans' benefits access, which they characterized as nonpartisan efforts to ensure equitable service delivery, not \"divisive\" DEIA activities as described in the executive order. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief to stop the VA from designating the OEA as a DEIA office and to require a public recantation of these designations. On April 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, which was denied by Judge Rudolph Contreras on May 2, 2025. The case was later voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on July 17, 2025.",
    "46242": "On March 5, 2025, BlueRibbon Coalition, Inc., Sage Riders Motorcycle Club, and Paul Wells filed a complaint challenging the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) December 31, 2024, San Rafael Swell Travel Management Plan (TMP), which closed 665 miles of motorized routes in the San Rafael Swell Travel Management Area (TMA) in Emery County, Utah. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, alleged that the TMP violates the Dingell Act by creating prohibited \"buffer zones\" around designated wilderness areas, violates the Administrative Procedure Act through arbitrary and capricious decision-making, and violates the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to take a \"hard look\" at environmental impacts. The plaintiffs specifically challenged BLM's closure of routes that provide access to historical sites, State Trust Land, and the Marsing Ranch, arguing these closures contradict Congress's intent under the Dingell Act. The plaintiffs also alleged that BLM improperly relied on CEQ regulations that were later invalidated by the D.C. Circuit in Marin Audubon Society v. FAA. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment declaring the TMP unlawful, an injunction preventing its enforcement, and related relief. On March 6, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or alternatively for a preliminary injunction to prevent implementation of the TMP. On March 10, 2025, the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance filed a motion to intervene as a defendant-intervenor to defend the TMP, which the court granted on April 21, 2025. The case is currently pending before United States District Judge David Nuffer in the District of Utah, with a scheduling order in place for briefing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.",
    "46039": "On February 4, 2025, the Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association (FBIAA), along with individual FBI special agents, forensic examiners, a forensic chemist, and an intelligence analyst (collectively referred to as \"John Does\" and \"Jane Does\" for anonymity), filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Justice and the United States of America. The plaintiffs alleged that the Department of Justice's request for the FBI to compile a list of personnel who worked on investigations related to the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack, and the subsequent threat of public disclosure of that information, violated their privacy rights under the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a), their First Amendment rights against retaliation for perceived political affiliation, and their Fifth Amendment due process rights. The plaintiffs contended that the disclosure of their personal information would expose them to threats and violence from January 6 rioters who had been pardoned by President Trump, citing public threats from pardoned rioters and previous incidents where FBI agents had been doxed. The Department of Justice opposed the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order, arguing that the information request was lawful under the Privacy Act for internal review purposes and that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate imminent harm. On February 7, 2025, Judge Jia M. Cobb entered a consent order deferring ruling on the temporary restraining order and establishing a schedule for a preliminary injunction hearing, while prohibiting the government from disseminating the list (or any record pairing unique identifiers to names) to the public before the court ruled on the preliminary injunction. The order also specified that the government could terminate the proscription by providing two business days' notice to the parties and court.",
    "46681": "Gary L. Barnes, a pro se citizen of the United States, filed a complaint in the U.S. Court of International Trade on February 3, 2025, challenging the constitutionality of tariffs imposed by President Trump on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China through executive orders. The plaintiff alleged that the President violated the U.S. Constitution by unconstitutionally imposing tariffs, as Article I, Sections 7 and 8 grant Congress alone the power to impose tariffs, and the President's actions violated the separation of powers. The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the tariffs and prevent future unconstitutional tariff imposition. The United States filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiff lacked Article III standing because he failed to allege a concrete, particularized injury that was fairly traceable to the tariffs and redressable by a favorable court decision. The court granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice on May 23, 2025, finding that the plaintiff's alleged injury as a consumer was too speculative and not particularized, and that his claim of a \"breach of the constitutional contract\" did not satisfy standing requirements. The court allowed the plaintiff 30 days to file an amended complaint addressing the standing deficiencies. The case was assigned to Judge Jennifer Choe-Groves.",
    "46758": "This case involves a putative class action lawsuit alleging that federal immigration officials have authorized a pattern of detentive stops without reasonable suspicion in the Central District of California. Plaintiffs, consisting of U.S. citizens, lawful residents, and immigrant workers represented by three organizations, alleged that federal agents conducting \"Operation At Large\" have made detentive stops based on factors including apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at specific locations (such as bus stops, carwashes, and tow yards), and the type of work an individual performs. The plaintiffs provided numerous examples of stops, including of U.S. citizens who were detained without reasonable suspicion, such as Jason Brian Gavidia, a lifelong East Los Angeles resident, and Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Carlos Osorto, and Isaac Villegas Molina, who were detained at a bus stop while waiting for construction work. The district court, after reviewing 21 sworn declarations, granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on July 11, 2025, prohibiting federal agents from making detentive stops without reasonable suspicion and specifically banning reliance on the four enumerated factors alone or in combination. The defendants appealed the TRO to the Ninth Circuit, requesting a stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit denied the stay motion, except for a minor modification to the TRO's language regarding the phrase \"except as permitted by law.\" The court determined that the plaintiffs had established standing to seek injunctive relief, as the challenged stops were part of a pattern of officially sanctioned conduct, and the TRO was consistent with the Fourth Amendment's requirement for reasonable suspicion. The court also rejected the defendants' argument that the TRO was impermissibly vague, finding that the TRO did not prohibit reliance on the four factors when combined with other relevant information, but only prohibited sole reliance on those factors. The court emphasized that the TRO was necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs, as a narrower injunction would not have effectively protected the plaintiffs from the challenged conduct.",
    "46378": "This case involves four international students—Chinmay Deore, Yogesh Joshi, Xiangyun Bu, and Qiuyi Yang—who were enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs at Michigan universities when their F-1 student status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was terminated by the Department of Homeland Security without providing them with notice, an explanation, or an opportunity to respond. The students, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union Fund of Michigan, filed a complaint on April 10, 2025, alleging that the terminations violated their Fifth Amendment due process rights and constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act. The students sought an emergency temporary restraining order to restore their F-1 status and prevent potential arrest or deportation. The government argued that SEVIS terminations do not automatically terminate F-1 status, that the students had not demonstrated irreparable harm, and that the plaintiffs had not established a strong likelihood of success on the merits. On April 17, 2025, Judge Stephen J. Murphy III denied the motion for a temporary restraining order, finding it was unclear whether the SEVIS terminations equated to a loss of F-1 status and that the plaintiffs had not sufficiently demonstrated the likelihood of success on their claims. The case remains pending, with a preliminary injunction hearing scheduled for May 19, 2025.",
    "46385": "On April 9, 2025, Sheila Bedi and Lynn Cohn, law professors at Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce, its Chair Tim Walberg, and Subcommittee Chair Burgess Owens, along with Northwestern University and its leadership as nominal defendants. The plaintiffs alleged that the Committee's demand for sensitive documents related to their legal clinics violated their constitutional rights. The Committee had sent a letter demanding information about the professors' work, accusing them of \"left-wing advocacy\" and \"left-wing political activism,\" and specifically targeting Bedi's representation of protesters in a lawsuit involving pro-Palestinian demonstrations. The plaintiffs argued that the Committee's demands were pretextual, using antisemitism as a justification to punish them for their political views and the causes they represent, and that the demands violated the First Amendment's protections for free speech, freedom of association, and the right to petition the government, as well as the Fifth Amendment's due process protections and the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel. The plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to prevent Northwestern from complying with the Committee's demands by April 10, 2025. The court held an emergency hearing on April 10, 2025, but the plaintiffs' motion was denied as moot because Northwestern had already complied with the Committee's April 10 deadline. The case was subsequently stayed by the court on June 24, 2025.",
    "46353": "John Doe, a software engineer in lawful F-1 nonimmigrant student status working under post-graduate STEM Optional Practical Training (OPT) employment authorization, filed a complaint on April 7, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Doe alleged that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated his Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record on March 28, 2025, marking him as \"Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status\" based on a criminal records check without providing notice or opportunity to respond. Doe, who had a single minor misdemeanor conviction that had been disclosed to DHS and did not render him inadmissible or deportable, contended that ICE lacked statutory authority to terminate his SEVIS record, as such termination can only occur under specific circumstances outlined in regulations (8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d)), none of which applied to his case. Doe sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, alleging that ICE's termination violated his due process rights and was arbitrary and capricious.\n\nThe court granted Doe's motion for a temporary restraining order on April 17, 2025, enjoining the government from arresting, detaining, or removing him based on the unlawful SEVIS termination. On April 25, 2025, the court extended the temporary restraining order for 14 days and scheduled a hearing on a preliminary injunction for May 13, 2025. The defendants, including the President of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security, ICE Director, and ICE Field Office Director, opposed the TRO, arguing that SEVIS termination does not affect nonimmigrant status and that Doe had not established a likelihood of success on the merits. On July 21, 2025, the defendants filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "46337": "On April 3, 2025, nineteen states (California, Nevada, Massachusetts, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin) filed a complaint challenging Executive Order No. 14248, issued by President Donald J. Trump on March 25, 2025, which sought to impose documentary proof of citizenship requirements for federal voter registration, alter military and overseas voter registration processes, and establish a uniform ballot receipt deadline of Election Day for all voting methods. The states, represented by their respective Attorneys General, argued that the Executive Order violated the constitutional Elections Clause (Article I, Section 4) and Electors Clause (Article II, Section 1), which reserve election administration authority to the states, and also violated statutory provisions including the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), Help America Vote Act (HAVA), and Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). The states specifically challenged Sections 2(a) (requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration), 2(d) (requiring assessment of citizenship before providing voter registration forms to public assistance program enrollees), 3(d) (requiring documentary proof of citizenship for military and overseas voters), 7(a) (directing the Attorney General to enforce a strict Election Day ballot receipt deadline), and 7(b) (conditioning federal election funding on compliance with the uniform ballot receipt deadline). On June 13, 2025, Judge Denise J. Casper granted the states' motion for preliminary injunction, finding the states were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that these provisions of the Executive Order were unconstitutional and ultra vires. The court enjoined the defendants from implementing Sections 2(a), 2(d), 3(d), and 7(b) of the Executive Order, and from taking civil or criminal enforcement actions under Section 7(a) against the thirteen states that allow for counting ballots received after Election Day but postmarked on or before that date. The preliminary injunction was amended on July 18, 2025, to clarify the scope of the relief. The defendants subsequently appealed the ruling to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "46238": "On March 17, 2025, Master Sergeant Logan Ireland and Staff Sergeant Nicholas Bear Bade, transgender men serving honorably in the United States Air Force, filed a complaint challenging President Trump's January 27, 2025, Executive Order 14183 and related Department of Defense guidance that effectively bans transgender individuals from military service. The plaintiffs alleged that the policy violates the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause by requiring transgender service members to serve in their birth sex (which conflicts with their gender identity) or face administrative separation, and by being motivated by animus against transgender people. The plaintiffs, who had been placed on administrative absence and faced potential separation as early as March 26, 2025, sought a temporary restraining order to prevent initiation of separation proceedings. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey granted the requested temporary restraining order on March 24, 2025, prohibiting the Department of Defense from initiating administrative separation proceedings against the plaintiffs. The court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits, that they faced irreparable harm, and that the balance of equities favored granting the TRO. The defendants later sought a stay of the order, but the court denied the request on March 26, 2025. The case was ultimately voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs on May 15, 2025, without prejudice. The plaintiffs were represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, Stapleton Segal Cochran LLC, National Center for Lesbian Rights, and Langer Grogan & Diver P.C.",
    "46234": "On March 15, 2025, Momodou Taal, a non-citizen Ph.D. student at Cornell University, along with U.S. citizen professor Mũkoma Wa Ngũgĩ and U.S. citizen student Sriram Parasurama, filed a complaint challenging two executive orders issued by President Donald Trump. The plaintiffs alleged that Executive Order 14161, \"Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,\" and Executive Order 14188, \"Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism,\" violated their First Amendment rights by restricting speech critical of U.S. government policy and the government of Israel, and by threatening deportation for such speech. The plaintiffs argued these orders were unconstitutionally vague, overbroad, and created an immediate chilling effect on their speech, association, and right to receive information. The complaint also alleged that the government had revoked Mr. Taal's student visa and initiated removal proceedings against him based on his participation in pro-Palestinian protests, violating his Fifth Amendment due process rights.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to prevent enforcement of the executive orders and to halt Mr. Taal's removal proceedings. On March 27, 2025, Judge Elizabeth C. Coombe denied the motion for a temporary restraining order, holding that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Taal's claim challenging his removal proceedings, as Congress has stripped district courts of jurisdiction to review removal questions under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(b)(9) and 1252(a)(5). The court also found that the plaintiffs had not established standing to challenge the executive orders, as the claims were either premature or could not be redressed by the requested relief. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 27, 2025, but the court's denial of the TRO remained in effect. On March 31, 2025, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.",
    "46216": "On March 12, 2025, Gordon Schiff and Celeste Royce, physicians and Harvard Medical School professors, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), alleging that the government unlawfully removed their medical commentaries from the Patient Safety Network (PSNet) website. The commentaries—Dr. Schiff's \"Multiple Missed Opportunities for Suicide Risk Assessment\" and Dr. Royce's \"Endometriosis: A Common and Commonly Missed and Delayed Diagnosis\"—were removed because they contained the terms \"transgender\" and \"LGBTQ,\" which the government deemed to \"promote gender ideology\" under Executive Order 14168. The government offered to restore the articles only if the plaintiffs removed those terms, which they refused to do. The plaintiffs argued the removal violated their First Amendment rights by imposing viewpoint-based censorship on a limited public forum and was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. On April 1, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to restore their articles and prevent further censorship. The government opposed the motion, arguing the PSNet website had been discontinued and the plaintiffs lacked standing. After a hearing on May 21, 2025, Judge Leo T. Sorokin granted the preliminary injunction on May 23, 2025, ordering the defendants to restore the plaintiffs' commentaries and all other content removed from PSNet pursuant to the government's implementation of Executive Order 14168. The court found the government's removal of the articles constituted viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment and that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The injunction required the defendants to restore the content within seven days and remain in effect until the case concluded.",
    "46207": "On March 7, 2025, three transgender inmates—Alishea Kingdom, Solo Nichols, and Jas Kapule—filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Trump administration and the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Eighth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiffs, who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and had been receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy and social accommodations (such as gender-appropriate clothing) while incarcerated, challenged Executive Order 14168, issued by President Trump on January 20, 2025, which prohibited the use of federal funds for \"any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate's appearance to that of the opposite sex.\" The BOP subsequently issued two implementing memoranda that enforced this prohibition, causing the plaintiffs to lose access to hormone therapy and social accommodations. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the Executive Order and implementing memoranda and class certification to represent all transgender inmates in BOP custody diagnosed with gender dysphoria who were receiving or would receive gender-affirming care. On June 3, 2025, Judge Royce C. Lamberth granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and class certification, finding they were likely to succeed on their APA claims, would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction, and that the balance of equities favored granting relief. The court ordered the BOP to provide hormone therapy to all class members who had been prescribed it and to restore social accommodations to the same extent as before the Executive Order. The case remains ongoing with the preliminary injunction in effect.",
    "46104": "American Oversight, a nonpartisan non-profit organization focused on government transparency, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 11, 2025, against the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), U.S. DOGE Service (USDS), U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, U.S. Digital Service, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The case arises from American Oversight's submission of eight FOIA requests seeking communications involving Elon Musk and his staff regarding the removal of inspectors general from federal agencies and DOGE's operations across the executive branch. American Oversight alleged that the government failed to process these requests within statutory timeframes and sought expedited processing for two of the requests, which the government denied by claiming DOGE is not subject to FOIA. The government's position contradicts public statements by President Trump and Musk, who have repeatedly identified Musk as DOGE's leader and described DOGE's authority to direct agency operations, including halting funding for life-saving programs and gaining access to sensitive government systems. The court granted American Oversight's motion for a preservation order on April 2, 2025, requiring defendants to preserve records responsive to the FOIA requests. Following the government's answer to the amended complaint, American Oversight filed a motion for limited discovery to determine whether DOGE wields independent authority sufficient to qualify as an \"agency\" under FOIA, which the government opposed. On May 23, 2025, Judge Beryl A. Howell ordered American Oversight to file a motion for limited discovery by June 2, 2025, to address the threshold question of DOGE's agency status under FOIA. The case is currently pending with discovery proceedings underway.",
    "46602": "In May 2025, Oregon Council for the Humanities (doing business as Oregon Humanities) and the Federation of State Humanities Councils filed a lawsuit challenging the National Endowment for the Humanities' (NEH) termination of federal grants to state and jurisdictional humanities councils. The plaintiffs alleged that NEH, acting on directives from the newly created United States DOGE Service (Department of Government Efficiency), unlawfully terminated nearly all grants to the councils without providing the required notice, opportunity for hearing, or statutory findings of noncompliance. The termination letters, sent on April 2, 2025, used boilerplate language citing Executive Order 14222 as justification, despite NEH not being named in the order. The NEH later issued a partial rescission on June 2, 2025, reducing funding to only 20 percent of the previously approved levels, which the plaintiffs argued still violated statutory requirements. The plaintiffs contended that the terminations violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to follow statutory procedures for grant terminations, contravened the Separation of Powers by refusing to spend congressionally appropriated funds as required by law, and violated the Impoundment Control Act by failing to follow required procedures for deferring funds. The District Court granted a preliminary injunction on August 6, 2025, enjoining NEH from implementing the April 2 grant terminations and directing that funds committed to the plaintiffs through grants approved as of April 2, 2025, not be disbursed elsewhere. The court found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious, violated statutory requirements for grant terminations, and contravened constitutional separation of powers principles. The injunction was limited to the named plaintiffs, including the Federation's member councils, and prohibited the defendants from further terminating or canceling the approved grants without statutory cause.",
    "46478": "Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc., family-owned educational toy companies that import most of their products from China and other countries, filed a lawsuit challenging the President's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on imports. The plaintiffs argued that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs at all, as it is an emergency economic powers statute that authorizes targeted sanctions, not broad tariffs. They specifically challenged executive orders imposing tariffs ranging from 10% to 145% on Chinese goods and other imports, which they claimed would force them to raise prices by 70% or cease importing products, threatening their business viability. The government moved to transfer the case to the Court of International Trade, arguing it had exclusive jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i), but the district court denied the motion, finding that IEEPA is not a \"law providing for tariffs\" as required by that statute. The court also granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, ruling that IEEPA's text, context, and historical practice confirm it does not authorize tariffs, and that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction. The court found that the power to \"regulate\" importation under IEEPA does not include the power to levy tariffs, as the Constitution distinguishes between the power to regulate commerce (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) and the power to lay taxes/duties (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1). The government appealed and sought a stay of the preliminary injunction, which the district court granted on June 3, 2025, staying the injunction pending resolution of the appeal. The case remains stayed as the DC Circuit considers the appeal.",
    "46390": "On March 14, 2025, the President issued a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), 50 U.S.C. § 21, to authorize the summary removal of Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a criminal gang, without the normal immigration process. The plaintiffs, D.B.U. and R.M.M., Venezuelan nationals detained in Colorado, filed a class action lawsuit challenging the proclamation as unlawful, arguing it violated the AEA's statutory requirements, the Constitution's Due Process Clause, and immigration law. They asserted the proclamation exceeded the AEA's scope because TdA is not a \"foreign nation or government\" and its activities do not constitute an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" as required by the statute. The plaintiffs also challenged the government's inadequate notice procedures, which provided only 12 hours to contest removal and failed to inform detainees of their right to seek habeas relief. The District Court granted the plaintiffs' Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order on April 22, 2025, certifying the class and ordering the government to provide 21 days' notice before any removal under the proclamation, and prohibiting transfers of class members outside the District of Colorado. The government appealed, but the Tenth Circuit denied a stay on April 29, 2025, finding the government failed to demonstrate irreparable harm. The District Court subsequently certified the class and granted a preliminary injunction on May 6, 2025, permanently enjoining the government from detaining, transferring, or removing class members under the proclamation, holding the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits because the proclamation failed to satisfy the AEA's statutory requirements and violated due process. The government has now appealed the class certification and preliminary injunction orders to the Tenth Circuit.",
    "46499": "In early April 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) initiated a sweeping termination of Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records for hundreds of international students with F-1 visas across the United States, without providing notice, explanation, or individualized review. The terminations were based on National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database hits, often related to minor incidents like dismissed arrests or traffic citations, rather than actual criminal convictions. The plaintiffs, four law-abiding international students (Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo) who had maintained academic standing and clean records, were abruptly stripped of their lawful F-1 status, which immediately jeopardized their ability to continue studies, work, and remain in the country. The plaintiffs filed a complaint on April 11, 2025, alleging that the terminations violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as arbitrary and capricious, and violated their Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection rights. On April 18, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order preventing ICE from arresting or transferring the plaintiffs. Following a hearing on May 14, 2025, the court granted a nationwide preliminary injunction on May 22, 2025, prohibiting ICE from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring the plaintiffs or similarly situated students, from imposing adverse legal effects from the SEVIS terminations, and from reversing the reinstatement of SEVIS records for reasons not specified in the regulations. The injunction was nationwide in scope, applying to all similarly situated international students. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the injunction was overbroad, violated the Supreme Court's recent decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc., and that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate irreparable harm. The case was initially filed in the Northern District of California and was related to several other similar cases nationwide. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from Deheng Law Offices PC with additional representation from the Chinese American Legal Defense Alliance. The case later expanded to include additional plaintiffs (Jing Tao, Yifeng Wu, and Wanrong Li) who had also had their F-1 visas revoked by the Department of State based on the same NCIC hits.",
    "46319": "The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's Executive Order 14,251, issued on March 27, 2025, which excluded numerous federal agencies from the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). The FSLMRS, enacted in 1978, grants federal employees collective bargaining rights, with a narrow exception allowing the President to exclude agencies if they have \"a primary function of intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work\" and if collective bargaining cannot be applied \"in a manner consistent with national security requirements and considerations.\" NTEU argued the Executive Order was ultra vires because it improperly excluded agencies that do not meet the statutory criteria, and that the President's actions were motivated by political retaliation against unions that challenged Administration policies rather than legitimate national security concerns. The White House Fact Sheet accompanying the Executive Order stated that \"certain Federal unions have declared war on President Trump's agenda\" and that the Executive Order was needed to \"protect our national security\" and \"ensure that agencies vital to national security can execute their missions without delay.\" On April 28, 2025, Judge Paul L. Friedman of the District of Columbia granted NTEU's motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the Executive Order applied an overly broad interpretation of \"national security\" and \"primary function\" and that the President's actions were motivated by retaliation. The court found \"clear evidence\" that the President was \"indifferent to the purposes and requirements of the [FSLMRS], or acted deliberately in contravention of them.\" The government appealed, and the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal on May 16, 2025, finding that the district court's injunction \"inflicts irreparable harm on the President by impeding his national-security prerogatives.\" The case is now proceeding with cross-motions for summary judgment.",
    "46285": "Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, UndocuBlack Network, and CASA, Inc. (immigrant rights organizations) filed a lawsuit challenging three Department of Homeland Security (DHS) actions that expanded expedited removal to noncitizens who had been paroled into the United States at ports of entry. The plaintiffs alleged that the January 23, 2025, Huffman Memorandum, the February 18, 2025, ICE Directive, and the March 25, 2025, CHNV Parole Termination Notice violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which limits expedited removal to \"arriving\" aliens or aliens who have not been admitted or paroled and have not been continuously present in the United States for two years. The organizations argued that the government's actions unlawfully subjected their members—many of whom had been paroled through programs like CBP One or the CHNV parole processes—to summary removal without due process, including no right to counsel, limited access to evidence, and no meaningful opportunity to apply for immigration relief. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a stay of the challenged actions, citing imminent harm to their members who were already being arrested after immigration court hearings and processed for expedited removal. On August 1, 2025, Judge Jia M. Cobb granted the stay, finding that the plaintiffs were substantially likely to succeed on the merits because the challenged actions exceeded DHS's statutory authority under the INA. The court held that neither the \"Arriving Aliens Provision\" nor the \"Designation Provision\" of the INA authorized applying expedited removal to parolees, as parolees no longer qualified as \"arriving\" aliens and were ineligible under the Designation Provision. The court also found the actions arbitrary and capricious due to inconsistent legal justifications. The government appealed the stay order to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is currently considering the appeal.",
    "46179": "This case involves the unlawful removal of two Senate-confirmed members of the United States Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), Travis LeBlanc and Edward Felten, by President Donald J. Trump without cause. The PCLOB was created by Congress to provide independent oversight of the executive branch's counterterrorism policies and to ensure that national security measures balance with privacy and civil liberties protections. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress initially established the PCLOB within the Executive Office of the President, but later reconstituted it as an independent agency in 2007 to ensure its independence. Congress removed language stating that Board members \"serve at the pleasure of the President\" and instead mandated that \"each member of the Board shall serve a term of six years.\"\n\nOn January 27, 2025, President Trump terminated LeBlanc and Felten without providing any cause for their removal, leaving the Board with only one member and preventing it from functioning as a quorum to carry out its statutory duties. The plaintiffs filed a complaint arguing that the President's removals violated 42 U.S.C. § 2000ee, which Congress intended to insulate Board members from removal without cause. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Judge Reggie B. Walton, granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, holding that the PCLOB's statutory structure and function made it clear that Congress intended to protect Board members from at-will removal. The Court declared the terminations unlawful and ordered the plaintiffs' reinstatement to their positions as Board members, with the President permitted to remove them only for cause. The defendants appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted a stay pending appeal on July 1, 2025.",
    "46106": "On February 11, 2025, current and former federal employees and their unions (American Federation of Government Employees, Association of Administrative Law Judges, and individual plaintiffs Vanessa Barrow, George Jones, and Deborah Toussant) filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and others, alleging violations of the Privacy Act of 1974. The plaintiffs claimed that OPM, in violation of federal law, granted unrestricted access to sensitive personnel records containing personal information of tens of millions of federal employees to individuals associated with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), including Elon Musk. The complaint alleged that OPM gave access to at least fourteen systems containing highly sensitive information—such as social security numbers, health information, and financial details—without proper vetting, training, or security protocols, and without establishing that the DOGE agents had a legitimate need for the information in performing their duties. The defendants argued the plaintiffs lacked standing and that the disclosures were lawful under the Privacy Act. On April 3, 2025, Judge Denise Cote denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, finding the plaintiffs had established standing based on a concrete injury analogous to intrusion upon seclusion. On June 9, 2025, Judge Cote granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding they were likely to succeed on their claims that OPM violated the Privacy Act by granting improper access to sensitive data and failing to establish appropriate security safeguards. The preliminary injunction required OPM to cease granting access to sensitive data to DOGE agents and to implement appropriate security measures, with a report due within two weeks of the order.",
    "46095": "On February 7, 2025, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued a Guidance (NOT-OD-25-068) that implemented a uniform 15% indirect cost rate for all NIH grants, retroactive to existing grants and effective February 10, 2025. This Guidance eliminated the decades-old system where NIH and universities negotiated institution-specific indirect cost rates (which varied widely, often exceeding 30% and reaching as high as 60%) based on the actual costs of research infrastructure. The Guidance was issued without prior notice or opportunity for comment, directly contradicting the requirements of 45 C.F.R. § 75.414, which mandates that deviations from negotiated rates must be based on documented justification and must be publicly available before implementation. It also violated Section 224 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, which explicitly prohibits using appropriated funds to develop or implement a \"modified approach\" to indirect cost reimbursement, and which has been repeatedly reenacted since 2018 in response to similar attempts to cap indirect costs. The plaintiffs, including the Association of American Universities, the American Council on Education, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, and numerous universities, filed suit on February 10, 2025, seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent implementation of the Guidance. The court granted a nationwide temporary restraining order on February 11, 2025, and later issued a preliminary injunction on March 5, 2025, finding the Guidance violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it was arbitrary and capricious, failed to follow required procedures, and was impermissibly retroactive. The court determined that the Guidance failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the change, ignored the substantial reliance interests of universities that had budgeted based on negotiated rates, and was issued without the required notice-and-comment process. On April 4, 2025, the court converted the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction and entered final judgment, vacating the Guidance in its entirety. The defendants filed a notice of appeal on April 8, 2025.",
    "46023": "This case involves a legal challenge to the Department of the Treasury's decision to grant members of the \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) access to sensitive personal and financial information maintained by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. The plaintiffs—Alliance for Retired Americans, American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, and Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO—filed a complaint on February 3, 2025, alleging that the Treasury Department violated the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code by granting DOGE access to systems containing personal information of millions of Americans, including Social Security recipients, federal employees, and taxpayers. The plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to halt the disclosure of personal information to DOGE members, which the court granted on February 6, 2025, with modifications on February 20, 2025, limiting access to \"read only\" for certain Treasury employees. The plaintiffs later converted their motion to a preliminary injunction, but the court denied it on March 7, 2025, finding they had not demonstrated irreparable harm. The court later permitted limited discovery to supplement the administrative record, and the parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment, with the plaintiffs arguing that the Treasury Department's actions violated the Privacy Act and the Internal Revenue Code, while the defendants contend the plaintiffs lack standing and that the actions were lawful. The case is currently before Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
    "46563": "On May 2, 2025, multiple cities, counties, and local housing and transportation agencies filed a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for unilaterally attaching new, unconstitutional conditions to federal grant agreements without congressional authorization. The plaintiffs, which include King County, San Francisco, Santa Clara, Boston, Columbus, New York City, and numerous other jurisdictions, had been conditionally awarded federal grants totaling hundreds of millions of dollars for homelessness assistance and transportation infrastructure. The challenged conditions included prohibiting recipients from \"promoting gender ideology\" as defined in an executive order, requiring recipients to certify they don't operate programs violating federal anti-discrimination laws, certifying that their compliance with anti-discrimination laws is \"material\" to government payment decisions, prohibiting promotion of \"elective abortions,\" and requiring recipients to certify they don't \"facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration\" while also mandating the use of specific immigration verification systems. The plaintiffs argued these conditions violated the separation of powers doctrine, the Spending Clause, the Fifth Amendment's void-for-vagueness doctrine, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), as they were not authorized by Congress, bore no relationship to the purposes of the grant programs, and were unconstitutionally vague. The plaintiffs faced imminent deadlines to accept these conditions or risk losing critical funding for homelessness services and transportation infrastructure. The court granted a temporary restraining order on May 7, 2025, and later granted a preliminary injunction on June 3, 2025, permanently enjoining HUD and DOT from imposing or enforcing the challenged conditions on the grant agreements. The defendants appealed the preliminary injunction on June 9, 2025.",
    "46484": "On April 23, 2025, the American Bar Association (ABA) filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice, Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The ABA alleged that the Department of Justice unlawfully terminated five grants totaling $3.2 million that funded the ABA's Commission on Domestic and Sexual Violence (ABA CDSV) in retaliation for the ABA's protected First Amendment activities. The ABA had publicly criticized the Trump Administration's actions as undermining the judiciary and legal profession, including issuing statements condemning remarks questioning the legitimacy of judicial review and joining a lawsuit challenging the Administration's freeze on international development grants. The next day, the Department of Justice terminated all of the ABA's OVW grants, citing a change in \"agency priorities\" without providing specific justification. The ABA moved for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to prevent the termination from taking effect, arguing the grants' termination constituted unlawful retaliation for protected speech. The court granted the motion on May 14, 2025, finding the ABA likely to succeed on its First Amendment retaliation claim, as the government had not identified any nonretaliatory reason for the termination and had not terminated any other similar OVW grants. The court held it had jurisdiction over the constitutional claim, rejecting the government's argument that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. The court ordered the Department of Justice to cease enforcing the termination of the grants and to resume disbursing funds to the ABA CDSV in the customary manner. The case was assigned to Judge Christopher R. Cooper, who granted the preliminary injunction without addressing the ABA's other claims.",
    "46279": "This case involves a class action lawsuit filed by noncitizens with final removal orders who were at risk of being deported to third countries without proper notice and opportunity to present fear-based claims. The plaintiffs challenged a February 18, 2025 directive from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that instructed officers to review cases of individuals granted withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) for potential removal to third countries. The plaintiffs alleged that DHS's policy of removing noncitizens to third countries without providing meaningful notice and an opportunity to present fear-based claims violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA), and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The district court found that DHS's policy violated due process, ordering DHS to provide written notice to noncitizens and their counsel in a language they understand, and to provide a meaningful opportunity to present fear-based claims before any third-country removal. The court further ordered DHS to facilitate the return of Plaintiff O.C.G., who had been wrongfully removed to Mexico and then to Guatemala without notice or opportunity to present his fear-based claim. The court clarified that a \"meaningful opportunity\" requires at least ten days' notice before removal and fifteen days to move to reopen proceedings if the fear claim is not initially approved. The court rejected DHS's arguments that the policy was lawful under the INA or that class members had received adequate process through other means, finding that DHS's policy created a constitutional violation by failing to provide proper notice and opportunity before third-country removal.",
    "46186": "This case concerns a legal challenge to the Trump administration's termination of several humanitarian parole programs and suspension of immigration benefit adjudications for individuals paroled through those programs. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14165 directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to \"terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States,\" specifically naming the Parole Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV). The Secretary subsequently issued a Federal Register Notice (published March 25, 2025) terminating the CHNV parole programs and providing that \"the temporary parole period of aliens in the United States under the CHNV parole programs and whose parole has not already expired by April 24, 2025, will terminate on that date.\" The plaintiffs, including individuals paroled through the CHNV, Uniting for Ukraine (U4U), Operation Allies Welcome (OAW), Family Reunification Parole (FRP), Military Parole-in-Place (MPIP), and Central American Minors (CAM) programs, as well as U.S. citizen sponsors, challenged these actions as unlawful under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They argued that the termination of parole and suspension of immigration benefit adjudications violated the statutory parole authority, which requires parole to be granted \"only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit\" (8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A)), and that the agency failed to provide adequate reasoning for its categorical actions. The district court initially granted a preliminary injunction staying the termination of CHNV parole, but the Supreme Court stayed that order on May 30, 2025, allowing the termination to proceed while the case is appealed. The court later granted partial relief, staying the suspension of adjudications for re-parole applications and other immigration benefits for individuals paroled through the U4U, CHNV, and FRP programs, as well as for MPIP applications. The plaintiffs have also filed a motion for partial summary judgment regarding the mass truncation of CHNV parole.",
    "46180": "The case involves a legal challenge to two actions by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in educational settings. On February 14, 2025, the DOE issued a \"Dear Colleague Letter\" that purported to clarify Title VI obligations but in practice imposed new restrictions on educational content related to race and diversity. The Letter claimed that teaching about \"systemic and structural racism\" or promoting \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" could constitute illegal discrimination, and it threatened enforcement actions within 14 days. The Letter also linked to an \"End DEI\" portal for reporting alleged violations.\n\nOn April 3, 2025, the DOE issued a Certification Requirement, requiring states and school districts to certify compliance with the Department's interpretation of Title VI and the Supreme Court's Students for Fair Admissions decision (SFFA), with threats of funding loss, contract suits, and False Claims Act liability for non-compliance.\n\nThe plaintiffs—American Federation of Teachers (AFT), American Sociological Association (ASA), American Federation of Teachers-Maryland (AFT-MD), and Eugene School District 4J (District 4J)—sued the DOE, Linda McMahon (Secretary of Education), and Craig Trainor (Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights), arguing that the Letter and Certification violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), First Amendment, and Fifth Amendment. They claimed the actions were procedurally defective (lacking proper notice-and-comment rulemaking), substantively unlawful (exceeding statutory authority), and unconstitutionally vague and viewpoint discriminatory.\n\nThe court initially stayed the Dear Colleague Letter under Section 705 of the APA on April 24, 2025, but denied relief on the Certification Requirement as it was not properly pleaded in the initial complaint. After the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint adding factual allegations about the Certification Requirement, the court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs on August 14, 2025, vacating both the Dear Colleague Letter and the Certification Requirement. The court held that both actions were final agency actions that violated the APA by failing to follow required procedures, were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded statutory authority, and violated the First and Fifth Amendments by being unconstitutionally vague and viewpoint discriminatory.",
    "46119": "J. Doe 1-26, a group of current and former USAID employees and contractors, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on February 13, 2025, challenging actions taken to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The plaintiffs alleged that Elon Musk, acting as the de facto leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), violated the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution by exercising significant authority over USAID without proper appointment, and violated Separation of Powers principles by dismantling an agency created by Congress without congressional authorization. The complaint detailed how, following President Trump's January 20, 2025, Executive Order establishing DOGE, Musk and DOGE members took control of USAID's digital systems, directed the closure of USAID's headquarters, terminated contracts and personnel, and removed the USAID name from its building. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt these actions, arguing that the dismantling of USAID violated constitutional principles and harmed their employment and privacy interests. On March 18, 2025, Judge Theodore D. Chuang granted a preliminary injunction against Musk and DOGE, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on their constitutional claims. The defendants appealed, and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the injunction pending appeal, later granting a motion to hold the appeal in abeyance while the district court resolves a motion to dismiss. The case is now pending in the district court with the appeal held in abeyance.",
    "46099": "This case concerns a legal challenge to the U.S. government's unilateral suspension of foreign assistance funding following the issuance of Executive Order 14169 on January 20, 2025. The executive order directed a \"90-day pause\" in foreign development assistance to assess programmatic efficiency and consistency with U.S. foreign policy, and the Secretary of State subsequently implemented this directive by suspending all foreign assistance funding. The plaintiffs—nonprofit organizations including AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, Journalism Development Network, and The Center for Victims of Torture, all of which receive foreign aid funding—filed a complaint alleging that the government's actions violated the separation of powers by unilaterally impounding congressionally appropriated funds without following the procedures required by the Impoundment Control Act. The district court granted a temporary restraining order on February 13, 2025, and later issued a preliminary injunction on March 10, 2025, requiring the government to \"make available for obligation the full amount of funds that Congress appropriated for foreign assistance programs in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024\" and to \"not withhold payments or letter of credit drawdowns for work completed prior to February 13, 2025.\" The government appealed, and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the preliminary injunction, holding that the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to enforce the Impoundment Control Act and that the separation of powers claim was improperly framed as a constitutional claim rather than a statutory one. The court emphasized that the plaintiffs' dispute was fundamentally statutory in nature, not constitutional, and that the Comptroller General—not private parties—was the proper entity to enforce the Impoundment Control Act.",
    "46093": "This case challenges President Trump's Executive Order 14163, \"Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program\" (USRAP EO), which suspended refugee admissions indefinitely without a defined end date. The plaintiffs, including individual refugees (proceeding anonymously), refugee resettlement organizations (HIAS, Church World Services, and Lutheran Community Services Northwest), and a sponsor of refugees, filed a complaint alleging the EO violated the Refugee Act of 1980, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and constitutional principles. The USRAP EO suspended all refugee admissions and processing, and the government immediately canceled scheduled refugee travel and suspended funding to resettlement partners, causing immediate harm to refugees and the organizations that assist them.\n\nOn February 28, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the government from implementing the suspension of refugee admissions and processing, and from suspending funding to resettlement partners. The Ninth Circuit partially stayed the injunction on March 25, 2025, clarifying that the injunction would apply only to refugees who had \"arranged and confirmable travel plans to the United States\" on or before January 20, 2025, and who had a \"strong reliance interest\" comparable to the lead plaintiff, Pacito, who had sold his belongings and given up his home in anticipation of travel to the United States. The court issued a second preliminary injunction on March 24, 2025, enjoining the government from terminating cooperative agreements with resettlement partners.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit issued further clarifications on April 21, 2025, and May 9, 2025, narrowing the scope of the injunction to apply only to refugees with a strong reliance interest comparable to Pacito's circumstances, requiring case-by-case determinations of reliance interests. On May 15, 2025, the court rescinded its compliance framework and appointed a magistrate judge to assist with these case-by-case determinations. The court's injunction remains in effect for refugees meeting the Ninth Circuit's criteria, requiring the government to process, admit, and provide resettlement support services to these refugees.",
    "46065": "On February 7, 2025, the State of Washington, State of Minnesota, State of Oregon, and three physicians filed a lawsuit challenging two executive orders issued by President Trump. The first executive order, Executive Order 14,187 (the \"Denial-of-Care Order\"), directed federal agencies to \"immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end\" gender-affirming care for individuals under 19 years old, defining such care as \"chemical and surgical mutilation.\" The second executive order, Executive Order 14,168 (the \"Gender-Ideology Order\"), defined \"sex\" as \"an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female\" and required federal agencies to \"end the Federal funding of gender ideology\" by ensuring \"grant funds do not promote gender ideology.\" The plaintiffs argued these orders violated the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause by discriminating against transgender youth based on transgender status and sex, violated the separation of powers by unilaterally conditioning federal funding on denying gender-affirming care, and violated the Tenth Amendment by usurping states' authority to regulate medical practice. On February 14, 2025, the court granted a temporary restraining order against enforcement of Section 4 of the Denial-of-Care Order, and on February 28, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction against enforcement of Section 4 of the Denial-of-Care Order and Sections 3(e) and (g) of the Gender-Ideology Order. The court held that these provisions \"discriminate based on transgender status and sex\" and \"fail heightened scrutiny\" because they \"do not serve any important government interest\" and are \"not substantially related to their purported purposes.\" The court also found that the orders \"violate the separation of powers\" by \"usurp[ing] Congress's spending, appropriation, and legislative powers\" and \"do[ing] something not even Congress may do.\" The preliminary injunction prohibits Defendants from enforcing Section 4 of the Denial-of-Care Order and Sections 3(e) and (g) of the Gender-Ideology Order \"to condition or withhold federal funding based on the fact that a health care entity or health professional provides gender-affirming care within the Plaintiff States.\" The court denied the plaintiffs' motion for contempt regarding a grant termination by the National Institutes of Health, finding the plaintiffs had not met their burden to show clear and convincing evidence of contempt, but granted plaintiffs' alternative request for expedited discovery.",
    "46028": "On February 4, 2025, Plaintiffs PFLAG, GLMA, and several transgender minors and their parents filed a lawsuit challenging two executive orders issued by President Trump. The first executive order, Executive Order 14,168, directed federal agencies to \"ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology,\" while the second, Executive Order 14,187, required agencies to \"immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\" Plaintiffs argued these orders were unconstitutional for three primary reasons: First, they violated the separation of powers by unilaterally withholding federal funds Congress had appropriated, a power reserved to Congress by the Constitution. Second, they conflicted with Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and Section 1908 of the Public Health Service Act, which prohibit health programs receiving federal funds from discriminating on the basis of sex. Third, they violated the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause by discriminating against transgender individuals. The court granted a temporary restraining order on February 13, 2025, and then a preliminary injunction on March 4, 2025, enjoining defendants from conditioning, withholding, or terminating federal funding based on whether healthcare entities provide gender-affirming medical care to patients under 19. The court found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, as the executive orders impermissibly attempted to amend federal legislation while bypassing Congress's role in the appropriations process, conflicted with federal anti-discrimination statutes, and violated equal protection principles. The defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "46306": "On March 26, 2025, 11 nonprofit legal service providers filed a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement's (ORR) termination of funding for direct legal representation of unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings. The Plaintiffs, who had previously received government funding through a contract administered by Acacia Center for Justice, alleged that the March 21, 2025 termination violated the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), which requires HHS to \"ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that all unaccompanied alien children... have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings,\" and the ORR's Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule, which states that \"ORR shall fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation for certain unaccompanied children.\" Congress had consistently appropriated funds for this purpose, including a recent appropriation through September 2027. The Plaintiffs argued that the termination, which required them to \"immediately stop work\" on active cases without guidance on handling existing representations, would leave thousands of unaccompanied children without legal counsel in immigration proceedings, violating the TVPRA's mandate. The district court granted a Temporary Restraining Order on April 1, 2025, and later a Preliminary Injunction on April 29, 2025, requiring the Government to continue funding legal representation. The Government appealed, arguing the district court lacked jurisdiction because the Plaintiffs' claims sounded in contract and should be brought in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, and that the termination decision was discretionary. The Ninth Circuit denied the Government's request for a stay pending appeal on May 5, 2025, finding the Government had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm absent a stay.",
    "46201": "On February 7, 2025, the U.S. Department of Education terminated approximately $600 million in federal grants previously awarded under two teacher preparation programs—the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) and Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) programs—without providing individualized explanations or notice. The termination letters cited vague \"Department priorities\" as the reason, including references to \"DEI initiatives\" and \"violating Federal civil rights law,\" but did not specify which, if any, of these reasons applied to particular grants. The states of California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Wisconsin (collectively \"Plaintiff States\") sued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging the Department's termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it was arbitrary and capricious, failed to provide a transparent explanation, improperly relied on factors Congress did not intend, and contravened statutory requirements for grant termination. The Plaintiff States argued the Department's action would immediately disrupt teacher workforce pipelines, increase reliance on underqualified educators, and destabilize school systems across the states, causing irreparable harm to students and schools. The Plaintiff States sought declaratory and injunctive relief to vacate and set aside the Department's termination of the grants. The district court granted a temporary restraining order on March 10, 2025, requiring the Department to restore the status quo and refrain from implementing the terminations. The Department appealed, seeking a stay of the order pending appeal. The First Circuit denied the stay, but the Supreme Court granted a stay on April 4, 2025, effectively halting the district court's order pending further review. The case centers on whether the Department's categorical termination of grants under these programs, based on newly announced \"priorities\" without individualized analysis or explanation, violated the APA.",
    "46057": "Plaintiffs, seven transgender active-duty military service members and one transgender individual seeking to enlist, filed a lawsuit challenging Executive Order 14183 (the \"2025 Military Ban\"), which prohibits transgender people from serving in the military. The Military Ban, issued on January 27, 2025, declared that \"expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service\" and that such service is \"inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria.\" The Department of Defense issued implementing guidance on February 26, 2025, which effectively barred transgender service members from continuing to serve and prevented transgender people from enlisting. The plaintiffs argued that the policy violates their constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, First Amendment, and Due Process Clause, and that it amounts to a \"bait and switch\" after they had relied on the previous administration's policy allowing transgender service. The United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Judge Benjamin H. Settle, granted a preliminary injunction on March 27, 2025, enjoining the government from implementing the Military Ban and requiring it to maintain the previous policy allowing transgender service. The government appealed, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied a stay on March 31, 2025, and the Supreme Court also denied a stay on May 6, 2025, allowing the preliminary injunction to remain in effect. The court concluded that the Military Ban \"is not rationally related to achieving military readiness\" and \"fails intermediate scrutiny\" as it discriminates based on transgender status and sex, and the government had \"not demonstrated that the policy is substantially related to achieving military readiness, cohesion, good order, or discipline.\"",
    "45984": "This case challenges President Donald J. Trump's January 27, 2025 Executive Order 14183, which banned transgender individuals from military service, and the Department of Defense's implementing guidance that required transgender service members to serve in their birth sex, denied them medical care for gender dysphoria, and initiated separation proceedings. The plaintiffs, transgender service members with decades of honorable military service and prospective enlistees, alleged the policy violated the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction, finding the policy likely unconstitutional. The court determined the policy classified based on sex (through its treatment of transgender status) and would fail intermediate scrutiny because the government's justifications were unsupported by evidence and based on conjecture. The court rejected the government's argument for deference to military judgment, noting the policy was rushed and lacked any factual basis. The court also found the policy was motivated by animus toward transgender people. The government appealed the preliminary injunction, and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is considering whether to stay the injunction pending appeal. The injunction maintains the status quo of military policy regarding transgender service that existed before Executive Order 14183 was issued, including policies allowing transgender individuals to serve under the same standards as other service members.",
    "45964": "The case challenges President Donald Trump's January 20, 2025 Executive Order titled \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship\" (Executive Order No. 14160), which purports to deny U.S. citizenship to children born in the United States to parents who are either unlawfully present or lawfully present on a temporary basis (unless the father is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident). The Plaintiff States—Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon—along with individual plaintiffs (pregnant noncitizen mothers Cherly Norales Castillo and Alicia Chavarria Lopez) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging that the Executive Order violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause, which states that \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States,\" and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which provides that \"a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, is a citizen of the United States.\" The Plaintiffs argued that the Executive Order would cause them immediate and irreparable harm through loss of federal funding for Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Title IV-E foster care, and the Social Security Administration's Enumeration at Birth program, as well as significant administrative burdens from having to overhaul their eligibility verification systems. The district court granted a Temporary Restraining Order on January 23, 2025, and later a preliminary injunction on February 6, 2025, barring enforcement of the Executive Order nationwide. The Defendants appealed, and the Supreme Court granted a partial stay of the injunction, holding that the universal scope of the injunction was impermissible insofar as it was based on individual and associational plaintiff standing, while leaving open the question of whether a universal injunction might be justified to provide complete relief to the Plaintiff States. The Ninth Circuit later affirmed the district court's grant of a preliminary injunction, concluding that the Executive Order was invalid because it contradicted the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause. The district court's injunction was later modified to limit its scope to provide complete relief to the Plaintiff States, consistent with the Supreme Court's guidance.",
    "45965": "On January 21, 2025, CASA, Inc. and Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP), two immigrant rights organizations with over 175,000 and 680,000 members respectively, along with five pregnant women (Maribel, Juana, Trinidad Garcia, Monica, and Liza) who are members of these organizations, filed a lawsuit challenging Executive Order 14,160, titled \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.\" The Executive Order sought to reinterpret the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause by denying birthright citizenship to children born in the United States to mothers who were either unlawfully present or lawfully but temporarily present in the United States, and whose fathers were not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. The plaintiffs alleged that the Executive Order violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause (\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States\") and 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a), which guarantees birthright citizenship to all persons born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. The plaintiffs, including members of CASA and ASAP who were pregnant or had recently given birth, argued that the Executive Order would deny citizenship to their children, causing irreparable harm including statelessness and denial of constitutional rights and benefits. On February 5, 2025, the district court granted a preliminary injunction nationwide, enjoining the defendants from implementing and enforcing the Executive Order. The government appealed, seeking to narrow the injunction to only the named plaintiffs, but both the district court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the request. The Supreme Court later granted a partial stay, holding that the district court's nationwide injunction likely exceeded federal courts' equitable authority, and directing the district court to limit the injunction to provide \"complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue.\" The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for class certification, which the court granted, certifying a nationwide class of children born in the United States after February 19, 2025, who would be affected by the Executive Order. The court then granted a classwide preliminary injunction, enjoining the defendants from enforcing the Executive Order as to the certified class.",
    "VR-LA-0120": "This case was filed on May 19, 2020, by individual and organizational plaintiffs, including Telisa Clark, Lakeshia Barnett, Martha Christian Green, Crescent City Media Group, and League of Women Voters Louisiana, who were consolidated with Power Coalition for Equity and Justice, Louisiana State Conference of the NAACP, Jane Chandler, Jennifer Harding, Edith Gee Jones, and Jasmine Pogue. The plaintiffs challenged Louisiana's absentee voting requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, alleging violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. They specifically targeted three provisions: (1) the Excuse Requirement, which limits absentee voting to voters who satisfy one of fifteen statutory excuses; (2) the Witness Requirement, which mandates that voters obtain a witness signature on their absentee ballot; and (3) the Cure Prohibition, which denies absentee voters notice of and an opportunity to cure defects in their ballots. The plaintiffs argued these provisions created undue burdens on their right to vote during the pandemic, particularly for voters with underlying health conditions and Black voters who face disproportionate health impacts from COVID-19. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of these provisions for all 2020 elections. The court dismissed the case on June 22, 2020, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to insufficient standing, finding that the plaintiffs' alleged injuries were not \"actual or imminent\" but rather based on \"fears of hypothetical future harm\" that was not \"certainly impending.\" The court later amended its judgment to dismiss the case without prejudice on June 30, 2020. The case was consolidated with Power Coalition for Equity and Justice v. Edwards (Case No. 3:20-cv-00283-SDD-RLB). The plaintiffs were represented by Southern Poverty Law Center, Fair Elections Center, and Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP. The court did not rule on the merits of the constitutional claims, as it determined the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue them.",
    "VR-SC-0078": "In April 2020, a group of South Carolina voters and the Family Unit, Inc. filed a lawsuit challenging two provisions of the state's absentee voting laws. The plaintiffs argued that South Carolina's \"Excuse Requirement\" (S.C. Code Ann. § 7-15-320), which limits who may vote by absentee ballot, and the \"Witness Requirement\" (S.C. Code Ann. § 7-15-220), which requires a witness to sign absentee ballot envelopes, violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Voting Rights Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs contended these requirements forced voters to choose between risking their health during the COVID-19 pandemic or forfeiting their right to vote, particularly impacting African American voters who face disproportionate health risks from the virus.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of these requirements for the June 2020 primary election. The court granted the motion as to the Witness Requirement on May 25, 2020, finding that the requirement imposed an unreasonable burden on voters during the pandemic. The court ordered defendants to cease enforcement of the Witness Requirement for the June 2020 primaries and to inform voters about the change. The court denied the motion regarding the Excuse Requirement, noting that the General Assembly had recently passed legislation allowing all qualified voters to vote by absentee ballot for the June primaries.\n\nThe case was stayed on September 18, 2020, pending resolution of related cases in the South Carolina Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court's stay was based on the fact that the June 2020 primary had already occurred and the plaintiffs' requested relief would no longer have practical effect for the upcoming November general election. The case remains stayed with the defendants and intervenor South Carolina Republican Party seeking summary judgment on the merits.",
    "JC-MD-0017": "The case involves a class action lawsuit filed on April 21, 2020, by pretrial detainees at Prince George's County Jail alleging that the jail's response to the COVID-19 pandemic violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs, including individuals with chronic medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe illness from the virus, alleged that the jail failed to implement basic public health measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including providing adequate soap and cleaning supplies, properly screening for symptoms, and isolating infected individuals. The jail had implemented a universal lockdown requiring prisoners to remain in their cells for 23 hours per day, which plaintiffs argued created an unreasonable risk of serious physical and psychological harm.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought injunctive relief requiring the jail to implement measures to protect prisoners from the spread of the virus, including providing adequate hygiene supplies, properly cleaning the facility, and implementing effective screening and isolation protocols. They also sought a writ of habeas corpus for medically vulnerable prisoners who were at heightened risk of severe illness from the virus.\n\nOn May 21, 2020, the court granted a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) requiring the jail to take specific actions to address the conditions. The court found that the jail had \"evident disregard for the existence of the clear triple-threat: (1) undertesting, and (2) inadequate treatment and isolation of COVID-19 symptomatic detainees, and (3) no plan for those at high risk of COVID-19 complications.\"\n\nOn July 3, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, adding two new claims challenging the jail's use of a generalized lockdown as unconstitutional. The Amended Complaint alleged that the lockdown conditions created an unreasonable risk of serious physical and psychological harm to prisoners in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.",
    "IM-FL-0029": "On April 13, 2020, 34 civil immigration detainees filed a lawsuit challenging conditions at three Florida immigration detention centers (Krome, Broward Transitional Center, and Glades) during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs, all at high risk of severe illness from the virus due to pre-existing medical conditions, alleged that ICE's failure to follow CDC guidelines violated their Fifth Amendment due process rights. They specifically argued that crowded conditions, lack of social distancing, and inadequate hygiene supplies placed them at imminent risk of contracting the virus. The plaintiffs sought release from detention and injunctive relief requiring ICE to comply with CDC guidelines.\n\nThe court initially granted a Temporary Restraining Order on April 30, 2020, directing ICE to follow CDC guidelines, provide adequate soap and cleaning supplies, and reduce the population to 75% capacity at each facility. The court later extended the order and on June 6, 2020, issued a preliminary injunction with additional requirements. The plaintiffs also filed a Motion for Class Certification on May 5, 2020, seeking to represent all current and future civil immigration detainees at the three facilities. The court partially certified the class for conditions-of-confinement claims but denied certification for the habeas corpus claims seeking release.\n\nThe case proceeded through numerous filings, including motions to compel compliance with the Court's orders. The court appointed a Special Master to monitor compliance with the Court's orders. After extensive litigation, the parties reached a settlement agreement on June 28, 2021, which required ICE to follow CDC guidelines, provide vaccinations, maintain population density at 75% capacity or lower, and implement specific health and safety protocols. The settlement was court-approved and is enforceable as an injunction, with ongoing monitoring by the Special Master. The settlement resolved all class-wide claims while preserving the right of class members to pursue individual habeas petitions."
