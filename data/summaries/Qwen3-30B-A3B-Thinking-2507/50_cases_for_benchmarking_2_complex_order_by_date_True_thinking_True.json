    "46290": "On March 5, 2025, Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council, a student organization at Texas A&M University, filed a complaint challenging the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents' resolution banning drag shows on university campuses. The resolution, adopted on February 28, 2025, prohibited \"drag show events\" because the Board claimed they \"parody\" and \"demean women\" through \"mockery\" and \"objectification,\" and violated an executive order on \"gender ideology.\" The Council had already booked the Rudder Theatre for its annual Draggieland event—a fully clothed, student-organized drag performance that had sold out the 750-seat venue for five consecutive years—and the Board's resolution canceled the March 27, 2025, performance. The Council argued the ban violated the First Amendment by engaging in viewpoint discrimination (targeting speech based on its message) and imposing an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech. The Council sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to allow the event to proceed. On March 24, 2025, Senior United States District Judge Lee H. Rosenthal granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, finding the Council demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm without the injunction, and that the public interest favored the injunction. The court ruled that Draggieland constituted protected expressive conduct, the ban was viewpoint-based discrimination, and the resolution was unconstitutionally vague. The injunction prohibited the Board from enforcing the ban and allowed the Draggieland performance to proceed as scheduled. The defendants filed a notice of appeal on March 28, 2025, and a motion to stay the injunction pending appeal, which the court had not yet ruled on as of the documents provided. The Council was represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE).",
    "46324": "In March 2025, Inclusiv, Inc., a nonprofit organization that partners with credit unions to promote financial security and independence for low- and moderate-income communities, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA Acting Deputy Administrator W.C. McIntosh, and Citibank, N.A. The case (Case No. 1:25-cv-00948) arose after the EPA froze funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) program and attempted to terminate Inclusiv's $1.87 billion grant award under the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) program. The GGRF program, created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provided nearly $27 billion in competitive grants for clean energy and pollution reduction initiatives.\n\nInclusiv received its grant award in April 2024, with funds deposited into its Citibank account pursuant to an Account Control Agreement that required Citibank to comply with Inclusiv's instructions for fund disbursement. On March 11, 2025, the EPA issued a termination letter purporting to end Inclusiv's grant, citing unspecified \"material deficiencies\" related to \"program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse\" without providing evidence or allowing Inclusiv an opportunity to respond. The EPA had requested detailed information from Inclusiv on March 4, 2025, but issued the termination letter before receiving Inclusiv's response.\n\nInclusiv alleged that the EPA's actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Inflation Reduction Act, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, the Anti-Deficiency Act, EPA's own regulations (2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339-342), and constitutional provisions related to separation of powers and due process. The complaint also alleged that Citibank violated its contractual obligations under the Account Control Agreement by refusing to disburse funds as instructed by Inclusiv.\n\nThe case was consolidated with Case No. 25-cv-698, which involved similar claims by other GGRF grant recipients. Inclusiv filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on April 1, 2025, seeking to enjoin the EPA from giving effect to the termination letter and to compel Citibank to comply with its contractual obligations. The motion was denied as moot on April 16, 2025, following the court's consolidation order. The case was assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, who presided over the consolidation of the case with the related matter (Case No. 25-cv-698). The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that the EPA's termination was void and an injunction to restore Inclusiv's access to its grant funds.",
    "46391": "On April 11, 2025, five international students in F-1 visa status—S.Y., Z.D., Y.W., H.G., and W.X.—filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Acting Field Office Director of ICE in San Francisco, and the President of the United States. The students, all current students or employed under post-graduate Optional Practical Training (OPT) authorization, alleged that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security unlawfully terminated their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records without lawful authority. The students, who have no criminal history that would justify termination of their status under immigration regulations, were informed that their SEVIS records were terminated based on the reason \"Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked,\" despite their status being fully compliant with F-1 visa requirements. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the terminations were unlawful, restoration of their F-1 status, and an injunction preventing enforcement actions against them. On April 16, 2025, they filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which was granted by Judge Noel Wise on April 17, 2025, enjoining the defendants from arresting, detaining, transferring, or imposing legal effects related to the SEVIS termination. The TRO was extended for an additional 14 days on April 25, 2025, when the case was reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White. The defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on July 21, 2025, seeking to stay the injunction pending appeal.",
    "46509": "On April 29, 2025, The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, its Board of Directors, and three individual Board members (Laura G. Ross, Thomas E. Rothman, and Diane Kaplan) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the President's purported termination of their Board membership. The complaint alleged that an email dated April 28, 2025, from the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel purporting to terminate the three Board members violated the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (47 U.S.C. § 396 et seq.), which established the Corporation as a private nonprofit entity insulated from governmental interference. The Act specifically provides that the Corporation \"will not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government\" and that \"the members of the Board shall not, by reason of such membership, be deemed to be officers or employees of the United States.\" The complaint further alleged that the Act prohibits any government entity from exercising \"any direction, supervision, or control over\" the Corporation. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the email was legally ineffective and an injunction preventing Defendants from taking any action to implement the purported termination or interfere with the Corporation's governance. The Plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order, which the Court converted to a motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court, Judge Randolph D. Moss, denied the motion on June 8, 2025, finding that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm. The Court reasoned that the Public Broadcasting Act did not expressly prohibit the President from removing Board members, and that under District of Columbia nonprofit corporation law, the President as the appointing authority could remove directors unless the Corporation's bylaws provided otherwise. The Court noted that the Corporation had since amended its bylaws to require a two-thirds vote of remaining directors to remove any member, and that the Corporation could continue functioning even with fewer than the statutory number of directors through a \"designated body\" provision. The Court also found that Plaintiffs failed to establish that the President's purported termination would cause irreparable harm, as the Corporation could continue operations through existing governance mechanisms. The Plaintiffs later voluntarily dismissed Laura G. Ross and Thomas E. Rothman as parties.",
    "46590": "On April 7, 2025, Harry Wiley, a coal miner diagnosed with coal workers' pneumoconiosis (black lung disease), filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., alleging violations of the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiff, who had applied for a job transfer under Part 90 of the Mine Act to work in a low-dust environment, alleged that the Department's termination of the Respiratory Health Division at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in Morgantown, West Virginia—responsible for administering the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) and Part 90—deprived him and thousands of similarly situated miners of critical medical screening and job transfer rights. The complaint asserted that the Department's actions violated statutory duties under 30 U.S.C. § 843, 30 U.S.C. § 811(a)(7), and 30 U.S.C. § 811(a)(9), constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act, and violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. On May 13, 2025, Judge Irene C. Berger granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering the Department to rescind the reduction-in-force notices affecting the Respiratory Health Division and restore the CWHSP and Part 90 programs to ensure continuous health surveillance and job transfer protections for coal miners. The court found the plaintiff likely to succeed on the merits, that he would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction, and that the public interest favored preserving the statutory protections for miners. The court further ordered the Department to submit written certification of compliance within 20 days and set the security requirement for the injunction at zero. The case remains pending, with the court directing the parties to proceed toward a dispositive motion deadline of October 27, 2025.",
    "46605": "On May 17, 2025, Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan, a Venezuelan citizen detained at the Desert View Annex (associated with the Adelanto ICE Processing Center), filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Represented by attorney Joshua Jonathan Schroeder, Arevalo alleged he was detained without proper notice or warrant and sought to challenge the government's enforcement of Proclamation No. 10903, which authorized the immediate removal of certain Venezuelan citizens under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). The plaintiff argued that the government's implementation of the Proclamation violated due process by failing to provide adequate notice before removal. On May 19, 2025, Judge John W. Holcomb granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) and certified a class of noncitizens in the Central District of California who were subject to the Proclamation. The court later issued a preliminary injunction on June 2, 2025, enjoining the government from removing or transferring class members under the AEA without providing adequate notice. The court also certified a class for the limited purpose of determining the required notice period, excluding those who had filed individual habeas petitions before the case began. The government subsequently appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on August 1, 2025. The plaintiff later filed an ex parte application for a writ of habeas corpus after being granted asylum at an immigration hearing, but the court denied this application, noting that the government could lawfully detain him under the Immigration and Nationality Act while appealing the asylum decision. The court ordered the government to file status reports regarding the appeal every 30 days.",
    "46635": "On May 8, 2025, President Donald J. Trump fired Dr. Carla D. Hayden, the Librarian of Congress, and on May 10, 2025, purportedly terminated Shira Perlmutter as Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office. The President also purportedly appointed Todd Blanche, Deputy Attorney General, as acting Librarian of Congress, and Blanche purportedly appointed Paul Perkins as acting Register of Copyrights. Perlmutter, represented by Democracy Forward Foundation and Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP, filed a complaint on May 22, 2025, arguing that the President's actions violated 17 U.S.C. § 701(a), which grants the Librarian of Congress exclusive authority to appoint and remove the Register of Copyrights, and the Appointments Clause of the Constitution (U.S. Const. Art. II, § 2, cl. 2). She sought a preliminary injunction to prevent Defendants from interfering with her lawful appointment. The court denied her motion for a temporary restraining order on May 28, 2025, and later denied her motion for a preliminary injunction on July 30, 2025, holding that she failed to establish irreparable harm. The court found that the temporary loss of her \"statutory right to function\" as Register of Copyrights was not irreparable harm in a government personnel case, as such harm could be remedied through reinstatement if she prevailed on the merits. Perlmutter appealed, but the court denied her emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal on August 20, 2025. The case is now pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
    "45143": "Ashley and Sean Willey, parents of students at Sweetwater County School District #1 in Wyoming, filed a federal lawsuit alleging that the school district violated their constitutional rights by implementing a policy requiring school staff to conceal from parents when students requested to be treated as the opposite sex with alternate names and pronouns (Parent Concealment Policy), while also requiring staff to use those alternate names and pronouns when interacting with students (Preferred Names Policy). The Willeys alleged that this policy violated their fundamental parental rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to direct their children's upbringing and mental health decisions, as well as their First Amendment rights to free exercise of religion and free speech. Specifically, they claimed the school district had treated their daughter A.S. as male with male pronouns without their knowledge, required staff to deceive them by using A.S.'s legal name when speaking with them but using the male name/pronouns at school, and interfered with their religious beliefs prohibiting deception about their children's gender identity. The case was filed on April 20, 2023, with the plaintiffs represented by the Child & Parental Rights Campaign. A motion for preliminary injunction was granted in part on June 30, 2023, enjoining the district from requiring staff to lie about student requests for alternate names or pronouns. The plaintiffs later filed a First Amended Complaint, and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied as moot. The defendants later filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted on April 28, 2025, dismissing all claims against the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on May 23, 2025, which was docketed as Case No. 25-8027.",
    "PH-IL-0002": "On May 10, 2016, current and former residents of the Alexander County Housing Authority (ACHA) filed a class action lawsuit alleging systemic racial and familial status discrimination. The plaintiffs, represented by Hughes, Socol, Piers, Resnick & Dym, Ltd. and the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, asserted that ACHA maintained racially segregated housing by concentrating African-American residents in the deteriorating McBride and Elmwood developments while preserving other developments like Connell Smith in satisfactory condition. The complaint alleged that ACHA's practices violated the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3604), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003. The plaintiffs also claimed ACHA charged residents more than 30% of their adjusted income for rent in violation of the Brooke Amendment to the U.S. Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 1437a), and prohibited families with children from living in certain developments despite those developments not qualifying as \"housing for older persons\" under federal law.\n\nThe case proceeded through multiple amended complaints, with the third amended complaint filed on February 13, 2017, defining three subclasses: African-American residents of McBride and Elmwood, families with children in those developments, and residents who paid excessive rent. After settlement negotiations, the represented plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice on July 27, 2017, with each party bearing its own attorney fees. The court dismissed the claims of Plaintiffs Lee and Cornelius for failure to prosecute on August 1, 2017, and dismissed Plaintiff Childress on September 12, 2017, after she failed to appear at a status conference. The court granted the stipulation of dismissal for the represented plaintiffs on September 12, 2017, with Chief Judge Michael J. Reagan noting the dismissal was appropriate and directing the case to be closed.",
    "16518": "The United States filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina on April 14, 2022, alleging that the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) violated the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to protect youth at the Broad River Road Complex (BRRC) from harm. This action followed a DOJ investigation that identified two primary constitutional violations: (1) DJJ's failure to protect youth from youth-on-youth violence and excessive force by staff, and (2) DJJ's use of prolonged isolation for punitive purposes rather than legitimate safety concerns. The DOJ's February 2020 and April 2022 investigation reports documented frequent youth-on-youth assaults, staff using excessive force (including choking, punching, and twisting limbs), and youth being isolated for hours or days for minor infractions such as using profanity or being \"out of place.\" \n\nRather than proceeding with litigation, the parties entered into a settlement agreement dated April 13, 2022, which the court conditionally dismissed on April 20, 2022, retaining jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. The settlement requires DJJ to implement specific reforms within four years, including: (1) revising staffing patterns to ensure adequate supervision; (2) improving physical plant security and video surveillance; (3) implementing positive behavior management programs; (4) revising use of force policies to prohibit punitive isolation and require de-escalation techniques; (5) establishing a multidisciplinary team to review isolation placements; and (6) developing improved mental health protocols. The agreement includes a Subject Matter Expert who will monitor compliance, submit biannual reports, and provide technical assistance. The settlement is enforceable by the court for five years, with the possibility of earlier termination upon demonstration of substantial compliance with constitutional standards. The court retained jurisdiction to reinstate the case should DJJ materially breach any provisions of the agreement.",
    "46815": "The United States filed an indictment on May 21, 2025, against Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, charging him with conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and illegal transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v) and (B)(i) and 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) and (B)(i). The government sought pretrial detention, arguing the case involved a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(1)(E) and that Abrego posed a serious risk of flight or would obstruct justice. Magistrate Judge Barbara D. Holmes denied the government's motion for detention, finding the government failed to establish by a preponderance of evidence that the case involved a minor victim under the statute's meaning, and that there were conditions of release that would reasonably assure Abrego's appearance and community safety. The government appealed to District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr., who affirmed the Magistrate Judge's decision. While finding the government had shown by a preponderance that Abrego's crimes involved minor victims, the District Judge determined the government failed to meet the higher burden of showing no conditions could reasonably assure Abrego's appearance or community safety. Abrego was released on conditions including third-party custody, travel restrictions, electronic monitoring, and prohibitions on contact with cooperating witnesses. The case was set for trial on January 27, 2026.",
    "46755": "On July 1, 2025, the City of Columbus, Ohio; Mayor and City Council of Baltimore; City of Chicago; Doctors for America; and Main Street Alliance filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland challenging the \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability\" rule (90 Fed. Reg. 27,074), which was scheduled to take effect on August 25, 2025. The plaintiffs, represented by Democracy Forward Foundation, alleged that the rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act by implementing provisions that would reduce access to affordable health insurance, increase premiums, and create barriers to enrollment, thereby causing significant financial harm to the cities through increased uncompensated care costs and harm to small businesses and medical providers. The complaint challenged nine specific provisions of the rule, arguing they were contrary to law or arbitrary and capricious. After a hearing on August 14, 2025, Judge Brendan A. Hurson granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for a stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705. The court stayed seven provisions of the rule: the imposition of a $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees; revocation of guaranteed insurance coverage for individuals with past-due premiums; the failure-to-reconcile policy; eligibility verification for special enrollment periods; requirements to verify household income inconsistencies; changes to de minimis ranges for actuarial value calculations; and changes to self-attestation of projected income. The court declined to stay two provisions: changes to the premium adjustment percentage calculation and elimination of the 60-day extension for resolving income inconsistencies. The stay remains in effect pending a final ruling on the merits of the case.",
    "46576": "The State of New York, along with 15 other states, the District of Columbia, and Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon on April 10, 2025. The states challenged the Department's abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for liquidating education stabilization funds (ESF) that had been granted to them under federal pandemic relief programs. The Department had previously approved extensions allowing the states to access funds through March 2026 for pandemic-related educational programs, including tutoring, infrastructure improvements, and support for students with learning loss. On March 28, 2025, the Department rescinded these extensions without providing a reasoned explanation, declaring that the pandemic had ended and extensions were no longer justified. The states argued that this action was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the policy change, ignored substantial reliance interests, and contradicted the Department's own prior approvals. The district court granted a preliminary injunction on May 6, 2025, and again on June 3, 2025, enjoining the Department from enforcing the rescission and requiring it to process liquidation requests without delay. The Department appealed the injunction to the Second Circuit, which denied its motion for a stay pending appeal on June 20, 2025, finding that the Department had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm.",
    "46637": "National Public Radio, Inc. and three Colorado-based public radio stations (Aspen Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio, and KSUT Public Radio) filed a lawsuit challenging Executive Order 14290, issued by President Donald Trump on May 1, 2025, titled \"Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media.\" The plaintiffs, who receive federal funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), argue that the Executive Order violates the First Amendment by retaliating against and discriminating based on viewpoint regarding NPR's journalism, and violates the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The Order directs CPB and federal agencies to cease all federal funding to NPR and PBS, and to prohibit local public radio stations from using federal funds to acquire NPR programming. The plaintiffs contend that the Order contravenes the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which explicitly prohibits government interference with CPB's funding decisions and requires that CPB distribute funds based on neutral criteria. The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the Executive Order is unlawful, a permanent injunction preventing its implementation, and vacatur of any agency actions implementing the Order. The case is currently pending before Judge Randolph D. Moss in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, with the parties having filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The complaint also references a related case, Corporation for Public Broadcasting v. Trump, which challenges the President's attempt to remove CPB board members.",
    "46340": "On March 27, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14251, which excluded numerous federal agencies and subdivisions from the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), stripping federal employees at these agencies of collective bargaining rights under Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code. The order excluded major departments including the Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others. Six labor unions representing over a million federal employees—American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United (NNOC/NNU), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), National Association of Government Employees (NAGE), and National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE)—filed a lawsuit on April 3, 2025, alleging the executive order violated the First Amendment by retaliating against unions for criticizing the administration's policies. The unions specifically pointed to a White House Fact Sheet released with the order that described \"certain Federal unions\" as having \"declared war on President Trump's agenda\" and stated the \"largest Federal union describes itself as 'fighting back' against Trump,\" while promising \"President Trump supports constructive partnerships with unions who work with him.\" The unions also alleged the order was ultra vires, violated Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection rights, and abrogated property rights in federal contracts. The Northern District of California granted a preliminary injunction on June 24, 2025, finding the unions had demonstrated a serious question regarding First Amendment retaliation, as the order appeared to target unions based on their political opposition to the administration. The government immediately appealed, and the Ninth Circuit granted a stay of the injunction on August 1, 2025, pending resolution of the appeal. The district court's preliminary injunction had ordered the government to cease implementing the executive order's exclusion of agencies from the FSLMRS, but the stay prevented enforcement of that order while the appeal was pending.",
    "46805": "On July 21, 2025, multiple nonprofit organizations that provide critical services to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and homeless individuals filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its officials, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and its officials. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel including the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island and Democracy Forward Foundation, alleged that the agencies had unlawfully imposed new conditions on federal grant awards. These conditions required grantees to certify they would not \"promote 'gender ideology' as defined in Executive Order 14168,\" would not operate programs that promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEI/DEIA) in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws, and would not fund or promote elective abortions. The plaintiffs argued these conditions violated the Administrative Procedure Act because they were not authorized by statute, were arbitrary and capricious, and conflicted with binding regulations. They also claimed the conditions violated the First Amendment by chilling protected speech, the Fifth Amendment due to vagueness, and the Spending Clause by imposing unauthorized conditions on federal funding. The plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to prevent enforcement of the conditions, which the court granted on July 28, 2025, and later revised on August 7, 2025 to expand the scope of the relief. The court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits and that they would suffer irreparable harm without the order. The temporary restraining order prohibited HUD and HHS from enforcing the challenged conditions on Continuum of Care grants, Community Development Block Grants, and State Domestic Violence Coalition grants, and required defendants to treat any prior enforcement of these conditions as \"null, void, and rescinded.\" The case remains pending, with a hearing scheduled for September 4, 2025 on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.",
    "46375": "Southern Education Foundation, Inc. (\"SEF\"), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with over 150 years of history advancing equitable education policies in the Southern United States, filed a lawsuit challenging the United States Department of Education's termination of its federal grant to operate the Equity Assistance Center for the Southern region (\"EAC-South\"). SEF had been awarded a five-year, $8.6 million grant in October 2022 to provide technical assistance to public schools in the South addressing educational disparities based on race, national origin, sex, and religion, with a specific focus on resolving the 130 open federal school desegregation cases in the region. On February 13, 2025, the Department abruptly terminated SEF's grant, citing that the grant \"provides funding for programs that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion ('DEI') initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another protected characteristic,\" and that it \"conflict[ed] with the Department's policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education.\" The Department's termination letter, which provided no factual or legal basis for the termination, was issued shortly after President Trump signed Executive Order 14151, which directed federal agencies to terminate \"equity-related\" grants or contracts. SEF filed a complaint alleging the Department's termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Fifth Amendment (due process), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, First Amendment, and the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. SEF also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to restore the grant, which the court granted on May 21, 2025, finding that the Department's termination was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the termination, used a boilerplate letter applicable to multiple grantees, and failed to follow required procedures under the General Education Provisions Act. The court ordered the Department to reinstate the EAC-South grant in accordance with the terms in place prior to the termination and to provide reimbursement for outstanding expenses incurred between February 13, 2025, and the court's order. The Department subsequently filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
    "46284": "Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old lawful permanent resident and Columbia University junior, filed a complaint challenging the federal government's efforts to detain and deport her based on her participation in pro-Palestine student protests. Ms. Chung was arrested on March 5, 2025, during a protest at Barnard College (affiliated with Columbia) related to university disciplinary actions against students supporting Palestinian rights. She was charged with obstruction of governmental administration—a common protest-related charge—and released the same day with no criminal convictions. Within days, government officials informed her counsel that her permanent resident status was being revoked under a policy (the \"Rubio Determination\") that uses the Foreign Policy Ground of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(4)(C)(i)) to target noncitizens for deportation based on their speech or association related to pro-Palestine protests. The government executed a search warrant at her Columbia dormitory, sought her arrest via an administrative warrant, and made public statements linking her arrest to her protected speech. Ms. Chung filed a complaint on March 24, 2025, alleging violations of the First Amendment (freedom of speech), Fifth Amendment (due process), the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Immigration and Nationality Act. She sought a temporary restraining order to prevent her detention and deportation. On March 25, 2025, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald granted a temporary restraining order enjoining the government from detaining or transferring her. On June 5, 2025, Judge Buchwald granted a preliminary injunction with three key provisions: (1) enjoining defendants from detaining or arresting Ms. Chung; (2) enjoining defendants from transferring her from the jurisdiction; and (3) requiring 72 hours' advance notice if defendants seek to detain her for any reason other than pursuing removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(4)(C). The government filed an interlocutory appeal on July 3, 2025, to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.",
    "46735": "The Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools (a public school district in New Mexico) filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon, and President Donald J. Trump, challenging the termination of a $6 million federal grant awarded under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The grant, which was part of a $1 billion mental health funding package enacted by Congress in 2022, had enabled the school district to establish comprehensive mental health services for approximately 2,500 students, including hiring additional mental health professionals and creating wellness rooms that served 40% of the student population. The Department of Education terminated the grant on April 29, 2025, citing that the mental health programs \"violate the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; conflict with the Department's policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; undermine the well-being of the students these programs are intended to help; or constitute an inappropriate use of federal funds.\" The school district argued the termination violated the First Amendment (free speech), Fifth Amendment (due process), and the Spending Clause of the Constitution, and was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedures Act. The district court denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, ruling that the case belonged in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, which provides exclusive jurisdiction over contract claims against the federal government. The court dismissed the complaint without prejudice, concluding the plaintiff's core claim was for the payment of funds under a grant agreement, not a constitutional or statutory challenge to agency action.",
    "46342": "The Association for Education Finance and Policy (AEFP) and the Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP) filed a complaint on April 4, 2025, against the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, alleging that ED's termination of contracts for the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), elimination of 90% of IES staff, and termination of remote access to restricted-use data violated the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (ESRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs, which rely on IES data for their research and policy work, sought a preliminary injunction to halt these actions and restore IES's programs. On June 3, 2025, Judge Trevor N. McFadden denied the motion for preliminary injunction, ruling that the plaintiffs' claims constituted a \"programmatic challenge\" rather than discrete challenges to specific agency actions. The court held that the APA was designed to address \"circumscribed [and] discrete\" improper actions, not to \"vindicate programmatic challenges to day-to-day agency operations,\" citing precedent including Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation. The court found that the plaintiffs had bundled multiple actions as part of a broader challenge to \"dismantle\" IES, which was beyond the scope of the APA. The plaintiffs subsequently amended their complaint to focus on six specific terminations but the preliminary injunction was already denied.",
    "46322": "On March 31, 2025, several voter advocacy organizations filed a lawsuit challenging Executive Order 14,248 issued by President Trump on March 25, 2025. The plaintiffs, including the League of United Latin American Citizens, Secure Families Initiative, Arizona Students' Association, and the League of Women Voters organizations, alleged that the Executive Order unlawfully exceeded presidential authority by directing federal agencies to implement changes to election procedures. Specifically, the plaintiffs challenged Section 2(a) of the Executive Order, which directed the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to require documentary proof of citizenship on the national voter registration form, and Section 2(d), which directed federal agencies to \"assess citizenship\" before providing the voter registration form to recipients of public assistance programs. The plaintiffs argued that these provisions violated the separation of powers by usurping authority reserved to Congress under the Elections Clause of the Constitution and to the bipartisan EAC under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and Help America Vote Act (HAVA). On April 24, 2025, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly granted a preliminary injunction against the implementation of Sections 2(a) and 2(d) of the Executive Order, finding the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction, and that the balance of equities favored the plaintiffs. The court denied the injunction as to Sections 2(b), 7(a), and 7(b) of the Executive Order, finding the plaintiffs had not established standing to challenge those provisions. The court's ruling affirmed that the President lacks authority to dictate changes to the Federal Form, which Congress has entrusted to the EAC through a bipartisan rulemaking process, and that the NVRA prohibits federal agencies from requiring citizenship documentation before providing the voter registration form.",
    "46510": "This case challenges the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the Head Start program, a federally funded early childhood education program serving low-income children across the United States. The plaintiffs—four state Head Start associations (Washington, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Pennsylvania) and two parent-led organizations (Family Forward Oregon and Parent Voices Oakland)—allege that the administration's actions violate the Constitution, federal statutes, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The core challenged actions include the abrupt closure of half of the Office of Head Start's regional offices and the layoff of approximately 60% of its staff on April 1, 2025, which has disrupted program administration and technical support. Additionally, the administration issued a \"DEIA Ban\" requiring Head Start agencies to certify they do not \"advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology\" in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws, and a March 14, 2025 letter prohibiting funding for \"diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.\" The plaintiffs argue these actions are unconstitutional because they are unconstitutionally vague (violating the Fifth Amendment), suppress protected speech (violating the First Amendment), and violate the Separation of Powers and Spending Clause by allowing the Executive Branch to dictate how Congress has appropriated funds. The plaintiffs further allege the actions violate the Head Start Act, which requires agencies to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services, support children with disabilities, and serve diverse communities, as well as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to prevent the implementation of these policies, arguing that without relief, hundreds of thousands of children and families will immediately lose access to critical early childhood education, health services, and childcare support, causing irreparable harm to children's development and parents' ability to work and pursue education. The case is pending before Judge Ricardo S. Martinez in the Western District of Washington.",
    "46734": "In May 2025, Roman Catholic clergy led by the Archbishop of Seattle, the Bishop of Yakima, and the Bishop of Spokane filed a lawsuit challenging Washington State's Senate Bill 5375 (SB 5375), which took effect on July 27, 2025. The law required clergy to report suspected child abuse or neglect learned during the Sacrament of Confession, a religious practice protected by the sacramental seal that forbids priests from disclosing any information heard in confession. The Catholic Church teaches that violating this seal would result in automatic excommunication and risk eternal damnation, creating a conflict where priests would face either religious punishment or criminal penalties under state law. The plaintiffs argued SB 5375 violated the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause by burdening religious practice and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause by singling out clergy for reporting obligations while exempting other groups, such as attorneys working at institutions of higher education, from similar requirements. On July 18, 2025, U.S. District Judge David G. Estudillo granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, ruling that SB 5375 is likely unconstitutional under the Free Exercise Clause. The injunction prevents Washington from enforcing SB 5375 as it applies to information learned through the Sacrament of Confession against the plaintiffs and all Roman Catholic priests in Washington who fall under the administration of the plaintiffs' dioceses. The court did not address the plaintiffs' Church Autonomy Doctrine and Establishment Clause claims at this stage.",
    "46678": "The State of California, represented by Governor Gavin Newsom, filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's invocation of 10 U.S.C. § 12406 to federalize 4,000 members of the California National Guard without the Governor's consent. The federal government had deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles following protests that arose in response to immigration enforcement actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The State argued that the President's actions violated the statute because none of the three statutory conditions for federalization (invasion, rebellion, or inability to execute laws) were met, the orders were not properly issued \"through the governor\" as required by statute, and the deployment violated the Tenth Amendment by unconstitutionally usurping state authority over its militia. The District Court for the Northern District of California granted a temporary restraining order on June 12, 2025, finding the President's actions \"illegal—both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment\" and ordering the federal government to return control of the National Guard to the Governor. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted a stay of the restraining order pending appeal, finding that the President likely had statutory authority under § 12406(3) to federalize the National Guard, as the protests had interfered with federal officers' ability to execute the law. The case remains pending on appeal, with the district court having scheduled a bench trial to address the merits of the claims.",
    "46287": "On March 25, 2025, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) filed a lawsuit challenging the federal government's termination of approximately $400 million in grants and contracts to Columbia University, which the government cited as inconsistent with agency priorities following concerns about antisemitism on campus. The government also demanded Columbia implement specific reforms as a precondition for continued funding. The plaintiffs, labor unions representing faculty at Columbia, sought a preliminary injunction to restore the funding, arguing the government violated the Administrative Procedure Act, First Amendment, and other constitutional provisions by failing to follow required procedures and coercing Columbia to suppress protected speech.\n\nThe court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed the case for lack of standing. The court found that the plaintiffs lacked standing because the grants were awarded to Columbia University, not to the plaintiffs or their members, and the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a direct injury traceable to the government's actions. The court noted that Columbia itself had been planning reforms for months before the government's demands, and Columbia's announced actions did not fully comply with the government's requests. The court also observed that Columbia had committed to providing salary coverage for affected faculty and had other resources to mitigate the impact of the funding termination. The court concluded that the plaintiffs could not establish a sufficient injury to themselves or their members to support their claims, and therefore the case was dismissed without prejudice.",
    "46580": "On May 7, 2025, 16 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Transportation, Secretary Sean Duffy, the Federal Highway Administration, and Acting Administrator Gloria M. Shepherd. The plaintiffs challenged the defendants' suspension of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, which was established by Congress in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to distribute $5 billion for strategic deployment of EV charging infrastructure across the country. The defendants implemented this suspension following President Trump's January 2025 \"Unleashing American Energy\" Executive Order, which directed agencies to \"immediately pause the disbursement of funds\" for EV charging infrastructure under the IIJA. On February 6, 2025, the Federal Highway Administration issued a letter rescinding its NEVI guidance and revoking all state plans for fiscal years 2022-2025, effectively halting the program. The states argued this action violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by exceeding statutory authority, acting arbitrarily, and failing to follow required procedures, and violated constitutional separation of powers and Take Care Clause principles by unlawfully withholding congressionally appropriated funds. On June 24, 2025, Judge Tana Lin granted a preliminary injunction in part, ordering the defendants to restore the state plans and allow obligation of funds for most of the plaintiff states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin), while denying relief to the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont due to insufficient evidence of irreparable harm. The injunction was stayed for seven days to allow for potential appeal, and took effect on July 2, 2025.",
    "46259": "This case involves eight Columbia University students who filed a lawsuit challenging the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce's request for student disciplinary records and the federal government's threats to withhold funding from Columbia University. The students allege that the government's actions constitute unconstitutional \"jawboning\" (using economic pressure to coerce private entities to suppress protected speech), violating their First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs claim that the Committee's February 13, 2025, letter demanding student disciplinary records for specific campus incidents—such as protests related to the Gaza conflict—is overbroad, not substantially related to any legitimate legislative purpose, and intended to chill protected speech about Palestine. They also challenge the federal government's March 13, 2025, letter demanding Columbia University adopt specific policies, including a mask ban, disciplinary changes, and a definition of antisemitism that they argue suppresses legitimate criticism of Israel. The students assert they have already experienced doxing, harassment, and increased self-censorship due to previous disclosures of their records to the government. The case began with a March 13, 2025, complaint, followed by a motion for a temporary restraining order that was denied on April 4, 2025, with the court granting leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on April 18, 2025, and all defendants subsequently filed motions to dismiss. The case is currently before Judge Arun Subramanian, who has already ruled that the congressional defendants are shielded from suit by the Speech or Debate Clause, and the case continues to be litigated on other grounds.",
    "46557": "On May 5, 2025, nineteen states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit challenging the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) \"March 27 Directive\" to terminate 10,000 employees and reorganize HHS agencies. The states alleged that the directive violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, and also violated constitutional principles of separation of powers and the appropriations clause. The directive, announced on March 27, 2025, and implemented with termination notices sent to employees on April 1, 2025, would have eliminated critical public health programs and services the states rely on, including CDC laboratory services, the Division of Reproductive Health, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Center for Tobacco Products, the Office of Head Start, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.\n\nThe states filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on May 9, 2025, seeking to halt implementation of the directive at these specific agencies. On July 1, 2025, District Judge Melissa R. DuBose granted the preliminary injunction, finding the states demonstrated a likelihood of success on their APA claims. The court determined the directive was arbitrary and capricious because it was implemented without adequate analysis, failed to consider the consequences of the sudden reorganization, and was contrary to law because it prevented HHS from fulfilling its statutory obligations. The injunction barred HHS from implementing the planned reductions in force or restructuring at the specified agencies. The defendants filed a motion to vacate the preliminary injunction and for a stay pending appeal, but Judge DuBose denied both on July 18, 2025. The case is now on appeal to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "46511": "Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit challenging the Corporation for National and Community Service's (AmeriCorps) abrupt termination of over 1,000 AmeriCorps programs and the removal of more than 750 National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) members from service on April 25, 2025. The states alleged that AmeriCorps violated the Administrative Procedure Act by making these significant changes to service delivery without first engaging in the required public notice-and-comment rulemaking. This violation stemmed from a specific statutory provision in the 2024 Appropriations Act requiring AmeriCorps to make any significant changes to program requirements, service delivery, or policy only through public notice and comment rulemaking. The states argued that these terminations would cause irreparable harm to vulnerable populations they served, including veterans, individuals with disabilities, students in underserved communities, and those impacted by natural disasters. On June 5, 2025, U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman granted a preliminary injunction requiring AmeriCorps to restore the terminated programs and members in the plaintiff states and to comply with the notice-and-comment rulemaking requirement before making any significant changes to service delivery. The court later modified the injunction on July 10, 2025, to apply only to the plaintiff states, in accordance with the Supreme Court's ruling in Trump v. CASA that universal injunctions are impermissible. The court denied the states' request to enjoin the reduction in AmeriCorps staff, finding they lacked standing to challenge those actions.",
    "46350": "The American Library Association (ALA) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (AFSCME) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on April 7, 2025, challenging actions taken by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and other federal defendants. The case arose after President Trump issued Executive Order 14238 on March 14, 2025, directing IMLS to \"reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law\" and \"eliminate non-statutorily required activities.\" The plaintiffs alleged that Acting Director Keith Sonderling implemented the executive order by placing all IMLS staff on administrative leave, terminating most employees, canceling grants, and firing the Board of the agency. The plaintiffs argued these actions violated the Museum and Library Services Act (MLSA), the separation of powers, the Take Care Clause, and the First Amendment. They sought a preliminary injunction to halt the dismantling of IMLS, restore staff, and reinstate grant funding. The court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction on June 6, 2025, concluding that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits due to jurisdictional issues. The court held that the plaintiffs' claims regarding grant terminations were properly subject to the Tucker Act, which vests exclusive jurisdiction over such claims in the Court of Federal Claims, and that the plaintiffs' broader challenge to the dismantling of IMLS was not a \"discrete final agency action\" reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act. The court's order denied the plaintiffs' motion without prejudice and required the parties to file a joint status report proposing next steps.",
    "46746": "On June 27, 2025, Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM), and Miami-Dade County. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by constructing and operating a temporary immigration detention facility at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (TNT) in Collier County, Florida, without conducting required environmental reviews. The facility, dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" was built on land owned by Miami-Dade County but located primarily in Collier County, with only a small portion extending into Miami-Dade County. The plaintiffs claimed the detention center's construction and operation would cause significant environmental harm to the ecologically sensitive Big Cypress National Preserve, including impacts to wetlands, wildlife habitats, and water quality, while violating NEPA's requirement for environmental impact assessments for major federal actions. \n\nThe district court held a four-day evidentiary hearing from August 6-13, 2025, and on August 21, 2025, granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court ordered the defendants to immediately cease bringing new detainees to the facility, halt all new construction, and remove certain infrastructure within 60 days. The court found that the detention facility constituted a \"major federal action\" under NEPA because it involved substantial federal control through 287(g) agreements between FDEM and federal immigration authorities, which allowed state officers to perform immigration enforcement functions under federal supervision. The court also found that the defendants' failure to conduct an environmental review before construction constituted final agency action under the APA.\n\nDefendants Kevin Guthrie (FDEM) and Kristi Noem (DHS) and Todd Lyons (ICE) filed a notice of interlocutory appeal on August 21, 2025, and a motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal on August 23, 2025. The defendants argued that the Southern District of Florida was an improper venue for the case, that NEPA does not apply to state actions, and that the injunction would cause irreparable harm to immigration enforcement efforts. The district court had found venue proper in the Southern District, and the defendants' motion to stay the injunction is currently pending before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "46388": "The case involves a lawsuit filed by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), its Harvard chapter (AAUP-Harvard), and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) against multiple federal agencies and officials. The plaintiffs challenge the Trump administration's threatened termination of over $2.7 billion in federal funding to Harvard University, which the government claimed was necessary to address alleged failures to address antisemitism on campus. On March 31, 2025, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Education (ED), and General Services Administration (GSA) announced a \"comprehensive review\" of Harvard's federal funding as part of a multi-agency \"Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism\" led by Defendant Leo Terrell. The Task Force sent Harvard a letter on April 3, 2025 (the \"April 3 Letter\") demanding sweeping changes to Harvard's governance, curriculum, and policies, including shuttering DEI programs, centralizing student discipline, and implementing a \"mask ban.\" The letter claimed Harvard had \"fundamentally failed to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence\" but provided no specific evidence of violations. The Task Force issued a second letter on April 11, 2025 (the \"April 11 Letter\") with even more extreme demands, including requiring Harvard to reduce faculty power, conduct a \"viewpoint diversity\" audit of all departments, and implement a \"comprehensive mask ban.\" Harvard refused to comply, prompting the government to announce a freeze on $2.2 billion in federal funding on April 14. By May 5, the Department of Education issued a letter stating Harvard \"should no longer seek GRANTS from the federal government.\" Between May 6 and May 12, multiple federal agencies sent termination letters for over $2.7 billion in grants, citing the same alleged reasons as the Demand Letters. The plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that the government's actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because they failed to follow required procedural steps under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, including providing notice, an opportunity for hearing, and findings of noncompliance. The plaintiffs also alleged that the actions violated the First Amendment by coercing Harvard to suppress protected speech and academic freedom, as the demands targeted topics and viewpoints the government disfavored. The plaintiffs seek a declaration that the government's actions are unlawful, a permanent injunction to stop the funding cuts, and other relief. The case is currently before Judge Allison D. Burroughs in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.",

The Department terminated the grants without prior notice, using identical termination notices stating the awards \"no longer effectuate the program goals or agency priorities.\" The plaintiffs argued the terminations were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, were based on an unconstitutionally vague regulation, and violated the separation of powers and appropriations clauses.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, Judge Amit P. Mehta dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the plaintiffs' claims were essentially contractual in nature and belonged in the Court of Federal Claims rather than federal district court. The court acknowledged the terminations were \"unquestionably arbitrary, at least in lay terms\" and \"likely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence,\" but explained it lacked authority to grant the requested relief due to jurisdictional constraints. The court also denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification as moot. The plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and on July 21, 2025, Judge Mehta denied their emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, though he issued a limited injunction preventing the re-obligation of the terminated grant funding for the five named plaintiffs until October 1, 2025.",
    "46387": "On April 9, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued Executive Order 14,263 targeting Susman Godfrey LLP, a prominent trial law firm, based on the President's claim that the firm \"spearheaded efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections,\" \"funded groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military,\" and \"supported efforts to discriminate on the basis of race.\" The Order directed federal agencies to suspend security clearances held by Susman employees, require government contractors to disclose business with Susman, review and potentially terminate contracts involving Susman, restrict Susman employees' access to federal buildings, limit government employees from engaging with Susman employees, and refrain from hiring Susman employees. Susman Godfrey LLP filed a complaint on April 11, 2025, arguing the Order violated the First Amendment by retaliating against protected speech, engaging in viewpoint discrimination, and restricting the right to petition the government; violated the Fifth Amendment by depriving Susman of liberty and property interests without due process; and violated separation of powers by exceeding the President's constitutional authority. The court granted a temporary restraining order on April 15, 2025, enjoining Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the Order. On June 27, 2025, the court granted Susman's motion for summary judgment, declaring Executive Order 14,263 unconstitutional and entering a permanent injunction against its implementation. The court concluded that the Order was \"unmistakably\" tied to Susman's protected activities, including its representation of Dominion Voting Systems in litigation concerning the 2020 election, a donation to GLAD (an organization advocating for equal treatment of LGBTQ+ service members), and statements on Susman's website about diversity. The court found the Order violated the First Amendment (retaliation and viewpoint discrimination), Fifth Amendment (due process), and separation of powers, and permanently enjoined the defendants from implementing or enforcing the Executive Order in any way.",
    "46245": "On March 18, 2025, the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) and five of its Board members filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's termination of the Institute's appointed Board members and the subsequent actions taken by the remaining ex officio Board members. The lawsuit alleged that the President's removal of the Board members violated the United States Institute of Peace Act (USIP Act), 22 U.S.C. § 4601-4611, which provides specific statutory removal protections for the appointed Board members. The USIP Act requires that Board members be removed only under three circumstances: \"in consultation with the Board, for conviction of a felony, malfeasance in office, persistent neglect of duties, or inability to discharge duties,\" \"upon the recommendation of eight voting members of the Board,\" or \"upon the recommendation of a majority of the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and a majority of the members of the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate.\" On March 14, 2025, President Trump terminated the appointed Board members without complying with these statutory requirements, and the ex officio Board members then removed USIP's President, Ambassador George Moose, and appointed Kenneth Jackson as acting president. On March 17, 2025, DOGE representatives forcibly entered USIP's headquarters building, and over the following weeks, DOGE terminated nearly all USIP employees, transferred the Institute's headquarters building to the General Services Administration, and transferred USIP's funds to the Treasury. The district court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs on May 19, 2025, declaring that the President's removal of the USIP Board members was unlawful, ultra vires, and without legal effect under the USIP Act. The court determined that USIP is part of the federal government for constitutional separation-of-powers purposes but does not exercise executive power and therefore is not part of the Executive Branch. The court further held that even if USIP were part of the Executive Branch, the statutory removal protections would be constitutional under Humphrey's Executor and Seila Law, as USIP is a multimember board with no substantial executive power. The court ordered that the plaintiff Board members \"shall continue to serve\" and that Ambassador Moose \"shall continue to serve\" as USIP President, and enjoined defendants from further trespass against USIP's property. The defendants appealed, and a motions panel of the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal, which the plaintiffs have sought to overturn through a petition for rehearing en banc.",
    "46274": "On March 8, 2025, Climate United Fund filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, along with Citibank, N.A., seeking to prevent the termination of a $6.97 billion grant awarded under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) program established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The grant was intended to fund clean energy projects across the United States. The EPA issued a \"Notice of Termination\" on March 11, 2025, claiming the grants were terminated due to \"substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse.\" Climate United argued that the termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it was arbitrary and capricious, failed to provide a reasoned explanation, and did not comply with federal regulations requiring specific procedural steps for termination. The court granted a temporary restraining order on March 18, 2025, and later granted a preliminary injunction on April 15, 2025, finding that the EPA's termination was unlawful under the APA, violated federal regulations, and deprived Climate United of due process. The court ordered EPA and Citibank to cease interfering with Climate United's access to the grant funds and to comply with Climate United's disbursement requests. EPA appealed the preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing the district court lacked jurisdiction because the claims were contractual in nature and should be heard in the Court of Federal Claims, but the D.C. Circuit has not yet ruled on the appeal.",
    "46142": "This case involves a federal lawsuit filed by three nonprofit organizations—National Urban League (NUL), National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), and AIDS Foundation of Chicago (AFC)—challenging three executive orders issued by President Donald Trump on January 20-21, 2025. The executive orders targeted \"diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\" (DEIA) programs and policies. Executive Order 14151 directed federal agencies to terminate \"equity-related\" grants and contracts, while Executive Order 14168 defined \"gender ideology\" in a way that effectively denied transgender people's existence and prohibited federal funding for programs promoting this concept. Executive Order 14173 required federal contractors and grantees to certify they do not operate \"DEI programs that violate federal anti-discrimination laws\" and to agree that such compliance is material to government payments under the False Claims Act.\n\nThe plaintiffs, which rely on federal funding to provide services to marginalized communities, alleged that the executive orders violated their First Amendment rights by chilling protected speech about racial and gender equity, and violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause by being unconstitutionally vague. They also claimed the orders violated the Equal Protection Clause by discriminating against people of color and transgender individuals. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of the executive orders, citing immediate harm including the termination of a $500,000 EPA grant to NUL for an environmental justice program and the forced alteration of AFC's Annual Report to remove DEIA-related language.\n\nThe court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction, holding that the plaintiffs failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits. The court found that the plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge several provisions of the executive orders, including the List Provision and Report Provision, and that for the provisions they did have standing for, they failed to show the orders violated constitutional rights. The court reasoned that the government is not required to fund protected speech, and the executive orders did not violate the First Amendment by merely refusing to fund certain speech. The court also found the orders were not unconstitutionally vague under the Fifth Amendment, as they did not regulate protected speech directly. The court's decision followed similar rulings in other federal courts, though the Fourth Circuit had stayed a similar injunction in a related case pending appeal. The plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended complaint, but the court denied the preliminary injunction as requested.",
    "46110": "In February 2025, five federal employee unions—National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), and International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)—filed a lawsuit challenging Executive Order 14210, issued by President Donald J. Trump on February 11, 2025, which directed federal agencies to \"promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force\" and to prioritize certain categories of employees for termination. The unions also challenged OPM's guidance on probationary employees (issued January 20, 2025) and OPM's deferred resignation program (announced January 28, 2025). The unions alleged that these actions violated separation of powers principles by undermining Congress's authority to create, fund, and set the missions of federal agencies, and that they violated statutory and regulatory requirements for reductions-in-force under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). The unions sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to halt the implementation of these policies. The court denied the motion on February 20, 2025, holding that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the unions' claims because the FSLMRS provides the exclusive channel for reviewing such labor-management disputes, requiring claims to be first processed through the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) before judicial review. The court concluded that the unions' claims fell squarely within the FSLMRS's comprehensive administrative review scheme and that the unions had not demonstrated that the FLRA process would be inadequate for addressing their concerns. The court also noted that the unions' arguments about \"irremediable harm\" did not overcome the jurisdictional bar, as the FSLMRS's review process could provide meaningful judicial review. The court's ruling effectively dismissed the unions' request for emergency relief and required them to pursue their claims through the administrative process established by the FSLMRS.",
    "46098": "Global Health Council and other foreign aid recipients sued the Trump administration in February 2025 after President Trump issued Executive Order 14,169, directing a \"90-day pause\" in foreign assistance funding for \"assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy.\" The plaintiffs challenged the government's blanket suspension of foreign aid as violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the separation of powers by unilaterally withholding funds Congress had appropriated. The district court granted a preliminary injunction requiring the government to \"make available for obligation the full amount of funds that Congress appropriated for foreign assistance programs\" under the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024, finding the government had not followed the Impoundment Control Act's procedures for deferring or rescinding funds and had no constitutional authority to withhold appropriations for policy reasons. The government appealed, arguing the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to enforce the appropriations laws. The D.C. Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction's impoundment provision, holding the plaintiffs had no constitutional cause of action because the dispute was fundamentally statutory, not constitutional, and the Comptroller General—not private parties—could enforce the Impoundment Control Act. The court rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs could transform a statutory claim into a constitutional one to avoid procedural limits, concluding the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue their separation-of-powers claim. The court also determined the plaintiffs' APA claims were precluded by the Impoundment Control Act's statutory scheme, which provided a detailed mechanism for enforcement that excluded private parties. The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with this ruling.",
    "46090": "On February 7, 2025, President Trump designated Russell Vought as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which Congress had created through the Dodd-Frank Act to regulate consumer financial products and protect consumers. On February 8, Vought issued an email directing CFPB employees to cease most activities \"unless expressly approved by the Acting Director or required by law.\" The next day, Vought issued a more comprehensive \"stop work\" order instructing employees to \"not perform any work tasks\" without prior approval. This was followed by the firing of 85 probationary employees on February 11, the cancellation of numerous contracts, the closure of the agency's headquarters, and the decision to decline additional funding. The plaintiffs, including the National Treasury Employees Union, National Consumer Law Center, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Virginia Poverty Law Center, and Ted Steege (substituted for his late wife Pastor Eva Steege), filed a lawsuit alleging these actions violated the Dodd-Frank Act and constitutional separation of powers principles. They argued Congress had created the CFPB with specific statutory duties that the agency must fulfill, and the Executive Branch had no authority to dismantle the agency. After a two-day evidentiary hearing, the district court granted a preliminary injunction on March 28, 2025, finding that the defendants were engaged in a concerted effort to shut down the agency. The injunction required defendants to maintain CFPB data, reinstate terminated employees, not terminate additional employees, not enforce the stop-work order, provide employees with work capabilities, maintain the consumer complaint system, and rescind contract terminations. The defendants appealed, and the D.C. Circuit partially stayed the injunction on April 11, 2025, allowing them to conduct reductions in force of employees deemed unnecessary. Days later, defendants issued a RIF affecting approximately 90% of the agency's workforce. The plaintiffs asked the district court to halt this RIF, and the D.C. Circuit lifted its partial stay on April 28, 2025, reinstating the full injunction. The D.C. Circuit ultimately dismissed the defendants' appeal on May 12, 2025, affirming the district court's preliminary injunction.",
    "PN-NY-0014": "Ligon v. City of New York is a federal class action lawsuit challenging the New York City Police Department's (NYPD) practice of making unconstitutional stops, frisks, and arrests on suspicion of trespass outside buildings enrolled in the Trespass Affidavit Program (TAP), a program that allows NYPD officers to patrol inside and around private residential apartment buildings. The case was filed on March 28, 2012, by Black and Latino residents of New York City who alleged they and their minor children were unlawfully stopped, questioned, frisked, and/or arrested in or around their homes or family members' homes. The plaintiffs sought relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the Fourth Amendment (unreasonable search and seizure) and the Fourteenth Amendment (equal protection). The court granted a preliminary injunction on January 8, 2013, finding that the plaintiffs had shown a \"clear likelihood of proving\" that the City, by its deliberate indifference, had a policy of conducting unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx. The court ordered the NYPD to cease performing trespass stops outside TAP buildings without reasonable suspicion of trespass. The case was related to Floyd v. City of New York, which challenged the NYPD's broader stop-and-frisk practices, and Davis v. City of New York, which challenged trespass enforcement in public housing. The court's Remedies Opinion, issued on August 12, 2013, ordered specific reforms to the NYPD's policies, training, supervision, auditing, and monitoring procedures. The court appointed Peter L. Zimroth as an independent monitor to oversee implementation of the reforms. The parties eventually reached a settlement agreement on July 19, 2017, which was approved by the court. The settlement required the NYPD to implement specific policy changes regarding stops, frisks, and trespass enforcement in TAP buildings, as well as to revise training materials, establish improved auditing procedures, and comply with the terms of the court's Remedies Opinion. The settlement also provided for court-ordered monitoring for a period of three years (with the possibility of extension) to ensure compliance with the settlement terms. The monitor's reports have documented ongoing efforts to ensure NYPD officers comply with the court-ordered reforms, including changes to policies, training, supervision, and auditing procedures.",
    "PB-CT-0007": "This case challenges Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines \"marriage\" for federal purposes as \"only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife\" and \"spouse\" as \"a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.\" Plaintiffs, six same-sex couples legally married under the laws of Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleging that DOMA violates the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause by denying them federal benefits available to opposite-sex married couples. The plaintiffs suffered concrete harms: Joanne Pedersen was denied health insurance coverage for her spouse under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; Gerald V. Passaro II was denied Social Security survivor benefits and a qualified preretirement survivor annuity; Lynda DeForge was denied family medical leave to care for her spouse; Janet Geller and Joanne Marquis were denied health insurance benefits under the New Hampshire Retirement System; and Suzanne Artis and Geraldine Artis, Bradley Kleinerman and James Gehre, and Damon Savoy and John Weiss were denied the ability to file federal income tax returns as married couples. The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied the government's motion to dismiss, holding that DOMA violates the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The court determined that classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny and, even under rational basis review, DOMA fails constitutional muster. The government and the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives appealed the district court's judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, while the plaintiffs petitioned for a writ of certiorari before judgment in the Supreme Court.",
    "PC-AL-0034": "The United States filed a civil rights complaint against the State of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) on May 28, 2015, under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997. The complaint alleged that ADOC violated the Eighth Amendment by failing to protect women prisoners at Tutwiler Prison for Women from sexual abuse and sexual harassment, based on a January 17, 2014 investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice that documented a history of staff sexual abuse and a toxic sexualized environment. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on May 28, 2015, which was approved by the court on June 18, 2015. The agreement required ADOC and Tutwiler to implement comprehensive reforms including developing gender-responsive policies, implementing a staffing plan, providing specialized staff training, improving inmate education about sexual abuse and harassment, establishing a risk assessment system, and addressing architectural issues related to privacy. The agreement established a monitoring process with an independent monitor to evaluate compliance, requiring biannual compliance reports. The monitor's eighth compliance report, filed on August 27, 2019, indicated that Tutwiler and ADOC had achieved \"substantial compliance\" with 41 sections of the agreement and \"partial compliance\" with 2 sections. The monitor noted ongoing challenges primarily related to staffing levels, with only 44% of correctional officer positions filled, though significant progress had been made in implementing gender-responsive policies, classification systems, programming, and staff training. The settlement requires continued monitoring until full compliance is achieved.",
    "ED-MI-0001": "In November 2006, Michigan voters approved Proposal 2, an amendment to the Michigan Constitution that prohibited public universities from considering race in admissions decisions. The Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary (BAMN), along with students, faculty, and other organizations, filed a federal lawsuit challenging the amendment as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs argued that Proposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause by restructuring Michigan's political process to place an undue burden on racial minorities seeking to change admissions policies that benefit them, and by making it more difficult for minorities to achieve beneficial legislation compared to other groups. The district court granted summary judgment for the state, finding Proposal 2 constitutional. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Proposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause by impermissibly restructuring the political process. The Supreme Court of the United States reversed the Sixth Circuit's decision, holding that Michigan's voters had the right to determine that race-based preferences in university admissions should be ended, and that the Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit a state from banning the consideration of race in admissions decisions. The Supreme Court emphasized that the case was not about whether race-conscious admissions policies are constitutionally permissible, but rather about whether Michigan voters could choose to prohibit such policies. The Court found that Proposal 2 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it did not inflict a specific injury on racial minorities, as was present in cases like Hunter v. Erickson and Washington v. Seattle School District, but rather involved a decision by voters to change the policy regarding race-conscious admissions. The Supreme Court's decision effectively upheld Michigan's constitutional amendment banning affirmative action in public university admissions.",
    "DR-CA-0033": "Maurizio Antoninetti, a wheelchair user, filed a lawsuit against Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. in 2005, alleging that Chipotle's restaurants violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California Disabled Persons Act by denying him equal access to the \"Chipotle experience.\" Antoninetti claimed the 44-inch high wall in front of food preparation counters blocked his view of food ingredients and the preparation process, preventing him from seeing the same visual elements available to standing customers. Chipotle initially relied on an unwritten policy of providing accommodations (such as showing food samples in cups or displaying ingredients at the cashier counter), which the district court initially found inadequate, but later adopted a written \"Customers with Disabilities Policy\" that the district court ruled provided \"equivalent facilitation.\" The district court denied Antoninetti's request for injunctive relief but awarded him $5,000 in statutory damages for five \"bona fide\" visits to Chipotle's restaurants before the written policy was implemented. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court, holding that Chipotle's written policy did not constitute \"equivalent facilitation\" under ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) Section 2.2, as it did not involve \"other designs and technologies\" that would provide \"substantially equivalent or greater access.\" The court found that Chipotle's wall design violated the ADA because it prevented wheelchair users from having the same visual experience of food preparation available to standing customers. The court also vacated the $5,000 damages award and remanded for further proceedings on damages. After remand, the district court entered judgment against Chipotle for violation of the ADA, awarded Antoninetti $5,000 in statutory damages for the five \"bona fide\" visits, and denied injunctive relief (which was rendered moot by Antoninetti's death in 2011). The district court also awarded Antoninetti $545,079.05 in attorney's fees, which the Ninth Circuit later reviewed and adjusted. The case established that public accommodations cannot rely on policies of providing methods of accommodation to avoid architectural compliance with ADA standards when the visual elements of the experience are integral to the service being provided.",
    "CJ-FL-0009": "On November 6, 2018, Florida voters overwhelmingly approved Amendment 4 to the state constitution, which automatically restored voting rights to most felons upon completion of all terms of their sentences, including parole or probation. The amendment passed with 64.55% of the vote, reflecting the will of the people to expand voting rights to approximately 1.4 million individuals. Shortly after the amendment took effect, the Florida Legislature enacted Senate Bill 7066 (SB 7066), which interpreted \"completion of all terms of sentence\" to include payment of all legal financial obligations (LFOs) such as fines, fees, and restitution imposed as part of a criminal sentence. The plaintiffs, 17 individuals with felony convictions who had completed all terms of their sentences but were unable to pay outstanding LFOs, filed a lawsuit challenging SB 7066 as unconstitutional. They asserted that the requirement to pay LFOs as a condition of voting violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applied to indigent felons, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment (which prohibits poll taxes), and the Due Process Clause. The district court granted a preliminary injunction in October 2019, ruling that Florida could not deny the right to vote based solely on inability to pay LFOs. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed this ruling in Jones v. Governor of Florida, 950 F.3d 795 (11th Cir. 2020), applying heightened scrutiny to the pay-to-vote requirement as applied to indigent felons. After a bench trial, the district court issued a permanent injunction on May 24, 2020, declaring that SB 7066 violated the Equal Protection Clause as applied to felons who could not pay their LFOs, and also violated the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. The court also ruled that the law was void for vagueness and denied due process. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court's permanent injunction on September 11, 2020, rejecting the State's argument that only rational basis review applied and finding that the pay-to-vote requirement was unconstitutional as applied to indigent felons. The court held that Florida's reenfranchisement scheme did not violate the Constitution and vacated the district court's injunction. The State had argued that the law was constitutional because it promoted the legitimate state interest of ensuring that felons who regained voting rights had fully satisfied their sentences, but the court found that the law's implementation created administrative chaos that denied due process to many felons who could not determine whether they owed LFOs or how much they needed to pay. The court also rejected the argument that LFOs were taxes prohibited by the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, finding that the fees and costs were part of the criminal sentence and thus not taxes.",
    "CW-CA-0005": "Katie A. v. Bonta is a class action lawsuit filed in 2002 on behalf of children in California foster care or at imminent risk of foster care placement who have mental health needs. The plaintiffs, represented by ACLU and other public interest law firms, alleged that the state of California and Los Angeles County violated the Medicaid Act's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions by failing to provide necessary mental health services, including wraparound services and therapeutic foster care (TFC). The case was certified as a class action for children who (a) are in foster care or at imminent risk of foster care placement; (b) have a mental illness or condition that has been documented or would have been documented; and (c) need individualized mental health services. The district court initially granted a preliminary injunction requiring the state to provide wraparound services and TFC as \"packages\" to eligible children, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision in 2007, holding that the district court misapplied the law by requiring the state to provide \"wraparound\" and \"TFC\" as distinct services rather than determining whether the state was providing the necessary components of these services. After the Ninth Circuit's ruling, the parties negotiated a settlement agreement approved by the court on July 16, 2003 for Los Angeles County defendants, and later for the state defendants, which required the state to develop and implement a plan to provide wraparound services and TFC to eligible children. The settlement agreement required the state to develop a Medi-Cal Specialty Mental Health documentation manual, establish a Shared Management Structure between state agencies, and implement a Core Practice Model for mental health services. A Special Master was appointed to monitor compliance with the settlement. The case has been ongoing for over 20 years with multiple reports and updates from the Special Master regarding the state's implementation of the settlement. The case is now closed with the court retaining jurisdiction for a specific period to ensure compliance with the settlement agreement.",
    "PC-VA-0022": "Eric J. DePaola, a Virginia inmate sentenced to 38 years in prison in 2004 for crimes including malicious wounding, use of a firearm, and abduction, was placed in administrative segregation (solitary confinement) at Red Onion State Prison following a 2009 incident in which he stabbed a prison guard. The Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) placed DePaola in the Intensive Management (IM) classification under VDOC Operating Procedure 830.A (OP 830.A), which governs the classification and management of segregation inmates. Unlike Special Management (SM) inmates who can participate in a step-down program to eventually return to the general population, IM inmates are not eligible for this program and remain in segregation indefinitely. DePaola has been confined in segregation for approximately eight years (from 2009 to 2017), during which time he has received few disciplinary infractions—only two \"100 series\" charges (for tampering with a sink lever and alleged possession of a sharpened instrument) and a few minor \"200 series\" charges related to possession of contraband. The Institutional Classification Authority (ICA) reviews, which occur every 90 days, have not provided meaningful review of DePaola's eligibility for return to general population, as they merely determine his privilege level within segregation rather than his fitness for return to the general population. In December 2014, DePaola filed a pro se civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against VDOC and various officials, alleging that VDOC's classification procedures violated his procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and that the conditions of his prolonged solitary confinement violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The district court denied DePaola's motion for appointment of counsel and his motion to certify the case as a class action. After amending his complaint, DePaola opposed the defendants' motion for summary judgment, arguing that his eight years in solitary confinement without meaningful opportunity for return to general population violated constitutional protections. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on all claims, finding that DePaola's solitary confinement did not implicate a protected liberty interest and that his conditions of confinement did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. DePaola appealed the district court's decision to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is now considering whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment without allowing for meaningful discovery.",
    "CJ-MD-0001": "Vernon Evans, a death row inmate in Maryland, filed a federal lawsuit challenging the state's lethal injection protocol under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging it violated the Eighth Amendment by creating an unnecessary risk of pain during execution. The protocol used a three-drug cocktail: sodium pentothal (an anesthetic), pancuronium bromide (a paralytic), and potassium chloride (a heart-stopping agent). Evans argued the protocol's design, including the absence of properly trained personnel to monitor anesthesia, the use of a pressure infusion bag, and the failure to plan for potential IV access issues (particularly given Evans's history of intravenous drug use), created a substantial risk of unnecessary pain. The case arose after Evans received a warrant of execution setting his execution for February 2006. Evans also challenged the protocol's adoption as a \"regulation\" under Maryland's Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services failed to follow required rulemaking procedures. The district court denied Evans's motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, finding he had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed Evans's appeal, but the case was later remanded. The district court ultimately held that while the protocol did not violate the Eighth Amendment (as previously determined in similar cases), the execution protocol did constitute a \"regulation\" under the APA that had not been properly adopted. The court ordered the state to either adopt the protocol in compliance with the APA or seek legislative exemption from the requirement, effectively halting any execution using the current protocol until the state complied with the APA. The court's ruling established that Maryland's execution protocol needed formal adoption under the state's administrative procedures before it could be used in executions.",
    "CW-DC-0001": "LaShawn A. v. District of Columbia is a landmark class action lawsuit filed on June 20, 1989, on behalf of children in the District of Columbia's foster care system and children known to the District's Department of Human Services (DHS) due to reported abuse or neglect. Represented by the ACLU and Children's Rights, the plaintiffs alleged that the District's child welfare system violated federal statutes, including the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, as well as the Fifth Amendment's due process protections under the Constitution. After a two-week trial in February 1991, the District Court found the District in violation of these rights, concluding that the child welfare system was operating in \"widespread and systematic deficiencies\" that caused emotional and physical harm to children. The court determined that the District had failed to comply with reasonable professional standards in almost every area of its child welfare system, with children remaining in foster care for years without permanent placement, investigations of abuse reports being delayed or inadequate, and foster care placements often inappropriate for the children's needs.\n\nThe court entered a Remedial Order in August 1991, which was later modified to be based solely on District law after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that District law provided an independent basis for the court's judgment. The Modified Final Order, entered January 27, 1994, established specific requirements for the District to reform its child welfare system. When the District failed to comply with these requirements, the court appointed a receiver in 1995 to oversee the child welfare system. Over the next 25 years, the court approved multiple implementation plans, with the Center for the Study of Social Policy serving as the court-appointed monitor to track the District's progress.\n\nThe case continued through numerous appeals and modifications to the implementation plans as the District made incremental improvements but repeatedly failed to meet the required standards. The District's compliance with the court's orders was closely monitored, with the court addressing issues such as timely investigations of abuse reports, appropriate foster care placements, and the provision of essential services to children. After more than 30 years of court supervision, the parties reached agreement on an Exit and Sustainability Plan in 2019, which the court approved. This plan marked the end of the court's supervision of the District's child welfare system, as the District had achieved and maintained compliance with the required standards for several years. The case is notable for being one of the longest-running child welfare reform cases in U.S. history, demonstrating the complexity of systemic reform and the court's role in ensuring accountability for vulnerable children."
