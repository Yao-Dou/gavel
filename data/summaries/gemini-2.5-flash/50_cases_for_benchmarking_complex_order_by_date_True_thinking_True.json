    "46567": "On May 5, 2025, a Venezuelan man, referred to by the pseudonym G.M.G., filed an individual petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The man is represented by counsel from the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation and its Rhode Island affiliate. He sued the President of the United States, the U.S. Attorney General, the Secretary and Department of Homeland Security, the Acting Director and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Secretary and Department of State, the Secretary and Department of Defense, the acting Boston Field Office Director for ICE, and the Warden of the Wyatt Detention Facility, all in their official capacities.\n\nThe petitioner challenges a Presidential Proclamation issued on March 14, 2025, and made public the following day, which invokes the Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. §§ 21-24). This Proclamation authorizes the immediate removal, without notice or judicial review, of Venezuelan citizens aged 14 or older who are identified as members of the criminal gang Tren de Aragua (\"TdA\") and are not lawful permanent residents or naturalized citizens. The Proclamation asserts that TdA is engaged in an \"invasion\" or \"predatory incursion\" against the United States and should be considered a \"foreign government or nation.\"\n\nThe petitioner, detained at Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island, was arrested on March 26, 2025. He alleges that he has a pending application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), based on a well-founded fear of persecution and torture in Venezuela due to his perceived political opposition and fear of TdA. At a bond hearing on May 1, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argued he was associated with TdA, citing his tattoos and an I-213 form identifying him as an \"active member\" despite no known criminal history. The immigration judge denied bond without allowing the petitioner to testify. The petitioner denies any affiliation with TdA, stating his tattoos are for personal reasons. He alleges he is at grave risk of being classified as an alien enemy and summarily deported to El Salvador, where prior removals under the Proclamation have sent individuals to a notorious prison, or to Venezuela where he fears persecution.\n\nThe petitioner claims the Proclamation is unlawful, asserting it fails to satisfy the statutory predicates of the Alien Enemies Act because TdA is not a \"foreign nation or government\" and its activities do not constitute a military \"invasion\" or \"predatory incursion.\" He further alleges the Proclamation violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.) by overriding its \"sole and exclusive procedure\" for removal, including protections for asylum (8 U.S.C. § 1158), withholding of removal (8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)), and CAT (8 U.S.C. § 1231 note via FARRA). He also argues it violates the Alien Enemies Act's requirement for voluntary departure and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause by providing inadequate notice and no meaningful opportunity for individuals to challenge their designation or removal. The Supreme Court, in a related case, *Trump v. J.G.G.*, 145 S. Ct. 1003 (Apr. 7, 2025), vacated a nationwide temporary restraining order but clarified that individuals subject to the Proclamation are entitled to due process and notice to seek habeas relief. Other federal courts have also found the Proclamation likely unlawful, including *J.A.V. v. Trump*, 2025 WL 1257450 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2025) and *D.B.U. v. Trump*, 2025 WL 1163530 (D. Colo. Apr. 22, 2025).\n\nThe petitioner seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction preventing his transfer out of the district or removal under the Proclamation, a writ of habeas corpus, a declaratory judgment that the Proclamation is unlawful, and an injunction requiring 30-day notice and an opportunity to respond before any removal.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, District Judge Melissa R. DuBose issued an order in this case, requiring the respondents to provide the Court with at least 48 hours' advance notice and the reason before moving the petitioner outside the District of Rhode Island. Following a motion hearing on May 7, 2025, Judge DuBose issued an amended order, increasing the notice requirement to 72 hours, to be provided to both the Court and the petitioner, with the notice period running only on business days. These orders remain in effect until otherwise ordered by the Court.",
    "46582": "On April 30, 2025, Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian noncitizen residing in the United States since 2016, filed a verified petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division. Ms. Kordia named Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security; Pamela Bondi, in her official capacity as Attorney General; Todd Lyons, in his official capacity as Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; Josh Johnson, in his official capacity as Acting Director of ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations Dallas Field Office; and Thomas Bergami, in his official capacity as Warden of the Prairieland Detention Facility, as Respondents-Defendants. Ms. Kordia is represented by private attorneys, legal services organizations including the Southern Poverty Law Center, and attorneys from the Texas Civil Rights Project, CUNY School of Law, and Muslim Advocates, many of whom were admitted pro hac vice throughout May 2025.\n\nThe factual basis of the case stems from Ms. Kordia's detention by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) since March 14, 2025, at the Prairieland Detention Facility in Alvarado, Texas, over 1,500 miles from her New Jersey home. Ms. Kordia alleges her detention is retaliatory, stemming from her attendance at a peaceful protest supporting Palestinian rights and a single monetary transfer to a family member in Palestine. She claims this action is part of a broader Trump Administration policy, initiated through Executive Orders, to target and deport noncitizens associated with Palestinian advocacy. The petition references several other individuals (Mahmoud Khalil, Ranjani Srinivasan, Dr. Badar Khan Suri, Momodou Taal, Rümeysa Öztürk, and Yunseo Chung), some of whose cases resulted in reported opinions (e.g., *Öztürk v. Trump*, 2025 WL 1145250 (D. Vt. Apr. 18, 2025); *Mahdawi v. Trump, et al.*, 2025 WL 1243135 (D.Vt., 2025)), who were allegedly targeted for similar reasons. Ms. Kordia further asserts that during her confinement, officials at the Prairieland Detention Facility have substantially burdened her religious liberty by denying her halal meals and adequate prayer accommodations, leading to significant weight loss and psychological distress. While an immigration judge granted Ms. Kordia release on a $20,000 bond on April 3, 2025, finding her neither a danger nor a flight risk, DHS appealed this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), triggering an automatic stay of her release.\n\nMs. Kordia's legal claims are based on alleged violations of the First Amendment (retaliation for protected speech and association) and the Fifth Amendment (procedural and substantive due process). She also brings claims against Warden Bergami and Acting Director Johnson under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c), for substantially burdening her sincerely held religious beliefs. She seeks a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 for her immediate release, an order to show cause, declaratory judgments that her confinement violates her constitutional and statutory rights, and injunctive relief to remedy the religious liberty violations and prevent future re-detention without clear and convincing evidence, along with attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe case was initially referred to Magistrate Judge Rebecca Rutherford. On May 5, 2025, Ms. Kordia filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction Ordering Release Pending Final Judgment. After the government responded, and Ms. Kordia replied, Magistrate Judge Rutherford held a hearing on the motion on June 5, 2025. The court authorized remote audio access for the public and allowed Ms. Kordia to attend remotely, but denied her request for physical presence. On June 27, 2025, Magistrate Judge Rutherford issued Findings, Conclusions, and Recommendation (Doc 53), recommending that the District Judge grant Ms. Kordia's motion and order her immediate release from immigration detention pending a final judgment on her underlying habeas claims. Both Ms. Kordia and the Government Respondents filed objections to this recommendation on July 7, 2025. On July 16, 2025, Judge Sam A. Lindsay recommitted the matter to Magistrate Judge Rutherford for new findings and recommendations, citing new issues raised by the parties in their objections that were not available at the time of the initial report or hearing. As of August 12, 2025, the parties have requested and received a modified briefing schedule for subsequent pleadings related to the underlying petition.",
    "46496": "On April 24, 2025, three organizations—human rights organization Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the Southern Border Communities Coalition, and legal services organization Urban Justice Center—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of Homeland Security. Represented by private counsel and non-profit legal groups including Public Citizen Litigation Group, Democracy Forward Foundation, and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants unlawfully closed three statutorily mandated DHS oversight offices: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman Office (CISOM), and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO).\n\nThe complaint asserted that on March 21, 2025, DHS abruptly ceased the operations of these offices, placing nearly all employees on administrative leave and terminating contractors, with separation dates set for May 23, 2025. The plaintiffs contended that these actions violated the constitutional separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), specifically alleging that the defendants acted in excess of statutory authority (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)) and arbitrarily and capriciously (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). They also cited violations of the Impoundment Control Act and Anti-Deficiency Act in subsequent filings. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment that the closures and suspension of functions were unlawful, injunctive relief to reverse the employee reductions and reinstate operations, and attorney fees. The defendants publicly stated the offices were closed because they \"obstructed immigration enforcement.\"\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Ana C. Reyes. On May 8, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to immediately halt the termination of the offices' functions, prevent the destruction of records, reinstate employees and contractors, and resume complaint processing. An evidentiary hearing was held on May 19 and 20, 2025. On May 23, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which Judge Reyes denied without prejudice after an evidentiary hearing. Following the denial of the TRO, a Reduction-in-Force (RIF) became effective on May 23, 2025, effectively removing 99% of the employees from the three offices.\n\nThroughout May and June 2025, the parties filed several status reports, revealing a dispute over the defendants' commitment to restoring the offices' functions. While the defendants indicated they were expediting new hires and seeking detailees, the plaintiffs raised concerns about the sincerity of these efforts. They pointed to conflicting public statements, including the FY2026 budget justification which stated OIDO had been \"eliminated in its entirety\" and proposed significantly reduced \"interim\" funding for CRCL and CISOM. Plaintiffs also noted that job postings for new positions excluded former employees affected by the RIF, contrary to earlier court assurances. The plaintiffs argued that this pattern of inconsistent conduct undermined the defendants' credibility and demonstrated an ongoing intent to diminish or eliminate the offices. The case also referenced *Flores v. Garland*, a long-running settlement agreement concerning children in detention, in which the Southern Border Communities Coalition had engaged with CRCL.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, the court granted a joint motion for a scheduling order, which included expedited discovery and briefing for cross-motions for summary judgment. Consequently, the plaintiffs' pending motion for a preliminary injunction was denied as moot. The administrative record was certified and indexed on August 22, 2025, with a schedule set for summary judgment motions in late 2025 and early 2026. On August 1, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the order denying the preliminary injunction as moot, which the defendants opposed, citing a D.C. Circuit case, *NTEU v. Vought - D.C. Cir. Aug. 15, 2025*, in their response.",
    "46432": "On April 18, 2025, a Bangladeshi national student, represented by private attorneys, the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, The Advocates for Human Rights, and the University of Minnesota Detainee Rights Clinic, filed a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. The student named federal officials, including the President of the United States, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, and various Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) directors, along with state officials from Freeborn County, as respondents. The federal respondents were represented by the United States Attorney’s Office, and the state respondents by the Freeborn County Attorney’s Office.\n\nThe student alleged his arrest and detention on March 28, 2025, by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers, and his subsequent holding at the Freeborn County Jail, were in retaliation for his social media posts advocating for Palestinian human rights and criticizing violence in Gaza. He contended these actions were part of a broader federal campaign to suppress pro-Palestinian expression among international students. He claimed violations of his First Amendment free speech rights, Fifth Amendment due process rights, and the Administrative Procedure Act, stemming from the termination of his SEVIS record and revocation of his F-1 student visa—actions for which the government provided shifting and inadequately explained justifications, initially referencing a 2023 misdemeanor disorderly conduct conviction. An Immigration Judge had previously ordered the student's release on a $7,500 bond, finding he posed no danger, but DHS invoked an automatic stay to block his release. While detained, the student reported worsening hernia conditions and missed medical appointments.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jerry W. Blackwell, with Magistrate Judge David T. Schultz, initially granted the student's motion for a temporary restraining order on April 22, 2025, prohibiting federal and state officials from transferring him outside the District of Minnesota. This order was subsequently extended on May 5, May 20, and June 3, 2025. On May 5, 2025, Judge Blackwell also granted the student's request for release on bail pending adjudication, ordering his immediate release subject to the $7,500 bond and conditions previously set by the Immigration Judge.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, Judge Blackwell issued an Order granting the Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, with judgment entered on June 18, 2025. The court found that the student had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that his detention violated his First Amendment rights due to viewpoint-based targeting of his protected speech, his Fifth Amendment due process rights because his detention lacked an individualized legal justification and the automatic stay was applied arbitrarily, and the Administrative Procedure Act because the termination of his SEVIS record was unlawful and violated agency policy. The court ordered the student to remain released from custody under the established bond conditions. On July 29, 2025, the federal respondents filed a Notice of Appeal to the Eighth Circuit, assigned case number 25-2516. The court referenced several related cases from various districts involving similar allegations against federal officials, including *Ziliang J. v. Noem*, Civ. No. 25‐1391 (D. Minn.), and *Mahdawi v. Trump*, 2025 WL 1243135 (D.Vt.).",
    "46477": "On April 14, 2025, ten international students at various U.S. universities, holding F-1 nonimmigrant visas, filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. Represented by private counsel, the students sued Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and other officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including its Acting Director and the Field Office Director of Detroit–ICE.\n\nThe students alleged that the Department of Homeland Security, through its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), unilaterally and without proper legal authority terminated their F-1 student records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). This action, often citing \"criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked\" as the reason, allegedly occurred without prior notice or a valid statutory or regulatory basis. The plaintiffs contended that these terminations violated their constitutional due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), specifically 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). The plaintiffs asserted that they had not been convicted of crimes of violence warranting status termination under 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(g) or any other valid grounds under 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d). The termination of their SEVIS records resulted in immediate loss of legal nonimmigrant status, termination of employment authorizations such as Optional Practical Training (OPT) and STEM OPT, academic disruption, and risk of arrest, detention, or deportation.\n\nUnited States District Judge Jane M. Beckering presided over the case. On April 15, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an Emergency Ex Parte Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Preliminary Injunction. After an oral argument, Judge Beckering granted the TRO on April 23, 2025. The TRO required the defendants to set aside the SEVIS record termination decisions, restore each plaintiff's F-1 student record retroactively to the date of termination, and prohibited them from terminating F-1 records without valid grounds or adherence to constitutional and statutory rights. It also enjoined defendants from revoking OPT employment authorizations and from arresting, detaining, transferring, or initiating removal proceedings against plaintiffs based on SEVIS termination without adequate notice to the court and counsel. The court waived the security requirement and set the TRO to expire in 14 days, unless extended.\n\nFollowing the TRO, the plaintiffs amended their complaint, expanding the number of plaintiffs to thirty-one, including both F-1 and M-1 nonimmigrant students and recent graduates. They also filed a motion for an order to show cause regarding compliance with the TRO, which was later withdrawn after defendants restored the SEVIS records. However, a subsequent dispute arose when plaintiffs argued the restoration was not fully retroactive, as the records still indicated periods of \"terminated\" status.\n\nOn May 7, 2025, after further briefing and a hearing, Judge Beckering granted the plaintiffs' request for a Preliminary Injunction. The court found that the plaintiffs demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their APA claim and would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction. The Preliminary Injunction largely reiterated the terms of the TRO, ordering the defendants to maintain the restored SEVIS records, prohibit unauthorized terminations, and prevent adverse actions based on past terminations. It also directed the defendants to ensure that notations on SEVIS records confirmed retroactive restoration and to address the visibility of these notations to Designated School Officials (DSOs). The court denied the plaintiffs' second motion for an order to show cause regarding full retroactive compliance, noting technical limitations but requiring confirmation of internal notations. The Preliminary Injunction's duration was set to preserve the status quo pending adjudication of the case's merits.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, the defendants filed a Notice of Interlocutory Appeal of the Preliminary Injunction with the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Case No. 25-1611). Subsequently, two plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims, reducing the total number of active plaintiffs to twenty-nine. The appeal process is ongoing.",
    "46239": "On March 17, 2025, Erie County, New York, a municipal entity, filed a lawsuit against the Corporation for National and Community Service (AmeriCorps), an independent federal agency, and Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, its interim agency head, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The case was assigned to Chief Judge James E. Boasberg. Erie County was represented by private counsel.\n\nThe dispute arose from an October 2023 application by Erie County for a three-year Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) grant from AmeriCorps, which was approved in January 2024. The grant was intended to support older people in the Buffalo area through a network of senior volunteers, commonly known as Meals on Wheels. Since 1999, AmeriCorps regulations required RSVP grant applicants to establish an Advisory Council \"of a diverse composition that reflects the demographics of the service area.\" Erie County's application detailed its efforts to ensure diverse community participation, including recruiting Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) members for its Advisory Council.\n\nIn January 2025, the President issued Executive Orders 14151 and 14173, which directed federal agencies to terminate \"equity-related\" grants and require grantees to certify they do not operate programs promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) that violate federal anti-discrimination laws. The orders did not precisely define \"equity-related\" or \"DEI.\" On February 14, 2025, AmeriCorps informed Erie County that its grant application, which contained terms like \"Diversity, Equity,\" and \"DEI,\" required clarification. AmeriCorps presented Erie County with three options: certify compliance (stating no DEI activities), amend its award to remove \"out of compliance\" language, or relinquish the grant, warning that nonresponse could lead to termination.\n\nErie County alleged that it could not honestly make the required certification because its grant application, in compliance with AmeriCorps' long-standing rules, explicitly promoted diversity. Erie County filed suit, asserting violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)), arguing that AmeriCorps' new requirements were arbitrary and capricious as they contradicted its own established regulations without proper notice and comment. Erie County also alleged violations of the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 1), claiming the new requirements imposed vague and unauthorized restrictions on federal funding to a local government. Erie County sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, specifically requesting a preliminary injunction to compel AmeriCorps to recognize its compliance with existing grant requirements and disburse funds without requiring the contested DEI certification.\n\nThe case referenced a related action, *National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education v. Trump*, No. 25-CV-333 (D. Md.), in which a federal district court had issued a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of Executive Order 14151. AmeriCorps initially indicated it would pause termination actions against Erie County's existing grant due to this injunction but continued to demand action for the continuation of a subsequent grant year. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals later stayed the Maryland district court's preliminary injunction in that related case (No. 25-1189).\n\nOn March 21, 2025, Erie County filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. AmeriCorps filed its opposition on April 4, 2025, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction due to discretionary agency decisions, the Tucker Act's exclusive jurisdiction for contract disputes over $10,000, and lack of ripeness. AmeriCorps also contended that Erie County had not demonstrated irreparable harm or a likelihood of success on the merits.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, Erie County filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal without prejudice, stating that AmeriCorps had \"changed its certification requirements since the filing of this suit.\" The court subsequently issued a Minute Order dismissing the case without prejudice, and the motion for a preliminary injunction was withdrawn.",
    "46230": "On March 14, 2025, twelve nonpartisan career civil servants, identified as Jane Doe 1-6 and John Doe 7-12, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Douglas A. Collins, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, along with compensatory damages, litigation expenses, and attorneys' fees. Their claims alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq.) and their rights under the First Amendment (freedom of speech, association, and protection against viewpoint discrimination) and the Fifth Amendment (due process, liberty interest in name and reputation, and equal protection). Jurisdiction was asserted under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n\nThe plaintiffs were employees of the Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) Office of Equity Assurance (OEA), an office established in 2023 to identify and address disparities in Veterans' access to benefits and services. Their work included improving access for rural Veterans, addressing geographical disadvantages, and researching race-based disparities in benefit granting. The plaintiffs, who were non-probationary and had years of federal service, alleged no history of poor performance or misconduct.\n\nThe factual basis of the case stemmed from President Donald Trump's Executive Order (EO) 14151, issued on January 20, 2025, which targeted \"Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.\" Following this, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued guidance directing federal agencies to terminate Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) offices and place their employees on administrative leave. On January 22, 2025, the Acting Secretary of the VA, Todd B. Hunter, sent an agency-wide email announcing the closure of DEIA offices, characterizing them as \"divisive\" and \"wasteful.\" Immediately, the OEA office was closed, and all 27 employees, including the plaintiffs, were placed on administrative leave and lost access to their government email accounts.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that their work was erroneously characterized as DEIA-focused, leading to their targeting. They were initially issued a Specific Reduction in Force (RIF) notice on February 14, 2025, which they contended lacked proper procedure (e.g., 60-day notice, reassignment options). Although this RIF notice was later rescinded on February 27, 2025, and they were retroactively placed back on administrative leave, they were not fully paid and remained unable to access agency systems or apply for other VA positions. They claimed pending job offers were withdrawn due to being labeled \"DEIA employees,\" causing irreparable harm to their careers and reputations. On March 13, 2025, plaintiffs received a new Specific RIF Notice, advising separation effective May 10, 2025, with the competitive area for the RIF limited solely to the OEA office, a practice they argued violated VA's own internal RIF guidelines.\n\nPlaintiffs' motion to proceed under pseudonym was granted in part by Chief Judge James E. Boasberg on April 9, 2025, allowing them to use pseudonyms in public filings while requiring their real names under seal. Plaintiffs also filed a notice of related case, identifying *Perkins Coie LLP v. U.S. Department of Justice et al., 1:25-cv-00716*, but Judge Beryl A. Howell subsequently ruled on April 18, 2025, that the cases were not related under local court rules, and this case was reassigned to Judge Rudolph Contreras.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), seeking to enjoin the defendant from designating OEA as a DEIA office and them as DEIA staff, and from blocking their access to the agency network and employee benefits. After a hearing, Judge Rudolph Contreras denied the plaintiffs' motion for a TRO on May 2, 2025.\n\nOn July 17, 2025, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.",
    "46242": "On March 5, 2025, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving public land access, a Utah-based motorcycle club, and an individual member of both organizations, filed a lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), federal agencies responsible for public land management. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel from BlueRibbon Coalition, Inc., challenge the BLM's December 31, 2024, San Rafael Swell Travel Management Plan (TMP) and its associated Decision Record and Final Environmental Assessment (DOI-BLM-UT-G020-2019-0019-EA).\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the TMP, which closes an additional 665 miles of motorized recreation routes in Utah's San Rafael Swell Travel Management Area (TMA), is unlawful. They assert three causes of action: that the BLM's actions are ultra vires and violate the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act (16 U.S.C. § 1132 et seq.) by creating de facto wilderness areas and a de facto \"wild river\" designation for the Price River, contrary to Congressional intent; that the BLM's actions are arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-06, 706(2)(A), 706(2)(c)) by failing to consider important aspects of the problem, offering explanations contrary to evidence, and not responding to significant public comments; and that the BLM violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA, 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)) by failing to conduct an Environmental Impact Statement despite the plan's significant effect on the human environment. The plaintiffs also argue that the BLM's reliance on Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations is questionable given recent court rulings and an Executive Order. They further contend that the BLM's decision to have the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Lands and Minerals Management approve the TMP, bypassing the traditional Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) process, was arbitrary and caused immediate harm, particularly to the individual plaintiff who lost access to his family's historic Marsing Ranch.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the TMP is unlawful, an order setting aside the TMP, and a permanent injunction preventing the defendants from enforcing the new policy. On March 6, 2025, they also filed a motion seeking relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705 to postpone the TMP's effective date or, alternatively, a preliminary injunction to enjoin its enforcement, and requested a waiver of the bond requirement. They also requested that the court order the defendants not to obliterate routes until the case's conclusion.\n\nUnited States District Judge David Nuffer presides over the case. On March 10, 2025, the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA), a non-profit conservation organization represented by its own attorneys, moved to intervene as a defendant, arguing it has a legally protectable interest in preventing motorized vehicle damage within the TMA and that the federal defendants might not adequately represent its interests. The plaintiffs opposed SUWA's intervention, while the federal defendants took no position. On April 21, 2025, Judge Nuffer granted SUWA's motion to intervene, finding it timely and that SUWA had protectable environmental interests that could be impaired and were not adequately represented by the existing parties. An administrative appeal scheduling order, setting deadlines for the administrative record and briefs, was initially issued on June 17, 2025, and subsequently amended on August 28, 2025. The case remains in its early procedural stages, with no trials or appeals having occurred.",
    "46039": "On February 4, 2025, the Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association (FBIAA), a professional organization representing FBI agents, along with several individual FBI special agents and personnel (identified as John Does 1-4 and Jane Does 1-3) filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice and the United States of America. The plaintiffs, represented by private attorneys and counsel from a non-profit organization, alleged unlawful retaliation by the federal government for their involvement in investigations and prosecutions related to the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack. The individual plaintiffs were granted permission to proceed under pseudonyms by Chief Judge James E. Boasberg.\n\nThe factual basis for the suit stems from actions following the January 20, 2025, presidential inauguration, which included pardons or commutations for all individuals prosecuted for January 6-related conduct. Subsequently, the Department of Justice directed the FBI to compile lists of current and former FBI personnel involved in January 6 investigations and a separate terrorism case, *United States v. Haniyeh*. The plaintiffs alleged that these actions, including a survey sent to some FBI agents regarding their January 6 work, were part of an effort to target as many as 6,000 FBI employees for unlawful termination, transfer, or demotion. They contended that the public dissemination of their personal information and involvement in these sensitive cases would expose them and their families to violence, reputational harm, and damage their future employment prospects, citing past threats against FBI agents. The defendants, represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys, maintained that the information collection was for an internal review process, consistent with the President's authority to investigate potential misconduct within the Executive Branch, and that no public dissemination of identifying information was planned.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted causes of action under the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 552a(e)(6) and 552a(b)), the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)), and sought a writ of mandamus under 28 U.S.C. § 1361. They also alleged violations of their constitutional rights under the First Amendment (retaliation based on perceived political affiliation) and the Fifth Amendment (due process for reputational harm and intentional violation of privacy interests). The remedies sought included injunctive relief to prevent further collection or dissemination of their personally identifiable information, writs of mandamus, and the award of costs and attorneys' fees.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Jia M. Cobb and consolidated with a related case, *John and Jane Does 1-9 v. Department of Justice*, Civil Action No. 25-0325. On February 4, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). Following a hearing on February 6, 2025, Judge Cobb issued an administrative stay, temporarily prohibiting the government from disclosing the information at issue outside the Department of Justice. On February 7, 2025, with the consent of both parties, the Court deferred ruling on the plaintiffs' TRO motions and entered a consent order. This order stipulated that the government would not disseminate the list of FBI personnel (or any versions linking unique identifiers to names) to the public, directly or indirectly, before the Court ruled on the plaintiffs' anticipated motions for a preliminary injunction. The government retained the option to terminate this proscription by providing two business days' notice to the parties and the Court. A schedule was set for the plaintiffs to file their preliminary injunction motions by February 24, 2025, with responsive filings due by March 14, 2025, and replies by March 21, 2025. A preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled for March 27, 2025.",
    "46681": "On February 3, 2025, a private citizen, Gary L. Barnes, proceeding *pro se*, filed a complaint in the United States Court of International Trade against the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with the United States government as the defendant. The citizen alleged that the President unconstitutionally imposed tariffs on foreign products from Mexico, Canada, and China through executive orders, thereby usurping the legislative authority of Congress to lay and collect duties and raise revenue, as specified in Article I, Sections 7 and 8 of the United States Constitution. The complaint also asserted that the President violated his Oath of Office under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution and sought to compel the President to perform his duties in accordance with 28 U.S. Code § 1361.\n\nThe factual basis for the case stemmed from the President's January 20, 2025 declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, which was expanded on February 1, 2025, to include concerns about illicit drug flow from Mexico, Canada, and China. Invoking authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the National Emergencies Act, the President imposed various tariffs, including 25% on products from Mexico, 10-25% on Canadian goods, and 10% on Chinese products, which were subsequently modified and increased. The plaintiff contended that these tariffs constituted an indirect, hidden tax on United States citizens, adversely affecting household incomes and the quality of life, and undermining the constitutional separation of powers. The plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that the President lacked constitutional authority to impose such tariffs and that any legislative acts purporting to grant such authority were unconstitutional. Additionally, the plaintiff requested preliminary and permanent injunctions to halt the collection of these tariffs and prevent future similar actions.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Jennifer Choe-Groves. On March 21, 2025, the United States, represented by attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff lacked both Article III and prudential standing. The government contended that the plaintiff, as an American consumer, had not alleged a concrete and particularized injury in fact that was fairly traceable to the tariffs or redressable by the court. It characterized the plaintiff's alleged harms as abstract, speculative, and common to all citizens, rather than personal. The government also argued that prudential standing was lacking because the plaintiff was attempting to vindicate the rights of third parties, such as importers, who were better suited to litigate the validity of the tariffs, citing other cases like *V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump*, Court No. 25-00066, and *Princess Awesome, LLC v. U.S. Customs & Border Prot.*, Court No. 25-00078, as examples of importers challenging similar executive actions.\n\nOn April 22, 2025, the plaintiff filed a reply to the motion to dismiss, asserting that Article III of the Constitution does not explicitly require standing and that latitude should be granted for complaints concerning unconstitutional acts, especially given the \"concrete injury\" of a \"breach of the Constitutional Contract.\" The plaintiff clarified that the suit was primarily about the unconstitutional imposition of duties, not the resulting price increases, thus arguing that the injury was directly traceable to the President's actions and redressable by an injunction. The defendant filed a final reply on May 9, 2025, reiterating that the plaintiff's \"breach of the Constitutional Contract\" theory was foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent and that Article III standing requirements could not be relaxed.\n\nOn May 23, 2025, in Slip-Op. 25-65, Judge Jennifer Choe-Groves granted the defendant's motion to dismiss without prejudice. The court affirmed its exclusive jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i) over the constitutional challenge to the tariffs. However, the court ruled that the plaintiff failed to establish Article III standing, specifically the injury-in-fact requirement. The court found that the plaintiff's alleged injuries—based on the \"breach of the Constitutional Contract\" or general economic harm to consumers—were abstract, speculative, and not particularized to him in a personal and individual way, but rather common to all members of the public. Consequently, the court did not reach the merits of the constitutional challenge or the other standing elements. The court ordered that the plaintiff could file an amended complaint to resolve all pleading deficiencies on or before June 23, 2025.",
    "46758": "This putative class action was initially filed on June 20, 2025, by five individual petitioners and plaintiffs—Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Carlos Alexander Osorto, Isaac Antonio Villegas Molina, Jason Brian Gavidia, and Jorge Luis Hernandez Viramontes—along with four organizational plaintiffs: United Farm Workers of America, Los Angeles Worker Center Network, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center. The plaintiffs are represented by private attorneys and legal services organizations. They sued Kristi Noem, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Pam Bondi, Attorney General, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Todd M. Lyons, Acting Los Angeles Field Office Director of ICE, and several other senior federal officials. The case also saw the intervention of the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and several other cities, represented by government attorneys.\n\nThe legal foundation of the case involves claims under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 for habeas corpus relief, and broader civil rights claims alleging violations of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures and the Fifth Amendment's due process clause, particularly concerning detention conditions and the denial of counsel. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and release from immigration custody for individuals.\n\nThe factual basis of the case stems from \"Operation At Large,\" a federal immigration enforcement operation launched in Los Angeles on June 6, 2025, by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and ICE. Plaintiffs allege that federal agents, organized into \"contact teams\" or \"roving patrols,\" conducted detentive stops in public places without individualized reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation. These stops allegedly targeted individuals based solely on factors such as apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at specific locations (e.g., bus stops, carwashes, day laborer sites), or the type of work performed. Specific incidents included a U.S. citizen being stopped, questioned about his birthplace, and having his identification and phone taken; a dual U.S./Mexico citizen being detained at a carwash after being told his driver's license was insufficient; and three day laborers being handcuffed and detained at a bus stop without agents identifying themselves or stating the basis for arrest. These practices, the plaintiffs contend, generated significant fear within the community.\n\nThe case has been presided over by District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong and Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym. Initially, the individual petitioners filed an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent their transfer out of the Central District of California, which was withdrawn by stipulation after the defendants agreed to house them at Adelanto and not transfer them for a period. On July 2, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Petition and Complaint, adding class action claims. Subsequently, on July 3, 2025, plaintiffs filed two ex parte applications for TROs: one challenging the suspicionless stop-and-arrest practices and another concerning denial of access to counsel and illegal conditions of confinement.\n\nOn July 11, 2025, Judge Frimpong granted both TRO applications (2025 WL 1915964). The TRO enjoined defendants from conducting detentive stops in the Central District of California without reasonable suspicion and specifically prohibited them from relying *solely* on apparent race/ethnicity, language/accent, presence at a particular location, or type of work to form such suspicion, \"except as permitted by law.\"\n\nDefendants appealed the TRO to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (No. 25-4312) and filed emergency motions for a stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit initially denied these motions on July 16, 2025, for procedural non-compliance. Judge Frimpong also denied the defendants' ex parte application for a stay of the TRO in the District Court on July 17, 2025. On July 29, 2025, Judge Frimpong granted the motion of the cities and county to intervene in the case.\n\nPetitioner Carlos Osorto filed an ex parte application for release from immigration custody on July 21, 2025. On July 30, 2025, Magistrate Judge Pym granted Osorto's application, ordering his immediate release upon posting a $5,000 bond and subject to electronic location monitoring. The ruling cited the defendants' inconsistent arguments regarding the immigration court's jurisdiction for Osorto's bond hearing and Osorto's serious health issues as \"special and unusual circumstances.\"\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit largely denied the defendants' renewed motion for a stay pending appeal of the District Court's TRO. The appellate court stayed only the \"except as permitted by law\" clause in paragraph b. of the TRO, finding it impermissibly vague, but upheld the remainder of the injunction. The Ninth Circuit found that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a district-wide injunction, determining it was necessary to provide complete temporary relief to the plaintiffs given the nature of the challenged conduct. On August 13, 2025, Judge Frimpong denied the defendants' motion for reconsideration of the order allowing intervention. Plaintiffs have since filed motions for preliminary injunctions and class certification, with hearings scheduled for September 24, 2025. Another related case, *Bautista v. Santacruz, Jr.,* case no. 5:25-cv-01873-SSS-BFM, was referenced in the Osorto release order for raising parallel legal issues.",
    "46378": "On April 10, 2025, four international students—Chinmay Deore, Yogesh Joshi, Xiangyun Bu, and Qiuyi Yang—filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, and the Field Office Director of Detroit, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The students, who attended Wayne State University and the University of Michigan, alleged that their F-1 student status records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) were terminated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) between April 4 and April 8, 2025. They claimed this action was taken without prior notice or a meaningful explanation, and that it was part of a nationwide pattern of arbitrary terminations based on minor law enforcement encounters or unconfirmed visa revocations, despite their compliance with F-1 program rules. The students asserted that these terminations placed them at risk of immediate detention and deportation, disrupted their academic pursuits, and caused loss of employment.\n\nThe students' legal claims, brought under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), specifically 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), sought declaratory judgment that the terminations violated their due process rights and were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, including 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d). They also sought injunctive relief, including the restoration of their F-1 student status in SEVIS, the setting aside of the termination decisions, and prohibitions against their arrest, detention, transfer, or initiation of removal proceedings without proper notice and opportunity to contest. Their counsel included attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union Fund of Michigan and private law firms. The case was assigned to District Judge Stephen J. Murphy III.\n\nOn the same day the complaint was filed, the students moved for an emergency temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary injunction. The government defendants responded, arguing that a SEVIS record termination does not automatically revoke F-1 student status and that they did not believe the students had lost their lawful nonimmigrant status or were subject to removal proceedings. They further contended that the Privacy Act barred the APA claim, the agency action was not final, and the terminations were not arbitrary or capricious, citing information of criminal history matches for each student and prudential visa revocations for two of them. The government also requested that if a TRO were issued, the students should be required to post security. This case referenced other related federal district court cases, including *Liu v. Noem*, No. 25-cv-133 (D.N.H. April 9, 2025), which had issued a TRO on similar grounds.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, Judge Stephen J. Murphy III issued an order denying the students' motion for a temporary restraining order. The Court found that, based on the limited record, it could not determine if a SEVIS record termination was synonymous with an F-1 status termination or if it carried independent legal consequences. The Court also concluded that the students had not sufficiently demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their APA or due process claims, nor had they established a likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm, particularly given the government's representations that they did not believe the students had lost F-1 status or were removable.\n\nFollowing the denial of the TRO, the students filed an ex parte motion for immediate expedited discovery, which Judge Murphy partially granted on April 30, 2025. A preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled for May 19, 2025, and later extended to June 11, 2025. However, on May 29, 2025, the case was dismissed by a Stipulated Order of Dismissal, indicating an agreement between the parties, though the specific terms of any settlement were not detailed in the provided documents.",
    "46385": "On April 9, 2025, two law professors and attorneys, Sheila Bedi and Lynn Cohn, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The professors, who teach and represent clients at Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law, sued the United States House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce, its Chair Tim Walberg, and its Subcommittee Chair Burgess Owens. Northwestern University, its President Michael Schill, and the Chair of its Board of Trustees Peter Barris were named as nominal defendants, as they were the recipients of the Committee's demands and holders of the requested documents. The professors are represented by a mix of private counsel, legal services, and public interest organizations, including the Center for Constitutional Rights.\n\nThe professors alleged that the Committee issued an unconstitutional and overbroad demand for documents from Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law and its Bluhm Legal Clinic. This demand, issued on March 27, 2025, sought extensive and sensitive information, including policies on legal clinics, detailed budgets, funding sources, payments made by the Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic (directed by Professor Bedi), and Professor Bedi's hiring materials and performance reviews. The Committee’s letter accused the law school and the plaintiffs of engaging in \"left-wing advocacy\" and \"left-wing political activism,\" specifically referencing Professor Bedi's pro bono representation of protesters involved in a 2024 pro-Palestinian human rights protest. The plaintiffs contended that the Committee's stated justification—investigating antisemitic conduct—was a pretext for targeting viewpoints and causes with which it disagreed, and that the demand was part of a broader effort by the federal government to intimidate and punish institutions and individuals for disfavored speech.\n\nThe lawsuit asserted four causes of action: violations of the First Amendment (free speech, freedom of association, right to petition, academic freedom, and retaliation), Fifth Amendment (due process and equal protection), and Sixth Amendment (right to counsel). The professors sought declaratory judgment that the Committee's demands were unconstitutional and immediate as well as permanent injunctive relief to prevent Northwestern University from producing, and the Committee from obtaining, the demanded documents.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Elaine E. Bucklo. On April 9, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), requesting a ruling before Northwestern's compliance deadline of April 10, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. CT. On April 10, 2025, Judge Andrea R. Wood, sitting as emergency judge, held a hearing and denied the plaintiffs' emergency motion for a TRO as moot, without prejudice. On April 17, 2025, Judge Bucklo ruled that the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file excess pages for the TRO motion was also moot. On June 20, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a joint motion to stay proceedings, which Judge Bucklo granted on June 24, 2025, effectively pausing the case until further court order. The case remains stayed, with a status hearing scheduled for September 22, 2025.",
    "46353": "The case of *John Doe v. Donald J. Trump, et al.* was initially filed on April 7, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiff, an individual software engineer from a predominantly Muslim country, was in lawful F-1 (student) status, employed under Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Optional Practical Training (OPT) employment authorization. He was represented by private counsel.\n\nThe plaintiff alleged that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), abruptly and unlawfully terminated his Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record on March 28, 2025. The stated reason for termination was \"Failure to maintain status,\" citing a criminal records check, specifically Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 237(a)(1)(C)(i). The plaintiff contended that his only criminal history was a minor misdemeanor conviction that did not warrant termination, and of which DHS had prior knowledge, having approved subsequent immigration benefits. He further alleged that this policy of SEVIS terminations disproportionately targeted African, Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim, and Asian students, coercing them into \"self-deportation\" or leading to arrests and transfers to distant detention facilities. The termination jeopardized his employment, ability to change to an H-1B work visa, and his path to lawful permanent resident status as the spouse of a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe plaintiff brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for unauthorized, arbitrary, and capricious agency action, as well as violations of procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment. He sought a declaratory judgment that the SEVIS termination was unlawful, an order vacating the termination and restoring his SEVIS record and status, and injunctive relief to prevent his arrest, detention, transfer, or removal from the United States.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White and was related to several other similar cases involving international students whose SEVIS records had been terminated. On April 16, 2025, the plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). The defendants, including the President of the United States, the Secretary of DHS, and officials from ICE, opposed the motion, arguing that SEVIS record termination did not equate to a loss of F-1 status, was not a final agency action, and did not cause irreparable harm. They contended that SEVIS was merely a database to monitor student compliance and that the plaintiff's alleged harms were speculative or monetary.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, Judge White granted an ex parte TRO, enjoining the defendants for 14 days from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring the plaintiff, and declaring the SEVIS termination without legal force to maintain his F-1 status and OPT employment. Following a hearing on April 25, 2025, the court extended the TRO for an additional 14 days, until May 15, 2025, and reiterated that defendants were enjoined from imposing any legal effect from the SEVIS termination or potential F-1 visa revocation. During this period, the defendants informed the court that ICE was developing a new policy framework for SEVIS record terminations and, until then, would reactivate the SEVIS records for the plaintiffs in this and related cases. The plaintiff subsequently confirmed his SEVIS record was reactivated.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, Judge White granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. Subsequently, on July 21, 2025, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging the preliminary injunction order (USCA Case Number 25-4514). The defendants then filed a motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal, which Judge White granted in part and denied in part on August 22, 2025.",
    "46337": "On April 3, 2025, nineteen states, represented by their respective Attorneys General, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the President of the United States, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and its Commissioners, and the Secretary of Defense. The lawsuit challenged Executive Order No. 14248, \"Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,\" issued by President Donald J. Trump on March 25, 2025.\n\nThe states alleged that the Executive Order unconstitutionally usurped their inherent sovereignty and powers to regulate federal elections, as granted by the U.S. Constitution's Elections Clause (Article I, Section 4) and Electors Clause (Article II, Section 1). They further contended that the Executive Order violated the separation of powers doctrine, the Bicameralism and Presentment Clauses of Article I, and was ultra vires (beyond legal power) by attempting to unilaterally amend or circumvent federal statutes such as the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). The states sought a declaratory judgment that specific provisions of the Executive Order were unlawful and void, and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent their implementation and enforcement by all defendants except the President.\n\nSpecifically, the challenged provisions of the Executive Order aimed to:\n1.  Require the EAC to amend the federal mail voter registration form (Federal Form) to demand documentary proof of U.S. citizenship and mandate state officials record this information.\n2.  Require the head of each federal voter registration agency (including state public assistance offices) to assess citizenship before providing the Federal Form.\n3.  Command the Secretary of Defense to update the Federal Post Card Application (used by military and overseas voters) to require documentary proof of citizenship and proof of eligibility to vote in state elections.\n4.  Direct the U.S. Attorney General to enforce a strict interpretation of federal Election Day statutes (2 U.S.C. § 7 and 3 U.S.C. § 1) that would prohibit states from counting absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day, even if postmarked on or before that date.\n5.  Require the EAC to condition the disbursement of federal HAVA funding to states on their compliance with this Election Day ballot receipt deadline.\n\nThe states argued that these directives would impose significant, unfunded administrative burdens, divert state resources, and would likely disenfranchise eligible voters, causing irreparable harm.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, the defendants moved to transfer or stay the case, citing a related case, *League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Exec. Off. of the President*, 2025 WL 1187730 (D.D.C. Apr. 24, 2025), which involved private parties challenging some of the same Executive Order provisions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Judge Denise J. Casper denied the defendants' motion on May 9, 2025, finding that the cases were distinct due to different parties and challenged provisions.\n\nOn June 6, 2025, Judge Casper held a motion hearing on the states' request for a preliminary injunction. Amicus curiae briefs were filed by local election officials and a bipartisan group of former secretaries of state in support of the plaintiffs, and by the Republican Party of Arizona. On June 13, 2025, Judge Casper issued a Memorandum and Order (25-cv-10810-DJC, D. 107) and an Order of Preliminary Injunction (25-cv-10810-DJC, D. 108), finding that the states were likely to succeed on the merits, faced irreparable harm, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored injunctive relief. The court declined to require the states to post a bond.\n\nThe preliminary injunction, as amended on July 18, 2025 (25-cv-10810-DJC, D. 116), enjoined the defendants (excluding the President) from:\n*   Implementing Section 2(a) of the Executive Order, which mandated documentary proof of citizenship for the federal voter registration form and required states to record related information.\n*   Implementing Section 3(d) of the Executive Order, which required the Secretary of Defense to update the federal postcard application to demand documentary proof of citizenship and state eligibility for military and overseas voters.\n*   Implementing Section 2(d) of the Executive Order, which required federal voter registration agencies to assess citizenship prior to providing the federal voter registration form to public assistance enrollees, specifically as to the Plaintiff States.\n*   Implementing civil or criminal enforcement actions pursuant to Section 7(a) of the Executive Order regarding the counting of ballots received after Election Day, as to the Ballot Receipt States (California, Nevada, Massachusetts, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Rhode Island).\n*   Implementing Section 7(b) of the Executive Order, which conditioned EAC funding on states adopting an Election Day ballot receipt deadline, against the Ballot Receipt States.\n\nThe preliminary injunction remains in effect unless modified by the court. On July 31, 2025, the defendants filed a Notice of Appeal to the First Circuit Court of Appeals (USCA Case Number 25-1726).",
    "46238": "On March 17, 2025, two active-duty service members, Master Sergeant Logan Ireland and Staff Sergeant Nicholas Bear Bade, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. They were represented by private counsel and legal advocacy organizations, including GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders and the National Center for Lesbian Rights. The service members, both transgender men, sued Peter B. Hegseth in his official capacity as Secretary of Defense, the United States of America, Gary Ashworth in his official capacity as Acting Secretary of the Air Force, and the United States Department of the Air Force.\n\nThe lawsuit challenged President Donald J. Trump’s January 27, 2025, Executive Order 14183 (\"Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness\"), his January 20, 2025, Executive Order 14168 (\"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government\"), and related implementing memoranda from the Department of Defense and United States Air Force. These directives reversed existing policy by banning transgender people from military service and subjecting transgender service members to unequal treatment. The service members alleged that the new policy required them to serve in their birth sex (as women), which was not possible given their medical transitions, and feared involuntary administrative separation proceedings could begin as early as March 26, 2025. Both plaintiffs had already been placed on administrative absence and removed from their assignments.\n\nThe service members asserted violations of the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection component, arguing that the policy constituted class-based discrimination by excluding transgender individuals from service, requiring them to serve in their birth sex, and employing a discriminatory definition of sex. They also claimed violations of Procedural Due Process and sought relief under the doctrine of Estoppel, having reasonably relied on prior military policies allowing open service for transgender individuals. They requested declaratory judgments, permanent injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the ban and unequal treatment, a preliminary injunction to hold open voluntary separation offers, and attorneys' fees.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Christine P. O’Hearn. On March 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which the court scheduled for a hearing on March 24, 2025. Defendants opposed the TRO, citing judicial deference to military judgment and arguing that the policy was based on medical conditions rather than animus, and that plaintiffs had not exhausted administrative remedies. Defendants also noted a related case, *Talbott v. United States*, 2025 WL 842332 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025), where a nationwide preliminary injunction against the same policy had been issued, though it was subject to a motion to dissolve and potential appeal. Another parallel case, *Shilling v. United States*, Case No. 1:25-cv-241 (W.D. Wash.), was also referenced.\n\nOn March 24, 2025, Judge O’Hearn granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a 14-day TRO. The court found that the plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, particularly regarding the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, and that they would suffer irreparable harm, including damage to their careers and reputations, if the injunction was denied. The TRO enjoined the defendants from initiating administrative separation proceedings against the plaintiffs based on their transgender status and from enforcing or implementing any aspect of the challenged orders against them. It also required defendants to immediately notify relevant personnel of the order. Defendants' subsequent request to stay the TRO was denied on March 26, 2025.\n\nOn May 15, 2025, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice.",
    "46234": "On March 15, 2025, Momodou Taal, a non-citizen Ph.D. student at Cornell University, along with two U.S. citizen associates, Professor Mũkoma Wa Ngũgĩ and Ph.D. student Sriram Parasurama, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and attorneys from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and Project TAHA, sued President Donald J. Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem in their official capacities.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged two executive orders issued by President Trump: Executive Order 14161, \"Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats\" (90 Fed. Reg. 8451, Jan. 30, 2025), and Executive Order 14188, \"Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism\" (90 Fed. Reg. 8847, Feb. 3, 2025). They alleged these orders violated their First Amendment rights to free speech, to listen, and to association, as well as their Fifth Amendment due process rights, by imposing vague, overbroad, and viewpoint-based restrictions on speech critical of the U.S. government, its institutions, American culture, or the government of Israel. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief to vacate and enjoin enforcement of specific provisions of the executive orders, and attorney fees.\n\nThe factual basis for the case stemmed from President Trump's public statements vowing to deport non-citizen students who participated in protests and to prosecute citizens for activities labeled \"anti-Semitic.\" Plaintiff Taal, a vocal critic of U.S. foreign policy and supporter of Palestinian human rights, had been targeted by pro-Israel groups and government officials for his activism. On March 9, 2025, DHS arrested another former student activist, Mahmoud Khalil, citing President Trump's executive orders. On March 14, 2025, the U.S. Department of State revoked Mr. Taal's F-1 student visa, leading U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to attempt to locate and detain him for removal proceedings. The plaintiffs asserted that this action, based on Mr. Taal's protected speech, severely chilled their expressive and associational activities.\n\nPresiding over the case was U.S. District Judge Elizabeth C. Coombe. The plaintiffs filed motions for a temporary restraining order (Dkt. 2, 23) to prevent the executive orders' enforcement, particularly against Mr. Taal. On March 27, 2025, Judge Coombe denied these motions (Dkt. 40). The court found it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enjoin Mr. Taal's removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(b)(9) and 1252(a)(5), noting that Mr. Taal would have the opportunity to raise constitutional challenges in immigration courts and on appeal. The court also determined that claims challenging EO 1 were constitutionally unripe, and the citizen-plaintiffs (Ngũgĩ and Parasurama) lacked standing to challenge EO 2, as their alleged harm (lack of access to Taal's speech and fear of prosecution) was either not redressable by the court given Taal's visa revocation or too speculative, respectively.\n\nFollowing this denial, on March 27, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint and Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus (Dkt. 38), adding the U.S. Department of State, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, Acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons, and Buffalo ICE Field Office Director Thomas Brophy as defendants-respondents. This amended filing reiterated the constitutional claims and added causes of action under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. § 1201(i), § 1227) and the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. § 706), also including a claim for retaliation and prior restraint under the First Amendment and a due process claim under the Fifth Amendment and Suspension Clause (28 U.S.C. § 2241). An emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (Dkt. 41) was filed based on the amended complaint.\n\nHowever, before the court ruled on the second set of temporary restraining order motions, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal without prejudice on March 31, 2025 (Dkt. 50). On April 2, 2025, Judge Coombe issued an order closing the case pursuant to the plaintiffs' voluntary dismissal (Dkt. 51).",
    "46216": "This case was filed on March 12, 2025, by two doctors, Gordon Schiff and Celeste Royce, both professors at Harvard Medical School, as individual plaintiffs. They are represented by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Massachusetts, Inc., the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, and the Media Freedom & Information Access Clinic at Yale Law School. The doctors sued the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and its Acting Director, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and its Acting Director.\n\nThe factual basis of the case stems from President Trump’s Executive Order 14168, issued on January 20, 2025, which directed federal agencies to remove all communications that “promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.” In response, OPM issued guidance on January 29, 2025, directing agencies to take down \"all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) that inculcate or promote gender ideology\" by January 31, 2025. HHS then issued its own guidance. Following these directives, AHRQ, an agency within HHS, removed several peer-reviewed articles from its Patient Safety Network (PSNet) website, a leading national online resource for patient safety research, because they contained terms such as “LGBTQ” and “transgender.” Among the removed articles were two commentaries authored by Dr. Schiff and Dr. Royce, which discussed suicide risk assessment and endometriosis diagnosis, respectively, and mentioned these terms in the context of identifying high-risk or specific patient populations. AHRQ offered to republish these articles only if the doctors agreed to remove the \"forbidden terms,\" which the doctors refused, citing scientific accuracy and ethical concerns.\n\nThe doctors alleged violations of their First Amendment rights, arguing that the removal constituted viewpoint-based and unreasonable restrictions on their speech in a government-run forum. They also claimed violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), asserting that the agencies' actions were arbitrary and capricious, and that OPM had exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the guidance. The doctors sought declaratory judgment that the censorship was unlawful, an order for the restoration of their censored research, and injunctive relief prohibiting further censorship.\n\nThe case is presided over by Judge Leo T. Sorokin. On April 1, 2025, the doctors filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. The federal agencies opposed the motion, arguing, among other points, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the doctors lacked standing and that the issues were moot or not ripe for adjudication. The agencies also noted that PSNet's contract expired on March 24, 2025, rendering it a static website unable to accept new content, including the restoration of articles. The agencies also referenced a related case, *Doctors for America et al., v. OPM et al.* (D.D.C. Case No. 1:25-cv-00322-JDB), where similar relief was sought.\n\nOn May 23, 2025, Judge Sorokin issued an Order granting in part the doctors' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the doctors were likely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment claims, particularly regarding viewpoint discrimination, and that they would suffer irreparable harm without relief. The judge rejected the federal agencies' jurisdictional arguments, stating that the doctors had standing and that the PSNet contract expiration did not negate redressability. The court found that OPM likely exceeded its statutory authority and that the agencies' actions were arbitrary and capricious. A Preliminary Injunction was issued on the same day, ordering the federal agencies to, within seven days, restore to PSNet complete, unaltered versions of Dr. Schiff’s commentary on suicide risk, Dr. Royce’s commentary on endometriosis, and all other content authored by private parties that was removed from PSNet pursuant to the federal agencies' implementation of Executive Order No. 14,168. No security bond was required. This preliminary injunction is to remain in effect until judgment is entered in the matter.\n\nFollowing the preliminary injunction, on June 16, 2025, the federal agencies filed a motion to dismiss the entire complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, again asserting that the claims were moot, the doctors lacked standing, and challenges to future implementation were not ripe. Briefing on this motion concluded on July 28, 2025.",
    "46207": "This class action lawsuit was filed on March 7, 2025, by three incarcerated individuals—a transgender woman and two transgender men—diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The plaintiffs brought the action on behalf of themselves and a class of all persons currently or who will be incarcerated in BOP facilities with a current diagnosis of gender dysphoria or who receive such a diagnosis in the future. They are represented by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, Transgender Law Center, and ACLU Foundation of the District of Columbia. The defendants include the President of the United States, the Attorney General of the United States, the Acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), and several Assistant Directors of the BOP's divisions, all sued in their official capacities. The defendants are represented by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe case alleges that the defendants violated the plaintiffs' rights under the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The factual basis for the suit stems from Executive Order 14168, titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” issued by the President on January 20, 2025. This Executive Order, particularly Section 4(c), directed the Attorney General and BOP to revise policies to prohibit the use of federal funds for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug intended \"for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\" The BOP subsequently issued two implementing memoranda in February 2025, which banned the purchase of \"transgender ideology\" items, denied requests for gender-affirming clothing, mandated biological-sex pronouns, and prohibited federal funds for gender-affirming medical treatments.\n\nPrior to these directives, the plaintiffs had been receiving gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy and social accommodations (such as gender-affirming clothing and commissary items), from the BOP to treat their gender dysphoria, a serious medical condition causing significant distress. Following the Executive Order and implementing memoranda, their hormone therapy was either discontinued or reduced, and access to social accommodations was denied, leading to increased anxiety, depression, thoughts of self-harm, and suicidal ideation. Although the hormone therapy for two of the named plaintiffs was later restored, the plaintiffs alleged this was a temporary measure in response to this litigation and a related case, *Doe v. McHenry*, Case No. 1:25-cv-00286-RCL (D.D.C.), rather than a permanent policy change, and social accommodations remained unavailable. An amicus brief supporting the defendants was filed by Indiana, Idaho, and 22 other states on April 1, 2025, arguing that the regulation of such medical practices falls within policymakers' authority. A motion to intervene was filed by Carla C. Keys on July 14, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to set aside the implementing memoranda, enjoin the enforcement of Executive Order 14168 as applied to BOP medical care and accommodations, and order the continuation of gender-affirming health care in accordance with prior BOP policy. They also sought a stay of agency action and provisional class certification.\n\nPresiding over the case, Judge Royce C. Lamberth issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order on June 3, 2025 (2025 WL 4218003), granting the plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction and class certification. The court determined that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their APA claims, finding the BOP's implementing memoranda arbitrary and capricious due to a lack of reasoned explanation, disparate treatment of gender dysphoria, and failure to acknowledge a significant policy reversal. The court also found a likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs and that the balance of equities and public interest favored an injunction. The court certified the class as \"all persons who are currently or will be incarcerated in BOP facilities with a current diagnosis of gender dysphoria or who receive such a diagnosis in the future\" and appointed the plaintiffs' attorneys as class counsel. The June 3, 2025, order enjoined the BOP to make social accommodations and hormone therapy available to all class members to the same extent as before the Executive Order's issuance. On August 20, 2025, Judge Lamberth granted a renewed preliminary injunction, enjoining the defendants from implementing Section 4(c) of Executive Order 14168 against any class member from September 1, 2025, to November 30, 2025. The President was not dismissed as a defendant at this early stage, as declaratory relief against him remained a possibility.",
    "46104": "On February 11, 2025, American Oversight, a nonpartisan, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), U.S. DOGE Service (USDS), U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization (USDSTO), U.S. Digital Service, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The case, assigned to Judge Beryl A. Howell, was initiated under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. American Oversight, represented by its in-house counsel, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the defendants to comply with FOIA, including processing FOIA requests on an expedited basis, conducting adequate searches for responsive records, and producing all non-exempt records.\n\nThe factual basis for the lawsuit stems from eight FOIA requests submitted by American Oversight between January 30 and February 3, 2025. Two requests sought expedited processing for records concerning President Trump’s January 24, 2025, removal of at least seventeen federal agency inspectors general. The other six requests sought records regarding the former U.S. Digital Service's pre-inauguration communications with the then-nascent, non-governmental DOGE, and post-inauguration records related to DOGE’s communications with external entities, its staffing, and Elon Musk’s employment and calendars. American Oversight alleges that DOGE, purportedly led by Elon Musk, has exercised substantial independent authority, including deploying staff to multiple executive branch agencies, gaining access to sensitive computer systems at agencies like USAID and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and making decisions regarding agency payments and personnel. These actions, along with the funding of DOGE via the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. § 1535) and conflicting public statements by government officials regarding DOGE's status and Musk's role, assertedly demonstrate that DOGE functions as an \"agency\" subject to FOIA. American Oversight further alleges that DOGE's use of ephemeral messaging and records retention practices raise concerns about federal record preservation. Defendants failed to respond to the expedited processing requests within the statutory ten days and did not make final determinations or produce records for any of the requests within twenty working days, leading to constructive exhaustion of administrative remedies.\n\nThe case has seen several important filings and rulings. An Amended Complaint was filed on March 5, 2025. On March 20, 2025, defendants filed a motion for an extension of time to respond to the complaint, which Judge Howell granted on April 2, 2025, setting an answer deadline of April 21, 2025. American Oversight filed a motion for a preservation order on March 24, 2025, which Judge Howell granted on April 2, 2025, requiring DOGE to preserve all records responsive to the eight FOIA requests at issue and to disclose whether all such records have been preserved. Defendants filed an Amended Answer on April 24, 2025, and a Joint Status Report on May 5, 2025, which indicated a dispute over whether American Oversight should be permitted limited discovery to determine DOGE’s agency status. On May 23, 2025, Judge Howell issued a minute order setting a briefing schedule for a motion for limited discovery. American Oversight filed its Motion for Limited Discovery on June 2, 2025, followed by defendants' opposition on June 16, 2025, and American Oversight's reply on June 23, 2025. The case references related litigation, including *AFL-CIO v. Dep't of Lab.*, 2025 WL 542825, and *CREW v. U.S. DOGE Serv.*, 2025 WL 752367, where other courts in the District of Columbia found DOGE likely an agency subject to FOIA.",
    "46602": "On May 15, 2025, two nonprofit organizations, the Oregon Council for the Humanities (doing business as Oregon Humanities) and the Federation of State Humanities Councils (a national federation representing 55 of the 56 state and jurisdictional humanities councils), filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon before Judge Michael H. Simon. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sued the United States DOGE Service, its Acting Administrator Amy Gleason, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), its advisory National Council on the Humanities, and its Acting Chairman Michael McDonald. The lawsuit was later updated with an Amended Complaint on June 11, 2025. Amicus curiae briefs supporting the plaintiffs were filed by the attorneys general of Oregon, Maryland, Washington, and thirteen other states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the defendants unlawfully disrupted and attempted to dismantle the congressionally established federal-state partnership, through which the NEH funds state humanities councils. Congress created the NEH in 1965 to promote humanities nationwide, emphasizing accessibility for all Americans, including underrepresented communities, and established a Federal/State Partnership in 1972 with mandatory statutory formulas for funding state councils. These councils, including Oregon Humanities, rely heavily on NEH funding to support local public humanities projects.\n\nThe factual basis of the case began in January 2025 with the establishment of the United States DOGE Service (DOGE) by Executive Order, tasked with reducing federal spending. In March and April 2025, DOGE directed the NEH to review grants for alignment with new Executive Orders. On April 2, 2025, the NEH, in consultation with DOGE, abruptly terminated nearly all open grants to state and jurisdictional humanities councils, including general operating support and special initiative grants, without prior notice, opportunity for a hearing, or an appeal process. The stated reason was that grants \"no longer effectuate the agency's needs and priorities\" in furtherance of the President's agenda. Concurrently, the NEH underwent a major restructuring, with over 65% of its staff, including almost all staff in the Federal/State Partnership office, being terminated or placed on administrative leave, severely impairing its statutory duties. These actions caused immediate and severe harm, forcing state councils to lay off staff, cancel programs (e.g., rural library support, youth mental health, language preservation, historical exhibits), and jeopardizing their financial stability.\n\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, on June 2, 2025, the NEH issued \"partial rescission\" notices for some fiscal year 2025 general operating support grants, restoring funding to 20% of the appropriated amount, which the NEH claimed was the statutory minimum. This was a significant reduction from previous funding levels (often 40%) and did not address all terminated grants or the lack of due process.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging unlawful withholding or unreasonable delay of agency action (5 U.S.C. § 706(1)) and agency action contrary to law or arbitrary and capricious (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)). They also alleged violations of the U.S. Constitution's Separation of Powers doctrine (specifically the Appropriations, Spending, and Take Care Clauses) and that the defendants' actions were ultra vires and violated the Impoundment Control Act (ICA) (2 U.S.C. §§ 681 et seq.), the latter forming a basis for their APA claims. The remedies sought included declaratory judgments that the defendants' actions were unlawful, arbitrary, and unconstitutional, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to compel agency action, set aside unlawful terminations, and enjoin the defendants from disrupting funding. They also sought attorney fees.\n\nOn August 6, 2025, Judge Michael H. Simon issued an Opinion and Order granting in part the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and a stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 of the APA. The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their Separation of Powers and APA claims (including that the actions were contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious, particularly in violation of the ICA's procedural requirements and the NEH's governing statutes regarding grant termination and funding formulas). The court determined that the defendants' actions were not committed to agency discretion and constituted final agency action. It rejected the defendants' arguments that the court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act and that the ICA precluded APA review. The court also found that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without relief and that the balance of equities and public interest favored the plaintiffs.\n\nThe court's decree declared the defendants' April 2, 2025 grant terminations unlawful and enjoined the defendants from implementing those terminations for grants awarded to the Oregon Council for the Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils (including all member councils). The defendants were further enjoined from terminating, suspending, or canceling these grants without cause specified in 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7) and from obligating, loaning, encumbering, disbursing, or otherwise disposing of the committed funds to any party other than the plaintiffs. A parallel APA stay was issued against the NEH, National Council on the Humanities, and Michael McDonald, preventing them from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations and from diverting committed funds. The injunction and stay are effective until further court order or a written agreement between the parties. The court denied the defendants' request for an administrative stay pending appeal and declined to require a bond from the plaintiffs, noting the public interest nature of the lawsuit.",
    "46478": "On April 22, 2025, two American family-owned businesses, Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc., filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the President of the United States and various federal agencies and officials, including the Secretaries of Homeland Security, Treasury, and Commerce, and the U.S. Trade Representative. The plaintiffs, who develop and sell educational products and import most of their goods from overseas, are represented by private counsel.\n\nThis case challenges a series of executive orders issued by the President, beginning in February 2025, which imposed significant tariffs on imported goods. These \"Challenged Orders\" invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement tariffs, initially a 10% and then a 20% ad valorem duty on Chinese goods, citing the influx of synthetic opioids. Subsequently, a \"Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order\" imposed a 10% universal tariff on most trading partners and additional country-specific tariffs, declaring a national emergency over \"large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits.\" Following retaliatory measures, the tariffs on Chinese imports were increased to a minimum of 145%. The President's administration asserted that these tariffs, estimated to generate up to $600 billion annually, are necessary to address national security and economic threats, rebalance global trade, and stem illicit drug flows.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the President's actions are *ultra vires*, exceeding the authority granted by IEEPA, which they contend does not authorize the imposition of tariffs. They argued that even if IEEPA could be interpreted to permit tariffs, the specific tariffs imposed were unlawful because they did not address an \"unusual and extraordinary threat,\" were not \"reasonably related\" to the declared emergencies, and were applied to property owned by U.S. nationals. The plaintiffs further claimed that if IEEPA is interpreted to grant such broad tariff-setting power, it constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under Article I, Sections 1 and 8, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution (nondelegation doctrine and Congress's power to tax). They also alleged that the implementing agency actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, including preliminary and permanent injunctions to prevent the collection of these tariffs from them, to set aside the agency actions modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, and to recover attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Rudolph Contreras. Defendants promptly filed a motion to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), arguing that the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising from laws providing for tariffs. The plaintiffs concurrently filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, asserting that the tariffs posed an existential threat to their businesses, causing irreparable harm through lost sales, increased costs (projected at over $100 million annually), and disrupted supply chains. Several amicus curiae briefs were filed, including one by a group of law professors and former government officials supporting the plaintiffs' position on the merits and the unconstitutionality of the tariffs.\n\nOn May 29, 2025, Judge Contreras issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order (2025 WL 3462943), denying the defendants' motion to transfer and granting the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court ruled that IEEPA is not a \"law . . . providing for tariffs,\" thus establishing its own jurisdiction and concluding that the President's tariff actions were *ultra vires*. The Court also found that the plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm and that the balance of equities and public interest favored injunctive relief, noting that any broader foreign policy consequences would likely stem from a separate, more sweeping permanent injunction issued by a three-judge panel of the CIT in a related case, *V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States*, 2025 WL 1514124 (Ct. Int’l Trade May 28, 2025).\n\nThe defendants filed a Notice of Appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court (USCA Case Number 25-5202) on May 29, 2025. On June 2, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal, arguing a strong likelihood of success on appeal regarding both jurisdiction and the merits, and emphasizing the irreparable harm to U.S. foreign policy and national security if the tariffs were undermined. On June 3, 2025, Judge Contreras granted the defendants' motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending the D.C. Circuit's appeal, noting that the CIT's related injunction had also been stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The case is currently stayed in the District Court pending the D.C. Circuit's resolution of the appeal.",
    "46390": "On April 12, 2025, two Venezuelan civil immigration detainees, D.B.U. and R.M.M., filed a class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado against President Donald J. Trump and various U.S. government officials and agencies, including the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, the plaintiffs alleged violations of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA, 50 U.S.C. § 21 et seq.), the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.), including specific provisions for asylum and withholding of removal (§§ 1158, 1231(b)(3)), protections under the Convention Against Torture (via 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note), the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and the Suspension Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2). The action was brought as a class petition for a writ of habeas corpus (28 U.S.C. § 2241 et seq.) and a class complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief (28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq.), seeking to halt their summary removal and transfers.\n\nThe case arose from a March 14, 2025 Presidential Proclamation invoking the AEA, which designated the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organization\" perpetrating an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" against the United States. The Proclamation authorized the summary apprehension, detention, and removal of Venezuelan noncitizens aged 14 or older identified as TdA members, bypassing standard immigration procedures. Following the Proclamation, over 130 Venezuelan noncitizens were reportedly summarily removed to a detention facility in El Salvador without adequate notice or opportunity to contest their designation. D.B.U. and R.M.M., both Venezuelan nationals detained in Colorado, denied TdA affiliation but feared imminent removal under the Proclamation due to ICE allegations of gang ties based on circumstantial evidence and tattoos.\n\nUpon filing, the plaintiffs also moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and class certification. U.S. District Judge Charlotte N. Sweeney initially issued a minute order on April 14, 2025, under the All Writs Act, temporarily enjoining the defendants from removing the named plaintiffs and the proposed class from the District of Colorado. On April 22, 2025, Judge Sweeney granted the plaintiffs' emergency motion for a TRO, provisionally certified the class, and ordered the government to provide 21 days' notice in a language the individual understood, detailing the intent to remove, the right to judicial review, and the opportunity to consult an attorney. The court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits, ruling that the Proclamation exceeded the President's statutory authority under the AEA, as TdA did not constitute a \"foreign nation or government\" and its activities did not meet the definition of \"invasion\" or \"predatory incursion.\" The court also found the government's proposed 12-to-24-hour notice period constitutionally deficient.\n\nThe government appealed the TRO to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on April 23, 2025, and sought an emergency stay, arguing the district court lacked jurisdiction and that the Proclamation was lawful. On April 29, 2025, the Tenth Circuit denied the government's emergency motion for a stay, citing the government's failure to demonstrate irreparable harm, especially given a concurrent U.S. Supreme Court order (A.A.R.P. v. Trump, 145 S. Ct. 1034 (2025)) preventing removal of a similar class. The government voluntarily dismissed this appeal on May 12, 2025.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, Judge Sweeney issued two further orders: one granting the plaintiffs' motion for class certification for \"All noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua' and/or its implementation.\" The second order granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the defendants from detaining, transferring, or removing the certified class members from the District of Colorado under the AEA based on the Proclamation. This preliminary injunction superseded the TRO and eliminated its 21-day notice requirement, as the court found removals under the Proclamation unlawful. On July 7, 2025, the government filed a new notice of appeal to the Tenth Circuit, challenging both the class certification and preliminary injunction orders.",
    "46499": "On April 11, 2025, several individual international students, represented by private counsel and the Chinese American Legal Defense Alliance, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs, primarily Chinese nationals pursuing advanced degrees or practical training under F-1 student visas, sued Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Todd Lyons, in his official capacity as Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The lawsuit alleged that in early April 2025, DHS and ICE, as part of a \"Student Criminal Alien Initiative,\" initiated a mass termination of Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records for hundreds, if not thousands, of F-1 international students nationwide. These terminations, which required students to immediately leave the country, end their studies, and lose employment authorization, were allegedly conducted without notice, explanation, or due process. The stated reasons were vague, often citing \"criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked,\" despite many affected students having no criminal convictions, only dismissed charges, or minor incidents.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging arbitrary and capricious agency action and action contrary to constitutional right, and under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. They sought a declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to halt the unlawful terminations, restore their legal status, and recover attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nInitially assigned to Judge Susan Illston, the case was promptly met with a motion for a nationwide temporary restraining order (TRO). On April 18, 2025, Judge Illston granted a 14-day TRO for the named plaintiffs, enjoining the defendants from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring them, and from imposing any legal effect from the SEVIS terminations or potential F-1 visa revocations. The case was subsequently reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White on April 22, 2025, and related to several other similar lawsuits filed in the district, including *John Doe v. Trump* (25-cv-03140-JSW), *S.Y. v. Noem* (25-cv-03244-JSW), *W.B. v. Noem* (25-cv-03407-JSW), and *J.C. v. Noem* (25-cv-03502-JSW). Other related cases were later dismissed by stipulation.\n\nFollowing the initial TRO, the government reactivated the SEVIS records of all affected students, including the plaintiffs, and issued new policy guidance. However, the plaintiffs continued to pursue broader relief, noting that many F-1 visas had also been revoked by the Department of State (State). On May 22, 2025, Judge White granted a preliminary injunction with a nationwide scope. This order enjoined the defendants from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring any named plaintiffs or similarly situated individuals nationwide, imposing adverse legal effects due to SEVIS record terminations, or reversing SEVIS reinstatements for reasons not specified in 8 C.F.R. § 214.1, pending the resolution of the proceedings. The court also waived a bond requirement.\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint, adding Marco Rubio, in his official capacity as Secretary of State, as a defendant. The amended complaint specifically challenged State's mass revocation of F-1 visas, arguing these actions were unlawful under the APA and that 8 U.S.C. § 1201(i), the provision State relied upon, did not apply to mass cancellations by subordinate officials or to individuals already present in the U.S. The plaintiffs sought to restore their revoked visas and prevent further unlawful actions by State.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit (Case Number 25-4521) challenging Judge White's preliminary injunction. Subsequently, on August 8, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal, citing the Supreme Court's recent decision in *Trump v. CASA, Inc.* (145 S. Ct. 2540), which limited the authority of federal courts to issue universal injunctions. On August 22, 2025, Judge White partially granted the defendants' motion, staying the nationwide scope of the preliminary injunction but maintaining its protections for the named plaintiffs in the consolidated cases.",
    "46319": "On March 31, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), a labor union representing federal government employees, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The union sued the President of the United States, the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the heads of several U.S. departments and agencies, including Treasury, Justice, Health and Human Services, Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Communications Commission, and Interior. The NTEU, represented by its in-house counsel, challenged an Executive Order issued by the President on March 27, 2025, titled \"Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs.\"\n\nThe Executive Order invoked 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) to exclude numerous federal agencies and subdivisions from the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (5 U.S.C. Chapter 71), which grants federal employees collective bargaining rights. The President asserted that these entities had a primary function of intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work, and that the Statute's provisions could not be applied consistently with national security requirements. The Executive Order's effect was substantial, removing collective bargaining rights from approximately two-thirds of the federal workforce, including 65.9% of NTEU-represented employees across twelve agencies and subdivisions. OPM subsequently issued guidance stating that these excluded agencies were no longer subject to collective bargaining requirements, and unions lost their status as exclusive representatives.\n\nThe NTEU alleged two primary causes of action: first, that the Executive Order was unlawful and ultra vires because it exceeded the President's authority under 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) and 5 U.S.C. Chapter 71; and second, that it constituted retaliation in violation of the NTEU's First Amendment rights of protected speech and petitioning activity. The union sought a declaratory judgment that the Executive Order and OPM guidance were unlawful as applied to NTEU-represented agencies, along with injunctive relief to halt their implementation and recover attorney fees and costs. The factual basis for the suit included allegations that the Executive Order was motivated by a desire to make federal employees easier to fire and political animus against unions that had opposed the President's agenda, as indicated by a White House Fact Sheet and OPM guidance. The union claimed immediate and severe financial harm from the cessation of payroll deductions for union dues and irreparable damage to its bargaining power and influence.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, the NTEU filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. Following oral argument, Judge Paul L. Friedman of the District Court granted the preliminary injunction on April 25, 2025, issuing a detailed opinion on April 28, 2025 (2025 WL 1218044). The court found that the NTEU had successfully rebutted the presumption of regularity due to \"clear evidence\" that the Executive Order's sweeping exclusions were driven by extra-statutory motivations, including retaliation and unrelated policy goals, rather than legitimate national security concerns. The court concluded that the NTEU was likely to succeed on its ultra vires claims and would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction. The District Court subsequently denied the government's motion to stay the preliminary injunction on May 1, 2025.\n\nThe government appealed this decision to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (Case #25-5157). On April 30, 2025, the government filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal. On May 16, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted the government's motion to stay the preliminary injunction (2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 11952). The appellate court found that the NTEU had failed to establish irreparable harm and that the preliminary injunction itself inflicted irreparable harm on the President by impeding his national security prerogatives.\n\nCurrently, the case is back in the District Court, where the NTEU filed a motion for summary judgment on June 9, 2025. The government responded with a cross-motion for summary judgment and opposition to the NTEU's motion on June 23, 2025. The NTEU filed its opposition and reply on July 7, 2025, and the government filed its final reply on July 17, 2025, leaving the cross-motions for summary judgment pending before Judge Friedman. Two other related cases, *American Foreign Service Ass’n v. Trump* (D.D.C.) and *AFGE v. Trump* (N.D. Cal.), involve similar issues. Additionally, an earlier preemptive lawsuit by the Department of Treasury against an NTEU chapter in Kentucky, *Dep’t of Treasury v. NTEU Chapter 73*, was dismissed for lack of standing.",
    "46285": "On March 24, 2025, three non-profit, membership-based immigrant rights organizations—the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), UndocuBlack Network, and CASA, Inc.—filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The organizations, represented by private and legal services counsel, brought claims on behalf of their members, who are noncitizens legally paroled into the United States. They sued the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the President of the United States, all in their official capacities. The case was assigned to Judge Jia M. Cobb.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges a series of Trump administration policies issued between January and March 2025. These include: a January 23 Huffman Memorandum directing agency personnel to consider applying expedited removal (ER) to noncitizens previously granted parole, potentially terminating active parole status or removal proceedings; a February 18 ICE Directive instructing officers to consider \"paroled arriving aliens\" for ER without a time limit; and a March 25 Federal Register Notice (CHNV Termination Notice) that formally terminated humanitarian parole processes for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV), also discussing the application of ER to these parolees. Plaintiffs allege these actions unlawfully expand ER to parolees, placing hundreds of thousands at risk of summary deportation without adequate due process. They assert violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), specifically 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing the actions are in excess of statutory authority, arbitrary and capricious, and violate the Accardi Doctrine. Plaintiffs also allege violations of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. They seek declaratory judgments, injunctive relief to prohibit DHS from applying ER to noncitizens previously granted parole at a port of entry, vacatur of the challenged agency actions (including 8 C.F.R. § 1.2's definition of \"arriving alien\" as added in the amended complaint), and attorneys' fees. The case is related to *Make the Road New York v. Huffman*, 25-cv-00190 (D.D.C.), challenging the expansion of ER to the interior, and *Svitlana Doe v. Noem*, 1:25-cv-10495 (D. Mass.), which challenged the termination of parole programs and where a district court's stay was subsequently stayed by the Supreme Court (2025 WL 1534782).\n\nAfter Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied as moot following Plaintiffs' submission of a First Amended Complaint on June 11, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Stay of Agency Action under 5 U.S.C. § 705. They presented evidence of widespread arrests and detentions of parolees for ER, often without warning or access to counsel, leading to family separation and loss of opportunities to pursue other immigration relief.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, Judge Jia M. Cobb granted Plaintiffs' motion for a stay. The Court found it had jurisdiction and that no statutory provisions or doctrines barred relief. On the merits, Judge Cobb concluded Plaintiffs were substantially likely to succeed, ruling that the challenged actions exceeded DHS’s statutory authority under the INA’s \"Designation Provision\" (8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II)) and \"Arriving Aliens Provision\" (8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i)), as neither provision permits ER for individuals previously paroled into the U.S. The Court also found the actions likely arbitrary and capricious under the APA due to inconsistent legal justifications and a failure to consider the impact on affected populations. Judge Cobb determined Plaintiffs' members faced irreparable harm, including risks of erroneous removal to countries of persecution, lack of meaningful process, detention, and family separation, outweighing any harm to the government.\n\nThe August 1, 2025, order, documented at 2025 WL 4218003, stayed the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, February 18 ICE Directive, and March 25 CHNV Termination Notice, pending conclusion of the review proceedings. This stay applies to the extent these actions subject to expedited removal individuals who have been, at any time, paroled into the United States at a port of entry, applying to all similarly situated noncitizens. No bond was required. Defendants appealed this order to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (USCA Case Number 25-5289) on August 5, 2025, and their subsequent motion to stay Judge Cobb's August 1, 2025, order was denied on August 13, 2025.",
    "46179": "On February 24, 2025, two Senate-confirmed members of the United States Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), represented by private counsel, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. They sued the United States Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, one of its Board members, its Executive Director, the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel, and the President of the United States, challenging their purported removal from the PCLOB without cause on January 27, 2025.\n\nThe PCLOB is a five-member, nonpartisan, independent agency established by Congress under 42 U.S.C. § 2000ee to provide oversight of the executive branch's counterterrorism policies and ensure the protection of privacy and civil liberties. Its creation followed recommendations from the 9/11 Commission, and Congress later reformed its organic statute in 2007 to strengthen its independence by removing it from the Executive Office of the President, deleting language that members served \"at the pleasure of the President,\" and establishing staggered six-year terms, nonpartisan selection requirements, and a significant role in advising Congress. The two Board members argued that these statutory provisions, coupled with the PCLOB's functions, which include oversight of the executive branch and acting as a legislative and judicial aid, prohibit their removal without cause. Their removal left the Board with only one member, preventing it from achieving a quorum necessary to perform its statutory duties, such as issuing critical reports to Congress on surveillance programs like Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The removals were alleged to be politically motivated, as all three Democratic members were terminated, leaving the sole Republican member in place.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, ultra vires actions, and sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief (including reinstatement), and a writ of mandamus. Judge Reggie B. Walton presided over the case.\n\nFollowing cross-motions for summary judgment, Judge Walton issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order on May 21, 2025, *LeBlanc v. U.S. Priv. & C.L. Oversight Bd.*, 2025 WL 1454010 (D.D.C. May 21, 2025). The District Court granted the two Board members' motion for summary judgment and denied the federal officials' cross-motion. The court declared the removals unlawful, void, and in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 2000ee, finding that the PCLOB's structure and function clearly indicated Congress's intent to protect its members from at-will removal, and that such a restriction on presidential removal power was constitutional. The court reinstated the two Board members to their positions, specifying one's term to expire on January 29, 2028, and the other's to continue until January 29, 2026, or until a successor is confirmed. It further enjoined the United States Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, the remaining Board member, the Executive Director, and the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel from treating the two Board members as removed or interfering with their duties.\n\nThe federal officials subsequently filed a motion to stay the District Court's order pending appeal. On May 29, 2025, Judge Walton denied this motion. The federal officials then appealed the District Court's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (Case No. 25-5197). On July 1, 2025, the D.C. Circuit, in *LeBlanc v. U.S. Priv. & C.L. Oversight Bd.*, No. 25-5197 (D.C. Cir. July 1, 2025), granted the federal officials' motion for a stay pending appeal, finding that the federal officials had satisfied the stringent requirements for a stay. The D.C. Circuit noted that the PCLOB's organic statute contains no explicit removal restriction and that, as the PCLOB does not adjudicate cases, its members do not have implied protection from at-will removal. The stay remains in effect pending further order from the Court of Appeals.",
    "46106": "On February 11, 2025, several labor organizations, including the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, and the Association of Administrative Law Judges, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Judicial Council 1, AFL-CIO, along with individual current and former federal employees and \"Does 1-100,\" filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel from Lex Lumina LLP, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the State Democracy Defenders Fund, and The Chandra Law Firm LLC, sued the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), its Acting Director Charles Ezell, the U.S. DOGE Service (USDS), its Acting Administrator, the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, and Elon Musk (collectively, the \"DOGE Defendants\"). The case was assigned to Judge Denise L. Cote.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that on January 20, 2025, following President Trump's Executive Order 14,158 establishing the \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) to modernize federal technology, OPM granted \"unrestricted, wholesale access\" to its extensive systems and records to DOGE Defendants and their agents. These systems contain highly sensitive personal and employment data for tens of millions of current and former federal employees, contractors, and job applicants, including social security numbers, health records, and financial information. The plaintiffs contended that this access was granted without proper vetting, security clearances, or training for many DOGE agents, and without a lawful \"need for the record in the performance of their duties\" under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a). They further alleged that these actions violated OPM's duty to establish appropriate safeguards for records under the Privacy Act and constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706). An additional claim of ultra vires action was brought against the DOGE Defendants. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the unlawful disclosures, ensure future compliance with privacy laws, and mandate the impoundment and destruction of any unlawfully obtained personal information.\n\nThe plaintiffs promptly filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 14, 2025, which was later converted into a motion for a preliminary injunction. This case was one of several similar actions filed against federal agencies regarding DOGE-related access to data, including related cases against OPM in Maryland (*Am. Fed’n of Tchrs. v. Bessent*, 2025 WL 582063) and Virginia (*Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. OPM*, 2025 WL 580596), and against other agencies like the Treasury Department (*New York v. Trump*, 2025 WL 573771) and the Social Security Administration (*Am. Fed’n of State, Cnty., & Mun. Emps. v. SSA*, 2025 WL 1141737).\n\nOn March 14, 2025, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. Judge Cote issued an Opinion and Order (2025 WL 996542) on April 3, 2025, denying the motion to dismiss on grounds of standing and largely denying it as to the APA and ultra vires claims. However, the court dismissed the direct Privacy Act claims for injunctive relief, finding that such relief was not available under the Privacy Act itself, but affirmed that these violations could serve as predicates for relief under the APA.\n\nFollowing a preliminary injunction hearing on May 29, 2025, Judge Cote issued an Opinion and Order (Document 121) on June 9, 2025, granting the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, establishing that OPM illegally disclosed records to individuals who were not OPM employees or lacked a \"need to know,\" and failed to establish appropriate safeguards, thereby violating the Privacy Act and acting arbitrarily and capriciously under the APA. The court also found that the plaintiffs faced irreparable harm due to the unlawful disclosure and increased cybersecurity risks, and that the public interest favored injunctive relief.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, a Preliminary Injunction Order (Document 134) was issued. The order required OPM, within two weeks, to file a report detailing the processes and procedures implemented since March 6, 2025, to ensure adherence to Privacy Act requirements for any new grants of access permissions to personally identifiable information (PII) of the plaintiffs within OPM's systems of records. The injunction was administratively stayed for fourteen days, and the plaintiffs were required to post a $1,000 bond for it to become effective. As of August 1, 2025 (Document 141), OPM was ordered to supplement its administrative record regarding each DOGE Agent, with a due date of August 29, 2025.",
    "46095": "On February 10, 2025, several university associations, including the Association of American Universities, the American Council on Education, and the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, along with numerous individual universities, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs, represented by private law firms Jenner & Block LLP and Clement & Murphy, PLLC, challenged a new policy issued on February 7, 2025, by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and their acting Secretary and Director (collectively, \"the defendants\").\n\nThe factual basis of the case stemmed from the NIH's \"Supplemental Guidance to the 2024 NIH Grants Policy Statement: Indirect Cost Rates\" (NOT-OD-25-068), which, effective February 10, 2025, imposed a 15% cap on \"indirect costs\" for all existing and future NIH grants to institutions of higher education. This guidance unilaterally replaced a long-standing system of individually negotiated indirect cost rates (NICRAs) between institutions and federal agencies. The plaintiffs alleged that this action would devastate medical research, force layoffs, halt critical clinical trials, compromise scientific integrity, and severely impact their ability to operate.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted multiple causes of action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), specifically alleging that the NIH's guidance was: (1) contrary to law, violating Section 224 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Pub. L. No. 118-47) and 45 C.F.R. § 75.414; (2) arbitrary and capricious; (3) adopted without observance of required notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures (5 U.S.C. § 553); and (4) impermissibly retroactive, exceeding statutory authority (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)). Additionally, claims were made that the guidance violated the Appropriations Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Art. I, § 9, cl. 7) and the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. § 241(a)). The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief (including a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctions), and vacatur of the guidance.\n\nThe case, assigned to Judge Angel Kelley, was consolidated with two related actions: *Commonwealth of Massachusetts, et al. v. National Institutes of Health, et al.* (Case No. 1:25-cv-10338) and *Association of American Medical Colleges, et al. v. National Institutes of Health, et al.* (Case No. 1:25-cv-10340).\n\nUpon the initial filing on February 10, 2025, a nationwide temporary restraining order (TRO) was granted in Case No. 1:25-cv-10340, which effectively mooted the TRO motion in this case. The TRO was subsequently extended on February 21, 2025. After full briefing and oral argument, Judge Kelley issued a Memorandum and Order on March 5, 2025, granting a nationwide preliminary injunction. The court found that it possessed subject matter jurisdiction, rejecting the defendants' argument that the claims exclusively belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. Judge Kelley concluded that the plaintiffs demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits regarding their APA claims (arbitrary and capricious, procedural violations, impermissible retroactivity) and the statutory violations (45 C.F.R. § 75.414 and Section 224 of the Appropriations Act). The court also found that the plaintiffs faced irreparable harm, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored granting the injunction. The preliminary injunction enjoined the defendants from implementing, applying, or enforcing the challenged guidance nationwide and vacated the guidance.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, the defendants filed an assented-to motion to convert the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction and enter final judgment, which Judge Kelley granted the same day. The Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction reaffirmed the court's earlier findings, permanently enjoined the defendants from enforcing the guidance, and vacated it in its entirety. Certain constitutional and Public Health Service Act claims were dismissed without prejudice due to the doctrine of constitutional avoidance. On April 8, 2025, the defendants filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, challenging the final judgment and permanent injunction.",
    "46023": "On February 3, 2025, three labor organizations representing millions of retirees, federal civilian employees, and other public service workers filed a complaint against the Secretary of the Treasury, the Department of the Treasury, and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). The plaintiffs, represented by private and public interest law firms, alleged violations of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a) and the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. § 6103), asserting causes of action under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706) and a nonstatutory claim. They sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to halt the unlawful disclosure of sensitive personal and financial information, ensure future compliance with federal privacy laws, and retrieve any improperly obtained data, along with attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe factual basis of the case stemmed from President Trump's January 20, 2025 Executive Order establishing the \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) and creating the U.S. DOGE Service (USDS). This order directed federal agencies to form DOGE Teams and grant USDS \"full and prompt access\" to unclassified agency records and IT systems, consistent with law. The plaintiffs alleged that the Treasury Department, through its Bureau of the Fiscal Service (responsible for managing trillions of dollars in federal financial transactions and maintaining sensitive data for millions of individuals), unlawfully granted a Treasury DOGE Team broad access to its payment systems and records. This action allegedly occurred after a high-ranking career official at the Bureau, who initially resisted DOGE's requests, was placed on leave and subsequently retired.\n\nDuring the initial implementation, a Treasury DOGE Team member, Mr. Marko Elez, was mistakenly granted \"read/write\" access to the Secure Payment System (SPS) instead of the intended \"read-only\" access for a brief period in early February 2025. Mr. Elez later resigned. The plaintiffs also highlighted that Mr. Elez copied USAID records to his laptop and emailed a spreadsheet containing payee names to two General Services Administration (GSA) officials. Plaintiffs' members reported feeling disturbed, anxious, and frustrated by the potential exposure and misuse of their personal information (including names, Social Security numbers, and bank account details).\n\nPresiding over the case, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly heard the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), filed on February 5, 2025. By consent of the parties, this motion was converted into a motion for a preliminary injunction, and an interim order was issued on February 6, 2025 (later modified on February 20, 2025). This interim order temporarily restricted access to BFS payment records and systems, allowing \"read-only\" access only to specific Treasury DOGE Team members (Mr. Thomas Krause, Mr. Marko Elez/Mr. Ryan Wunderly) and other authorized Treasury employees or persons entitled under specific statutory exceptions.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Judge Kollar-Kotelly denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, dissolving the interim order. The court's memorandum opinion (2025 WL 740401) concluded that while the plaintiffs had established Article III standing, they had not met the high standard in the D.C. Circuit for showing a likelihood of \"irreparable harm\" that was \"certain and great\" in the absence of an injunction. The court noted that damages might be an adequate remedy for privacy harms in certain contexts and that mere \"risk\" of future harm was insufficient.\n\nFollowing the denial of the preliminary injunction, the court ordered the defendants to file the administrative record. Disputes over the record's completeness led to a partial grant of plaintiffs' objections and an order for limited expedited discovery on March 20, 2025, focusing on the specific actions taken by defendants to grant USDS personnel access. A stipulated protective order for confidential information was subsequently entered on April 1, 2025.\n\nCurrently, the case is at the dispositive motions stage. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment on April 11, 2025, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing, failed to identify reviewable final agency action, and that their claims were not legally viable. The plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on April 25, 2025, asserting that the defendants acted unlawfully in granting DOGE unfettered access to personal information. Briefing on these motions is ongoing, with a modified schedule extended to May 23, 2025. This case is related to several other cases in different federal district courts challenging DOGE-related access to agency records, with varying outcomes on preliminary injunctive relief.",
    "46563": "On May 2, 2025, a lawsuit was filed by Martin Luther King, Jr. County, Pierce County, Snohomish County, the City and County of San Francisco, the County of Santa Clara, the City of Boston, the City of Columbus, and the City of New York against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), its Secretary, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), its Secretary, and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and its acting Administrator. The plaintiffs, initially comprised of eight cities and counties, are represented by private law firms and their respective municipal legal departments.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that HUD and DOT were unlawfully imposing new funding conditions on congressionally authorized grants for homelessness assistance and public transit. These conditions, stemming from a series of executive orders issued by President Trump, purportedly aimed to prohibit Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies, mandate participation in federal immigration enforcement (including using the SAVE system for status verification), restrict funding related to \"gender ideology,\" and prohibit the \"promotion\" of \"elective abortions.\" The plaintiffs contended that these conditions lacked statutory authorization, were unconstitutional (violating the Separation of Powers, Spending Clause, Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause for vagueness, and Tenth Amendment's anti-commandeering principle), and violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as arbitrary, capricious, in excess of statutory authority, and without observance of proper procedure. They sought declaratory judgment that the conditions were unlawful and injunctive relief to prevent their imposition and enforcement.\n\nThe case is presided over by Judge Barbara J. Rothstein in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.\n\nFollowing the initial complaint, the plaintiffs promptly filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). On May 7, 2025, Judge Rothstein granted the first TRO, finding that the court had subject-matter jurisdiction (rejecting the defendants' arguments based on the Tucker Act and agency discretion) and that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, would suffer irreparable harm (facing a \"Hobson's choice\" between accepting unconstitutional conditions or losing critical funds), and that the balance of equities favored injunctive relief. The court specifically enjoined HUD and FTA from imposing or enforcing the challenged \"CoC Grant Conditions\" and \"FTA Grant Conditions,\" or from withholding funds based on them. The court also denied the defendants' request for a bond and a stay of the order.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, significantly expanding the roster to include numerous additional cities, counties, and local housing and transportation agencies, and adding the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and their respective acting administrators as defendants. Simultaneously, a second motion for TRO and preliminary injunction was filed by the newly added plaintiffs, challenging substantively identical conditions being imposed by DOT and its additional operating administrations across a broader range of transportation grants. On May 23, 2025, Judge Rothstein granted the second TRO, reiterating her previous findings due to the material indistinguishability of the new claims.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, Judge Rothstein issued an order granting both the first and second motions for preliminary injunction. The court's order permanently enjoined HUD, DOT, and its operating administrations (FTA, FHWA, FAA, FRA) from imposing or enforcing the challenged conditions on any affected grants, from rescinding or withholding funds, or from requiring certifications related to these conditions. It further mandated that any actions taken to implement or enforce these conditions be treated as null and void, and that the conditions could not be retroactively applied. The preliminary injunction is to remain in effect pending further orders from the court.\n\nOn June 9, 2025, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit regarding the preliminary injunction order.",
    "46484": "On April 23, 2025, the American Bar Association, a non-profit organization representing judges, lawyers, and legal professionals, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and the Deputy Attorney General. The American Bar Association alleged violations of its First Amendment rights, including retaliation for protected speech and viewpoint discrimination, as well as unconstitutional conditions on government grants, Fifth Amendment violations (Equal Protection and Due Process), and breaches of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Association sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, specifically requesting a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction to prevent the termination of its grants and to ensure the customary disbursement of funds. The case was assigned to Judge Christopher R. Cooper.\n\nThe dispute arose from the American Bar Association's participation in public criticism of the Administration's actions concerning the judiciary and legal profession, and its involvement in a separate lawsuit challenging federal grant freezes. Following these actions, on April 9, 2025, the Deputy Attorney General issued a memorandum restricting Department of Justice employees' engagement with the American Bar Association due to the Association's litigation and \"activist causes.\" The very next day, the Department of Justice terminated all five of the American Bar Association's active grants from the Office on Violence Against Women (totaling $3.2 million, with an unobligated balance of over $2 million), citing a change in \"agency priorities.\" The Department of Justice did not terminate similar grants held by other organizations and offered no non-retaliatory explanation for this differential treatment. The American Bar Association contended that this termination was retaliatory and threatened the continued operation of its Commission on Domestic & Sexual Violence.\n\nOn April 24, 2025, the American Bar Association filed a motion for a temporary restraining order or, in the alternative, a preliminary injunction. The Department of Justice responded with a motion to dismiss on May 2, 2025, arguing that the claims were contractual and belonged in the Court of Federal Claims. On May 14, 2025, Judge Cooper issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order, granting in part the American Bar Association's motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court found a likelihood of success on the merits of the American Bar Association's First Amendment retaliation claim, emphasizing that the Department of Justice had failed to provide a non-retaliatory explanation for the grant terminations. The Court ruled that the American Bar Association would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored relief, especially given the constitutional nature of the claim.\n\nThe preliminary injunction ordered the Department of Justice to cease enforcing the termination of any grants to the American Bar Association’s Commission on Domestic & Sexual Violence, including closeout obligations, and to refrain from re-obligating the associated funds. It also required the Department of Justice to take all necessary steps to ensure the customary disbursement of funds for the grants. The Court noted that the Department of Justice's motion to dismiss would be stricken, allowing the First Amendment retaliation claim to proceed.",
    "46279": "On March 23, 2025, noncitizens with final removal orders, represented by legal services organizations, filed a class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), its Secretary, the U.S. Attorney General, and the Superintendent of the Plymouth County Correctional Facility. The plaintiffs, including a Cuban man, a Honduran woman, an Ecuadorian man, and a Guatemalan man, alleged that DHS maintained a policy and practice of deporting or seeking to deport noncitizens to \"third countries\"—countries not previously designated for removal in their immigration proceedings—without first providing them meaningful notice or an opportunity to contest removal based on a fear of persecution, torture, or death. They asserted violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order to declare DHS's policies unlawful, enjoin future unnotified third-country removals, and compel the return of a deported class member. Judge Brian E. Murphy was assigned to the case.\n\nThe factual basis of the case stemmed from a February 18, 2025, DHS directive instructing officers to review cases of previously released noncitizens for re-detention and removal to third countries. The plaintiffs cited specific instances, such as the Guatemalan man, who, despite an immigration judge (IJ) granting him withholding of removal to Guatemala, was deported to Mexico without notice, where he had previously suffered violence, and subsequently re-deported to Guatemala.\n\nOn March 28, 2025, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' emergency motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), enjoining DHS from removing named plaintiffs and any class members to a third country without providing written notice and a meaningful opportunity to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) (and for named plaintiffs, also under INA § 1231(b)(3)). DHS appealed the TRO to the First Circuit, which denied a stay on April 7, 2025, finding the TRO not immediately appealable as a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn March 30, 2025, DHS issued \"Guidance Regarding Third Country Removals\" (March 30 Memo), outlining procedures that, in some cases, allowed removal to a third country without notice if diplomatic assurances against torture existed, or with limited notice (24 hours) for others, without an affirmative inquiry about fear. On April 18, 2025, the District Court certified the class and issued a Preliminary Injunction (PI), largely mirroring the TRO but specifying a \"reasonable fear\" standard for initial screenings and a 15-day period for noncitizens to seek to reopen immigration proceedings if their fear claim was denied. The court also ordered expedited discovery regarding the Guatemalan man's deportation.\n\nDHS appealed the PI to the First Circuit, which denied a stay on May 16, 2025. Following reports of alleged removals to El Salvador via Guantanamo Bay, the District Court issued an Amended PI on April 30, 2025, clarifying that DHS could not cede custody or control to other agencies to circumvent the injunction's protections. Further alleged violations occurred, including an attempted removal of 13 class members to Libya in early May and the actual removal of six class members to South Sudan on May 20, 2025. The court found these actions violated the PI, issued a remedial order on May 21, 2025, detailing specific procedures for the six class members in South Sudan, and on May 23, 2025, ordered DHS to immediately facilitate the return of the Guatemalan man to the United States. DHS sought reconsideration and a stay of these orders, both of which Judge Murphy denied on May 26, 2025.\n\nDHS then filed an emergency application for a stay of the PI with the Supreme Court, which was granted on June 23, 2025, rendering the PI inoperative pending the resolution of appeals. On July 3, 2025, the Supreme Court clarified that its stay also applied to the District Court's remedial orders. On July 9, 2025, ICE issued new guidance for implementing the March 30 Memo, allowing removals with as little as six hours' notice in \"exigent circumstances.\"\n\nCurrently, the plaintiffs have filed a motion for partial summary judgment to declare DHS's policy and practice unlawful and a motion for an indicative ruling that the District Court would dissolve the PI upon remand from the First Circuit, given the Supreme Court's stay. DHS has responded with a motion to stay all proceedings pending appeal.",
    "46180": "On February 25, 2025, three national education and sociological membership organizations, along with a Maryland-based teachers' union, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. They were later joined by an Oregon public school district in an amended complaint filed on March 5, 2025. These plaintiffs, represented by the non-profit legal organization Democracy Forward Foundation, sued the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), its Secretary, Linda McMahon, and its Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, Craig Trainor (represented by U.S. Department of Justice attorneys).\n\nThe lawsuit challenged a \"Dear Colleague Letter\" (the Letter) issued by the DOE on February 14, 2025, along with subsequent \"Frequently Asked Questions\" (FAQs) and an \"End DEI\" public portal. These documents purported to clarify obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, following the Supreme Court's decision in *Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard Coll.*, 600 U.S. 181 (2023). Plaintiffs alleged that the Letter radically altered existing law by broadly restricting teaching about systemic racism, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, identity-based student groups, and race-neutral admissions practices, threatening loss of federal funding. This was evidenced by 51 initial Title VI investigations announced by DOE on March 14, 2025, citing the Letter. On April 3, 2025, DOE further issued a \"Certification Requirement\" demanding state and local education agencies affirm compliance with DOE's interpretations under threat of federal funding termination, breach of contract, and False Claims Act liability.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged these actions created widespread uncertainty, chilled constitutionally protected speech and association, and violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)) due to a lack of proper notice-and-comment rulemaking and non-compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. They also asserted direct violations of the First Amendment (Free Speech and Free Association) and Fifth Amendment (Due Process Vagueness) due to the unclear and coercive nature of the directives, particularly noting conflicts with state laws regarding curriculum. Related cases, including *Nat’l Educ. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Educ.*, 2025 WL 1188160 (D.N.H. Apr. 24, 2025), and *Nat’l Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v. Dep’t of Educ.*, 2025 WL 1196212 (D.D.C. Apr. 24, 2025), were referenced.\n\nPresiding over the case, Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher initially ordered plaintiffs to show cause why the lawsuit should be heard in Maryland. On April 24, 2025, the Court granted a preliminary injunction, staying the Dear Colleague Letter under 5 U.S.C. § 705 of the APA, but denied a preliminary injunction against the Certification Requirement due to it not being included in the then-operative complaint. The stay of the Letter was set to last pending the final resolution of the case.\n\nAfter plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint on July 17, 2025, addressing the Certification Requirement, both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On August 14, 2025, Judge Gallagher granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on claims alleging violations of the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and APA concerning both the Dear Colleague Letter and the Certification Requirement. The Court found both documents unlawful and vacated them in their entirety under 5 U.S.C. § 706 of the APA, thereby permanently setting them aside. The remedies sought by plaintiffs included declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and an order to set aside the agency actions.",
    "46119": "On February 13, 2025, a group of 26 current and former employees and contractors of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), proceeding pseudonymously, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The initial defendants were Elon Musk, a Senior Advisor to the President (in his official capacity), the United States DOGE Service, and the Department of Government Efficiency (collectively \"DOGE\"). Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from the State Democracy Defenders Fund and Marziani, Stevens & Gonzalez PLLC.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged violations of the U.S. Constitution's Appointments Clause (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2) and Separation of Powers principles. They claimed that Elon Musk, as the de facto leader of DOGE, was exercising significant governmental authority without proper Senate confirmation, and that DOGE's actions, directed by Musk, constituted an unconstitutional dismantling of USAID, an agency established and funded by Congress. The relief sought included declaratory judgments that Musk and DOGE were acting unconstitutionally, setting aside their unlawful actions, and injunctive relief to prevent them from performing wide-ranging duties related to USAID unless Musk was properly appointed.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the defendants' actions to shut down USAID, particularly the permanent closure of its headquarters and the taking down of its website without the approval of a duly appointed USAID official, likely violated the Appointments Clause and Separation of Powers. The court issued an injunction, *J. Does 1-26 v. Musk*, 2025 WL 840574, ordering the defendants to reinstate access to USAID electronic systems for employees and contractors, cease disclosure of confidential information, halt actions related to USAID's shutdown, and refrain from further actions without authorization from a USAID official. The injunction also required a written agreement confirming USAID could reoccupy its headquarters if plaintiffs prevailed. The court later clarified on March 20, 2025, that the injunction applied to any individual with a past or present affiliation with the defendants or DOGE, specifically including Jeremy Lewin, who had been delegated duties as USAID Deputy Administrator and Chief Operating Officer.\n\nThe defendants appealed this ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On March 28, 2025, the Fourth Circuit granted an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, *J. Does 1-26 v. Musk*, 2025 WL 1020995. The appellate court found that the defendants had made a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, citing concerns that the plaintiffs had failed to name the proper defendants (such as USAID itself) and had not established irreparable harm.\n\nFollowing the Fourth Circuit's stay, the plaintiffs filed a second amended class action complaint on May 30, 2025. This amended complaint refined the plaintiff class to specifically include J. Doe 4, J. Doe 7, J. Doe 22, J. Doe 27, J. Doe 28, and J. Doe 29, and formally sought class certification. It also expanded the list of defendants to include USAID, the U.S. Department of State, the President (Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity), the Secretary of State (Marco Rubio, in his official capacity and as Acting USAID Administrator), an Acting Deputy Administrator of USAID (Peter Marocco, in his official capacity), a Deputy Administrator for Policy and Programming and Chief Operating Officer for USAID (Jeremy Lewin, in his official capacity), a Deputy Administrator for Management and Resources at USAID (Kenneth Jackson, in his official capacity), and an Acting Administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service (Amy Gleason, in her official capacity). The amended complaint continued to seek declaratory and injunctive relief for the alleged constitutional violations, explicitly excluding monetary damages.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction (citing preclusion by the Civil Service Reform Act for employees and the Contract Disputes Act for contractors, and lack of Article III standing) and for failure to state a claim (reiterating arguments against the Appointments Clause and Separation of Powers claims, and arguing against injunctive relief directly against the President). On May 27, 2025, the district court denied the plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery. On June 9, 2025, the Fourth Circuit granted the defendants' motion to hold the appeal in abeyance, pausing the appellate proceedings pending the district court's resolution of the motion to dismiss.\n\nOn August 13, 2025, the district court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. On August 18, 2025, the district court also granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The remaining defendants were ordered to file an answer to the second amended complaint. As of the last available record, the case continues in the district court.",
    "46093": "On February 10, 2025, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Acting Secretary of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs included eight individual refugee applicants and sponsors, alongside three national faith-based nonprofit organizations (HIAS, Inc., Church World Service, Inc., and Lutheran Community Services Northwest, an affiliate) that provide refugee resettlement services. The individual plaintiffs initiated the case as a class action on behalf of similarly situated individuals impacted by the challenged policies. Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from Perkins Coie LLP and the International Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nThe lawsuit challenged the Trump Administration's actions following the issuance of Executive Order 14163, \"Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program\" (Refugee Ban EO), on January 20, 2025. This order indefinitely suspended all refugee admissions and decisions on refugee applications, citing concerns about migration levels and resource strain on U.S. communities. Simultaneously, the State Department and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS, whose Acting Secretary Dorothy A. Fink was later substituted by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.) immediately halted all refugee case processing and travel, canceling flights even before the EO's stated effective date. Furthermore, the State Department, citing a separate \"Foreign Aid Executive Order,\" suspended federal funding to the nonprofit resettlement organizations responsible for overseas processing and domestic post-arrival services. This led to significant financial distress and mass layoffs within these organizations.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that these actions unlawfully dismantled the congressionally established U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), violated the Refugee Act (8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., particularly §§ 1157 and 1522), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA, 5 U.S.C. § 553, § 706(a)(2)(A)–(D)), and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and constituted a violation of the Separation of Powers. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including temporary restraining orders, preliminary and permanent injunctions to halt the challenged policies, and an order compelling the restoration of funding and processing. This case is related to previous challenges to Trump administration immigration policies, such as *Washington v. Trump*, 2017 WL 462040 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 3, 2017), and *Hawai’i v. Trump*, 859 F.3d 741 (9th Cir. 2017).\n\nPresiding over the case, Judge Jamal N. Whitehead issued a preliminary injunction on February 28, 2025, enjoining several provisions of the Refugee Ban EO and the suspension of refugee processing, admissions, and USRAP funding nationwide. Following this, the State Department, on February 26, 2025, issued \"Termination Notices\" to resettlement partners, formally ending cooperative agreements for R&P services and most overseas processing support. On March 24, 2025, Judge Whitehead issued a second preliminary injunction, ordering the government to cease enforcing these terminations and to reinstate the cooperative agreements, finding the terminations likely arbitrary and capricious under the APA.\n\nThe government immediately appealed both injunctions to the Ninth Circuit. On March 25, 2025, the Ninth Circuit partially stayed the first preliminary injunction, allowing it to remain in effect only for individuals who were conditionally approved for refugee status by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services before January 20, 2025. All other aspects of the first injunction were stayed. Subsequent Ninth Circuit orders on April 21, 2025, and May 9, 2025, further clarified this carveout, narrowing it to individuals who, on or before January 20, 2025, had a conditionally approved refugee application, were cleared for travel, had arranged and confirmable travel plans, and possessed a \"strong reliance interest arising prior to January 20, 2025, comparable to Plaintiff Pacito,\" to be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn response to the Ninth Circuit's clarifications, Judge Whitehead rescinded his initial compliance framework and, on July 14, 2025, issued an \"Order Establishing Injunction Implementation Framework.\" This order appointed U.S. Magistrate Judge Michelle L. Peterson to assist with case-by-case determinations of reliance interests for \"Review-Eligible Cases.\" The framework established a rebuttable presumption of protection for approximately 160 refugees with imminent travel, unaccompanied minor children, and Afghan refugees at Camp As Sayliyah. On July 30, 2025, Judge Whitehead granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification and denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the first supplemental complaint. The injunctions remain in effect pending further orders from the Court.",
    "46028": "The case was initially filed on February 4, 2025, by two national LGBTQ+ advocacy and health professional organizations, PFLAG, Inc. and GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ+ Equality, along with five transgender minors, two transgender young adults (aged 18), and four parents of the minors. The organizational plaintiffs brought claims on behalf of their members. They are represented by a coalition of private law firms and non-profit legal advocacy organizations, including Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Maryland. The defendants include the President of the United States in his official capacity, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Acting Secretary, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and its Principal Deputy Administrator, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its Acting Director, and the National Science Foundation (NSF) and its Director.\n\nThe factual basis of the case stems from two Executive Orders issued by the President. First, on January 20, 2025, Executive Order 14,168, titled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government\" (the \"Gender Identity Order\"), declared gender identity a \"false\" idea and directed federal agencies to ensure federal funds are not used to \"promote gender ideology.\" Second, on January 28, 2025, Executive Order 14,187, titled \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation\" (the \"Denial of Care Order\"), directed federal agencies to \"immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end\" gender-affirming medical care for individuals under 19 years of age. These orders rapidly led to federal agencies, including HRSA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), issuing notices to grant recipients threatening to terminate funding. Numerous hospitals nationwide, including those serving the individual plaintiffs, consequently halted gender-affirming medical care for patients under 19, citing fear of losing federal funding. The White House publicly stated that these shutdowns were the orders' \"intended effect.\" The plaintiffs alleged that this halted medically necessary care, causing significant distress and other harms.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted six causes of action, alleging that the Executive Orders (1) exceeded the President's Article II authority by usurping Congress's power of the purse and violating Article I's Bicameralism and Presentment Clauses; (2) conflicted with statutory prohibitions against sex discrimination under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. § 18116) and Section 1908 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. § 300w-7); (3) conflicted with statutory prohibitions against disability discrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794) and Section 1557 of the ACA; (4) violated the Equal Protection Component of the Fifth Amendment; (5) violated the Substantive Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by infringing on parental rights; and (6) violated the First Amendment by engaging in viewpoint discrimination. They sought declaratory judgment that the orders were unlawful and unconstitutional, as well as temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief to prevent their enforcement and the withholding of federal funding, along with attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nPresiding over the case, Judge Brendan A. Hurson first granted the plaintiffs' Emergency Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on February 13, 2025, finding a strong likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm to plaintiffs, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored relief. The TRO, explained in a Memorandum Opinion (ECF 62) issued on February 14, 2025, enjoined federal agencies (excluding the President) from conditioning or withholding federal funding based on the provision of gender-affirming medical care to patients under 19, and was extended until March 5, 2025.\n\nOn March 4, 2025, Judge Hurson granted the plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, issuing a nationwide injunction with a detailed Memorandum Opinion (ECF 115). The injunction (ECF 116) prohibited the defendant agencies and officials (excluding the President) from conditioning, withholding, or terminating federal funding under the challenged sections of the Executive Orders based on the provision of gender-affirming medical care to patients under 19. It also ordered the agencies to provide written notice of the injunction to their employees, contractors, and grantees by March 10, 2025, and to release any funds paused due to the Executive Orders. The court again found a strong likelihood of success on the merits for the plaintiffs' separation of powers, statutory sex discrimination, and Equal Protection claims, citing U.S. Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit precedents, including *Bostock v. Clayton County* and *Kadel v. Folwell*. The court further concluded that the Executive Orders were motivated, at least in part, by discriminatory animus.\n\nFollowing the preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs filed an Emergency Motion to Enforce the Preliminary Injunction on March 7, 2025, alleging that CMS, HRSA, and SAMHSA had issued new notices threatening future policy updates and potential grant cancellations, thereby violating the injunction. On March 28, 2025, Judge Hurson denied this motion without prejudice in a Memorandum and Order (ECF 135), determining that the new notices, as currently phrased, indicated only policy reviews and *potential* future actions, and thus did not constitute a violation of the preliminary injunction's unequivocal command to *condition, withhold, or terminate* funding.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, the defendants filed a Notice of Interlocutory Appeal (ECF 132) of the preliminary injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On April 8, 2025, the parties filed a Joint Motion for a Limited Partial Stay of case deadlines, including the defendants' responsive pleading deadline, pending the resolution of this appeal. Judge Hurson granted this motion on April 9, 2025 (ECF 137). On May 12, 2025, the Fourth Circuit placed the appeal in abeyance pending a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in *United States v. Skrmetti*, Case No. 23-477. No trial has occurred, and the preliminary injunction remains in effect pending further orders from the District Court.",
    "46186": "On February 28, 2025, a class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts by various individuals, including Ukrainian, Nicaraguan, Afghan, Salvadoran, Haitian, and Venezuelan nationals, alongside U.S. citizens who sponsor immigrants, a U.S. legal permanent resident, U.S. citizen military personnel, and the Haitian Bridge Alliance, a non-profit organization. These plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and non-profit legal services organizations such as Justice Action Center and Human Rights First, sued the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the President of the United States.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges actions taken by the Trump administration starting on January 20, 2025, which aimed to terminate several humanitarian parole programs and suspend the adjudication of immigration benefits for individuals paroled through them. These programs include Uniting for Ukraine (U4U), the processes for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV), Operation Allies Welcome (OAW) for Afghans, Family Reunification Parole (FRP), Military Parole in Place (MPIP), and the Central American Minors (CAM) program. The administration's actions, initiated through Executive Orders and agency memoranda (including the January 20 Huffman memorandum, the January Higgins directive, and the February 14 Davidson memorandum), were based on the assertion that these \"categorical parole programs\" were unlawful and inconsistent with the parole statute's \"case-by-case\" requirement and national interests.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that these actions, which halt the processing of new parole and re-parole applications and indefinitely suspend the adjudication of other immigration benefits (such as asylum, Temporary Protected Status, and adjustment of status) for parolees, violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and failing to follow agency procedures (Accardi Doctrine). They also claim violations of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the parole programs are lawful, an injunction prohibiting the government from implementing its challenged policies, and the vacatur of the relevant agency actions.\n\nPresiding over the case, Judge Indira Talwani has issued several significant rulings. On April 14, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction and certified a class of CHNV parolees, staying the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) March 25, 2025 Federal Register Notice (FRN) which had terminated the CHNV programs and revoked existing parole grants and work authorizations for hundreds of thousands of individuals by April 24, 2025. The court found that DHS's rationale for early termination was based on a legal error regarding expedited removal and that the categorical termination without case-by-case review was likely arbitrary and capricious. This ruling was appealed by the government to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, which denied a stay on May 5, 2025. However, on May 30, 2025, the Supreme Court granted the government's application for a stay of the district court's April 14 order, allowing the termination of CHNV parole grants to proceed pending appeal.\n\nSeparately, on May 28, 2025, Judge Talwani granted partial preliminary relief on a class-wide basis, staying the suspension of adjudications for re-parole applications under U4U, OAW, FRP, and CAM, as well as initial parole applications and other immigration benefit applications under the MPIP program. The court also stayed the February 14, 2025 Davidson memorandum's indefinite suspension of immigration benefit adjudications for U4U, FRP, and CHNV parolees, finding these suspensions likely arbitrary and capricious. The government has also appealed this May 28, 2025 order to the First Circuit. On August 1, 2025, the court denied preliminary relief for initial parole adjudications sought for individuals not yet in the United States. The case remains ongoing, with a motion for partial summary judgment filed by the plaintiffs on June 16, 2025, regarding the mass truncation of CHNV parole.",
    "46099": "On February 10, 2025, several non-profit organizations, including an HIV/AIDS advocacy group, an investigative journalism network, and a torture victim support center, represented by private attorneys and legal advocacy groups, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The organizations sued federal agencies, including the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), along with their respective heads (the Secretary of State and the Director of OMB), and the President of the United States. The case was later consolidated with a similar action, *Global Health Council v. Trump*, Civil Action No. 25-00402. Other related cases challenging similar government actions were also referenced in the proceedings.\n\nThe lawsuit challenged Executive Order 14169, titled \"Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid,\" issued by the President on January 20, 2025. This order directed an immediate 90-day pause in U.S. foreign development assistance, freezing all obligations and disbursements of funds for programmatic assessment. The non-profit organizations alleged that subsequent directives from federal agencies, including stop-work orders issued by the Secretary of State, illegally implemented this executive order, causing widespread disruption, layoffs, and threats to their humanitarian missions.\n\nThe non-profits asserted six causes of action: violations of the U.S. Constitution's Article I (Separation of Powers, Appropriations Clause) and Article II, Section 3 (Take Care Clause), and violations of federal statutes, specifically the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), the Anti-Deficiency Act, and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024 (FCAA). They sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, including enjoining the enforcement of the challenged orders, reinstatement of foreign assistance funding, and continued administration of awards as they were prior to the government's actions, along with legal costs and attorney fees.\n\nThe case was presided over by Judge Amir H. Ali. On February 13, 2025, the District Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), partially granting the non-profits' request. The TRO enjoined the federal agency defendants (excluding the President) from enforcing the blanket foreign aid suspension directives issued between January 20 and February 13, 2025, but allowed for individualized actions consistent with contractual terms. Following allegations of non-compliance, the District Court issued an order on February 20, 2025, reiterating its directive to cease the blanket suspension. Defendants' subsequent motion to clarify or stay the TRO was denied on February 22, 2025. On February 25, 2025, the District Court orally granted a second emergency motion to enforce the TRO, ordering payments for work completed before February 13, 2025, by the following day.\n\nDefendants appealed this February 25th order to the D.C. Circuit, which dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction on February 26, 2025 (2025 WL 621396). The same day, the Supreme Court Chief Justice issued an administrative stay, which the full Supreme Court subsequently denied vacating on March 5, 2025 (2025 WL 698083), while instructing the District Court to clarify compliance obligations with feasibility in mind.\n\nOn March 10, 2025, the District Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order (2025 WL 752378), granting in part and denying in part the non-profits' motions for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the non-profits were likely to succeed on their APA claims regarding the initial blanket suspension directives (January 20 to February 13, 2025) and on their constitutional claims that the federal agency defendants were unlawfully impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds in violation of the separation of powers. The court enjoined these actions and ordered the federal agency defendants to make the full amount of appropriated FCAA funds available for obligation. However, the court denied relief aimed at enjoining the large-scale terminations of awards that occurred after February 13, 2025, finding these to be distinct agency actions not directly challenged in the initial complaints, and declined to dictate specific operational or personnel decisions.\n\nDefendants appealed this preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit on April 1, 2025. On August 13, 2025, the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion (25-5097, 25-5098; 2025 WL 2129854), vacating the preliminary injunction and remanding the case for further proceedings. The D.C. Circuit held that the non-profits lacked a cause of action to press their claims, concluding that they could not bring a freestanding constitutional claim where the underlying alleged violation and claimed authority were statutory. The court also determined that APA review was precluded by the Impoundment Control Act and that the non-profits could not reframe the fundamentally statutory dispute as an ultra vires claim. The D.C. Circuit's ruling means that the District Court's preliminary injunction, which required the government to obligate appropriated funds, is no longer in effect.",
    "46065": "The case, initiated on February 7, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, involves the States of Washington, Minnesota, Oregon, and Colorado, alongside three unnamed physicians, challenging two Executive Orders issued by President Donald J. Trump. The defendants include President Trump in his official capacity, the U.S. Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Veterans Affairs, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Small Business Administration, and the United States of America. Plaintiffs are represented by their respective State Attorneys General and Assistant Attorneys General, while defendants are represented by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe lawsuit centers on two executive orders: Executive Order 14,187, titled \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation\" (referred to by plaintiffs as the \"Medical Services EO\"), issued on January 28, 2025; and Executive Order 14,168, titled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government\" (referred to by plaintiffs as the \"Gender Ideology EO\"), issued on January 20, 2025. The Medical Services EO directs federal agencies to immediately cease federal research and education grants to medical institutions providing gender-affirming care to individuals under 19 years of age. It also directs the Attorney General to prioritize criminal prosecutions under 18 U.S.C. § 116 (female genital mutilation), which the order attempts to redefine to include non-surgical gender-affirming treatments. The Gender Ideology EO establishes a federal policy recognizing only two immutable sexes (male and female, defined at conception) and mandates agencies to end federal funding for programs that \"promote gender ideology,\" which it characterizes as a \"false claim\" regarding gender identity.\n\nPlaintiffs contend that gender-affirming care is medically necessary and supported by overwhelming medical consensus, and that state laws in the plaintiff states protect its provision. They allege the Executive Orders are unconstitutional, discriminatory, and inflict immediate and severe harm by threatening the loss of federal funding for critical medical research and services, and by creating a credible threat of criminal prosecution for providers and families. These actions, plaintiffs argue, force medical institutions and providers into an impossible choice between violating ethical obligations to patients or losing vital funding and facing legal repercussions. This has led to increased anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicidality among transgender youth.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions, arguing violations of the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause (due to discrimination based on transgender status and sex), constitutional Separation of Powers (by usurping Congress's spending and legislative authority), the Tenth Amendment (by interfering with states' traditional police powers to regulate medicine), and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (claiming the orders are unconstitutionally vague).\n\nU.S. District Judge Lauren King initially granted a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on February 14, 2025, enjoining defendants (excluding the President) from enforcing Section 4 of the Medical Services EO and limited aspects of Section 8(a) within Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota. The court issued a supporting memorandum opinion (2025 WL 509617) on February 16, 2025, finding plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits and face irreparable harm. Following an amended complaint that added Colorado as a plaintiff and included challenges to the Gender Ideology EO, Judge King granted in part a Preliminary Injunction (PI) on February 28, 2025. The PI enjoined defendants (excluding the President) from enforcing Section 4 of the Medical Services EO and Sections 3(e) and 3(g) of the Gender Ideology EO within the plaintiff states, finding these provisions likely violated the Equal Protection Clause and Separation of Powers. However, the court denied the PI concerning Section 8(a) of the Medical Services EO, concluding plaintiffs lacked standing due to the absence of a credible threat of prosecution under the actual statutory definition of female genital mutilation. The PI remains in effect pending further orders.\n\nSubsequently, plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt on March 6, 2025, alleging that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) had terminated a research grant to Seattle Children's Hospital for gender-affirming care, in violation of the court's orders. On March 17, 2025, Judge King denied the motion for contempt and attorneys' fees, finding plaintiffs had not provided clear and convincing evidence of a violation. However, the court granted plaintiffs' alternative request for expedited discovery into the grant termination and ordered defendants' counsel to correct their \"unreasonable interpretation\" of \"gender-affirming care\" in the PI to include all gender-affirming services, not just the specific treatments listed in the Executive Orders, and to include patient care in research studies. Following this, NIH reinstated the terminated grant on March 27, 2025.\n\nDefendants filed a Notice of Interlocutory Appeal to the Ninth Circuit (Case No. 25-1922) on March 21, 2025, challenging the PI order and the expedited discovery order. On April 23, 2025, Judge King granted defendants' motion for a limited stay of district court proceedings pending the appeal, noting that the PI would remain in effect and that the stay would not prevent plaintiffs from enforcing the injunction, amending their complaint, or seeking to lift the stay. On June 16, 2025, the court denied plaintiffs' motion to compel discovery, deeming the requests moot after the NIH grant reinstatement. Related cases cited in the litigation include *New York v. Trump* (D.R.I.) and *PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump* (D. Md.), where similar injunctions were issued against the Executive Orders.",
    "46057": "On February 6, 2025, a complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington by seven active-duty transgender service members (three Naval officers and four Army and Air Force enlisted personnel), one transgender individual seeking to enlist in the Marine Corps, and a Washington State-based civil and human rights organization representing its transgender members. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and legal advocacy organizations, sued the President of the United States (in his official capacity, though later dismissed by stipulation), the United States of America, the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Department of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the U.S. Department of the Army, the Acting Secretary of the Navy, the U.S. Department of the Navy, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force, and the U.S. Department of the Air Force.\n\nThe lawsuit challenged Executive Order No. 14183, issued on January 27, 2025 (dubbed the \"2025 Military Ban\"), and related federal policies, which banned transgender people from military service. The Ban declared transgender status incompatible with military service, asserting it conflicted with an \"honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle\" and was a \"falsehood.\" It also incorporated definitions from another executive order that deemed a gender identity incongruent with one’s birth sex a \"false belief.\" The Ban directed the Secretary of Defense to update retention and accession standards, immediately prohibited individuals from using facilities designated for a sex different from their own, and required directives to prevent the use of pronouns consistent with transgender service members' gender identities.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that these policies violated their equal protection, free speech, and procedural due process rights under the Fifth and First Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, and that the government should be equitably estopped from implementing the Ban. They sought a declaratory judgment that the Ban was unconstitutional and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent its enforcement, including any separations, discharges, or denials of service based on transgender status.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Benjamin H. Settle. Related cases challenging prior transgender military bans included _Karnoski v. Trump_, 926 F.3d 1180 (9th Cir. 2019), and parallel cases such as _Talbott v. United States_, 2025 WL 842332 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025), and _Ireland v. Hegseth_ (D.N.J., No. 25-01918-CPO).\n\nOn February 19, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. On February 26, 2025, the Department of Defense issued implementing guidance (the \"Hegseth Policy\"), which clarified a complete ban on transgender individuals, disqualifying those with a diagnosis, history, or symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria, or a history of related medical interventions. This policy set March 26, 2025, as the start date for identification and separation processes, offering \"voluntary\" separation incentives and immediately designating affected service members as non-deployable. Plaintiffs argued this policy abruptly reversed prior military policies (the 2016 Carter Policy and 2021 Austin Policy) that allowed open transgender service, which had been based on extensive research indicating no negative impact on military readiness or cohesion. They also noted that some active-duty plaintiffs had already faced adverse career impacts due to the impending ban.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, Judge Settle granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The order, effective nationwide, enjoined all defendants from implementing the 2025 Military Ban and the Hegseth Policy, or any other related actions. It mandated the maintenance of the status quo of military policy regarding transgender service members that existed immediately before the 2025 Military Ban, specifically citing the non-discriminatory policies from the Biden administration. The District Court also denied the government's request for a stay of its injunction.\n\nThe government appealed this ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on March 28, 2025, and sought an immediate administrative stay and a stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit denied the administrative stay on March 31, 2025, and subsequently denied the government's emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal on April 18, 2025, stating that the government had not demonstrated irreparable harm. Following this, the government filed an application for a stay with the U.S. Supreme Court. On May 6, 2025, the Supreme Court, in Order List: 605 U.S., granted the government's application, thereby staying the District Court's March 27, 2025 preliminary injunction pending the Ninth Circuit's disposition of the appeal and any timely sought petition for a writ of certiorari.",
    "45965": "On January 21, 2025, two immigrant rights non-profit organizations, CASA, Inc. and Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP), along with five individual pregnant women (suing individually and as next friends to their future children), filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs, represented by private non-profit legal organizations and an academic legal clinic, challenged an Executive Order issued by the President of the United States on January 20, 2025. The Executive Order, titled \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\" purported to deny birthright citizenship to children born in the United States if their mother was unlawfully present or lawfully present but temporarily (e.g., on a student, tourist, or work visa), and their father was neither a U.S. citizen nor a lawful permanent resident. It directed various federal officials and agencies responsible for immigration and citizenship (including the Secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Commissioner of the Social Security Administration) to cease issuing or accepting citizenship documentation for such children born after February 19, 2025, and to issue implementation guidance.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the Executive Order constituted an ultra vires action, violating the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause and 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a), which, they argued, guarantee birthright citizenship to nearly all persons born in the U.S. They sought declaratory judgments that the Executive Order was unconstitutional and unlawful, and injunctive relief to prevent its enforcement. The defendants were represented by government counsel.\n\nJudge Deborah L. Boardman initially granted the plaintiffs' motion for a nationwide preliminary injunction on February 5, 2025, finding an extremely strong likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored the injunction. The court also granted the individual plaintiffs permission to proceed pseudonymously. The government appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and sought to stay the nationwide application of the injunction. Both this District Court and the Fourth Circuit denied the government's stay requests, with the Fourth Circuit's order reported at *CASA, Inc. v. Trump, 2025 WL 654902 (4th Cir. Feb. 28, 2025)*.\n\nThe government then sought a partial stay from the Supreme Court, which consolidated this application with two others (*Trump v. Washington* and *Trump v. New Jersey*) challenging the same Executive Order. On June 27, 2025, the Supreme Court partially stayed the injunction, ruling that universal injunctions likely exceed federal courts' equitable authority. Reported at *Trump v. CASA, Inc., 145 S. Ct. 2540 (2025)*, the Court instructed the lower courts to narrow injunctions to provide complete relief only to plaintiffs with standing and to permit agencies to develop implementation guidance. The Supreme Court highlighted Rule 23 class actions as a legitimate means for obtaining broader relief.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's ruling, the Fourth Circuit dismissed the government's appeal and remanded the case. The plaintiffs, now including eight individual women (some as next friends to their newborn children) and the two organizations, filed a First Amended Complaint on June 27, 2025, to pursue a nationwide class action. On August 7, 2025, Judge Boardman granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, certifying a nationwide class defined as: \"Any child who has been born or will be born in the United States after February 19, 2025, (1) whose mother was unlawfully present in the United States and whose father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) whose mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary and whose father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.\" The court also granted a classwide preliminary injunction, enjoining federal officials from enforcing the Executive Order against all members of the certified class. The original preliminary injunction was dissolved, and security for the new injunction was waived. This classwide preliminary injunction remains in effect until further order of the court.",
    "VR-SC-0078": "The case of *Mary T. Thomas, et al. v. Marci Andino, et al.* was initially filed on April 22, 2020, in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. The plaintiffs include several individual registered voters and two non-profit organizations, The Family Unit, Inc. and the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP, represented by private counsel from the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc., and the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina. They brought suit against the Executive Director and members of the South Carolina State Election Commission, and the Governor of South Carolina, all in their official capacities. Later, the South Carolina Republican Party, the Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives, and the President of the South Carolina Senate intervened as defendants.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented public health emergency, posing significant risks to in-person voting and disproportionately affecting elderly, disabled, and African-American voters. They claimed that two specific South Carolina election requirements violated their fundamental right to vote under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (52 U.S.C. § 10301), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131, et seq.). The challenged requirements were: (1) the \"Excuse Requirement\" (S.C. Code Ann. § 7-15-320), which set exclusive categories for absentee voting eligibility, and (2) the \"Witness Requirement\" (S.C. Code Ann. § 7-15-220), mandating a third-party witness signature on absentee ballots. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including preliminary and permanent injunctions against these requirements for the duration of the 2020 election calendar, along with attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nPresiding over the case was Judge J. Michelle Childs. Key filings included the plaintiffs' initial complaint and a motion for preliminary injunction on April 28, 2020. The South Carolina Republican Party's motion to intervene was granted on May 8, 2020, followed by the intervention of the Speaker of the House and President of the Senate on August 24, 2020. The Election Defendants and Governor McMaster filed their answers to the complaint on May 11, 2020.\n\nA hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction was held on May 15, 2020, consolidated with a related case, *Middleton v. Andino* (3:20-cv-01730-JMC). On May 25, 2020, the court issued an order granting in part the motion for preliminary injunction. The court enjoined the Witness Requirement for registered absentee voters, but *only for the June 2020 primaries and any resulting runoff elections*. The defendants were ordered to publicly inform South Carolina voters about this temporary elimination of the Witness Requirement. The court did not enjoin the Excuse Requirement at that time, as the South Carolina General Assembly had passed S.J. Res. 635, temporarily allowing all qualified voters to vote by absentee ballot for the June 2020 primaries. This temporary law expired on July 1, 2020.\n\nOn July 13, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint, reiterating their challenges to the Excuse and Witness Requirements for all remaining 2020 elections, citing continued COVID-19 risks. Subsequently, the Election Defendants and the South Carolina Republican Party filed motions for summary judgment on August 10, 2020. The case was scheduled for a bench trial from September 22-25, 2020.\n\nHowever, on September 15, 2020, the South Carolina General Assembly passed H.B. 5305, suspending the Excuse Requirement for the November 2020 General Election. On September 18, 2020, in the related case of *Middleton v. Andino* (3:20-CV-01730-JMC), the court enjoined the Witness Requirement for all South Carolina voters in the upcoming November 2020 General Election. That same day, Judge Childs issued an order in this case, *sua sponte* staying the proceedings, including the scheduled trial, and holding all pending motions in abeyance. The court reasoned that the legislative suspension of the Excuse Requirement and the injunction of the Witness Requirement in *Middleton* for the November election had largely mooted the plaintiffs' claims for this electoral cycle. The stay would remain in effect until the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or future statewide elections became sufficiently determinable, with plaintiffs' counsel responsible for requesting the stay be lifted no later than three months before the next scheduled statewide election. A motion to consolidate this case with *Middleton* was denied on September 22, 2020. The intervenor-defendants filed a motion to reconsider and lift the stay or enter judgment on September 22, 2020.",
    "JC-MD-0017": "On April 21, 2020, a group of incarcerated individuals, including both pretrial detainees and post-conviction prisoners, filed a class action complaint against Mary Lou McDonough, the Director of the Prince George's County Department of Corrections, in her official capacity. The plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from Civil Rights Corps and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, grounded in 42 U.S.C. § 1983, stemming from the Jail's allegedly uncontrolled COVID-19 outbreak and inadequate response. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the Jail's conditions (lack of hygiene, ineffective social distancing, disregard for symptomatic individuals, and unsanitary isolation facilities) created a substantial risk of serious illness and death. They also alleged a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment due to the Jail's policy of unlawfully detaining COVID-positive prisoners who were legally entitled to release. A subset of medically vulnerable pretrial detainees further sought writs of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, arguing that the Jail's conditions posed an immediate, severe risk to their lives. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief (including mandatory implementation of CDC guidelines, provision of mental health services, improved sanitation, personal protective equipment, appropriate social distancing, and an end to the alleged overdetention policy), monetary damages (attorneys' fees and costs), and release for the medically vulnerable subclass.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Paula Xinis. Following the initial filing, the plaintiffs also moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction, and for class certification. Defendant McDonough answered the original complaint on May 13, 2020.\n\nOn May 1, 2020, Judge Xinis appointed Dr. Carlos Franco-Paredes, an infectious disease expert, as an independent expert witness under Federal Rule of Evidence 706 to inspect the Jail's conditions regarding COVID-19. Dr. Franco-Paredes conducted a site visit on May 6-7, 2020, and presented his report and testimony on May 11, 2020. His findings indicated that while the Jail was generally complying with many CDC guidelines regarding supplies (soap, disinfectant, masks) and its lockdown measures had helped contain the spread, a \"large outbreak\" had occurred in late March to mid-April. He noted significant undertesting (18 positive out of 20 tested detainees, indicating a 90% positivity rate), inadequate treatment and isolation of symptomatic detainees, and a lack of a specific plan for medically vulnerable individuals.\n\nOn May 21, 2020, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion (2020 WL 2571168) and Order granting in part the plaintiffs' motion for a TRO. The Court found a likelihood of success on the merits for the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims, citing the \"triple-threat\" of undertesting, inadequate treatment/isolation of symptomatic detainees, and the absence of a plan for high-risk individuals. The Court ordered the Director to:\n1.  Within five days, file comprehensive written plans for identifying, monitoring, treating, and housing \"high risk\" detainees (as defined by CDC criteria), including single-cell housing when appropriate.\n2.  Within five days, file comprehensive written plans for staff training, education, and supervision on symptom identification, timely medical care, improved sick call response, and accurate temperature checks.\n3.  Within five days, file comprehensive written plans for COVID-19 testing criteria for current and new detainees, obtaining test kits, and isolating/releasing positive/symptomatic detainees.\n4.  Within 14 and 28 days, report total tests administered, confirmed positive detainees, and details of new positive cases.\n5.  Within 14 days, file comprehensive written plans for continued provision of soap and cleaning supplies, social distancing measures, adequate face masks for detainees, and other protocols in response to Dr. Franco-Paredes' report.\n\nThe Court denied preliminary relief for the overdetention and habeas claims, finding the latter was primarily a challenge to prison conditions, not the fact of confinement, and that en masse release was not warranted at that stage. The motion for class certification was held in abeyance.\n\nDefendant McDonough appealed the May 21, 2020, TRO to the Fourth Circuit (USCA Case Number 20-6776) and moved the District Court to stay the order pending appeal. On June 3, 2020, Judge Xinis denied the motion to stay, finding that the defendant had not made a strong showing of likely success on the merits or irreparable harm, and that the public interest favored denial. The Fourth Circuit subsequently denied the defendant's motion for a stay pending appeal on June 10, 2020, and later dismissed the appeal on August 12, 2020.\n\nIn response to the May 21 Order, Defendant filed a five-day response on May 26, 2020, outlining new plans for high-risk detainee management, staff training, and testing. A 14-day report filed on June 5, 2020, indicated that 521 out of 525 inmates had been tested, with 6 positive cases (1.14% infection rate) and 2 of those released. 47 new detainees were received, with 0 positive results from 19 tests, 9 refusals, and 45 pending. New intakes were to be quarantined for 14 days.\n\nOn July 2, 2020, Judge Xinis denied an extension or modification of the May 21, 2020, TRO, concluding that the TRO was extinguished. The motion for preliminary injunction was also denied.\n\nOn July 3, 2020, plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint, introducing new claims (Counts IV and V) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment violations based on the Jail's continued universal and indefinite lockdown. These new claims detailed psychological and physiological harms, lack of mental health services, and insufficient procedural protections associated with the lockdown, which had continued for a fourth month. On July 17, 2020, Defendant McDonough filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint or, Alternatively, Motion for Summary Judgment, arguing mootness for released plaintiffs, failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and failure to state claims for the new counts and the original overdetention and habeas claims. Settlement discussions have been ongoing, with multiple conferences held with Magistrate Judge Timothy J. Sullivan from September to December 2020, and again in March 2021, and all deadlines were stayed pending these discussions.",
    "IM-FL-0029": "On April 13, 2020, civil immigration detainees in three Florida detention centers—Krome Detention Center, Glades County Detention Center, and Broward Transitional Center—filed a class action lawsuit against the Field Office Director for the Miami Field Office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Attorney General. The detainees, initially 34 and later expanded to 58 named plaintiffs, sought habeas corpus relief, a declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief, alleging that their continued detention during the COVID-19 pandemic violated their Fifth Amendment Due Process rights (including the right to reasonable safety and claims under the *Accardi* doctrine and state-created danger theory) and Eighth Amendment protections. They contended that overcrowded conditions and ICE's policies prevented adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, exposing them to an imminent, severe, and possibly fatal risk of COVID-19 infection. Counsel for the detainees included private law firms and non-profit/legal services organizations such as the University of Miami School of Law Immigration Clinic and the Southern Poverty Law Center. District Judge Marcia G. Cooke presided over the case, with Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman handling pre-trial matters.\n\nThe detainees promptly filed an Emergency Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and a Preliminary Injunction. After reviewing arguments and declarations from both sides, Magistrate Judge Goodman issued a Report and Recommendations on April 22, 2020. Both parties filed objections. On April 30, 2020, Judge Cooke adopted parts of the Report and Recommendations, granting a TRO that ordered ICE to evaluate named detainees for release, report on plans to reduce facility populations to 75% capacity, and immediately comply with CDC and ICE guidelines regarding hygiene, masks, and education. The TRO was extended multiple times. On May 2, 2020, Judge Cooke clarified that ICE could transfer detainees only after evaluating their eligibility for release.\n\nOn May 5, 2020, the detainees filed an Expedited Motion for Class Certification. Following arguments and a subsequent Amended Report and Recommendations from Magistrate Judge Goodman, Judge Cooke issued an Omnibus Order on June 6, 2020. This order granted class certification for all current civil immigration detainees held by ICE at Krome, Glades, and Broward Transitional Center (and those held there since the action's filing or in the future) for their conditions-of-confinement claims. However, it denied class certification for the habeas corpus claims seeking immediate release, deeming them too individualized. The Court explicitly retained jurisdiction over all class members transferred to other facilities. The Omnibus Order also converted the existing TRO into a Preliminary Injunction, mandating specific actions from ICE, including: ceasing the cohorting of unconfirmed and confirmed COVID-19 cases; providing sufficient CDC-recommended cleaning supplies, disinfectants, and masks to all detainees and staff; ensuring unrestricted access to hand soap, hand sanitizer, and disposable hand towels; educating detainees on COVID-19; limiting transportation to essential medical appointments and releases; enforcing social distancing in transport vehicles and detention areas; and implementing rigorous testing protocols before transfers.\n\nFollowing the Preliminary Injunction, the detainees filed a second Emergency Motion to Compel Compliance on June 16, 2020, alleging continued violations. In response, Judge Cooke appointed Matthew C. Dates as Special Master on July 17, 2020, to inspect the three detention facilities and assess ICE's compliance. Special Master Dates conducted inspections in late July and early August 2020. In his Report and Recommendation filed on February 19, 2021, the Special Master found ICE's declarations concerning cleanliness, supply stock, and attempts at social distancing to be \"credible,\" acknowledging challenges in a rapidly evolving pandemic. However, he concluded that ICE's social distancing measures were \"insufficient\" given the facilities' structural limitations and the airborne nature of the virus. He recommended denying the motion to compel regarding general conditions but suggested the Court incentivize deportation or release to achieve better social distancing. On March 25, 2021, Judge Cooke adopted the Special Master's Report, granting in part and denying in part the motion to compel, and requested further information and briefing on social distancing and cohorting.\n\nA jury trial was scheduled for April 27, 2021. However, on June 28, 2021, the parties reached a Settlement Agreement, which resolved all class-wide claims. The agreement, enforceable as a court injunction, requires ICE to comply with all applicable detention guidelines, ICE Pandemic Response Requirements (PRR), and CDC Guidelines. Key terms include implementing a COVID-19 vaccination protocol, providing free vaccinations and related educational materials, offering seasonal influenza vaccinations, maintaining population density at 75% capacity or lower, and reporting on any deviations. It mandates testing for symptomatic individuals and close contacts, isolation for positive cases, and medical isolation for exposed but negative individuals. The agreement also details requirements for providing unlimited soap, hand sanitizer, new masks (replaced regularly), and cleaning supplies. Specific protocols for transfers, including rapid testing and vehicle sanitization, are outlined. The agreement ensures social distancing in all detention areas (sleeping, eating, lines) \"whenever possible,\" mandates proper maintenance and cleaning logs for facilities, requires staff to wear PPE, and guarantees detainees access to their medical records and interpreters for educational materials. The settlement is set to last for six months from the entry of the Final Order or until all remaining detainees have had an opportunity to be fully vaccinated, whichever is later. The Court retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, with provisions for future disputes over compliance.",
    "46306": "On March 26, 2025, a group of eleven nonprofit legal service organizations, including Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs, represented by private legal services organizations including Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, and Justice Action Center, sued the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), its Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), and the Department of the Interior (DOI).\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that federal government agencies had violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by terminating funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children. The plaintiffs claimed this action was \"not in accordance with law\" under the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), 8 U.S.C. § 1232, which requires the government to \"ensure, to the greatest extent practicable,\" that unaccompanied children receive legal counsel. They further argued the termination violated ORR's own 2024 Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule, 45 C.F.R. pt. 410, which mandates ORR to \"fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation\" to unaccompanied children if appropriations are available and pro bono counsel is not practicable. Lastly, plaintiffs asserted the termination was an \"arbitrary and capricious\" agency action. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the defendants violated the law and were required to continue funding legal representation, along with a nationwide injunction prohibiting the cessation of funding and an award of attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín.\n\nThe factual basis for the case stemmed from the defendants' decision on March 21, 2025, to terminate contract line items through which HHS and ORR had provided funding for counsel for unaccompanied children, despite congressional appropriations for these services being available through at least September 30, 2027. This \"Cancellation Order,\" issued by DOI on behalf of HHS/ORR, directed legal service providers to \"immediately stop work\" on ongoing funded representations, impacting approximately 26,000 unaccompanied children nationwide. Plaintiffs alleged this forced them to lay off staff, divert resources, and potentially withdraw from existing cases, severely harming their missions and leaving vulnerable children unrepresented in complex immigration proceedings.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction. The defendants opposed, arguing, among other things, that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, which channels contract claims against the government to the Court of Federal Claims, and that the funding decisions were committed to agency discretion. On April 1, 2025, Judge Martínez-Olguín granted the TRO, enjoining the defendants from withdrawing services or funds for direct legal representation as of March 20, 2025, under the TVPRA and Foundational Rule, and precluding the cutting off of congressionally appropriated funding. The court ruled that no security bond was required. The TRO was initially set to expire on April 16, 2025.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, defendants moved to dissolve the TRO, citing the intervening Supreme Court decision in *Department of Education v. California*, 2025 WL 1008354, which held that the APA's waiver of sovereign immunity does not extend to orders compelling payment under contractual obligations. On April 9, 2025, defendants also moved for Judge Martínez-Olguín's recusal, citing her prior employment as a managing attorney at lead plaintiff Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto and her public statements criticizing prior immigration policies, which they argued created an appearance of bias or personal knowledge of disputed facts. On April 10, 2025, the court extended the TRO until April 30, 2025, citing the pending recusal motion as good cause.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, Judge Martínez-Olguín denied the motion for recusal, finding that neither her prior employment nor her past advocacy statements warranted disqualification. On April 18, 2025, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the defendants' appeal of the TRO for lack of appellate jurisdiction (2025 WL 1203167), and a subsequent petition for rehearing en banc was denied on April 24, 2025.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, the district court denied the defendants' motion to dissolve the TRO, distinguishing *Department of Education v. California* on the grounds that the plaintiffs in this case were subcontractors with no direct contractual relationship with the government, and they sought enforcement of statutory/regulatory duties, not monetary damages for breach of contract.\n\nOn April 29, 2025, Judge Martínez-Olguín granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, replacing the TRO. The preliminary injunction carried the same terms, enjoining the defendants from withdrawing funding for direct legal representation of unaccompanied children as of March 20, 2025, under the TVPRA and Foundational Rule, and precluding the cutting off of congressionally appropriated funding. The court again ruled that no security bond was required, and the injunction remains in place until a final judgment on the merits. The court ordered status reports on compliance.\n\nOn April 30, 2025, the defendants filed a notice of appeal of the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit. On May 5, 2025, the defendants filed an emergency motion with the Ninth Circuit to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal, reiterating their arguments regarding lack of jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, agency discretion, irreparable harm to the government, and the appearance of judicial impartiality. On May 14, 2025, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants' motion to stay the preliminary injunction, finding the government failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm.\n\nOn June 6, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint, again asserting lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. On July 17, 2025, Judge Martínez-Olguín denied the motion to dismiss, reaffirming her prior jurisdictional rulings. On July 31, 2025, the defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint. On August 1, 2025, the court ordered the defendants to file a certification of the administrative record and for the parties to propose a dispositive motion briefing schedule. The administrative record was subsequently filed on August 18, 2025. The case is ongoing, with an appeal of the preliminary injunction pending before the Ninth Circuit.",
    "46201": "On March 6, 2025, eight U.S. States—California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Wisconsin—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Education, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, and former Acting Secretary of Education Denise Carter. The states, represented by their Attorneys General, sued on behalf of their respective public universities, schools, and residents.\n\nThe lawsuit arose after the Department of Education, in February 2025, abruptly terminated approximately $600 million in previously awarded grants under the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) and Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) programs. These programs, established by Congress, aimed to address nationwide teacher shortages and improve teacher quality in underserved communities and subjects. The terminations affected over forty active programs in the plaintiff states, totaling over $250 million, and were enacted through boilerplate letters citing inconsistency with new \"Department priorities,\" including an unspecified elimination of \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI) initiatives. This action followed executive orders issued by President Trump broadly seeking to end DEI-related federal funding.\n\nThe plaintiff states initially alleged that the Department’s actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), specifically that they were arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). They contended that the terminations lacked reasoned explanation, failed to consider reliance interests, contradicted the statutory purposes of the TQP and SEED programs (20 U.S.C. §§ 1022 et seq. and § 6672), and violated federal regulations regarding grant terminations (2 C.F.R. part 200). The states sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including a temporary restraining order (TRO), a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, and attorneys' fees and costs, to vacate the terminations and restore the grants.\n\nDistrict Judge Myong J. Joun initially presided over the case. On March 10, 2025, Judge Joun granted the plaintiff states' motion for a TRO, ordering the defendants to immediately restore the pre-existing status quo for the affected grants and temporarily enjoining further terminations unless consistent with federal law, regulations, and grant terms. The court's decision was influenced by similar rulings in related cases such as *Massachusetts v. Nat’l Institutes of Health*, 2025 WL 702163 (D. Mass. Mar. 5, 2025), and *New York v. Trump*, 25-cv-39, 2025 WL 357368 (D.R.I. Jan. 31, 2025).\n\nThe defendants immediately appealed the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on March 11, 2025, and filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal, which the First Circuit denied on March 12, 2025 (___ F.4th ___ (2025)). On March 21, 2025, the plaintiff states moved to extend the TRO, which Judge Joun granted on March 24, 2025, extending it until April 7, 2025, or until a ruling on the preliminary injunction.\n\nThe defendants then filed an application with the U.S. Supreme Court to vacate the District Court's TRO. On April 4, 2025, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 *per curiam* decision (604 U.S. ___ (2025)), granted the application, staying the District Court's order pending the First Circuit appeal. The Supreme Court's majority opined that the District Court likely lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA, suggesting such claims belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's stay, the plaintiff states withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction on April 8, 2025, rendering it moot. The defendants subsequently filed an unopposed motion to voluntarily dismiss their appeal to the First Circuit.\n\nOn May 12, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, to transfer the action to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, reiterating their jurisdictional arguments. On June 2, 2025, the plaintiff states filed a First Amended Complaint, adding constitutional claims under the Spending Clause (U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 1) and the Separation of Powers doctrine (U.S. Const. art. I, § 1), as well as an equitable ultra vires claim. They argued that the Department’s actions were beyond its statutory authority and unconstitutional. Following this, on June 3, 2025, Judge Joun recused herself, and the case was reassigned to District Judge Angel Kelley. The defendants later re-filed their motion to dismiss or transfer on June 30, 2025, targeting the First Amended Complaint.",
    "45984": "The case, *Nicolas Talbott, et al. v. United States of America, et al.*, Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-00240, was initially filed on January 28, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, a group of transgender service members and prospective service members, were represented by private and non-profit legal counsel, including GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders and the National Center for Lesbian Rights. The defendants included the United States of America, the Secretary of Defense, and various acting secretaries and departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Defense Health Agency. The President of the United States was initially named as a defendant but was later dismissed by court order.\n\nThe lawsuit challenged President Donald J. Trump’s January 27, 2025, Executive Order 14183 (\"Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness\"), and related provisions of Executive Order 14168 (\"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government\"), along with implementing memoranda from the Department of Defense (DoD). These policies reversed the prior 2021 Austin Policy, which allowed transgender individuals to serve openly in the U.S. military. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection component, asserting that the ban discriminated against them based on sex and transgender status, procedural due process, and estoppel. They sought declaratory judgment that the ban was unconstitutional and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent their categorical exclusion from military service, to ensure access to medically necessary care, and to prevent requirements that they serve in their birth sex.\n\nThe challenged Executive Order 14183, issued seven days after President Trump took office, declared transgender status incompatible with military standards like readiness, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. It incorporated definitions from Executive Order 14168 that define \"sex\" as an immutable biological classification at conception, explicitly aimed at denying legal recognition to transgender individuals. The Order mandated revisions to military medical standards, prohibited \"identification-based\" pronoun usage, and required sex-segregated facilities based on birth sex. The Secretary of Defense, Peter B. Hegseth, issued \"Additional Guidance on Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness\" on February 26, 2025 (the \"Hegseth Policy\"), which implemented the ban, paused new accessions for individuals with a history or symptoms of gender dysphoria, and halted gender-affirming medical procedures. This policy also initiated administrative separation proceedings for current transgender service members, offering a waiver that the court later described as an \"exemption in name only\" due to stringent conditions that virtually no transgender person could meet.\n\nThe plaintiffs, many with decades of honorable and decorated service, testified to the direct harm caused by the ban, including the cancellation of medically necessary gender-affirming surgeries, removal from training programs, placement on administrative absence, and the loss of career opportunities. They argued that the ban was based on animus and conjecture, lacking support from military studies, including the 2016 RAND report and more recent DoD reviews, which generally indicated no adverse impact from transgender service.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, Judge Ana C. Reyes of the District Court granted the plaintiffs' Renewed Application for Preliminary Injunction, ruling that the Military Ban was likely unconstitutional. The court found that the ban was \"soaked in animus and dripping with pretext,\" lacked a rational basis, and failed intermediate scrutiny because it classified individuals based on sex and transgender status without an \"exceedingly persuasive\" justification. The court noted that the ban's language was \"unabashedly demeaning\" and its conclusions \"bear no relation to fact,\" contradicting military leaders' testimony that transgender service members are fit and contribute positively. Judge Reyes' order (2025 WL 842332) preliminarily enjoined the implementation of Executive Order 14183, the Hegseth Policy, and any related directives, effectively reinstating the 2021 Austin Policy. The court ordered defendants to maintain the plaintiffs' military statuses and to take steps to effectuate the order.\n\nDefendants subsequently moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction and for a stay pending appeal, citing new \"Military Department Identification Guidance\" (MDI Guidance) issued on March 21, 2025. On March 26, 2025, Judge Reyes denied this motion (2025 WL 914716), reiterating that the MDI Guidance did not alter her conclusion and further confirmed the ban's animus and lack of reasoned judgment. She again *sua sponte* stayed her order until March 28, 2025, to allow defendants to seek an emergency stay from the D.C. Circuit.\n\nOn March 26, 2025, the defendants filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (Case #25-5087) and an Emergency Motion for Immediate Administrative Stay and Stay Pending Appeal. On March 27, 2025, the D.C. Circuit issued an Order granting an administrative stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction pending further order from the appellate court. Related cases include prior litigation challenging the first Trump administration's transgender military ban (e.g., *Doe 1 v. Trump*, *Doe 2 v. Shanahan*, *Stone v. Trump*, *Karnoski v. Trump*, *Stockman v. Trump*) and other ongoing challenges to the current ban (*Shilling v. Trump*, *Ireland v. Hegseth*). On June 27, 2025, two plaintiffs, Miriam Perelson and Greyson Shishkina, were voluntarily dismissed. The defendants filed their Answer to the Fourth Amended Complaint on August 1, 2025.",
    "VR-LA-0120": "This case, *Clark, et al. v. Edwards, et al.*, was initially filed on May 19, 2020, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs included individual voters, Telisa Clark and Lakeshia Barnett, along with civic engagement organizations, Crescent City Media Group and the League of Women Voters Louisiana. They were represented by legal advocacy groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and Fair Elections Center, as well as private counsel from Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP. The defendants were the Governor of Louisiana, the Secretary of State of Louisiana, and the Attorney General of Louisiana. Initially, two parish Registrars of Voters were also named defendants, but they were later removed from the amended complaint. The State of Louisiana subsequently intervened as a defendant in the consolidated proceedings.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought this action under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (52 U.S.C. § 10302), alleging violations of their fundamental rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, including the right to vote, bodily integrity, and procedural due process. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to address what they claimed were unconstitutional burdens on voting rights during the COVID-19 public health crisis.\n\nThe factual basis for the case centered on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Louisiana, which led Governor John Bel Edwards to declare a state of emergency and issue stay-at-home orders, and to twice postpone state elections. For the July 11 and August 15, 2020 elections, Louisiana adopted an Emergency Election Plan. However, the plaintiffs argued that this plan, and existing state election laws, failed to adequately protect voters from COVID-19 risks for all 2020 elections (July 11, August 15, November 3, and December 5). Specifically, they challenged three provisions: (1) the \"Excuse Requirement\" (La. Rev. Stat. § 18:1303), which limited absentee voting by mail to specific categories of voters, even with the emergency plan's narrow additions for July/August; (2) the \"Witness Requirement\" (La. Rev. Stat. § 18:1306(E)(2)(a)), which mandated an in-person witness signature for absentee ballots (later amended by Senate Bill 75 to restrict who could serve as a witness); and (3) the \"Cure Prohibition\" (La. Rev. Stat. § 18:1313), which denied absentee voters notice or opportunity to correct ballot defects (an emergency rule on June 15, 2020, allowed in-person curing, which plaintiffs deemed insufficient).\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that these challenged provisions forced many voters, particularly those at high risk from COVID-19 or living with high-risk individuals (such as plaintiff Telisa Clark, who has underlying health conditions, and plaintiff Lakeshia Barnett, who lives with high-risk family members), to choose between exercising their right to vote and endangering their health. They contended that these burdens disproportionately affected Black voters, who face higher rates of COVID-19 infection and death due to systemic socioeconomic and health disparities. Organizational plaintiffs, Crescent City Media Group and the League of Women Voters Louisiana, asserted that they were forced to divert limited resources from their core civic engagement missions to educate voters about these complex rules and mitigate in-person voting risks.\n\nOn June 3, 2020, a related case, *Power Coalition for Equity and Justice, et al. v. Edwards, et al.* (Case No. 3:20-cv-00283-SDD-RLB), was consolidated with *Clark v. Edwards*, with the latter designated as the lead case before Chief Judge Shelly D. Dick. The State of Louisiana intervened as a defendant.\n\nThe defendants filed motions to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing, that the claims presented non-justiciable political questions, and that the requested relief would interfere with upcoming elections in violation of the Purcell doctrine. The defendants contended that the COVID-19 pandemic was not \"state action\" and that any alleged injuries were speculative and not traceable to or redressable by the state.\n\nThe Court, Chief Judge Shelly D. Dick presiding, held a telephone status conference on June 8, 2020. On June 22, 2020, the Court issued a ruling granting the defendants' motions to dismiss. The initial judgment dismissed the plaintiffs' claims *with prejudice*. However, following a motion to amend judgment filed by the Clark plaintiffs, the Court issued an amended judgment on June 30, 2020, dismissing the claims *without prejudice*, noting that the dismissal was based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction (standing) and not on the merits of the case.",
    "45964": "On January 21, 2025, the States of Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon (the Plaintiff States) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against the President of the United States, several federal agencies (U.S. Departments of Homeland Security, Social Security Administration, State, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Agriculture), and their respective acting secretaries or commissioners (the federal defendants). The Plaintiff States were later joined by Individual Plaintiffs, Cherly Norales Castillo and Alicia Chavarria Lopez, pregnant noncitizens residing in Washington State, who sought to represent a class of similarly situated pregnant persons and their future children. Their lawsuit, originally filed as a separate action (C25-0163-JCC), was consolidated with the Plaintiff States’ case (C25-0127-JCC) on January 27, 2025.\n\nThe core of the dispute is President Trump’s Executive Order, \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\" issued on January 20, 2025. This Order declared that U.S. citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the United States if their mother was unlawfully or temporarily present, and their father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. It directed federal agencies to cease issuing or accepting citizenship documents for such individuals born after February 19, 2025, and to issue public guidance on its implementation.\n\nThe Plaintiff States and Individual Plaintiffs alleged that this Executive Order violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause and Section 1401 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Individual Plaintiffs also asserted a claim under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706). They sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief (temporary, preliminary, and permanent), and attorneys' fees. They argued that the Executive Order's redefinition of citizenship would cause irreparable harm: for the Plaintiff States, through the loss of federal funding for programs like Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and foster care, as well as increased administrative burdens; and for the Individual Plaintiffs and proposed class members, through the denial of U.S. citizenship, risk of removal or statelessness, and loss of essential rights and benefits. The federal defendants countered that the Executive Order's interpretation of \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" was constitutionally sound, that the Plaintiff States lacked standing due to indirect or self-inflicted harms, and that broad injunctive relief was unwarranted. Judge John C. Coughenour presided over the case.\n\nOn January 23, 2025, the District Court granted the Plaintiff States' motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the enforcement and implementation of the Executive Order on a nationwide basis. On February 6, 2025, following a preliminary injunction hearing, the court granted a universal preliminary injunction, finding that the Executive Order was likely unconstitutional and unlawful. The court concluded that the Plaintiff States had standing based on direct and immediate economic and administrative harms, and the Individual Plaintiffs' standing was undisputed. The court determined that a universal injunction was necessary to provide complete relief to the Plaintiff States.\n\nThe federal defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Case No. 25-807) on February 6, 2025, and moved for a stay of the injunction pending appeal. The District Court denied the stay motion on February 26, 2025. The Ninth Circuit subsequently denied the federal defendants' emergency motion for a partial stay pending appeal on February 19, 2025 (2025 WL 553485). The federal defendants then filed an emergency application for a partial stay with the Supreme Court of the United States (Case Nos. 24A884, 24A885, 24A886) on March 13, 2025. The Supreme Court consolidated the applications with similar cases from other circuits (D. Md. – 2025 WL 408636; D. Mass. – 2025 WL 485070; 1st Cir. – 2025 WL 118257710).\n\nOn June 27, 2025, the Supreme Court granted a partial stay of the injunctions (2025 WL 1773631). The Supreme Court held that universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority of federal courts, limiting the injunctions to be \"no broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue.\" The Supreme Court also stayed the prohibition on executive agencies from developing and issuing public guidance about the Executive Order's implementation.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's decision, on July 23, 2025, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's preliminary injunction, upholding its constitutionality (9th Cir. July 23, 2025). The Ninth Circuit dismissed the Individual Plaintiffs’ claims, finding them moot or covered by a class action certified in another federal court (\"Barbara,\" et al. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1904338 (D. N.H. July 10, 2025)). However, the Ninth Circuit affirmed that the Plaintiff States had standing and were likely to succeed on the merits, concluding that the Executive Order is invalid because it contradicts the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause and the INA. The Ninth Circuit also affirmed the universal scope of the injunction, reasoning that it was necessary to provide complete relief to the Plaintiff States due to the cross-border mobility of individuals and the administrative burdens a narrower injunction would impose. The Ninth Circuit's opinion was updated on July 28, 2025. The case remains stayed in the District Court pending the outcome of any further appeals."
