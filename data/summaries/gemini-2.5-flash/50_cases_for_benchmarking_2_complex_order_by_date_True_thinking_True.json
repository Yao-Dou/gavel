    "46290": "On March 5, 2025, the Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council (QEC), a recognized student organization represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The QEC sued members of the Board of Regents of the Texas A&M University System, the Chancellor of the System, and the President of Texas A&M University, all in their official capacities.\n\nThe QEC alleged violations of its First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, brought under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, and sought relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02. The QEC also claimed that the Board of Regents violated the Texas Open Meetings Act, Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 551.141, 551.142.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from the Board of Regents' February 28, 2025, resolution to ban all \"Drag Show Events\" from university \"Special Event Venues.\" This resolution, which the Board adopted after providing public notice only the day before its meeting, led to the immediate cancellation of Draggieland, an annual, student-funded drag show organized by the QEC and scheduled for March 27, 2025, at the Rudder Theatre. The Board asserted that drag shows were inconsistent with university values, \"demeaned women,\" and promoted \"gender ideology\" in potential violation of a federal executive order. The QEC contended that drag performances are expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, that the Rudder Theatre is a designated public forum for student expression, and that the ban constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination and an impermissible prior restraint on speech.\n\nThe QEC sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctions to prevent the enforcement of the ban, a declaratory judgment that the ban violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and an injunction voiding the Board's February 28, 2025, actions.\n\nOn March 24, 2025, Senior United States District Judge Lee H. Rosenthal granted the QEC's motion for a preliminary injunction. In a Memorandum and Opinion, the court determined that the QEC demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its First Amendment claims, noting that Draggieland constituted protected speech and expressive conduct. The court found that the Rudder Theatre functioned as a designated public forum and that the Board's ban was an unconstitutional viewpoint-based restriction and prior restraint on speech, regardless of the forum type. The court also found the ban unconstitutionally vague and not narrowly tailored to serve any compelling governmental interest. Furthermore, Judge Rosenthal ruled that the QEC would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction, and that the public interest favored protecting free speech on campus. The court waived the bond requirement for the QEC.\n\nThe preliminary injunction, issued on March 24, 2025, prohibited the defendants and their agents from enforcing the Board's resolution and ordered them to permit the Draggieland performance to take place as scheduled on March 27, 2025, at the Rudder Theatre. The injunction remains in effect until further order of the court.\n\nOn March 28, 2025, the defendants filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (USCA No. 25-20108) and an Opposed Motion to Stay the Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal.",
    "46324": "A lawsuit was filed on March 31, 2025, by Inclusiv, Inc., a nonprofit financial intermediary, against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA Acting Deputy Administrator W.C. McIntosh, and Citibank, N.A., a national banking association. Inclusiv, Inc. is represented by private counsel from Venable LLP.\n\nThe case centers on the EPA's February 2025 freeze and March 2025 purported termination of a $1.87 billion grant awarded to Inclusiv under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund's (GGRF) Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) program, established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The GGRF aims to support clean energy, energy efficiency, and pollution reduction through competitive grants. Inclusiv, as a recipient, had already committed $651 million in subawards to 108 credit unions across 27 states and Puerto Rico, intending to distribute up to $1.683 billion by June 30, 2030, to finance clean technology deployment in low-income and disadvantaged communities. EPA's actions, including public statements by Administrator Zeldin alleging \"reckless financial management, blatant conflicts of interest, astonishing sums of tax dollars awarded to unqualified recipients,\" and \"misalignment with the agency's priorities,\" led to Citibank, the designated financial agent, refusing to disburse the obligated funds from Inclusiv's account.\n\nInclusiv alleges that the EPA's actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being arbitrary and capricious, not in accordance with law, and in excess of statutory authority, specifically contravening the Inflation Reduction Act, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, and the Anti-Deficiency Act, as well as EPA's own regulations (2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339–342). Inclusiv also asserts violations of the U.S. Constitution, including the Separation of Powers (Legislative Vesting Clause, Spending Clause, Appropriations Clause, and Take Care Clause) and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, arguing that EPA's actions are ultra vires. Against Citibank, Inclusiv claims breach of contract under the Account Control Agreement, conversion, and replevin for withholding the funds.\n\nInclusiv seeks declaratory judgments that EPA's termination is void and unlawful, and that Citibank's freeze and refusal to comply with instructions violate its contractual obligations and property rights. Inclusiv also seeks permanent injunctions to set aside EPA's termination, enjoin EPA from interfering with the grant, and order Citibank to comply with its obligations, including setting up subrecipient accounts and disbursing funds.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan. This case, 1:25-cv-00948, has been consolidated with case 1:25-cv-00698-TSC, and all future filings are to be made in the lead case (1:25-cv-00698-TSC). Other related cases include *Climate United v. Citibank*, 1:25-cv-698; *Power Forward Communities v. Citibank*, 1:25-cv-739; *California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank v. Citibank*, 1:25-cv-770; and *Just Climate Fund v. Environmental Protection Agency*, 1:25-cv-825. Inclusiv filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 1, 2025, after finding its funds removed from its Citibank account, despite prior assurances. This motion was withdrawn on April 2, 2025, after the funds were reportedly reinvested in money market funds and expected to reappear. Inclusiv's motion for a preliminary injunction, filed on April 1, 2025, was denied as moot on April 16, 2025, following the consolidation of the case and a preliminary injunction order in the lead case.",
    "46391": "On April 11, 2025, five international students, S.Y., Z.D., Y.W., H.G., and W.X., who are either current F-1 visa students or engaged in post-graduate Optional Practical Training (OPT) in the Northern District of California, filed a lawsuit against Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Todd M. Lyons, in his official capacity as Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; Moises Becerra, in his official capacity as Acting Field Office Director of the San Francisco Office of Detention and Removal, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States. Represented by private counsel, the individual plaintiffs proceeded pseudonymously due to fear of retaliation.\n\nThe students alleged that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abruptly and unlawfully terminated their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records between April 4 and April 8, 2025. The stated reason for termination was \"Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked.\" The plaintiffs asserted that their minor criminal histories (misdemeanor convictions, arrests with dismissed charges, or arrests with no charges filed) did not constitute a failure to maintain F-1 status or render them deportable, and that their visas had been reissued previously with full disclosure of these incidents. Some plaintiffs also received notices that their F-1 visas had been revoked. The students contended that ICE's actions were designed to coerce them into leaving the country without due process, leading to severe stress, anxiety, and the risk of unlawful arrest, detention, transfer, and deportation.\n\nThe students brought their action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Declaratory Judgment Act, also alleging violations of their Fifth Amendment procedural due process rights. They sought a declaratory judgment that the SEVIS terminations were unlawful, an order to vacate the terminations, the restoration of their SEVIS records and F-1 visa statuses, and injunctive relief prohibiting the defendants from taking any enforcement action against them related to these terminations or their immigration histories.\n\nInitially assigned to District Judge Noel Wise, the case was later related to several other similar cases, including *JOHN DOE v. DONALD J. TRUMP, et al.* (25-cv-03140-JSW), and reassigned to District Judge Jeffrey S. White.\n\nOn April 16, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). Judge Wise granted the TRO on April 17, 2025 (2025 WL 4218003), enjoining the defendants for 14 days from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring the plaintiffs outside the district, and from imposing any legal effect caused by the SEVIS terminations or potential visa revocations. Judge Wise cited similar rulings in cases like *Roe v. Noem, 2025 WL 1114694 (D. Mont. April 15, 2025)* and *Isserdasani v. Noem, 2025 WL 1118626 (W.D. Wis. Apr. 15, 2025)*. On April 25, 2025, following a hearing with related cases, Judge White extended the TRO for an additional 14 days and scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, Judge White granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The defendants subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on July 21, 2025 (USCA Case Number 25-4523), appealing the preliminary injunction order. A motion to stay the injunction pending appeal was filed on August 8, 2025, with a hearing scheduled for September 12, 2025.",
    "46509": "On April 29, 2025, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), its Board of Directors, and individual Board members Laura G. Ross, Thomas E. Rothman, and Diane Kaplan, represented by private counsel Saul Ewing LLP, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (Case No. 25-1305). The plaintiffs sued President Donald J. Trump in his official capacity, along with Trent Morse (Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel), the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Russell Vought (Director of OMB), the White House Presidential Personnel Office, and Sergio Gor (Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office).\n\nThe lawsuit stemmed from an email sent on April 28, 2025, by Deputy Director Morse, purporting to terminate the positions of Board members Ross, Rothman, and Kaplan on behalf of President Trump. The plaintiffs alleged that these actions violated the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (47 U.S.C. § 396 et seq.), which established CPB as a private, nonprofit corporation explicitly designed to be insulated from governmental interference and control, with its Board members not considered federal officers or employees. They further contended that the President's actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C)) by exceeding statutory authority, and the Constitution's Separation of Powers, Presentment, Appropriations, and Take Care Clauses (U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 7, Clause 2; Art. II, Sec. 3, Clause 3) by constituting an ultra vires exercise of presidential power. The plaintiffs sought a judicial declaration (under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202) that the purported terminations were of no legal effect, an order enjoining the defendants from interfering with CPB's governance and operations, and an award of costs and attorney's fees.\n\nConcurrently with their complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, which the parties subsequently agreed to treat as a motion for a preliminary injunction. On June 8, 2025, Judge Randolph D. Moss denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction in a Memorandum Opinion and Order. Judge Moss found that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits regarding their claim for injunctive relief or a likelihood of suffering irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief. The court noted that the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act, to which CPB is subject, generally permits an appointing authority to remove a director with or without cause unless the corporation's articles or bylaws provide otherwise. The court also observed that CPB's Board had subsequently amended its bylaws to require Board concurrence for removals, and that the existence of a \"designated body\" provision in CPB's bylaws mitigated concerns about the corporation's ability to function.\n\nFollowing this ruling, on June 29, 2025, Judge Moss granted a joint motion for an expedited summary judgment briefing schedule. On July 24, 2025, individual plaintiff Laura G. Ross voluntarily dismissed her claims, and on August 1, 2025, individual plaintiff Thomas E. Rothman voluntarily dismissed his claims. On July 25, 2025, the remaining plaintiffs—the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, its Board of Directors, and Diane Kaplan—filed a motion for summary judgment. The case remains ongoing for these plaintiffs.",
    "46590": "This class action lawsuit was initially filed on April 7, 2025, by coal miners, represented by private, legal services, and public interest counsel. The lead plaintiff, Harry Wiley, an active coal miner, brought the action individually and on behalf of all other similarly situated coal miners against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. The case was assigned to Judge Irene C. Berger.\n\nThe factual basis of the complaint alleges that coal miners face severe health hazards, including advanced coal mine dust lung disease (\"black lung\"). Federal law, specifically the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 and the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act), mandates a medical screening program, known as the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP), and a unique right for miners to transfer to a non-dusty job (known as \"Part 90\") if they show early signs of occupational lung disease. These programs are administered by the Respiratory Health Division (RHD) within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiff, Harry Wiley, who had been diagnosed with black lung, applied for a Part 90 transfer in November 2024 but received no response. On April 1, 2025, the Department of Health and Human Services terminated or placed on administrative leave most critical employees of the RHD, including its chief medical officer, effectively halting the CWHSP and Part 90 programs.\n\nThe coal miners alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706, asserting that the defendants' actions were arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, and contrary to their statutory duties under 30 U.S.C. § 843 (requiring examinations and job transfer rights), 30 U.S.C. § 811(a)(7) (general examination authority), and 30 U.S.C. § 811(a)(9) (anti-backsliding provisions). They also claimed a deprivation of procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, arguing that the closure of the RHD deprived them of their property interests in accessing CWHSP monitoring and Part 90 job transfers without notice or opportunity to be heard. The miners sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief to fully restore the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division and compel the continuation of health surveillance and job transfer programs, and class certification.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, following a hearing, Judge Berger issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order, 2025 WL 4218003, granting the coal miners' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the miners were likely to succeed on the merits of their APA and due process claims, were likely to suffer irreparable harm from continued dust exposure and disease progression, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored an injunction. The court rejected the defendants' arguments regarding lack of standing and sovereign immunity, finding that the closure of the CWHSP constituted a final agency action and that the claims were not merely employment disputes. The preliminary injunction ordered the defendants to enjoin and rescind the reductions in force (RIFs) within the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division, facilitate its full restoration, and ensure no pause, stoppage, or gap in the protections and services mandated by Congress in the Mine Act and attendant regulations. The court set the security bond at zero. Subsequently, on August 14, 2025, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, rendering the defendants' prior motions to dismiss the original amended complaint moot. A scheduling order has been issued, setting a trial date for May 4, 2026.",
    "46605": "This class action lawsuit was filed on May 17, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan, a Venezuelan citizen, on his own behalf and on behalf of a putative class of similarly situated Venezuelan nationals. The plaintiffs brought claims for a writ of habeas corpus and declaratory and injunctive relief against various federal government officials and agencies, including the President of the United States, the Attorney General, and the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense. The case was presided over by Judge John W. Holcomb.\n\nThe underlying facts concern President Donald J. Trump's Proclamation No. 10903, issued on March 14, 2025, which invoked the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), 50 U.S.C. §§ 21 et seq. This Proclamation authorized the immediate apprehension and removal of Venezuelan citizens, aged 14 or older, identified as members of the Tren de Aragua, a designated foreign terrorist organization declared by the President to be conducting \"irregular warfare\" and \"hostile actions\" against the United States. Arevalo, a vocal dissident of the Venezuelan government with a pending asylum application and a work permit, was arrested and detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) without prior notice or a warrant. He alleged his detention was due to his Venezuelan nationality and tattoos, which the government suspected indicated affiliation with Tren de Aragua, and he feared immediate removal without adequate due process. The Government contended Arevalo was detained under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and not yet formally designated for removal under the Proclamation, noting his pending asylum hearing.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted claims under the United States Constitution (including the Due Process Clause) and the California Constitution, arguing the Proclamation was unlawful and that, even if lawful, detainees were entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal. They sought a temporary restraining order (TRO), preliminary and permanent injunctions to prevent removals and transfers, a writ of habeas corpus for Arevalo's release, and class certification.\n\nOn May 19, 2025, Judge Holcomb granted in part Arevalo's ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and motion for class certification. The court certified a class of \"All noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation... and/or its implementation.\" The TRO temporarily enjoined the Government from removing Arevalo or any class member under the AEA or Proclamation No. 10903, pending further court order regarding the amount of notice due prior to removal. This TRO was later extended to June 2, 2025.\n\nFollowing a hearing, on June 2, 2025, Judge Holcomb issued an Amended Order granting in part the application for a preliminary injunction and motion for class certification. The court confirmed Arevalo had standing due to an imminent threat of removal. While the court declined to review the President's invocation of the AEA or define its terms, it found Arevalo likely to succeed on his Due Process claims regarding the right to adequate notice and process before removal. The preliminary injunction restrained the Government from removing or transferring Arevalo or any class member from the Central District of California under the AEA or Proclamation No. 10903, pending further court order on notice and process. The order clarified that it did not prevent removals under the INA or the release of detainees. The court required Arevalo to post a nominal $1 bond. The certified class was refined to exclude noncitizens who had filed individual habeas petitions prior to the commencement of this action. Related cases cited by the court included *Trump v. J.G.G.*, 145 S. Ct. 1003 (2025), and *A.A.R.P. v. Trump*, 2025 WL 1417281 (S. Ct. May 16, 2025).\n\nOn June 14, 2025, Arevalo filed an emergency ex parte application for a writ of habeas corpus, seeking immediate release after an Immigration Judge granted him asylum on June 9, 2025, but he remained in ICE custody. On June 20, 2025, Judge Holcomb denied this application, ruling that the Government was authorized to continue detaining Arevalo under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A) pending its appeal of the asylum grant, as removal proceedings are not concluded until such appeals are decided.\n\nOn August 1, 2025, the Government filed a Notice of Appeal [Appeal Docket No. 25-4866] to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging the June 2, 2025, preliminary injunction order. This appeal remains ongoing.",
    "46635": "On May 22, 2025, Shira Perlmutter, the Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office, represented by private counsel from Democracy Forward Foundation and Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The lawsuit named Todd Blanche, the purported acting Librarian of Congress; Paul Perkins, the purported acting Register of Copyrights; Sergio Gor, Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office; Trent Morse, Deputy Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office; the Executive Office of the President; and Donald J. Trump, the President of the United States, as defendants.\n\nThe factual basis for the case stemmed from President Trump's actions beginning May 8, 2025, when he fired Dr. Carla D. Hayden, the Librarian of Congress. Two days later, he purportedly removed Ms. Perlmutter from her position as Register of Copyrights. Subsequently, the President purported to appoint Todd Blanche as acting Librarian of Congress, who then purported to appoint Paul Perkins as acting Register of Copyrights. Ms. Perlmutter alleged these actions were unlawful, asserting two causes of action: first, that the President's appointment of an acting Librarian of Congress was ultra vires, violating constitutional and statutory authority because the Library of Congress is not an \"Executive agency\" under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (5 U.S.C. § 3345(a)); and second, that her removal violated the U.S. Constitution's Appointments Clause (U.S. Const. Art. II, § 2, cl. 2) and the separation of powers, as Congress vested the Librarian of Congress, not the President, with the exclusive authority to appoint and remove the Register of Copyrights (17 U.S.C. § 701(a)). Ms. Perlmutter sought declaratory judgments confirming her rightful position and the unlawfulness of the appointments, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent her removal and to block the purported acting officials from exercising their claimed powers.\n\nPresiding over the case, Judge Timothy J. Kelly denied Ms. Perlmutter's initial motion for a temporary restraining order on May 28, 2025, finding she had not demonstrated irreparable harm (ECF No. 15). Following this, Ms. Perlmutter filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on June 10, 2025. On July 30, 2025, Judge Kelly denied this motion (ECF No. 39, Order; ECF No. 40, Memorandum Opinion), reiterating that Ms. Perlmutter failed to establish irreparable harm. The court cited *Sampson v. Murray*, 415 U.S. 61 (1974), and appellate court decisions in similar government personnel cases, concluding that the temporary loss of a \"statutory right to function\" or inability to perform statutory duties did not constitute a \"genuinely extraordinary situation\" warranting preliminary injunctive relief. The court also rejected arguments that institutional harms to the Library of Congress or Copyright Office could be invoked by Ms. Perlmutter to show personal irreparable harm. The court considered *Berry v. Reagan*, *Aviel v. Gor*, *LeBlanc v. United States Privacy & Civil Liberties Oversight Board*, *Grundmann v. Trump*, *Wilcox v. Trump*, *Harris v. Bessent*, *Dellinger v. Bessent*, and *Trump v. Boyle* in its analysis of irreparable harm.\n\nMs. Perlmutter filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 31, 2025 (ECF No. 41). She then filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, which Judge Kelly also denied on August 20, 2025 (ECF No. 47, Order; ECF No. 48, Memorandum), consistently ruling that she had not shown irreparable harm. The case is proceeding with a schedule for cross-motions for summary judgment, with defendants' obligation to respond to the complaint stayed until those motions are resolved.",
    "45143": "Ashley Willey and Sean Willey, represented by private counsel and the Child & Parental Rights Campaign, filed this action on April 20, 2023, against Sweetwater County School District No. 1 Board of Trustees, its Superintendent Kelly McGovern, Assistant Superintendent Nicole Bolton, Director of Student Services Kayci Arnoldi, and Black Butte High School Principal Bryant Blake. The parents brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of their fundamental parental rights to direct the upbringing and mental health decision-making for their children under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and their fundamental right to free exercise of religion under the First Amendment. Ashley Willey, also an employee of the school district, further alleged violations of her First Amendment rights to free exercise of religion and free speech, and that the district's actions violated Wyoming Statute § 14-1-101 regarding parental consent for minor mental healthcare. They sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, nominal damages, compensatory damages for emotional distress and family dynamic damage, and attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on the parents' 16-year-old daughter, A.S., a childhood trauma survivor diagnosed with ADHD, PTSD, and symptoms of gender dysphoria, who was receiving private counseling. In 2021, A.S. began identifying as a boy, using a male name \"C\" and male pronouns at Black Butte High School, and requested that school staff conceal this from her parents. The parents alleged that the school district had adopted a \"Policy\" (Preferred Names Policy and Parent Concealment Policy) that required staff to affirm a student's chosen gender identity and conceal this information from parents unless the student consented, even over parental objections. Ashley Willey, a math teacher in the district, inadvertently discovered this concealment in March 2022. The parents informed school administrators, including Principal Blake, Ms. Bolton, Ms. McGovern, and Ms. Arnoldi, of their objections, citing their sincerely held religious beliefs against affirming a discordant gender identity and against lying or deception. They also noted A.S.'s existing private mental health treatment plan. Administrators allegedly confirmed the policy, refused to accommodate Mrs. Willey's religious beliefs, and threatened staff with discipline for non-compliance. The parents contended that \"social transitioning\" constitutes mental health treatment requiring parental consent under Wyoming law. They argued the policy created a rift in their relationship with A.S. and negatively affected her mental health.\n\nThe case proceeded before Judge Scott W. Skavdahl. On June 30, 2023, Judge Skavdahl issued an order granting in part and denying in part the parents' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court enjoined the school district from preventing employees from responding to a minor student's parent's inquiry regarding their requested name or pronoun, or from requiring an employee to lie about such a request, unless there was a reasonable concern of physical abuse or harm. All other aspects of the requested preliminary injunction were denied. A motion to dismiss filed by the school district was subsequently denied without prejudice on July 20, 2023, as moot following the parents' filing of a First Amended Complaint.\n\nOn December 18, 2023, Judge Skavdahl granted in part and denied in part a renewed motion to dismiss. The parents were allowed to proceed with claims for nominal and compensatory damages for violations of their parental rights and free exercise claims, but their requests for declaratory and injunctive relief on these claims were dismissed. Ashley Willey's free speech claim was dismissed, however, her free exercise claim as an employee survived.\n\nA jury trial was initially scheduled for March 24, 2025, and later reset for June 2, 2025. However, on April 28, 2025, Judge Skavdahl granted the school district's motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff Sean Willey was dismissed from the action, and summary judgment was granted in favor of the defendants and against Ashley Willey on all her remaining claims (Counts I, II, and III). All other pending motions, including motions in limine and motions to exclude testimony, were denied as moot.\n\nOn May 23, 2025, the parents filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, indicating their intent to challenge the district court's final judgment. The appeal was docketed as Case No. 25-8027.",
    "PH-IL-0002": "On May 10, 2016, a group of public housing residents, represented by a private law firm and a public interest legal organization, filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs, initially seven and later expanded to 35 individuals in the Third Amended Complaint, were current and former residents of the Alexander County Housing Authority's (ACHA) McBride and Elmwood family housing developments. They sued the Alexander County Housing Authority, an Illinois municipal corporation and public housing agency, along with its former executive directors, James Wilson and Martha Franklin. Former executive directors Thomas Upchurch and Joanne Pink were initially named but later dismissed from the case.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged rampant race and familial status discrimination, claiming that ACHA engaged in a pattern and practice of segregating its public housing developments by race and familial status. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that McBride and Elmwood, occupied almost exclusively by African-American tenants, were allowed to deteriorate into nearly uninhabitable conditions, infested with pests and suffering from severe structural, plumbing, heating, electrical, and security issues. In contrast, developments like Connell Smith, with a higher proportion of white and senior residents, were allegedly adequately maintained. The plaintiffs further asserted that ACHA prohibited families with children from living in certain developments to prevent African-American families from residing in majority-white housing. The factual basis for these claims included a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit in 1974 against ACHA for racial segregation and a September 30, 2014, letter from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) finding ACHA in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act due to intentional racial segregation and inadequate maintenance.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3604, § 3608(e)(5)), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq.), the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003 (740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 23/5), and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for failure to affirmatively further fair housing. Additionally, they alleged state law claims for breach of ACHA's residential lease, negligence, and willful and wanton conduct due to the deplorable housing conditions. They sought declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to end discriminatory practices and remedy the housing conditions, monetary damages (compensatory and punitive), abatement of rent, prejudgment interest, and attorneys' fees, along with class certification for various subclasses.\n\nThe case was presided over by Chief Judge Michael J. Reagan, with Magistrate Judge Reona J. Daly handling pretrial matters after an initial referral to Magistrate Judge Philip M. Frazier. Throughout the proceedings, the plaintiffs filed three amended complaints to refine their claims. The court denied a motion to stay proceedings (2016 WL 3524673) and a request to overrule the defendants' assertion of deliberative process privilege regarding executive session minutes. After multiple settlement conferences, counsel for the majority of the plaintiffs and the defendants indicated a tentative settlement had been reached. On July 27, 2017, 30 of the 35 plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice, with each party agreeing to bear its own attorneys' fees. Five plaintiffs (William Frey, Monica Woodson, Latonya Lee, Coretta Cornelius, and Denieshia Childress) were not part of this settlement. William Frey's claims were dismissed earlier in 2016 and Monica Woodson's claims were dismissed in April 2017. Latonya Lee and Coretta Cornelius's claims were dismissed for failure to prosecute on August 1, 2017, and Denieshia Childress's claims were dismissed for failure to prosecute on September 12, 2017. On September 12, 2017, Chief Judge Reagan formally dismissed the claims of the represented plaintiffs with prejudice, closing the case.",
    "16518": "On April 14, 2022, the United States of America, represented by the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Carolina, filed a complaint against the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ). The complaint alleged a pattern or practice of conduct that violated the federal rights of children confined at DJJ's Broad River Road Complex (BRRC), its long-term juvenile commitment facility, under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 34 U.S.C. § 12601. The United States contended that conditions at BRRC violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, specifically concerning the safety and treatment of youth. The government sought declaratory and injunctive relief to ensure lawful conditions of confinement.\n\nThe lawsuit followed a multi-year investigation by the Department of Justice, which began in 2017. Investigative findings, detailed in notices issued in February 2020 and April 2022, revealed that DJJ failed to keep youth reasonably safe from youth-on-youth violence and from excessive force by staff. The investigation also concluded that DJJ seriously harmed youth by using prolonged, punitive isolation. These issues were exacerbated by inadequate staff training, ineffective behavior management tools, insufficient physical plant safety features (such as surveillance blind spots), and inadequate internal investigations into allegations of abuse. Notably, the Department of Justice referenced a prior federal court injunction from the 1990s, *Bowers ex rel. Alexander S. v Boyd, 876 F. Supp. 773 (D.S.C. 1995)*, which addressed similar constitutional violations at DJJ facilities, highlighting a history of concerns.\n\nOn April 14, 2022, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Conditional Dismissal, indicating they had reached a settlement. On April 20, 2022, U.S. District Judge Mary Geiger Lewis granted the motion, dismissing the action without prejudice while retaining jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement, signed on April 13, 2022, aims to remedy the identified constitutional violations. DJJ committed to a comprehensive plan to improve conditions at BRRC, with all provisions to be implemented within four years. Key terms include:\n*   **Protection from Harm**: DJJ will conduct a staffing study to ensure adequate supervision, identify and add video surveillance to blind spots within the facility, and retain video footage for investigations. It will implement structured rehabilitative programming and establish positive behavior management tools and de-escalation strategies. DJJ will revise its use of force policies to limit force to situations of immediate danger, prohibit its use as punishment, and ensure prompt documentation and medical evaluation after any incident.\n*   **Investigations**: DJJ will revise its investigation policies, ensuring all allegations of youth-on-youth harm, excessive force, or improper isolation receive an initial review. Full investigations, to be completed within ten business days, will include interviews, document review, and video analysis, and will proceed even if a youth withdraws an allegation or no video exists. DJJ will take prompt corrective and disciplinary measures for staff misconduct.\n*   **Isolation**: DJJ will revise its isolation policies, limiting its use to only when a youth poses a serious and immediate danger and after de-escalation efforts have failed. Isolation will not be used for discipline, punishment, or protective custody. Stays will be limited to four hours unless approved by security leadership after daily in-person examinations by qualified mental health professionals and security staff. A multidisciplinary team will review isolation placements, and youth in isolation will receive access to sunlight, working facilities, and meaningful education. Suicidal youth will not be placed in isolation, and DJJ will work with the Department of Mental Health for prompt transfers to appropriate treatment facilities. DJJ will also cease using the Laurel Building for isolation and develop alternative, safe spaces.\n*   **Training**: DJJ will provide annual competency-based training for all staff on non-physical de-escalation, updated use of force policies, and thorough investigation procedures.\n*   **Quality Assurance**: DJJ will develop a quality assurance system within 24 months, including monthly data collection and analysis on incidents, use of force, and isolation, to identify trends and correct deficiencies. A Quality Improvement Committee will review this data and recommend system changes.\n\nThe agreement will terminate in five years if DJJ achieves and maintains substantial compliance with all provisions for one year. A jointly selected Subject Matter Expert, retained by DJJ at a cost not exceeding $225,000 in the first year, will provide technical assistance and submit comprehensive compliance reports every six months, which DJJ will post publicly. Wendy Leach was named as DJJ's Director of Settlement Compliance.",
    "46815": "The case of *United States v. Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia* was initially filed on May 21, 2025, with an indictment charging the defendant, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, with one count of conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and one count of illegal transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v) and (B)(i), and 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) and (B)(i). The defendant is represented by Federal Public Defenders and later by private counsel, while the government is represented by the Acting U.S. Attorney and Deputy Director of Joint Task Force Vulcan.\n\nThe underlying facts involve allegations that Mr. Abrego Garcia participated in a human smuggling operation, which included transporting undocumented individuals from Texas to other parts of the country. The charges partly stem from a traffic stop on November 30, 2022, where Mr. Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with multiple individuals. The government alleged that the offenses involved minor victims, citing a roster from the traffic stop and witness statements claiming Mr. Abrego Garcia transported his own children and other minors. The government also raised concerns about his alleged association with the MS-13 street gang, access to firearms and drugs, and past incidents leading to temporary protective orders from his wife. Mr. Abrego Garcia had previously been unlawfully removed to El Salvador and returned to the United States following intervention by the Supreme Court in *Noem v. Abrego Garcia*, 145 S.Ct. 1017 (2025), and related cases in the District of Maryland and Fourth Circuit. He was arrested upon his return on June 6, 2025.\n\nFollowing his arrest, the government moved for pretrial detention. Magistrate Judge Barbara D. Holmes reminded the government of its *Brady* obligations under the Due Process Protections Act of 2020 and ordered specific discovery. After an initial appearance and detention hearing on June 13, 2025, Judge Holmes denied the government's motion for detention on June 22, 2025, in a Memorandum Opinion (2025 WL 4218003). The court found the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the case involved a minor victim under the Bail Reform Act (18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(1)(E)), a serious risk of flight under § 3142(f)(2)(A), or a serious risk of obstruction of justice under § 3142(f)(2)(B). Judge Holmes further concluded that even if a detention hearing were authorized, conditions of release could reasonably assure Mr. Abrego Garcia's appearance and the safety of the community, considering his lack of prior criminal history and strong family and community ties in Maryland.\n\nThe government appealed the Magistrate Judge's release order to District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr., and moved to stay the release. Judge Crenshaw denied the motion to stay on June 25, 2025 (2025 WL [citation for 6/25/25]), but granted in part the motion for revocation, scheduling an evidentiary hearing for a de novo review. After this hearing on July 16, 2025, Judge Crenshaw, in a Memorandum Opinion on July 23, 2025 (2025 WL [citation for 7/23/25]), denied the government's motion for revocation. The District Judge agreed with the Magistrate Judge that the government could not demonstrate that no conditions would permit release under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g). However, Judge Crenshaw found that the government *was* entitled to a detention hearing because the charged crimes more likely than not involved minor victims, interpreting \"involves\" in § 3142(f)(1)(E) to include the underlying conduct of the charged offenses. Despite this, the court ultimately determined that Mr. Abrego Garcia's history, characteristics, and the weight of the evidence did not warrant detention, particularly given his lack of prior criminal history, strong community ties, and the ability to impose sufficient release conditions.\n\nThe case was remanded to Magistrate Judge Holmes for the issuance of a release order. On August 22, 2025, Judge Holmes granted Mr. Abrego Garcia's motion to modify release conditions and issued an order for his pretrial release (Document 112). The significant terms of his release include prohibiting possession of firearms, ammunition, or dangerous weapons; requiring a third-party custodian to monitor compliance; random drug testing; resuming family, mental health, or anger management counseling; restricting contact with cooperators and N.V.; limiting travel to Maryland and necessary court appearances in Tennessee; and imposing home restrictions and location monitoring. A jury trial is currently scheduled for January 27, 2026. Mr. Abrego Garcia has since filed a motion to dismiss for vindictive and selective prosecution, which is pending before the District Court.",
    "46755": "On July 1, 2025, the City of Columbus, Ohio; the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland; the City of Chicago, Illinois; Doctors for America (a non-profit organization of physicians and medical trainees); and Main Street Alliance (a non-profit network of small businesses) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Represented by the Democracy Forward Foundation, the plaintiffs sued Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), along with HHS itself, Mehmet Oz, in his official capacity as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and CMS.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., alleging that multiple provisions of the \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability\" (2025 Rule), published at 90 Fed. Reg. 27,074, were either contrary to law or arbitrary and capricious. They contended that the 2025 Rule undermined the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) by creating unreasonable barriers to obtaining medical care (42 U.S.C. § 18114), violating the ACA's guaranteed issue (42 U.S.C. § 300gg-1) and guaranteed renewability (42 U.S.C. § 300gg-2) requirements, and unlawfully altering the statutory formulas for premium tax credits (26 U.S.C. § 36B) and advance premium tax credits (42 U.S.C. § 18081, 18082). The plaintiffs argued that the 2025 Rule, despite its stated aim to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse, would cause at least 1.8 million Americans to lose health insurance coverage, increase premiums, and impose greater out-of-pocket costs, thereby burdening cities with uncompensated care costs and harming small businesses and medical providers. The case referenced prior related litigation involving similar challenges to federal health insurance regulations, *City of Columbus v. Trump*, 453 F. Supp. 3d 770 (D. Md. 2020), and *City of Columbus v. Cochran*, 523 F. Supp. 3d 731 (D. Md. 2021). The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment, a stay of the Rule's effective date, and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to vacate the challenged provisions.\n\nOn August 22, 2025, U.S. District Judge Brendan A. Hurson issued a Memorandum Opinion (Civil No. 25-2114-BAH), followed by an Order on August 25, 2025, granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for a stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705. The court stayed the effective dates of seven provisions of the 2025 Rule pending a final ruling on the merits. These provisions included: (1) a $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees; (2) the revocation of guaranteed insurance coverage for individuals with past-due premiums; (3) a stricter failure-to-reconcile tax policy that removed a grace period; (4) new special enrollment period (SEP) eligibility verification requirements; (5) a requirement for Exchanges to verify household income inconsistencies when attested income differs from \"trusted data sources\"; (6) changes to the de minimis ranges for actuarial value calculations; and (7) changes to the policy regarding self-attestation of projected income when tax data is unavailable. The court found that the plaintiffs, particularly Main Street Alliance members and the city governments, had established a strong likelihood of success on the merits for these provisions, were likely to suffer irreparable harm from increased premiums and uncompensated care costs, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored preventing the Rule from taking effect. However, the court declined to stay two other provisions: the change to the measure for calculating the premium adjustment percentage and the elimination of the 60-day extension of time to resolve inconsistencies in household income data.",
    "46576": "On April 10, 2025, sixteen states (New York, Arizona, California, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon), the District of Columbia, and the Governor of Pennsylvania, represented by their respective state and district attorneys general offices, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued the United States Department of Education (ED) and its Secretary, Linda McMahon, in her official capacity, both represented by the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nThe case centered on hundreds of millions of dollars in Education Stabilization Fund (ESF) grants, including the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER), Homeless Children and Youth (HCY), and Emergency Assistance to Nonpublic Schools (EANS) programs. These funds were appropriated by Congress through COVID-19 relief laws, such as the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (CRRSA), to help K-12 students recover from the pandemic's effects. While funds were generally to be obligated by September 30, 2023, or September 30, 2024, with a 120-day liquidation period, ED had previously granted the plaintiff states extensions, mostly through March 2026, even after the federal government declared the COVID-19 pandemic over in May 2023. The states relied on these extensions for various ongoing educational programs, infrastructure projects, and staffing.\n\nOn March 28, 2025, ED abruptly reversed course, rescinding all previously approved liquidation extensions, effective that day, citing that extending deadlines for \"COVID-related grants\" years after the pandemic ended was \"not consistent with the Department’s priorities.\" The plaintiffs alleged this \"Rescission Letter\" was an arbitrary and capricious final agency action and contrary to law under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706, causing immediate and irreparable harm to their education systems. They sought a declaratory judgment, vacatur of the rescission, reinstatement of the extensions, and injunctive relief, including attorneys' fees.\n\nPresiding over the case, Judge Edgardo Ramos initially granted a preliminary injunction on May 6, 2025, preventing ED from enforcing its March 28, 2025 directive and from modifying liquidation periods without 14 days' notice. On May 11, 2025, ED issued a new \"Dear Colleague\" letter, reaffirming the termination of liquidation periods, effective May 25, 2025, and proposing a new individualized extension process. The plaintiffs moved for a second preliminary injunction, and on June 3, 2025, Judge Ramos granted it, preliminarily enjoining ED from enforcing both the March 28 and May 11 letters. The order further directed ED to process all outstanding and future ESF liquidation requests without delay and prohibited modifications to approved periods without 30 days' notice. The court ordered the plaintiffs to post a $1000 security.\n\nED promptly appealed the June 3, 2025 preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Docket No. 25-1424) on June 4, 2025, also seeking an immediate stay of the injunction. ED argued the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1)), citing *Department of Education v. California*, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025), and that its actions were not arbitrary and capricious. On June 10, 2025, a single Circuit Judge denied ED's request for an immediate administrative stay but referred the motion for a stay pending appeal to a three-judge panel. On June 20, 2025, the Circuit panel (Judges Michael H. Park, William J. Nardini, and District Judge Stefan R. Underhill) denied ED's motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction, finding the case more analogous to *Bowen v. Massachusetts*, 487 U.S. 879 (1988), on jurisdictional grounds and concluding ED had not made a strong showing of likely success on the merits or irreparable harm. Judge Park dissented. The Second Circuit's order noted that the appeal itself would proceed for a full merits consideration. However, on August 11, 2025, the appeal was withdrawn by stipulation of the parties.",
    "46637": "This case was filed on May 27, 2025, by National Public Radio, Inc. (NPR), a private nonprofit corporation, along with three of its local member stations: Roaring Fork Public Radio, Inc. d/b/a Aspen Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio, and KUTE Inc. d/b/a KSUT Public Radio. The plaintiffs are represented by private law firms and NPR’s in-house counsel. They sued the President of the United States, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts (later substituted by the Acting Chair), the Office of Management and Budget, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), all in their official capacities. The case has been assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss and is related to *Corporation for Public Broadcasting v. Trump*, Case No. 25-cv-1305, and *United States v. Ross*, No. 25-2261 in the same district.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenge Executive Order 14290, titled \"Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,\" issued by the President on May 1, 2025. The Order asserts that NPR and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) do not present \"fair, accurate, or unbiased\" news and directs the CPB to cease all direct and indirect federal funding to NPR and PBS. It also mandates that local public radio and television stations receiving CPB grants not use those federal funds to acquire NPR or PBS programming, and instructs all federal agencies to terminate any direct or indirect funding to NPR and PBS \"to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.\" The President’s public statements and White House communications accompanying the Order explicitly characterized NPR's content as \"left-wing propaganda\" and cited specific news coverage as examples of bias.\n\nNPR receives a significant portion of its operating revenue from its member stations and direct federal grants, including funds for managing the Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS), which provides national content distribution and emergency alerts. The Local Member Stations rely on CPB grants, using a portion to license NPR programming.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert five causes of action, primarily seeking equitable relief and review under the Administrative Procedure Act: (1) lack of constitutional and statutory authority (ultra vires), alleging the Executive Order exceeds presidential power by violating the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (47 U.S.C. §§ 396, 398), the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act (20 U.S.C. § 954), and various Appropriations Acts, thereby contravening the Constitution's Separation of Powers and Spending Clause (Art. I, § 8, cl. 1); (2) violation of the First Amendment based on retaliation for protected speech; (3) violation of the First Amendment based on viewpoint-based discrimination; (4) violation of the First Amendment based on infringement of freedom of association; and (5) violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause due to deprivation of property interests without notice or opportunity to be heard, and for vagueness.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that Executive Order 14290 and its implementing actions are unlawful and unconstitutional, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent its enforcement, and specific declarations that the National Endowment for the Arts and the CPB may not withhold funding based on the Order.\n\nIn June and July 2025, both the plaintiffs and the federal defendants filed motions for summary judgment. Several organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, along with the State of Colorado and 22 other states, filed amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs. The federal defendants argue that the claims are not ripe for review, asserting that no final agency action has occurred, and that the President's funding decisions are not subject to the First or Fifth Amendments. They contend that the Executive Order's directive to act \"consistent with applicable law\" insulates it from challenge.\n\nThe case remains ongoing, with no final rulings on the summary judgment motions. The National Endowment for the Arts has already terminated a grant to NPR and denied a subsequent application. The CPB, while disputing the President's authority, issued a Request for Proposals in July 2025 to replace NPR as the manager of the PRSS. Additionally, Congress, at the President's request, rescinded CPB's funding for Fiscal Years 2026 and 2027, though this is not argued to moot the case due to other retained funds and ongoing alleged harms.",
    "46340": "On April 3, 2025, six federal employee labor organizations—the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO; American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO; National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United; Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO; National Association of Government Employees, Inc.; and National Federation of Federal Employees, IAM, AFL-CIO—filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Represented by private and union in-house counsel, these unions, representing over a million federal employees, sued the President of the United States, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, and numerous federal departments and agencies (including the Departments of State, Defense, Treasury, Veterans Affairs, Justice, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Interior, Energy, Agriculture, Transportation, and Education, along with the EPA, NSF, USITC, GSA, and SSA), and their respective heads, all in their official capacities.\n\nThe unions challenged Executive Order 14251, \"Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Programs,\" issued by the President on March 27, 2025. This order purported to remove collective bargaining rights under Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code from a wide array of federal agencies and subdivisions, citing national security grounds. The unions alleged that the order was an unconstitutional retaliation for their protected First Amendment speech and petitioning activities opposing the administration’s policies, a viewpoint discrimination, an ultra vires act exceeding the President's statutory authority under 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1), and a violation of their Fifth Amendment rights to procedural due process, protection against abrogation of property rights in federal contracts, and equal protection. The unions sought declaratory and injunctive relief, along with attorney's fees and costs.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, the unions moved for a temporary restraining order, which Judge James Donato converted into a motion for a preliminary injunction. After briefing and oral argument, Judge Donato granted the preliminary injunction on June 24, 2025, finding that the unions had raised serious questions regarding their First Amendment retaliation claim and demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm from the loss of union dues, bargaining power, and representation services. The court ordered the defendants to cease implementing Section 2 of Executive Order 14251 against the plaintiffs and their members, including recognizing unions, terminating collective bargaining agreements, suspending dues deductions, eliminating official time, and refusing to participate in grievance and arbitration procedures. The court required the plaintiffs to post a $60,000 bond.\n\nThe defendants, represented by U.S. Department of Justice attorneys, appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 26, 2025, and on July 1, 2025, filed an emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The district court denied the motion to stay on July 8, 2025. However, on August 1, 2025, the Ninth Circuit granted the defendants' emergency motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The appellate court concluded that the government was likely to succeed on the merits of the retaliation claim, arguing that the President would have issued the order regardless of the unions' speech, based on national security concerns. The court also found that the government would suffer irreparable harm without a stay, noting that the harm to the unions was mitigated by the government's instruction to agencies to refrain from terminating collective bargaining agreements until litigation concluded. The case is currently awaiting further proceedings in the district court, with an expedited trial date to be set, but the preliminary injunction remains stayed by the Ninth Circuit.",
    "46805": "On July 21, 2025, a coalition of numerous nonprofit organizations, including state coalitions against domestic violence and sexual assault, and homeless services providers, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The plaintiffs, represented by private attorneys, cooperating counsel from the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island, Democracy Forward Foundation, Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC, and the National Women’s Law Center, alleged that federal agencies were unlawfully imposing new ideological conditions on grant funding. The defendants include Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); Scott Turner, in his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); and various other federal agencies and officials within HHS and HUD, such as the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA).\n\nThe factual basis for the case stems from a series of executive orders issued by the Trump Administration in early 2025, which aimed to curtail diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEI/DEIA) initiatives, restrict \"gender ideology,\" and limit abortion access. Following these executive orders, HUD and HHS began implementing new conditions on federal grants, requiring recipients to certify compliance with these directives. The plaintiffs, who rely on these federal grants to provide critical services to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, and unhoused individuals and families, contend that these new conditions compel them to fundamentally alter their programming, abandon outreach methods, or face significant liability under the False Claims Act.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted several causes of action, primarily under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706), alleging that the agencies' actions were in excess of statutory authority, contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and contrary to constitutional rights. They also claimed violations of the constitutional separation of powers, the Spending Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1), the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause (U.S. Const. amend. I), and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (U.S. Const. amend. V) due to the vagueness of the conditions. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief (including temporary restraining orders and preliminary and permanent injunctions), and attorneys' fees and costs. The case is being heard by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose, with Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan also assigned. Other related cases cited include *King Cnty. v. Turner, No. 2:25-cv-00814 (W.D. Wash. July 14, 2025)* and *Colorado v. HHS, 2025 WL 1426226*.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). After a hearing on July 24, 2025, Judge DuBose granted the motion, issuing an initial TRO on July 28, 2025. This order was subsequently amended and revised three times, with the \"Third Revised Temporary Restraining Order\" issued on August 20, 2025. This order enjoined HUD and its Secretary, Scott Turner, from requiring or enforcing specific conditions on Continuum of Care (CoC) grants and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) for several named plaintiffs and their members. These enjoined conditions included prohibitions on using grant funds to promote \"gender ideology\" (as defined in E.O. 14168), requirements linking compliance with anti-discrimination laws to False Claims Act liability, prohibitions on using funds to promote elective abortions (as required by E.O. 14182), and the general condition that grant-assisted projects be governed by \"all current Executive Orders.\"\n\nSimilarly, the Third Revised TRO enjoined HHS and its Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., along with ACF and its Acting Assistant Secretary, Andrew Gradison, from requiring or enforcing conditions on Family Violence Prevention Services Act (FVPSA) State Domestic Violence Coalition Grants for other named plaintiffs. These enjoined conditions prohibited recipients from certifying that they would not operate programs advancing or promoting DEI, DEIA, or \"discriminatory equity ideology\" in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws. The court ordered the defendants to immediately treat these conditions as null, void, and rescinded for the affected grants. The Third Revised Temporary Restraining Order remains in effect pending further order from the court, accommodating the briefing schedule for the plaintiffs' pending motion for a preliminary injunction, for which a hearing is scheduled for September 4, 2025.",
    "46375": "On April 9, 2025, the Southern Education Foundation, Inc. (SEF), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing equitable education practices in the southern United States, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. SEF sued the United States Department of Education, its Secretary Linda McMahon, and the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, challenging the termination of its federal grant. SEF, represented by private counsel, operates the Equity Assistance Center for the southern region (EAC-South), a program authorized under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000c-2) to provide technical assistance for public school desegregation. In October 2022, SEF was awarded a five-year, $8.6 million grant to operate EAC-South, which served 130 of the 132 open federal school desegregation cases in the country.\n\nThe factual basis for the case began on January 20-21, 2025, when President Trump issued Executive Orders 14151 and 14173, directing federal agencies to terminate \"radical and wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing\" and \"illegal discrimination.\" These orders did not define key terms like \"DEI\" or \"equity-related.\" On February 13, 2025, the Department of Education abruptly terminated SEF's grant, citing inconsistency with Department priorities to eliminate programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or unlawful discrimination. The termination letter, which was standardized and sent to multiple grantees, did not provide specific factual or legal findings against SEF or define the prohibited terms. The Department also imposed a \"route pay\" condition on the terminated grant, requiring prior approval for fund drawdowns without prior notice or risk assessment. SEF alleged this termination was unlawful, unjustified, and caused irreparable harm by cutting off the sole funding source for EAC-South, threatening its existence, staff employment, and reputation. SEF initially filed an administrative appeal on March 11, 2025, but withdrew it on May 16, 2025. On May 14, 2025, the Department remitted $293,681.78 for expenses incurred prior to termination, but the grant remained terminated.\n\nSEF brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging the Department's action was arbitrary and capricious, failed to comply with notice and comment rulemaking procedures, and violated due process. Additionally, SEF alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (vagueness), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1), the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. §§ 681 et seq.), the U.S. Constitution's Appropriations and Take Care Clauses, and the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. SEF sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, including a temporary restraining order, preliminary, and permanent injunctions to reinstate the grant, enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order and termination letter, and obtain reimbursement for outstanding expenses and attorney fees. The case is related to other federal grant termination cases, including *Am. Ass’n of Colls. for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, 2025 WL 833917 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025)*, and the court considered jurisdictional issues in light of *Department of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025)* and *Widakuswara v. Lake, 2025 WL 1288817 (D.C. Cir. May 3, 2025)*.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman granted SEF's motion for a preliminary injunction. The court's Opinion found SEF was likely to succeed on the merits of its APA claim that the termination was arbitrary and capricious, and that SEF would suffer irreparable harm. The accompanying Order directed the Department of Education and its Secretary to reinstate the EAC-South grant award (S004D220011) to its terms and conditions as they existed prior to the February 13, 2025 termination, provide reimbursement for all outstanding and allowable expenses incurred between the termination date and the order date, and enjoined the defendants from terminating the grant in a manner found likely unlawful under the APA. On July 18, 2025, the defendants filed a Notice of Appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court (USCA Case No. 25-5262).",
    "46284": "On March 24, 2025, a college student who is a lawful permanent resident, Yunseo Chung, filed a lawsuit and petition for writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against federal officials, including the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Acting Director and Field Office Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The student, represented by private attorneys and legal and human rights organizations, alleged the government was attempting to deport her in retaliation for her participation in pro-Palestinian protests and criticism of university disciplinary actions, constituting an unlawful assault on her First and Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nThe factual basis for the case stemmed from the student's involvement in student protests at Columbia University related to Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the university's response. On March 5, 2025, she was arrested during a protest at Barnard College for \"obstruction of governmental administration.\" Days later, federal agents visited her parents' home, and her attorney was informed that the Secretary of State had \"revoked\" her lawful permanent resident status under a \"Foreign Policy Ground\" for deportation. An administrative arrest warrant was issued, and a judicial search warrant was executed at her dormitory. The student claimed these actions were part of a broader Trump Administration policy to use immigration enforcement to suppress speech disfavored by the administration, citing executive orders and public statements by federal officials, and referencing similar actions taken against other noncitizen students.\n\nThe student's legal claims included violations of her First Amendment rights (retaliation, discrimination, prior restraint), Fifth Amendment due process rights (unconstitutionally vague policy, arbitrary and outrageous conduct, denial of fair notice and pre-deprivation process), the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Accardi doctrine, and the Non-Delegation Doctrine. She sought declaratory judgment that the government's policy and actions were unlawful, and injunctive relief to vacate the policy and the Secretary of State's determination as applied to her, and to enjoin the federal officials from detaining, transferring, or deporting her.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald. On March 25, 2025, Judge Buchwald granted the student's motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), enjoining federal officials from detaining or transferring her and requiring 72 hours' advance notice for any detention on grounds other than the Foreign Policy Ground, to prevent pretextual First Amendment retaliation. The bond requirement was waived. A hearing for a preliminary injunction was initially set for May 20, 2025, and later adjourned to May 29, 2025. On April 11, 2025, the federal officials filed a motion to dismiss the case.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, Judge Buchwald granted the student's motion for a Preliminary Injunction, continuing the terms of the TRO by enjoining federal officials from detaining or transferring her from the district's jurisdiction, and requiring 72 hours' notice for any detention on other asserted bases. The federal officials' motion to dismiss was denied in part and granted in part. On July 3, 2025, the federal officials filed a Notice of Interlocutory Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from the preliminary injunction order, asserting that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The appeal record was transmitted on July 7, 2025. On July 17, 2025, Judge Buchwald acknowledged that the appeal divested the District Court of jurisdiction over aspects of the case involved in the appeal, denying further discovery.",
    "46735": "On June 20, 2025, the Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools (the School District), represented by private counsel Himes, Petrarca & Fester, Chtd., filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico against Linda McMahon, in her official capacity as Secretary of Education; the U.S. Department of Education; and Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States.\n\nThe School District's Verified Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief arose from the U.S. Department of Education's (DOE) termination of a $6 million federal mental health grant, part of a $1 billion package authorized by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 (Pub. L. 117–159, 163 Stat. 1313). This Act, passed after the 2022 Uvalde school shooting, aimed to expand school-based behavioral health services for children and families. The School District had utilized the grant to hire seven additional mental health professionals, establish wellness rooms, implement a mental health app, and create family outreach programs, resulting in improved student-to-provider ratios, reductions in bullying and disruptive behavior, and increased student well-being.\n\nIn January 2025, President Trump issued several Executive Orders, including \"Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing\" (Exec. Order No. 14151, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339), \"Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity\" (Exec. Order No. 14173, 90 Fed. Reg. 8633), and \"Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling\" (Exec. Order No. 14190, 90 Fed. Reg. 8853). Following these orders, the DOE issued a \"Dear Colleague Letter\" (DCL) on February 14, 2025, and a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" (FAQ) document, threatening the loss of federal funding for schools engaging in ambiguously defined \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI) programs. The DOE also launched an \"End DEI\" complaint portal. On April 29, 2025, the DOE issued a \"Notice of Non-Continuation of Grant Award\" to the School District, stating that the mental health programs reflected prior administration priorities not shared by the current administration and purportedly violated federal civil rights law or constituted an inappropriate use of federal funds. The School District alleged that this termination, effective December 31, 2025, would cause irreparable harm by dismantling its mental health programs.\n\nThe School District sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctions, arguing that the DOE's actions violated the First Amendment (free speech and association), the Fifth Amendment (due process and void for vagueness), Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 (Spending Clause), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), by being arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with law, and ultra vires. They requested the reinstatement of grant funding, reimbursement for interim expenditures, and attorney's fees under 28 U.S.C. § 2412. An amicus brief in support of the School District was filed by the States of New Mexico, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.\n\nOn July 16, 2025, District Judge William P. Johnson held a hearing on the School District's motion for a preliminary injunction. On July 18, 2025, Judge Johnson issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order denying the motion and dismissing the case without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The judge determined that the School District's claims, which sought the reinstatement and payment of grant money, were contractual in nature, falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims via the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. § 1491). The court cited several recent Supreme Court rulings, including *Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025)*, which held that the APA's waiver of immunity does not extend to orders to enforce contractual obligations to pay money. The judge also found that the School District was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Spending Clause, and APA claims, and that the alleged harm was not irreparable as monetary relief could be pursued in the proper forum. The court noted a split among circuit courts on the jurisdictional issue but sided with those finding Tucker Act jurisdiction for such claims.",
    "46342": "On April 4, 2025, an association of scholars and practitioners and a nonprofit research organization filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Secretary of Education and the U.S. Department of Education. Represented by private counsel from Public Citizen Litigation Group, the plaintiffs alleged that the Department of Education (ED) and its Secretary were unlawfully dismantling the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), an agency established by the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (ESRA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 9501–84, to conduct and disseminate education research and statistics.\n\nThe plaintiffs contended that beginning in February 2025, the defendants took a series of actions to terminate IES's statutorily mandated functions. These actions included mass cancellation of contracts vital for IES's research, data collection, and dissemination activities (such as the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, High School Longitudinal Studies, and Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten), a significant reduction in force (RIF) eliminating approximately 90% of IES staff, and the termination of remote access to restricted-use data and the processing of new data access applications. The plaintiffs, who rely heavily on IES's data and research for their own work, alleged that these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706, by being contrary to law (including ESRA, the Higher Education Opportunity Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1015, 1015a, and the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act, 44 U.S.C. § 3582(a)), arbitrary and capricious, or an unreasonable delay of agency action. They initially also raised constitutional claims regarding separation of powers and ultra vires actions, as well as violations of the Impoundment Control Act and Anti-Deficiency Act. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief to vacate the defendants' actions, and orders compelling the restoration of terminated programs, staff, and data access.\n\nJudge Trevor N. McFadden was assigned to the case, and a related case (National Academy of Education, et al. v. Department of Education, et al., Case No. 1:25-cv-01266) was consolidated for a joint preliminary injunction hearing. On April 17, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. On June 3, 2025, Judge McFadden denied the preliminary injunction, ruling in a Memorandum Opinion (2025 WL 4218003) that the plaintiffs' APA claims constituted an impermissible \"programmatic\" challenge seeking \"wholesale modifications to agency operations writ large,\" rather than discrete agency actions reviewable under the APA, citing *Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n*. The Court also found that the constitutional claims were merely repackaged statutory claims and thus unlikely to succeed on the merits.\n\nFollowing the denial of the preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on June 18, 2025, and a Second Amended Complaint on July 16, 2025. These amended complaints refined their claims, focusing exclusively on specific APA challenges to the termination of individual studies, the peer review program for new grants, and restricted-use data access, as well as the unreasonable delay in disclosure risk reviews. The defendants' initial motion to dismiss was rendered moot by the filing of the Second Amended Complaint. The case continues in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
    "46322": "On March 31, 2025, several plaintiffs initiated legal actions in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which were subsequently consolidated under Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly. The plaintiffs comprised various nonpartisan organizations—including civil rights groups, student associations, and military family organizations—alongside several national Democratic Party-affiliated organizations and two U.S. Congressional leaders. They were represented by private counsel. The defendants included the President of the United States, the Executive Office of the President, the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and its Commissioners and Executive Director, the U.S. Departments of Justice (DOJ), Defense (DoD), Homeland Security (DHS), State, Veterans Affairs (VA), Interior (DOI), and the Small Business Administration (SBA), as well as the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) and the respective heads of these agencies, all sued in their official capacities. A national political party, the Republican National Committee, later intervened as a defendant.\n\nThe consolidated cases challenged Executive Order 14248, \"Preserving And Protecting The Integrity Of American Elections,\" issued by the President on March 25, 2025. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, alleging that specific provisions of the Executive Order constituted ultra vires presidential actions that violated the constitutional separation of powers, particularly the Elections Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 4, cl. 1) and Electors Clause (U.S. Const. art. II, § 1, cl. 2), and federal statutes including the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), 52 U.S.C. § 20501 et seq., the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), 52 U.S.C. § 20901 et seq., the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a. Other related cases challenging the Executive Order were noted in other federal courts.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for preliminary injunctions against five sections of the Executive Order: (1) Section 2(a), which directed the EAC to require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship on the national mail voter registration form (Federal Form); (2) Section 2(b), which directed the DHS and Department of State to open databases for state and local officials and the U.S. DOGE Service to identify \"unqualified voters\"; (3) Section 2(d), which directed federal voter registration agencies (e.g., DoD, VA, DOI, SBA) to \"assess citizenship\" before providing the Federal Form to public assistance enrollees; (4) Section 7(a), which directed the Attorney General to \"enforce\" federal election day statutes (2 U.S.C. § 7 and 3 U.S.C. § 1) against states that count mail-in ballots received after Election Day; and (5) Section 7(b), which directed the EAC to condition federal funding to states on their compliance with an Election Day ballot receipt deadline.\n\nOn April 24, 2025, Judge Kollar-Kotelly issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order, 2025 WL 4218003, granting in part and denying in part the motions for preliminary injunction. The Court granted preliminary injunctions against Sections 2(a) and 2(d) of the Executive Order. For these sections, the Court found that the plaintiffs demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored injunctive relief. The Court reasoned that the President lacked constitutional or statutory authority to unilaterally dictate changes to the Federal Form or to compel federal agencies to assess citizenship before distributing voter registration forms, as these powers are reserved to Congress and the States or delegated to independent, bipartisan commissions with specific procedural requirements. The injunction on Section 2(a) bars the EAC, its Commissioners, and Executive Director from implementing any part of that section, including modifying the Federal Form to require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. The injunction on Section 2(d) bars the DoD, VA, DOI, SBA, and their leaders from implementing any part of that section, including failing to provide the Federal Form to any applicant for service or assistance based on an inability to \"assess citizenship.\"\n\nThe Court denied preliminary injunctions against Sections 2(b), 7(a), and 7(b) of the Executive Order. For Section 2(b), the Court found that the plaintiffs had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits, citing uncertainty regarding the agencies' implementation plans and the potential for compliance with existing Privacy Act routine uses. For Section 7(a), the Court determined that the Attorney General's directive was a matter of prosecutorial discretion and that it was unclear what lawful enforcement actions could be taken \"against States\" by private parties. For Section 7(b), the Court found that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of standing, as the alleged harm from potential state funding cuts or changes to ballot deadlines was too speculative. The Court declined to require the plaintiffs to post an injunction bond. The preliminary injunctions are temporary, pending a full trial on the merits.",
    "46510": "This case, *Washington State Association of Head Start and Early Childhood Assistance and Education Program et al. v. Kennedy, Jr. et al.*, was filed on April 28, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington before Judge Ricardo S. Martinez.\n\nThe plaintiffs consist of four state-level Head Start Associations (representing Head Start providers in Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) and two parent-led non-profit organizations (Family Forward Oregon and Parent Voices Oakland, representing parents and caregivers). They are represented by a coalition of private and public interest attorneys, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Impact Fund. The defendants are the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Administration for Children and Families (Andrew Gradison), the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), and the Acting Director of the Office of Head Start (Tala Hooban), all sued in their official capacities.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the defendants are unlawfully dismantling the Head Start program, a federally funded initiative established by Congress in 1965 to provide comprehensive early education, health, nutrition, and social services to low-income children and families, including those with disabilities, dual language learners, and those experiencing homelessness. The factual basis for the suit stems from a series of actions taken by the defendants starting in January 2025. These include:\n\n1.  **Executive Orders (January 20-21, 2025):** President Trump issued executive orders banning \"diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\" (DEIA), \"gender ideology,\" and services to \"illegal aliens\" across the federal government.\n2.  **OMB Funding Freeze (January 27, 2025):** The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) temporarily froze federal funds for recipients, including Head Start providers, in an effort to implement these executive orders. Although later rescinded following court injunctions in other cases, this caused immediate closures and significant financial uncertainty for numerous Head Start agencies.\n3.  **March 14 DEI Letter:** HHS issued a letter prohibiting the use of federal funding for any training, technical assistance, or program expenditures that \"promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives,\" without defining \"DEI.\"\n4.  **April 16 DEIA Certification:** HHS amended its Grants Policy Statement, requiring agencies receiving new grants to certify they would not \"operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.\" Non-compliance could result in fund claw-backs and civil/criminal liability under the False Claims Act.\n5.  **Mass Office Closures and Layoffs (April 1, 2025):** HHS abruptly closed half of its regional Head Start offices (in 23 states) and laid off approximately 60% of the Office of Head Start (OHS) staff, including crucial \"Program Specialists.\" This severely hampered grant administration, monitoring, and support for agencies.\n6.  **OMB Memorandum (April 10, 2025):** An OMB memorandum stated that the President's budget does not fund Head Start and directed HHS/ACF to prepare to \"close out the program.\"\n7.  **Delayed Funding and Designation Renewals:** Agencies experienced extreme delays in receiving annual grant approvals, accessing allocated funds through the Payment Management System (PMS), and decisions on their designation renewals, leading to payroll issues, staff layoffs, and program suspensions (e.g., one Washington-based agency closed, impacting 400 children and 70 staff).\n8.  **Termination of Research Projects (May 2, 2025):** Defendants reportedly planned to terminate dozens of research projects aimed at improving Head Start operations.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert eleven causes of action, alleging that the defendants' actions violate the constitutional principles of Separation of Powers (Article I, Sections 8 & 9) and the First and Fifth Amendments (Due Process, Void for Vagueness), as well as the Administrative Procedure Act (APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706) by being contrary to law, in excess of statutory authority, arbitrary and capricious, and without observance of required procedure. They also claim violations of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. § 794) and that the actions are ultra vires.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that the dismantling of Head Start, the DEI Letter, and the DEIA Certification are unconstitutional and unlawful. They also request preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to vacate and set aside the defendants' actions, compel the designation and refunding of eligible Head Start agencies, enjoin the implementation of office closures, layoffs, and the DEIA Ban, order the reinstatement of federal employees, and mandate notice to all Head Start grant recipients.\n\nAs of August 5, 2025, oral arguments were held on the plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order. The court subsequently deemed the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order moot due to defendants' stipulation, converting it to a preliminary injunction motion, which remains pending with a hearing scheduled for September 9, 2025. The court also granted the plaintiffs' motion to file a Second Amended Complaint on August 19, 2025. Other federal courts have issued injunctions against similar administrative actions in related cases concerning other federal programs.",
    "46734": "On May 29, 2025, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Seattle, two Roman Catholic Bishops (of Yakima and Spokane), two Auxiliary Bishops, and six Roman Catholic priests (collectively, \"the clergy\") filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Tacoma. The clergy, represented by private law firms and religious liberty organizations, sued the Governor of Washington, the Attorney General of Washington, and 39 County Prosecuting Attorneys, all sued in their official capacities. The lawsuit challenges Washington State Senate Bill 5375, signed into law on May 2, 2025, and set to become effective on July 27, 2025.\n\nThe challenged law modifies Washington Revised Code § 26.44.030 to add \"any member of the clergy\" to the list of mandatory reporters for suspected child abuse or neglect, explicitly removing the statutory priest-penitent privilege for information learned in confession. Under Roman Catholic doctrine, priests are \"absolutely forbidden\" from disclosing information shared during the Sacrament of Confession, with violation resulting in automatic excommunication and risking eternal damnation. The clergy argue that SB 5375 forces them into an impossible choice between their religious obligations and facing criminal prosecution (a gross misdemeanor punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a $5,000 fine) and civil liability.\n\nThe clergy's complaint alleges violations of the First Amendment's Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses, the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and Article I, Section 11 of the Washington Constitution. They argue the law is not neutral or generally applicable because it targets clergy while treating comparable secular activities more favorably; for instance, a concurrently passed law, Substitute House Bill 1171, expanded privileged communication exemptions for attorneys and their staff at higher education institutions, even when related to child abuse. The clergy further contend that SB 5375 infringes on church autonomy by interfering with internal governance and ministerial supervision and commandeers religious practices for state purposes. They sought declaratory judgment that the law is unconstitutional and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent its enforcement, along with attorneys' fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, the clergy filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. On July 14, 2025, a hearing was held before U.S. District Judge David G. Estudillo. Prior to the hearing, on June 23, 2025, the United States of America, represented by the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, moved to intervene in the case, which Judge Estudillo granted on July 15, 2025. The United States also filed its own Motion for Preliminary Injunction on June 25, 2025, but later withdrew it on July 23, 2025, after the court ruled on the clergy's motion. Furthermore, on July 15, 2025, the clergy reached a stipulation with the 39 County Prosecuting Attorneys, agreeing to stay proceedings against them in exchange for their consent to be bound by the court's preliminary injunction and waiver of appeal and fee claims.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, Judge Estudillo granted the clergy's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, finding that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their Free Exercise Clause challenge. The court concluded that SB 5375 impermissibly burdens sincere religious practice by forcing clergy to violate the sacramental seal or face severe penalties. It found the law was neither neutral nor generally applicable, citing the disparate treatment of clergy compared to other professionals who retain privileged communication exemptions under similar circumstances (like attorneys under SHB 1171). The court also determined that the law failed strict scrutiny as it was not narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest. The court noted that the clergy faced irreparable harm due to the loss of First Amendment freedoms and that the balance of equities and public interest favored an injunction. While acknowledging serious questions regarding the Church Autonomy Doctrine and Establishment Clause claims, the court did not reach these issues for its ruling. The injunction prevents the Governor and Attorney General from enforcing SB 5375 as to the Sacrament of Confession against the individual clergy plaintiffs and all Roman Catholic priests in Washington who fall directly under the administration of Archbishop Etienne and Bishops Daly and Tyson, pending a final judgment on the merits.\n\nSeparately, on August 28, 2025, the court issued an order for the plaintiffs in this case to show cause why it should not be consolidated with a related case, *Orthodox Church in America et al v. Ferguson et al*, Case No. 2:25-cv-01537.",
    "46678": "The State of California and its Governor filed a lawsuit on June 9, 2025, against the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and the U.S. Department of Defense. Represented by the Attorney General of California, the plaintiffs alleged that the federal defendants unlawfully federalized and deployed members of the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests. The federal defendants were represented by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe factual basis for the case began on June 6, 2025, when federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted enforcement actions in Los Angeles. These actions led to widespread public protests, some of which involved violence and property damage. On June 7, the President issued a memorandum citing \"numerous incidents of violence and disorder\" and \"credible threats of continued violence\" as reasons to federalize 2,000 California National Guard members under 10 U.S.C. § 12406, asserting that these conditions constituted a \"form of rebellion\" or rendered him unable to execute federal laws with regular forces. The Secretary of Defense subsequently issued orders for federalization, followed by a second order on June 9 for an additional 2,000 National Guard members, and the deployment of 700 active-duty Marines. The Governor of California objected to these actions, contending that local law enforcement was capable of managing the situation, that the federalization was unlawful and unconstitutional, and that it bypassed his authority as Commander-in-Chief of the state's National Guard while exacerbating public tensions.\n\nThe plaintiffs' complaint, filed with Judge Charles R. Breyer in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, asserted three causes of action: ultra vires (that the federal defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority), violation of the Tenth Amendment (infringement on state sovereignty and police powers), and violation of the Administrative Procedure Act against the Department of Defense defendants. They also argued that the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. § 1385) by involving the military in domestic law enforcement. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the federalization orders were invalid and injunctive relief to prohibit the deployment of the federalized National Guard and military forces for domestic law enforcement, demanding the return of control of the California National Guard to the Governor. They also requested costs and attorneys' fees.\n\nOn June 10, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). After a hearing and considering the defendants' opposition, Judge Breyer granted the TRO on June 12, 2025. The district court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the President's actions exceeded his statutory authority under 10 U.S.C. § 12406 (finding no \"rebellion\" or inability to execute laws with regular forces, and a failure to issue orders \"through the governor\") and violated the Tenth Amendment. The court temporarily enjoined the federal defendants from deploying the federalized California National Guard in Los Angeles and directed them to return control of the National Guard to the Governor. This order was stayed until noon on June 13, 2025. The district court's order is reported as 2025 WL 4218003.\n\nThe federal defendants immediately appealed the TRO to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal. On June 19, 2025, the Ninth Circuit granted the federal defendants' motion for a stay of the TRO. The appellate court found that the federal defendants made a strong showing of likely success on the merits of their appeal, concluding that under a highly deferential standard of review, the President likely acted within his authority under 10 U.S.C. § 12406(3) (inability to execute laws with regular forces) and that the procedural requirement of issuing orders \"through the governor\" was likely met by transmittal to the Adjutant General. The Ninth Circuit's order is reported as *Newsom v. Trump*, No. 25-3727 (9th Cir. June 19, 2025).\n\nFollowing the TRO and appeal, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction on June 16, 2025. A bench trial on the preliminary injunction was held before Judge Charles R. Breyer from August 11 to August 13, 2025. The outcome of this trial is not specified in the provided documents.",
    "46287": "On March 25, 2025, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), both labor unions representing faculty and academic professionals, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The unions, represented by private counsel, sued the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S. Attorney General, a Senior Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights and head of the DOJ Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, the United States Department of Education (DOE), the U.S. Secretary of Education, the Acting General Counsel of the DOE, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Secretary of HHS, the Acting General Counsel of HHS, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Acting Director of NIH, the United States General Services Administration (GSA), the Acting Administrator of GSA, and the Commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service.\n\nThe lawsuit stemmed from actions taken by these federal agencies against non-party Columbia University. Following an Executive Order by President Trump on January 29, 2025, directing agencies to combat antisemitism on campuses, the agencies initiated investigations into Columbia for alleged failures to address antisemitism. On March 7, 2025, the federal agencies summarily canceled approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia, citing the university's \"continued inaction\" and stating that the funding \"no longer effectuate[d]... agency priorities\" or was \"for the convenience of the Government.\" Three days later, the NIH confirmed terminating over $250 million, comprising more than 400 grants, for nonalignment with agency priorities for safe research environments. On March 13, 2025, the federal agencies sent a letter to Columbia outlining nine \"preconditions\" for \"formal negotiations\" regarding the university's \"continued financial relationship with the United States government,\" which was valued at over $5 billion. These demands included enforcing disciplinary policies with \"expulsion or multi-year suspension\" for protesters, abolishing the University Judicial Board, banning masks, placing the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies (MESAAS) department under academic receivership, and reforming admissions practices. Columbia subsequently announced its own reforms on March 21, 2025, many of which aligned with, but did not entirely match, the government's demands.\n\nThe labor unions alleged that these federal actions violated their members' First Amendment rights to free speech and academic freedom (including under the unconstitutional conditions doctrine), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) due to procedural and substantive failures, the constitutional separation of powers (as ultra vires executive actions), the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and the Tenth Amendment and Spending Clause. They argued that the agencies failed to follow the specific procedural requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act for terminating federal funding and that the actions were arbitrary and capricious. The unions sought a declaratory judgment, a preliminary and permanent injunction to reinstate the terminated funding to Columbia, halt further interference with funding without proper process, and prevent enforcement of the demands, as well as compensatory and nominal monetary damages for their members.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil. On April 3, 2025, the labor unions filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. The federal agencies opposed, arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the unions and their members lacked Article III and prudential standing, and because the claims were contractual in nature, falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims via the Tucker Act (citing *Dep’t of Educ. v. California*, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025)). They also argued that the decision to withdraw funding was committed to agency discretion and thus unreviewable under the APA. On the merits, the federal agencies contended their actions complied with the APA, did not violate the First Amendment (as they targeted conduct, not speech), and were permissible exercises of Executive Branch authority based on agency priorities.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Judge Vyskocil issued an Opinion & Order denying the labor unions' motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissing the case without prejudice for lack of standing. The Court found that neither the unions nor their members were the direct recipients of the terminated grants and contracts, which belonged to non-party Columbia University. The Court noted that Columbia itself was engaged in negotiations and administrative appeals regarding the funding. It concluded that the unions failed to demonstrate a cognizable injury to themselves or to their members that was fairly traceable to the defendants, citing that Columbia's own actions and planned reforms predated the federal demands and that members' alleged \"chilling effect\" was subjective and speculative. The Court also noted that the agencies terminated funding based on \"agency priorities\" and \"convenience,\" not explicitly under Title VI, which does not directly address religious discrimination.\n\nThe labor unions filed a Notice of Appeal from the Opinion and Order on June 16, 2025.",
    "46580": "On May 7, 2025, sixteen states and the District of Columbia, represented by their respective Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), its Secretary Sean Duffy, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and its Acting Administrator Gloria M. Shepherd. The plaintiffs, who are individual sovereign states and the District of Columbia, were later joined by seven environmental and public interest organizations (Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, Climate Solutions, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, CleanAIRE NC, West End Revitalization Association, and Plug In America), represented by public interest law firms and in-house counsel, whose motion to intervene as party plaintiffs was granted on July 23, 2025.\n\nThe lawsuit arose after President Trump issued Executive Order No. 14,154, \"Unleashing American Energy,\" on January 20, 2025, directing federal agencies to immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), specifically targeting the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. Following this, on January 29, 2025, Secretary Duffy issued DOT Order No. 2100.7, establishing new policy priorities for DOT grantmaking, some of which were unrelated to transportation and included social criteria. On February 6, 2025, the FHWA issued a letter rescinding its existing NEVI Formula Program Guidance and retroactively suspending all previously approved State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans. This action effectively froze approximately $2.74 billion in congressionally appropriated NEVI funds, preventing states from obligating funds for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure projects.\n\nThe IIJA, enacted in 2021, had appropriated $5 billion for the NEVI Formula Program to strategically deploy EV charging infrastructure nationwide, with funds to be distributed to states and the District of Columbia using a mandatory, non-discretionary formula and to remain available until expended. States had developed detailed plans, which the FHWA had approved, and had begun implementing projects, awarding contracts, and committing state resources in reliance on these federal funds. The defendants' actions halted these efforts, causing immediate harms such as project delays and cancellations, loss of private sector partners, increased administrative burdens, and impediments to achieving state-level EV adoption and emissions reduction goals.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by exceeding statutory authority, being arbitrary and capricious, and failing to observe procedures required by law. They also claimed violations of the U.S. Constitution's Separation of Powers Doctrine (Article I, Section 1) and the Take Care Clause (Article II, Section 3), and asserted a common law ultra vires claim, arguing the Executive Branch impermissibly usurped congressional spending power.\n\nPresiding over the case, Judge Tana Lin heard arguments on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. On June 24, 2025, Judge Lin issued an order (2025 WL 4218003) granting in part and denying in part the motion. The preliminary injunction was granted for fourteen states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin), enjoining the defendants from suspending or revoking their previously approved State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans and from withholding or withdrawing NEVI Formula Program funds without adhering to the IIJA's requirements. The court ordered that these states' plans be restored to their legal status prior to February 6, 2025. The injunction was denied for the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont due to insufficient evidence of irreparable harm beyond the complaint's allegations. The injunction was initially stayed for seven days to allow for a potential appeal, but this stay was lifted on July 2, 2025, as no appeal was filed. The preliminary injunction remains in effect pending further orders from the court. The parties subsequently filed motions for summary judgment on August 26, 2025.",
    "46259": "On March 13, 2025, eight students from Columbia University and Barnard College, suing under pseudonyms, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Columbia University, its Trustees and Interim President, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce (the \"Committee\") and its Chairman. The students, represented by private attorneys and non-profit legal organizations like CAIR, alleged that the Committee was unlawfully coercing the University to suppress protected speech and association related to pro-Palestinian activism. An amended complaint on March 19, 2025, added federal officials from the Departments of Justice, Education, Health and Human Services, and the General Services Administration—collectively forming a \"Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism\"—as defendants, alleging their involvement in the coercive campaign.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on alleged \"jawboning\" tactics by the federal entities. The Committee, since early 2024, has demanded student disciplinary records from the University, culminating in a February 13, 2025, letter. The Task Force, established by a presidential executive order, threatened to withhold \"billions in federal funding\" from Columbia, with $400 million in grants already canceled by March 7, 2025, citing the University’s failure to address antisemitism. Plaintiffs allege these actions are intended to punish and suppress pro-Palestinian viewpoints on campus. They claim that the University, under this pressure, has implemented policies such as harsher disciplinary procedures, a mask ban, expanded campus law enforcement with arrest powers, and placed the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies (MESAAS) department under \"academic receivership,\" while also adopting an expansive definition of antisemitism for disciplinary purposes. Prior disclosures of student information to the Committee in an October 31, 2024, report allegedly led to doxing, harassment, and even the detention of one plaintiff by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The students, who have engaged in pro-Palestinian activism, fear further irreparable harm to their reputations, careers, and personal safety.\n\nThe students brought claims under the First Amendment (freedom of speech and association), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, along with a breach of contract claim against the University. They seek a declaratory judgment, permanent injunctions to prevent Congress from compelling student records, to enjoin federal agencies from coercing the University by withholding funds to suppress speech, and to prevent the University from complying with these demands. They also seek monetary damages for records already produced.\n\nJudge Arun Subramanian is presiding over the case. On March 18, 2025, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion to proceed under pseudonyms and provisionally sealed certain exhibits. The students initially sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to halt further disclosures and funding cuts. On March 20, 2025, the Court temporarily enjoined the University from providing records or identifying student information to Congress pending a hearing. However, on April 4, 2025, the Court denied the TRO/PI motion without prejudice, vacating the temporary injunction. The Court noted that the initial complaint and motion papers failed to address standing and irreparable harm from the funding threats and Columbia's policy changes. The Court also found that the Speech or Debate Clause likely barred relief directly against the Congressional defendants for their legislative acts. To allow for renewed motions, the Court granted the students leave to file a second amended complaint by April 18, 2025, and ordered the University to provide 30 days' notice before any future disclosures of student records or identities to Congress. The Court subsequently denied the plaintiffs' request to extend this notice requirement to Columbia’s narrative response to a separate request from the Senate HELP Committee.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, the students filed their Second Amended Complaint. All defendant groups (Congressional, University, and Federal Agency) filed motions to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on May 23, 2025. Amicus curiae briefs were filed by Palestine Legal (May 23, 2025) and Defending Rights & Dissent (July 2, 2025) in support of the plaintiffs. On June 18, 2025, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the federal agency defendants in their individual capacities only, retaining them in their official capacities. Following the denial of the initial TRO/PI, the plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction on June 20, 2025, alongside their opposition briefs to the motions to dismiss. A Stipulation and Protective Order was entered on May 14, 2025, to govern the handling of the pseudonymous plaintiffs' personally identifiable information. Briefing on the motions to dismiss and the renewed preliminary injunction motion is ongoing.",
    "46557": "On May 5, 2025, nineteen states and the District of Columbia, represented by their respective Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), along with HHS itself and several of its sub-agency leaders and sub-agencies (including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Administration for Community Living (ACL), and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)).\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that HHS Secretary Kennedy issued a directive on March 27, 2025 (the \"March 27 Directive\") to dismantle the Department. This directive called for the termination of 10,000 HHS employees, the reorganization of 28 sub-agencies into 15 (including the creation of three new agencies like the \"Administration for a Healthy America\"), and the closure of half of HHS's ten regional offices. This action followed earlier layoffs of probationary employees and was explicitly acknowledged by Secretary Kennedy as a rapid, \"decisive action\" taken to maintain \"political momentum,\" despite foreseeing that up to 20% of the terminations would be \"mistakes\" due to a lack of careful, line-by-line review of job responsibilities.\n\nThe plaintiffs contended that these actions immediately and severely disrupted critical, statutorily mandated public health and human services. Specific allegations included the shuttering of CDC infectious disease laboratories (affecting testing for rare diseases, STIs, and viral hepatitis), the elimination of CDC's Division of Reproductive Health (halting data collection for maternal and infant health programs like PRAMS and support for Maternal Mortality Review Committees), the near-total demolition of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the incapacitation of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) and CDC's Office on Smoking and Health (OSH) (halting compliance checks, premarket reviews, and public education campaigns), significant staff reductions in the Office of Head Start within ACF (disrupting grant administration and technical assistance for early childhood education programs), and the termination of the entire team responsible for annually updating the federal poverty guidelines within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE). These disruptions, plaintiffs argued, left states without essential federal resources, expertise, and data, forcing them to divert their own strained resources or risk significant negative public health and welfare outcomes for their residents.\n\nThe lawsuit asserted five causes of action: violations of the U.S. Constitution's Separation of Powers Doctrine (Article I, Section 1 and Article II, Section 3) and Appropriations Clause (Article I, Section 9, Clause 7), ultra vires conduct by federal officials, and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. § 706) as the actions were \"contrary to law\" and \"arbitrary and capricious.\" The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent the directive's implementation, and vacatur of the directive.\n\nOn May 9, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. After expedited briefing and a hearing on May 20, 2025, District Judge Melissa R. DuBose granted the preliminary injunction on July 1, 2025. The Court ruled that the plaintiff states had standing and that their claims were not barred by the Civil Service Reform Act or the Tucker Act. The Court found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their APA claims, concluding that HHS's actions were both \"arbitrary and capricious\" due to a lack of reasoned explanation and failure to consider crucial impacts, and \"contrary to law\" because they made it functionally impossible for HHS to comply with numerous congressional mandates and effectively disregarded appropriated funds. The Court declined to address the constitutional claims at that stage. The Court also found that the plaintiffs faced irreparable harm and that the balance of equities and public interest weighed heavily in their favor. A nominal bond of $100 was imposed.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, Judge DuBose denied the defendants' motion to vacate the preliminary injunction or, in the alternative, for a stay pending appeal, stating that recent Supreme Court summary orders in other cases would not short-circuit the appellate process for this case given its distinct basis. On August 12, 2025, the Court issued a revised preliminary injunction order, clarifying that HHS and all named defendants were enjoined from implementing the planned reductions in force (RIFs) or sub-agency restructuring announced in the March 27 Directive with respect to: the CTP; OHS and its regional office staff; CDC's National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention (NCHHSTP), Division of Reproductive Health (DRH), NIOSH, OSH, National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), and National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD); and ASPE's Division of Data and Technical Analysis. The injunction prevents further RIFs, issuance of new RIF notices, and placement of additional employees on administrative leave, \"until further order of this Court.\"\n\nThe defendants filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on August 12, 2025 (USCA Case Number 25-1780).",
    "46511": "This case was filed on April 29, 2025, by 24 states and the District of Columbia (referred to as \"the states\") against the Corporation for National and Community Service, operating as AmeriCorps, and its Interim Head, Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi (collectively, \"the federal agency\"). The states were represented by their respective Attorneys General or Governors' offices, while the federal agency was represented by attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe underlying dispute arose from the Trump Administration's efforts, initiated in January 2025 through the \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE), to dismantle federal programs and personnel without Congressional approval. Regarding AmeriCorps, these actions included: on April 15, 2025, placing over 750 members of the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) on administrative leave pending termination; on April 16, 2025, placing 85% of the federal agency’s paid staff on administrative leave (followed by reductions in force); and on April 25, 2025, abruptly terminating over 1,000 AmeriCorps grants, totaling nearly $400 million (approximately 41% of AmeriCorps’ budget), and ordering the immediate cessation of all volunteer activities for roughly 30,000 AmeriCorps and VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) members. The federal agency justified these terminations by stating the awards \"no longer effectuate agency priorities,\" without providing prior notice or opportunity for comment. The states alleged that these actions caused immediate and irreparable harm to essential state-administered service programs in areas like disaster relief, education, public health, environmental stewardship, and veteran support, which rely heavily on AmeriCorps funding and volunteers.\n\nThe states sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the federal agency's actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by being contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and undertaken without required public notice and comment rulemaking. They also claimed violations of the U.S. Constitution's Separation of Powers doctrine, arguing that the Executive Branch unlawfully usurped Congress's power of the purse and failed to faithfully execute laws, and that the actions were ultra vires.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, the states filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. An amicus brief in support of the states' motion was filed by thirty-three bipartisan former governors on May 12, 2025. On June 5, 2025, U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order, granting in part the states' motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court found that the states were likely to succeed on their APA claim that the federal agency failed to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking, as required by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-47, § 401, 138 Stat. 460, 695 (and incorporated by reference for Fiscal Year 2025), before making \"significant changes to program requirements, service delivery or policy.\"\n\nThe June 5, 2025 Order (2025 WL 4218003) enjoined the federal agency from enforcing the April 25, 2025 grant terminations and member removals in the plaintiff states, and from enforcing the April 15, 2025 removal of NCCC members nationwide. It ordered the federal agency to restore the affected AmeriCorps programs, reinstate terminated grants, and return AmeriCorps and VISTA members to service (if willing and able). The order also required the federal agency to comply with the notice-and-comment rulemaking requirement before making any future significant changes in service delivery. The Court denied the request to enjoin the reduction in AmeriCorps staff, citing a lack of standing. A nominal bond of $100 per plaintiff was imposed.\n\nFollowing a Supreme Court decision in *Trump v. CASA, Inc.*, 606 U.S. ----, 2025 WL 1773631 (June 27, 2025), which limited the scope of universal injunctions, the federal agency moved to modify the injunction. With the states' consent, Judge Boardman issued a Modified Preliminary Injunction on July 10, 2025. This modified order clarified that the requirement for notice-and-comment rulemaking applies only to significant changes in service delivery that *harm the plaintiff states*, rather than universally. The preliminary injunction remains in effect until further order of the Court.",
    "46350": "On April 7, 2025, the American Library Association (ALA), a non-profit membership organization, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (AFSCME), a national labor organization, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. They sued Keith Sonderling, the Acting Director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), IMLS itself, President Donald Trump, and other federal officials and agencies, including the U.S. DOGE Service and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from Democracy Forward Foundation and Gair Gallo Eberhard LLP.\n\nThe lawsuit stemmed from President Trump's Executive Order No. 14,238, issued on March 14, 2025, which declared IMLS \"unnecessary\" and directed it to reduce its statutory functions and personnel to the minimum required by law. Following this, on March 20, 2025, Keith Sonderling, who allegedly lacked the statutory qualifications, was appointed Acting Director of IMLS and announced his intent to align the agency with the administration's agenda of \"patriotism.\" By March 31, 2025, IMLS, with assistance from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), placed all 75 IMLS employees on indefinite administrative leave, cut off their access to agency systems, and threatened to terminate all grants. On April 3, 2025, termination notices were sent to most IMLS staff, leaving only 12 employees. On April 4, 2025, Acting Director Sonderling fired all 23 members of the National Museum and Library Services Board. By April 9, 2025, IMLS began canceling grants to state libraries and, specifically, terminated two grants held by ALA. These actions led to immediate harms, such as the Maine State Library announcing layoffs and a temporary closure due to lost IMLS funding.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged violations of the U.S. Constitution's Article I (Separation of Powers, Spending Clause, Appropriations Clause), Article II, Section 3 (Take Care Clause), and the First Amendment, asserting that the defendants' actions constituted an unlawful unilateral dismantling of a congressionally mandated agency and an unconstitutional condition on federal funding. They also claimed violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1) and 706(2)(A)-(C), arguing the actions were arbitrary, capricious, in excess of statutory authority, and unlawfully withheld agency action. Additionally, they brought claims under the Impoundment Control Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act, and an equitable claim of ultra vires conduct. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgments, a preliminary and permanent injunction to halt the dissolution of IMLS, reinstate employees and grants, restore agency operations, and recover costs and attorney's fees.\n\nPresiding over the case, Judge Richard J. Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, initially converted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction into a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 30, 2025. On May 1, 2025, the Court issued a Memorandum Order granting in part the TRO, preserving the status quo as of that date, and later extended it to May 29, 2025. During these proceedings, the defendants argued the Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, citing related appellate decisions such as *Department of Education v. California*, 2025 WL 1008354 (Apr. 4, 2025), and *Widakuswara v. Lake*, 2025 WL 1288817 (D.C. Cir. May 3, 2025), which addressed similar challenges to federal grant terminations and personnel actions, often channeling such claims to the Court of Federal Claims or administrative bodies under the Civil Service Reform Act.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the TRO, citing the D.C. Circuit's reasoning in *Widakuswara*. On June 6, 2025, Judge Leon issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order, denying the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction without prejudice and denying the defendants' motion for reconsideration as moot. The Court also denied as moot the plaintiffs' subsequent motion for a temporary restraining order. The judge noted that the plaintiffs \"may not be able to show that this Court has jurisdiction\" over claims related to grant terminations (which typically fall under the Tucker Act for the Court of Federal Claims) and personnel actions (governed by the Civil Service Reform Act), thus failing to meet the high bar for preliminary injunctive relief. The order directed the parties to file a joint status report proposing next steps, leading to a schedule for dispositive motions, including the defendants' anticipated motion to dismiss.",
    "46746": "On June 27, 2025, two environmental non-profit organizations, Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and Center for Biological Diversity, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The lawsuit named as defendants the Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (federal officials), the Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management (a state official), and Miami-Dade County. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel from Earthjustice, Center for Biological Diversity, and Coffey Burlington, P.L., alleged violations of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq., the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., and applicable provisions of Florida law and Miami-Dade County Code. They sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to halt the unlawful construction and operation of a mass federal detention facility, referred to as \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (TNT Site).\n\nThe factual basis of the case is the rapid construction of a detention facility for up to 5,000 noncitizen detainees at the TNT Site, which is owned by Miami-Dade County and located within or adjacent to the ecologically sensitive Big Cypress National Preserve and Big Cypress Area in South Florida. This area is critical habitat for endangered and threatened species such as the Florida panther and Florida bonneted bat. The plaintiffs asserted that the state and federal officials proceeded with the construction and operation of the facility without conducting required environmental reviews, public notice or comment, or compliance with other federal statutes and state or local land-use laws. They also sought a declaration that the state official's actions were ultra vires and that the county's acquiescence violated local codes. The state official, represented by the Office of the Attorney General of Florida and Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, maintained that the facility was constructed using state funds under emergency powers to assist federal immigration enforcement. Federal officials, represented by the U.S. Department of Justice, acknowledged that the facility operates under 287(g) agreements for federal immigration purposes and that federal funding for a Detention Support Grant Program, for which the state agency is the only eligible applicant, was announced.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams. On June 27, 2025, the environmental organizations filed an Expedited Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Preliminary Injunction. On July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, represented by private counsel, successfully moved to intervene as a plaintiff, citing its long-standing ties to the affected lands and the environmental risks to its food and water supply. The court held a four-day Preliminary Injunction Hearing on August 6, 7, 12, and 13, 2025. During the proceedings, the court granted the environmental organizations' motion for expedited discovery on July 28, 2025.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Judge Williams issued an Order granting in part the environmental organizations' Renewed Motion for TRO. This order prohibited the state and federal officials from installing additional industrial-style lighting, paving, filling, excavating, fencing, or any other site expansion, including new buildings or residential/administrative facilities at the TNT site for 14 days.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, Judge Williams issued an Omnibus Order (2025 WL 1482733) granting in part and denying in part the environmental organizations' Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The Preliminary Injunction prohibits the state and federal officials from (1) installing any additional industrial-style lighting (described as \"Sunbelt\" lighting), paving, filling, excavating, or fencing, or any other site expansion (including additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential or administrative facilities) on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the time the order went into effect. The injunction allows for modifications or repairs to existing facilities solely for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks. Furthermore, the order mandates that, no later than 60 days from the date of the order, and once the population attrition allows for safe implementation, the defendants shall remove temporary fencing, Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the detention facility, and all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed to support the project. The existing housing and detention dormitory facilities may remain and be maintained to prevent deterioration or damage. The plaintiffs were required to post a bond of $100.\n\nBoth the state official and the federal officials subsequently filed Notices of Interlocutory Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (Case No. 25-12873) on August 21 and August 23, 2025, respectively. They also filed motions to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal, which the District Court denied on August 27, 2025. Other related cases referenced in the proceedings include C.M. v. Noem, 25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.) (2025 WL 2400953) and Garcia v. Guthrie, No. 25-cv-23136 (S.D. Fla.).",
    "46388": "This case was initially filed on April 11, 2025, by two faculty associations, the American Association of University Professors—Harvard Faculty Chapter and the American Association of University Professors, along with a labor union representing academic workers, the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. These plaintiffs are represented by private law firms. The lawsuit names numerous federal agencies and their respective high-ranking officials in their official capacities as defendants.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause, the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and the Separation of Powers/Spending Clause (Article I) of the U.S. Constitution. The APA claims are largely based on the alleged failure to follow procedures outlined in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq.). The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to set aside the defendants' actions and enjoin future similar actions, along with attorneys' fees and costs. The case is presided over by Judge Allison D. Burroughs.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on the Trump administration's alleged campaign to control American universities by leveraging federal funding. This campaign began with Executive Orders in January 2025, targeting \"DEI programs\" and antisemitism, leading to the formation of a multi-agency \"Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism.\" Similar federal actions, including funding freezes, were reportedly taken against other universities like Columbia, Cornell, and Northwestern.\n\nRegarding Harvard University, the defendants, comprising various federal agencies (including the Departments of Justice, Education, Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Energy, Defense, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and the National Science Foundation, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration), announced on March 31, 2025, a \"comprehensive review\" of Harvard's federal funding, citing unspecified failures to address antisemitism and \"promoting divisive ideologies.\" On April 3, the defendants sent a letter to Harvard, alleging it \"fundamentally failed\" to protect students and demanding \"immediate\" and sweeping \"reforms\" as preconditions for continued funding. These demands included programmatic changes to \"improve viewpoint diversity and end ideological capture,\" overhauling student discipline, enacting a \"mask ban,\" and \"shuttering\" all \"DEI programs.\" An April 11 letter expanded on these demands, adding requirements such as a \"comprehensive audit\" of hiring and admissions for \"viewpoint diversity,\" reporting foreign students for conduct violations, and sanctioning faculty.\n\nOn April 14, Harvard rejected these demands, asserting violations of its First Amendment and statutory rights. Hours later, the defendants announced a freeze of over $2 billion in federal funding to Harvard. Subsequently, on May 5, the Secretary of Education declared that Harvard would receive no future federal grants due to its alleged \"systemic pattern of violating federal law\" and its refusal to implement the administration's \"common-sense reforms.\" Between May 6 and May 12, various federal agencies issued letters terminating approximately $2.7 billion in grants to Harvard, citing general allegations of antisemitism and race discrimination and Harvard's non-compliance with the earlier demands. The defendants also cited 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) (agency priorities) as a basis for some terminations.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that these actions have caused severe and irreparable harm to their members—faculty, graduate students, and researchers—by halting academic research, delaying experiments, jeopardizing careers, forcing layoffs, and disrupting academic progress. This includes research in critical areas such as public health, national defense, and scientific advancement. The plaintiffs also assert that the defendants' actions have created a pervasive climate of fear and self-censorship on campus, leading some members to modify their research and teaching. They highlight that Harvard has already made some concessions, such as centralizing student discipline and closing its DEI office, demonstrating the coercive impact of the defendants' actions. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants failed to follow Title VI's mandatory procedural requirements (such as notice, hearing, and specific findings) and that their actions were arbitrary, capricious, unconstitutional coercion, viewpoint discrimination, and retaliation.\n\nIn the course of proceedings, the court granted motions to seal certain affidavits and for leave to file excess pages. Plaintiffs' initial emergency motion for a temporary restraining order was withdrawn. Plaintiffs were granted leave to file a Second Amended Complaint on May 20, 2025. Both Plaintiffs and Defendants filed motions for summary judgment, with oral arguments scheduled for July 21, 2025. The case is associated with other related matters, including *President and Fellows of Harvard College v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al.* (1:25-cv-11048-ADB) and *President & Fellows of Harvard College v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security* (1:25-cv-11472).",
    "46625": "On May 21, 2025, a group of non-profit organizations, including the Vera Institute of Justice, Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Affirmative Action (d/b/a Stop AAPI Hate), FORCE Detroit, and Health Resources in Action, filed a class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, represented by private and non-profit legal organizations, sued the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), U.S. Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi, the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), and Maureen A. Henneberg (Acting Head of OJP), all in their official capacities.\n\nThe lawsuit challenged OJP's abrupt, \"en masse\" termination in April 2025 of over 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants, totaling more than $820 million, without prior notice. OJP informed grantees via identical form emails that their awards \"no longer effectuate[] the program goals or agency priorities\" due to a change in DOJ priorities to focus on supporting law enforcement operations, combating violent crime, protecting children, and assisting victims of trafficking and sexual assault. The plaintiff organizations, however, asserted that their terminated grants directly supported these very purposes, covering initiatives such as violence reduction, victims' services (including sign language interpretation for Deaf victims), juvenile justice, anti-AAPI hate crime support, and hospital-based violence intervention programs. The terminations allegedly caused immediate and irreparable harm, including cessation of vital community services, staff layoffs, and reputational damage.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (alleging deprivation of property interest without notice and void for vagueness), an equitable ultra vires claim, and claims alleging violations of the constitutional separation of powers, the Spending and Appropriations Clauses, and the Take Care Clause. They also alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), specifically that OJP's actions were contrary to law (2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4)) and arbitrary and capricious (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). They sought declaratory judgments, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to reinstate funding and prevent future similar terminations, and an order directing fund disbursement, along with costs and attorney fees.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Amit P. Mehta. Plaintiffs filed motions for preliminary injunction and class certification, while defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction (under the Tucker Act, citing *Department of Education v. California*, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025)), and failure to state claims on the merits. Amicus curiae briefs were filed by various state attorneys general and community-based public safety subgrantees in support of the plaintiffs.\n\nIn a Memorandum Opinion issued on July 7, 2025 (2025 WL 4218003), Judge Mehta acknowledged that OJP's terminations were \"unquestionably arbitrary, at least in lay terms,\" \"shameful,\" and \"unfair and indiscriminate,\" noting that defendants' counsel could not explain the specific reasons for the terminations. However, the court denied the preliminary injunction and granted the motion to dismiss, finding that it lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' APA claims, deeming them \"essentially contractual in nature\" and thus belonging in the Court of Federal Claims. The court also dismissed the constitutional and ultra vires claims for failure to state a plausible claim. The motion for class certification was denied as moot.\n\nFollowing this, plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court (USCA Case #25-5248) and an Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal in the district court. On July 21, 2025, Judge Mehta issued an Order (2025 WL 4403063) granting in part the emergency motion. While denying a broad affirmative injunction, the court issued a narrower injunction, prohibiting the defendants from re-obligating or otherwise diminishing the specific grant funds that were awarded to the five named plaintiffs. This limited injunction is set to remain in effect until October 1, 2025, without a bond requirement.",
    "46274": "On March 8, 2025, a nonprofit financial institution, Climate United Fund, initiated a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Citibank, N.A., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. Subsequently, additional nonprofit financial institutions (Coalition for Green Capital, Power Forward Communities, Inc., Justice Climate Fund) and state green banks (California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank, Efficiency Maine Trust, Illinois Finance Authority, Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority) filed similar individual lawsuits, which were later consolidated into this action before Judge Tanya S. Chutkan. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel and state attorneys general, while the federal defendants are represented by attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice, and Citibank by private counsel.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that Congress, through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (42 U.S.C. § 7434), established the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) and appropriated $27 billion for competitive grants to invest in clean energy. In April 2024, the EPA awarded billions in grants to the plaintiffs, with funds held at Citibank under Financial Agency Agreements (FAA) with the U.S. Treasury Department and Account Control Agreements (ACA) with EPA and each grantee. These agreements specified conditions for the EPA to exercise exclusive control over the funds.\n\nBeginning in mid-February 2025, following the new EPA Administrator's public statements expressing hostility towards the GGRF program, Citibank allegedly ceased disbursing funds to the plaintiffs, citing directives from the EPA and Treasury. The plaintiffs contended that the EPA, through various actions including FBI \"recommendations\" and Treasury directives, unlawfully orchestrated this freeze without legal justification or due process. On March 11, 2025, the EPA issued \"Notices of Termination\" to the primary grantees, citing concerns about program integrity, misalignment with agency priorities, and alleged deficiencies in oversight and account controls, effective immediately.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of contract, replevin, and conversion against Citibank. Against the EPA and Administrator Zeldin, they alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)), the Appropriations Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 9, Clause 7), and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. They sought declaratory judgments that Citibank breached the ACAs, that the EPA's actions violated federal law, and that the termination was null and void. They also sought injunctive relief to compel Citibank to disburse funds, enjoin the EPA from impeding Citibank, and prevent the EPA from unlawfully suspending or terminating the grants.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, the court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) (2025 WL 842360), which was extended multiple times, enjoining the EPA from giving effect to the termination letters or implementing the termination (including transferring, re-obligating, or re-allocating funds, or issuing a Notice of Exclusive Control). The TRO also enjoined Citibank from transferring funds to any party other than the accountholders but did not compel Citibank to disburse funds. The court also denied a motion to intervene by Tarek Farag.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs' consolidated motion for a preliminary injunction. This order enjoined the EPA defendants from effectuating the March 11, 2025, Notices of Termination, from unlawfully suspending or terminating grants (including by issuing a Notice of Exclusive Control or limiting access to funds except as permitted by the ACAs, grant awards, and applicable law), and from directly or indirectly impeding Citibank. The order also enjoined Citibank from transferring funds except as permitted and, significantly, ordered Citibank to disburse funds properly incurred before the mid-February suspension. The court waived the bond requirement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) and denied the federal defendants' contingent emergency motion for a stay pending appeal without prejudice. This preliminary injunction remains in effect pending further orders from the District Court. On April 16, 2025, both the federal defendants (USCA Case #25-5122) and Citibank (USCA Case #25-5123) filed notices of appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court.",
    "46110": "On February 12, 2025, five federal employee unions—the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)—filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The unions, represented by private counsel, brought the action as individual plaintiffs against the President of the United States and various federal agency heads (including the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), among others). The defendants were represented by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe lawsuit challenged three executive actions initiated by the Trump Administration, alleging these actions collectively aimed to dismantle the federal government workforce. First, OPM directed federal agencies to identify and determine whether to retain probationary employees, leading to mass firings of an estimated 220,000 such employees across various agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Second, OPM implemented a \"deferred resignation program\" in January 2025, inviting federal employees to resign by September 30, 2025, while retaining pay and benefits; approximately 75,000 employees opted into this program before it closed on February 12, 2025. Third, on February 11, 2025, the President issued Executive Order No. 14210, titled \"Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Workforce Optimization Initiative,\" which directed agencies to prepare for large-scale reductions-in-force (RIFs), prioritizing employees in non-mandated functions, diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and those deemed nonessential during government shutdowns (an estimated 345,000 employees). Firings under this Executive Order also began in February 2025.\n\nThe unions asserted two causes of action: first, that the mass firings and forced resignations violated separation of powers principles by undermining Congress's authority to create, fund, and assign missions to federal agencies (based on the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 1); and second, that agency defendants were violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by implementing RIFs contrary to statutory and regulatory requirements (citing 5 U.S.C. § 3502 and 5 C.F.R. Part 351). The unions sought declaratory judgment that these actions were unlawful, injunctive relief to halt the implementation of Section 3(c) of Executive Order No. 14210, OPM's directive to terminate probationary employees, any extension of the deferred resignation program, and all violations of RIF statutes and regulations, plus attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman and then randomly reassigned to Judge Christopher R. Cooper. On February 14, 2025, the unions filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction. On February 20, 2025, Judge Cooper denied this motion, ruling that the court likely lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the claims fell within the exclusive administrative and judicial review scheme established by Congress in the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS).\n\nFollowing this ruling, the unions filed an Amended Complaint on February 17, 2025, and a Second Amended Complaint on June 6, 2025, which updated the factual basis to reflect ongoing terminations and added new defendants. On May 15, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. However, on May 27, 2025, the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) voluntarily dismissed itself as a plaintiff. Subsequently, on June 6, 2025, Judge Cooper granted the unions' motion to amend their complaint, striking the defendants' May 15th motion to dismiss, and ordered the defendants to respond to the Second Amended Complaint by June 27, 2025. The defendants filed a new motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on July 11, 2025. As of the last available docket entry, this motion is pending.",
    "46098": "On February 11, 2025, a group of nonprofit organizations and businesses, including the Global Health Council, Small Business Association for International Companies, HIAS, Management Sciences for Health, Inc., Chemonics International, Inc., DAI Global, LLC, Democracy International, Inc., and the American Bar Association, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. These plaintiffs, represented by private law firms and public interest groups, sued President Donald J. Trump (in his official capacity), the Secretary of State, the Acting Director of Foreign Assistance, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and OMB. The case was consolidated with *AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. U.S. Department of State*, Civil Action No. 25-cv-00400, and assigned to Judge Amir H. Ali.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged Executive Order 14,169, issued on January 20, 2025, which announced a \"pause\" on all U.S. foreign assistance funding, claiming it was \"antithetical to American values\" and not aligned with the President's foreign policy. This Executive Order led to directives from the State Department, USAID, and OMB, halting funding, issuing stop-work orders, recalling thousands of USAID employees, and initiating mass terminations of foreign assistance awards. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. §§ 682 et seq.), the Anti-Deficiency Act Amendments of 1982 (31 U.S.C. §§ 1301(a), 1512(c)(1)), the 2024 Appropriations Act (Pub. L. No. 118-47), the constitutional separation of powers (U.S. Const. art. I, §§ 8 & 9, and art. II, § 3), ultra vires actions, and procedural due process (Fifth Amendment). They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including vacatur of the challenged directives and orders, and mandamus relief, to compel the defendants to release and obligate appropriated funds.\n\nOn February 13, 2025, the District Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), granting in part the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary relief. The TRO enjoined the defendants (excluding the President) from enforcing certain sections of the Secretary of State's January 24, 2025, memorandum and other directives implementing Executive Order 14,169 by suspending, pausing, or preventing the obligation or disbursement of appropriated foreign assistance funds for awards existing as of January 19, 2025, or by issuing, implementing, or enforcing terminations, suspensions, or stop-work orders for such awards. The court explicitly allowed actions to enforce the terms of particular contracts. Following multiple motions to enforce the TRO due to alleged non-compliance, the District Court reiterated its order, including requiring the disbursement of funds for work completed prior to February 13, 2025.\n\nOn March 10, 2025, the District Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction (2025 WL 752378). The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their APA claims that the initial directives implementing a blanket suspension of foreign aid (between January 20 and February 13, 2025) were arbitrary and capricious, particularly due to the failure to consider substantial reliance interests. However, the court found the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on APA claims challenging subsequent large-scale terminations of awards that occurred after the TRO, deeming these distinct agency actions not adequately challenged in the current litigation. The court also found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their constitutional claims that the defendants' wholesale withholding of congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds violated the separation of powers, as the Executive lacked unilateral authority to impound funds for policy reasons without following statutory procedures. The injunction (60) enjoined defendants from giving effect to terminations, suspensions, or stop-work orders issued between January 20 and February 13, 2025, and from withholding payments for work completed prior to February 13, 2025. It also enjoined defendants from unlawfully impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and ordered them to make available for obligation the full amount of funds appropriated in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024. The court set a benchmark for payment processing and required weekly status reports on compliance.\n\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (Case #25-5097). On August 13, 2025, the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion (2025 WL 2129854) vacating the part of the District Court's preliminary injunction involving impoundment. The Circuit Court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to bring their freestanding constitutional claim or an APA claim to enforce the Impoundment Control Act, finding that the ICA's detailed scheme for interbranch dialogue and enforcement by the Comptroller General implicitly precluded private enforcement. The D.C. Circuit reasoned that the plaintiffs' claims, although framed as constitutional, were fundamentally statutory violations that could not be transformed into a constitutional cause of action. The court remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.",
    "PC-VA-0022": "The case of Eric J. DePaola v. Virginia Department of Corrections, et al., Case No. 7:14CV00692, was filed on December 19, 2014, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Initially filed by multiple plaintiffs seeking class action certification, the motion for class certification was denied, and the case proceeded with Eric J. DePaola as an individual, pro se plaintiff. The defendants included the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC), its Director, its Chief of Operations, various VDOC officials, and numerous supervisory and treatment officials at Red Onion State Prison (ROSP).\n\nThe inmate, Eric J. DePaola, was sentenced in 2004 to 38 years for malicious wounding, use of a firearm, statutory burglary, and abduction. After being transferred to Red Onion State Prison (ROSP) in 2007, he was placed in administrative segregation (solitary confinement) in 2009 following a stabbing incident involving a prison guard. The inmate challenged VDOC Operating Procedure 830.A (OP 830.A), the \"Segregation Reduction Step-Down Program,\" alleging violations of his Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses and the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. He sought monetary damages and injunctive relief to abolish OP 830.A and alleviate harsh conditions at ROSP.\n\nThe inmate contended that OP 830.A discriminated against \"Intensive Management\" (IM) inmates, who, unlike \"Special Management\" (SM) inmates, were permanently barred from progressing out of solitary confinement regardless of their behavior. He alleged his assignment to IM status was arbitrary and lacked due process, with reviews being meaningless and susceptible to false reporting by officers. He also complained of severe and unconstitutional conditions in solitary confinement, including small, unsanitary cells, constant bright lights, and inadequate meals, which he claimed caused mental illness, anxiety, sleep loss, physical deterioration, and vision problems.\n\nThe case was presided over by Judge James P. Jones. Key filings included motions to certify class, to appoint counsel, to dismiss, for a protective order, to amend the complaint, and for summary judgment. The motions to certify class and appoint counsel were denied. The motion for a protective order was granted. The motion to amend the complaint was granted, and the motion to dismiss was denied. The VDOC was dismissed as a defendant due to being an improper party under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nThe district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on September 27, 2016, finding that the inmate's confinement conditions, while restrictive, did not constitute an \"atypical and significant hardship\" because he could theoretically progress within the IM privilege levels. The court concluded there was no Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process or Equal Protection violation, and no Eighth Amendment violation. The district court's opinion is cited as DePaola v. Va. Dep’t of Corrs., No. 7:14-cv-00692 (W.D. Va. Sept. 28, 2016), ECF No. 76. The judgment was subsequently affirmed by an unpublished per curiam opinion in the Fourth Circuit on November 22, 2017.",
    "46387": "On April 11, 2025, the law firm Susman Godfrey LLP, represented by private counsel, filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Executive Office of the President, the United States of America, numerous federal agencies (including the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Management and Budget, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission), and their respective officials in their official capacities. The case was assigned to Judge Loren L. AliKhan.\n\nThe lawsuit challenged Executive Order 14,263, titled \"Addressing Risks from Susman Godfrey,\" which President Donald J. Trump issued on April 9, 2025. This Executive Order was part of a series of similar orders targeting other law firms, some of which resulted in settlements where firms agreed to provide pro bono services to Administration-approved causes to avoid sanctions.\n\nThe Executive Order accused Susman Godfrey of \"spearhead[ing] efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections\"—a reference to the firm's representation of Dominion Voting Systems and state election officials in litigation concerning the 2020 presidential election. It also alleged the firm \"fund[ed] groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military\" (in reference to a donation to GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders) and \"engage[d] in unlawful discrimination, including . . . on the basis of race\" (referring to the Susman Godfrey Prize and general diversity initiatives).\n\nThe Executive Order mandated several punitive actions:\n*   Section 2 directed federal agencies to immediately suspend active security clearances held by Susman employees and review them, and to cease providing government goods, property, and services benefiting the firm.\n*   Section 3 required government contractors to disclose any business with Susman and directed agencies to terminate contracts where Susman was hired for services.\n*   Section 4 referenced a prior Executive Order, signaling investigations into law firms' diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.\n*   Section 5 directed agencies to limit Susman employees' access to federal buildings and engagement with federal employees, and to refrain from hiring Susman employees without a specific waiver.\n\nSusman Godfrey alleged that the Executive Order violated the First Amendment (retaliation for protected expression, viewpoint discrimination, infringement on the right to petition, free association, and unconstitutional conditions on government contracts). It also claimed violations of the Fifth Amendment (procedural due process, void for vagueness, right to counsel, and equal protection), and the Constitution's separation of powers (ultra vires presidential action). The firm sought a declaratory judgment that the Executive Order was unconstitutional and injunctive relief to halt its implementation.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, Susman Godfrey filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). Judge AliKhan granted the TRO on April 15, 2025 (2025 WL 1113408), enjoining Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the Executive Order, and extended it on April 16, 2025, pending final judgment.\n\nFollowing cross-motions for summary judgment and to dismiss, on June 27, 2025, Judge AliKhan denied the federal government's motion to dismiss and granted Susman Godfrey's motion for summary judgment. The court ruled that Executive Order 14,263 was unconstitutional, null, and void, based on violations of the First and Fifth Amendments (specifically Counts I, II, III, IV, VI, VII, VIII, and IX of the Amended Complaint). A permanent injunction was issued, prohibiting the federal government, its agencies, and officials from implementing, enforcing, or relying on any part of the Executive Order, and directing them to rescind all related guidance, reverse any suspensions or revocations, and operate as if the order had never been issued. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the order.\n\nOn August 22, 2025, the federal government filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court (USCA Case Number 25-5310).",
    "46245": "On March 18, 2025, the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), an independent nonprofit corporation established by Congress, along with five of its presidentially-appointed Board members, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, initially represented by private counsel from Picard Kentz & Rowe LLP and Zuckerman Spaeder LLP, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against Kenneth Jackson (purported acting president of USIP), the U.S. DOGE Service (a newly created entity within the Executive Office of the President), its Temporary Organization, several DOGE employees, and various high-ranking federal officials including the U.S. Secretaries of State and Defense, the President of the National Defense University (who also serve as ex officio USIP Board members), and the President of the United States.\n\nThe factual basis for the case originated on February 19, 2025, when the President issued Executive Order 14217, declaring USIP \"unnecessary\" and directing the reduction of its statutory functions and personnel to a minimum. Following this, on March 14, 2025, the White House Presidential Personnel Office e-mailed USIP's appointed Board members, including the plaintiffs, informing them of their immediate termination, without adhering to the specific removal procedures outlined in the United States Institute of Peace Act, 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f). The remaining three ex officio Board members then purportedly removed USIP President Ambassador George Moose and appointed Kenneth Jackson as acting president. On March 17, 2025, representatives from DOGE, backed by FBI agents and D.C. Metropolitan Police, forcibly took over USIP's headquarters building, which USIP owned and had administrative jurisdiction over. Subsequently, the new purported USIP leadership terminated nearly all of USIP's over 400 employees, replaced Kenneth Jackson with Nate Cavanaugh as acting president, and initiated the transfer of USIP's headquarters building (valued at $500 million and largely funded by private donations) and its $25 million Endowment to the General Services Administration (GSA).\n\nThe plaintiffs, including additional Board member Nancy Zirkin and Ambassador George Moose in individual and official capacities in an amended complaint, alleged that the President's actions violated the separation of powers doctrine, were *ultra vires*, and specifically violated the USIP Act (22 U.S.C. §§ 4605, 4606). They also claimed trespass to real and personal property. They sought declaratory judgments stating that the purported removals and appointments were unlawful, null, and void, and injunctive relief prohibiting further trespass, restoring the lawful Board and President, and enjoining defendants from exercising unauthorized control over USIP's resources. The case, presided over by Judge Beryl A. Howell, involved a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which was denied on March 19, 2025, and a motion under the All Writs Act to suspend property transfer, which was denied on April 1, 2025.\n\nOn May 19, 2025, Judge Howell granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment (2025 WL 1428641). The court ruled that USIP, while a governmental entity for constitutional purposes, does not exercise executive power and is not part of the Executive Branch. Therefore, the President's removal of the appointed Board members violated the USIP Act's removal protections (22 U.S.C. § 4605(f)), which were held to be constitutional. The court declared the purported removal of the appointed Board members and Ambassador Moose, and the subsequent appointments of Kenneth Jackson and Nate Cavanaugh as presidents, as unlawful, null, and void. All actions taken by Jackson or Cavanaugh as purported presidents, including the transfer of USIP's headquarters and financial assets to GSA, were also declared invalid. The court issued a permanent injunction, ordering the plaintiff Board members and Ambassador Moose to continue serving in their respective roles and enjoining defendants (except ex officio Board members to the extent of their lawful positions) from further trespass, and from maintaining unauthorized access or control over USIP's property and resources.\n\nThe defendants appealed this decision to the D.C. Circuit (Case #25-5185) and filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal and an administrative stay. On June 27, 2025, a motions panel of the D.C. Circuit granted the defendants' motion for a stay pending appeal, finding that the government was likely to succeed on the merits because USIP exercises \"substantial executive power,\" which would make the Board's removal protections unconstitutional under Article II, citing *Seila Law LLC v. CFPB*, 140 S. Ct. 2183 (2020), and *Trump v. Wilcox*, 145 S. Ct. 1415 (2025) (a related case concerning other agencies). The panel also found irreparable harm to the President's executive powers and that a stay was in the public interest. On June 29, 2025, the plaintiffs-appellees filed a petition for rehearing en banc and an emergency administrative stay of the June 27 order. The D.C. Circuit denied the motion for en banc reconsideration on July 24, 2025. Related cases involving similar challenges to presidential removals are pending in the D.C. Circuit.",
    "46142": "On February 19, 2025, the National Urban League (NUL), the National Fair Housing Alliance, and the AIDS Foundation of Chicago (AFC) filed a civil rights action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The lawsuit was assigned to Judge Timothy J. Kelly following a transfer from Judge Loren L. AliKhan. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and non-profit legal organizations including the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc. and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., are non-profit organizations that rely heavily on federal grants and contracts to pursue their missions of advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA), and promoting the rights of people of color, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals. The National Fair Housing Alliance later voluntarily dismissed its claims on June 27, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs sued the President of the United States and numerous federal departments and agencies, along with their respective heads or acting directors, in their official capacities. These defendants included the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), U.S. Departments of Labor (DOL), Health and Human Services (HHS), Commerce (DOC), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Agriculture (USDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Administration for Community Living (ACL), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nThe lawsuit challenges three Executive Orders issued by President Donald J. Trump on January 20-21, 2025: Executive Order No. 14151 (\"Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs and Preferencing\"), Executive Order No. 14168 (\"Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government\"), and Executive Order No. 14173 (\"Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity\"). These orders aim to eliminate DEIA programs and what the Administration terms \"gender ideology\" from the federal government and private entities receiving federal funds. The orders direct agencies, among other things, to terminate \"equity-related\" grants and contracts, end federal funding of \"gender ideology,\" and require contractors and grantees to certify that they do not operate DEI programs violating federal anti-discrimination laws, with compliance deemed material under the False Claims Act. The orders also contemplate identifying and investigating private entities involved in such programs.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that these Executive Orders and related agency actions violate their First Amendment rights (viewpoint and content discrimination, chilling of speech) and Fifth Amendment rights (Due Process Clause, including void-for-vagueness, and Equal Protection Clause, alleging discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and transgender status). They also claim the orders constitute ultra vires presidential action, exceeding the President's authority by usurping Congress's power over federal spending (Article I, Sections 7 and 9) and contravening existing federal statutes designed to support equity and address discrimination.\n\nAs remedies, plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the Executive Orders and their implementing actions are unlawful, unconstitutional, and invalid. They also request a permanent injunction to prevent defendants from enforcing these orders against them, including mandates to rescind agency directives, rectify affected contracts and grants, and provide notice to affected parties, along with an award of costs and attorney's fees.\n\nPlaintiffs cited several related cases involving similar challenges to these or previous administration policies, including *National Council of Nonprofits v. OMB* (2025 WL 314433, 2025 WL 368852, 2025 WL 597959), *New York v. Trump* (2025 WL 357368), *Santa Cruz Lesbian and Gay Community Ctr. v. Trump* (508 F. Supp. 3d 521), *Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity Officers in Higher Educ. v. Trump* (2025 WL 573764, stayed by 4th Cir. on Mar. 14, 2025), *Chi. Women in Trades v. Trump* (2025 WL 933871, 2025 WL 1114466), *San Francisco AIDS Foundation v. Trump* (2025 WL 1621636), and *Thakur v. Trump* (2025 WL 1734471).\n\nOn February 28, 2025, plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. On March 5, 2025, a non-profit organization named \"Do No Harm\" filed a motion to intervene as a defendant, which the Court denied without prejudice on March 12, 2025, allowing it to participate as amicus curiae. On May 2, 2025, Judge Kelly denied the plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, finding that they were not likely to succeed on the merits of their facial constitutional challenges, and for some claims, had failed to establish standing. This ruling was reported as *National Urban League et al. v. Trump et al.*, 2025 WL 1978727 (D.D.C. May 2, 2025).\n\nFollowing the preliminary injunction denial and the voluntary dismissal of one plaintiff, NUL and AFC filed a First Amended and Supplemental Complaint on June 30, 2025, removing the Administrative Procedure Act as a separate cause of action and updating factual allegations to include specific harms, such as the termination of a $500,000 EPA grant for NUL's Urban Environmental Justice Collaborative Program and directives from HRSA to AFC to censor language related to gender and DEIA in its program materials.",
    "46090": "On February 9, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) filed a complaint, later amended on February 13, 2025, with multiple individual and organizational plaintiffs including the National Consumer Law Center, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Virginia Poverty Law Center, Pastor Eva Steege (later substituted by her husband, Ted Steege, for her estate), and the CFPB Employee Association. These plaintiffs, represented by private law firms and union counsel, sued Russell Vought in his official capacity as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the CFPB itself.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that the Executive Branch was unlawfully attempting to dismantle the CFPB, an independent agency created by Congress in 2010 through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to protect consumers and ensure financial stability. This effort, plaintiffs claimed, violated constitutional separation of powers principles, the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution (challenging Vought's appointment under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by exceeding statutory authority and acting arbitrarily and capriciously (5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (C)). Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief (including temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions), and attorneys' fees.\n\nThe factual basis for the suit began on January 31, 2025, when President Trump fired CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. Interim Acting Director Scott Bessent and subsequently, on February 7, 2025, Acting Director Russell Vought (also Director of the Office of Management and Budget) issued directives pausing most CFPB activities, with Vought explicitly ordering a \"stop work\" to all employees on February 10, 2025, unless approved by the Chief Legal Officer. President Trump publicly stated his goal to \"totally eliminate\" the CFPB. The agency's website was taken offline, and Elon Musk (head of the \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" DOGE, whose personnel were embedded at CFPB) posted \"CFPB RIP.\" These actions were followed by the termination of approximately 85 probationary and 130 term employees (including the statutorily mandated Private Education Loan Ombudsman), the cancellation of over $100 million in contracts, and plans for a large-scale Reduction in Force (RIF) affecting nearly all remaining CFPB employees.\n\nOn February 14, 2025, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson converted the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order into a motion for a preliminary injunction. The court entered a consent order (Doc 19) temporarily prohibiting data destruction, most employee terminations, RIF notices, and fund transfers. After evidentiary hearings on March 10-11, 2025, Judge Jackson issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order on March 28, 2025 (Doc 87, 88), granting the preliminary injunction. The court found a likelihood of success on the merits, concluding that defendants were engaged in an unlawful, concerted effort to dismantle the CFPB in violation of separation of powers principles and the APA. The injunction ordered the defendants to maintain agency data, reinstate previously terminated probationary and term employees, cease further RIFs or terminations (except for cause), not enforce the stop-work order, provide employees with necessary work access, ensure the Office of Consumer Response maintained its complaint systems, and rescind contract termination notices.\n\nDefendants appealed this preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (Case No. 25-5091) on March 29, 2025. Related cases included *NTEU v. Trump*, 2025 WL 561080 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2025), where Judge Cooper denied a preliminary injunction for NTEU's employment claims, and *Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau*, 2025 WL 814500 (D. Md. Mar. 14, 2025). On April 11, 2025, the D.C. Circuit issued a partial stay of the District Court's injunction (Doc 2110720), allowing RIFs and work stoppages *only if* defendants conducted a \"particularized assessment\" that affected employees/work were unnecessary to statutory duties. Following this, on April 17, 2025, the CFPB issued RIF notices to 1408 employees. On April 18, 2025, Judge Jackson issued an interim order (Doc 113) suspending this RIF and prohibiting the cutoff of employee computer access, pending a hearing to determine compliance with the partially stayed injunction. Defendants appealed this interim order (Case No. 25-5132). On April 28, 2025, the D.C. Circuit lifted its partial stay of the RIF prohibition (Doc 2113309), fully reinstating the District Court's ban on RIFs. Appeal No. 25-5132 was voluntarily dismissed by defendants on May 7, 2025, and granted on May 12, 2025.\n\nUltimately, on August 15, 2025, the D.C. Circuit (Judges Katsas and Rao, with Judge Pillard dissenting) vacated the District Court's preliminary injunction (Doc 2130273, 2025 WL 2130273). The majority held that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the employment-related claims of the NTEU and CFPB Employee Association, as these claims must proceed through the exclusive review scheme of the Civil Service Reform Act. For the remaining plaintiffs, the D.C. Circuit concluded that their claims targeted neither \"final agency action\" reviewable under the APA (as the alleged \"shutdown decision\" was abstract and not a sufficiently discrete, binding agency statement) nor unconstitutional action reviewable in equity (as the claims were statutory violations rephrased as constitutional ones, per *Dalton v. Specter*). The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court's opinion.",
    "PB-CT-0007": "On November 9, 2010, six same-sex couples and one widower, all legally married in Connecticut, Vermont, or New Hampshire, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. These individual plaintiffs, represented by private attorneys and public interest legal organizations, sued federal agencies and officials, including the Office of Personnel Management, the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor, the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, the United States Postal Service, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and the United States of America. The plaintiffs alleged that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 1 U.S.C. § 7, violated the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n\nThe plaintiffs contended that DOMA Section 3, which defined \"marriage\" and \"spouse\" for all federal purposes as exclusively between one man and one woman, discriminatorily denied them federal protections, benefits, and responsibilities available to similarly situated opposite-sex married couples. Specific harms included a retired federal employee's spouse being denied \"Self and Family\" health insurance coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB); a widower being denied a \"One-Time Lump-Sum Death Benefit\" from the Social Security Administration and a Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity (QPSA) under his deceased spouse's private pension plan; a federal employee being denied leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to care for her ill spouse and unable to enroll her spouse in her FEHB \"Self and Family\" plan; retired state employees being denied a medical cost spousal benefit from the New Hampshire Retirement System due to federal tax regulations tied to DOMA; and two same-sex married couples being compelled to file federal income tax returns as \"Head of Household\" or \"Single,\" resulting in higher tax burdens and denied refunds. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that DOMA Section 3 is unconstitutional as applied to them, an injunction to prevent its enforcement, and monetary damages for the tax-related harms ($1,465 for Suzanne and Geraldine Artis, and $2,085 for Bradley Kleinerman and James Gehre).\n\nAfter the U.S. Attorney General announced in February 2011 that the Executive Branch would no longer defend DOMA Section 3, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) of the U.S. House of Representatives intervened to defend the statute. Both BLAG and the federal defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint, while the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. Judge Vanessa L. Bryant denied BLAG's motion to stay proceedings on July 4, 2012.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, Judge Bryant issued a Memorandum of Decision (2012 WL 3113883), denying the motions to dismiss and granting the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. The court found that classifications based on sexual orientation are entitled to a heightened form of judicial scrutiny, but concluded that DOMA Section 3 failed even the lowest level of rational basis review. The court rejected all asserted justifications for DOMA, including defending traditional marriage, promoting responsible procreation, preserving government resources, protecting state sovereignty, and ensuring consistency, finding them to lack a rational relationship to the statute's discriminatory classification. The judgment, entered on August 2, 2012, declared DOMA Section 3 unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiffs, permanently enjoined the defendants from enforcing its discriminatory provisions, and awarded the specified monetary damages and costs.\n\nBoth the federal defendants and BLAG filed separate notices of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on August 17, 2012, and September 26, 2012, respectively. These appeals were subsequently consolidated in the Second Circuit. Additionally, both the plaintiffs and the federal defendants filed petitions for a writ of certiorari before judgment to the U.S. Supreme Court. This case is related to other ongoing challenges to DOMA, including *Windsor v. United States* and *Gill v. Office of Personnel Management*.",
    "DR-CA-0033": "On August 22, 2005, a wheelchair-bound individual filed a civil complaint against Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., alleging that two of its California restaurant locations (in San Diego and Encinitas) denied him full and equal access due to architectural barriers. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, specifically claimed that high walls (44-46 inches) in front of the food preparation counters obstructed his view of food items and their preparation, thereby preventing him from fully participating in the \"Chipotle experience\" of selecting and customizing his order. He also alleged inaccessible parking, entrances, restrooms, and dining tables. The lawsuit asserted causes of action under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.) and various California statutes, including the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the Disabled Persons Act. The plaintiff sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief (to mandate barrier removal and policy modification), monetary damages, and attorneys' fees.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Napoleon A. Jones, Jr. In January 2006, Chipotle filed a cross-claim for indemnity and defense against the property landlords, Carl Karcher Enterprises, Inc. and El Camino Plaza Associates, which was later dismissed with prejudice. A related putative class action, *Maurizio Antoninetti, et al. v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.* (Case No. 06CV2671-LAB (POR)), was filed and consolidated with this case for discovery purposes only.\n\nIn January 2007, Judge Jones denied Chipotle's motion to dismiss this case but affirmed the discovery-only consolidation. In June 2007, Judge Jones issued a partial summary judgment ruling: he granted Chipotle's motions regarding ADA claims for parking, entrances, and restrooms (finding them moot due to remediation or lacking evidence/damages sought), but granted the plaintiff's motions on state law parking claims (due to prior violations). Crucially, he denied both parties' motions for summary judgment on the food preparation counters, finding a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Chipotle's accommodation policies constituted \"equivalent facilitation\" under ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) § 7.2(2)(iii), and ruling that the ADA's general anti-discrimination provisions did not apply. Both parties' subsequent motions for reconsideration were denied in August 2007.\n\nA bench trial was held before Judge Jones from November 27 to December 3, 2007. On January 10, 2008, Judge Jones issued his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment: he found that Chipotle's *prior unwritten* accommodation policy *did not* constitute \"equivalent facilitation,\" but its *current formal written* accommodation policy *did* comply with ADAAG § 7.2(2)(iii). He denied injunctive relief for the counter walls, citing the plaintiff's lack of irreparable injury and sincere intent to return to the restaurants. The plaintiff was awarded $5,000 in statutory damages under the California Disabled Persons Act for five \"bona fide\" visits made while the unwritten policy was in effect, but no damages for \"litigation-related\" visits or for multiple barriers on a single visit.\n\nThe plaintiff appealed the judgment and the subsequent attorney fees order, and Chipotle cross-appealed. On July 26, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (643 F.3d 1165) issued an opinion that significantly altered the case: it affirmed the finding that the unwritten policy violated the ADA, but *reversed* the finding that Chipotle's *written* policy complied with the ADA. The Ninth Circuit also *reversed* the denial of injunctive relief, remanding for appropriate relief, and *vacated* the $5,000 damages award and the attorney fees award, remanding for reconsideration in light of its new rulings.\n\nFollowing remand, and after the plaintiff Maurizio Antoninetti's death, his wife, Livia Antoninetti, was substituted as plaintiff. On March 21, 2012, District Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz denied injunctive relief as moot due to the plaintiff's death. He subsequently awarded $5,000 in statutory damages for the five \"bona fide\" visits, but again denied damages for the three \"litigation-related\" visits. On July 17, 2012, after reconsideration, Judge Moskowitz awarded the plaintiff $545,079.05 in attorneys' fees and costs, for a total amended judgment of $550,079.05 (including the $5,000 in damages). On December 26, 2012, the Appellate Commissioner for the Ninth Circuit awarded attorneys' fees and expenses in the amount of $353,469.95 for the appellate proceedings.",
    "CJ-FL-0009": "This consolidated class action, initially filed on June 28, 2019, challenged Florida's legal framework for restoring voting rights to citizens with past felony convictions. The individual plaintiffs were felons who had completed all terms of their sentences, including incarceration and parole or probation, but still owed court-ordered financial obligations (Legal Financial Obligations or \"LFOs\") such as fines, fees, costs, and restitution. Many of these plaintiffs asserted they were genuinely unable to pay these LFOs, and some had already registered and voted. Organizational plaintiffs, including the Florida State Conference of the NAACP, the Orange County Branch of the NAACP, and the League of Women Voters of Florida, joined the suit, alleging that the new laws hampered their voter registration efforts and diverted resources. The defendants included the Governor of Florida, the Secretary of State of Florida, and the Supervisors of Elections for several Florida counties.\n\nThe case centered on Florida's Amendment 4, a voter-initiated constitutional amendment approved in November 2018, which restored voting rights to most felons \"upon completion of all terms of sentence including parole or probation,\" effective January 8, 2019. In June 2019, the Florida Legislature enacted Senate Bill 7066 (SB7066), which defined \"all terms of sentence\" to explicitly include payment of LFOs, even if converted to civil liens. The plaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment's prohibition against poll taxes, the First Amendment (speech and association), and the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA). They sought declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nPresiding Judge Robert L. Hinkle, who oversaw the consolidated cases, initially granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction on October 18, 2019. This injunction allowed the 17 named individual plaintiffs to register and vote if they asserted or showed a genuine inability to pay their LFOs. The State appealed, and the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the preliminary injunction on February 19, 2020, in *Jones v. Governor of Fla., 950 F.3d 795 (11th Cir. 2020)*. The appellate court held that conditioning voting rights on the payment of LFOs violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause as applied to felons genuinely unable to pay, applying heightened scrutiny. Separately, on January 16, 2020, the Florida Supreme Court issued an advisory opinion, *Advisory Op. to the Governor Re: Implementation of Amendment 4, 288 So. 3d 1070 (Fla. 2020)*, agreeing that \"all terms of sentence\" in Amendment 4 included LFOs.\n\nFollowing the preliminary injunction, Judge Hinkle certified a class representing all persons eligible to vote but for unpaid LFOs (for the Twenty-Fourth Amendment claim) and a subclass of those genuinely unable to pay (for the Fourteenth Amendment claim) on April 7, 2020. A bench trial was held from April 27 to May 6, 2020. The district court's findings of fact from trial included that the \"overwhelming majority\" of felons with unpaid LFOs were genuinely unable to pay; that state records for LFOs were decentralized, inconsistent, and often impossible for felons to ascertain; that the State's Division of Elections had not screened a single felon registrant for LFOs and projected completion by 2026 or later without additional resources; and that the risk of criminal prosecution for false affirmation deterred eligible voters. The court also found that the State's newly adopted \"every-dollar method\" for calculating LFO payments was irrational and undermined its \"debt-to-society\" rationale. The court determined that many fees and costs were, in substance, taxes used for government funding.\n\nOn May 24, 2020, Judge Hinkle issued a permanent injunction, *Jones v. DeSantis, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2020 WL 2618062 (ND Fla., May 24, 2020)*. The court declared Florida's pay-to-vote system unconstitutional as applied to individuals genuinely unable to pay LFOs, for amounts unknown or undeterminable, and for fees and costs (deemed \"taxes\"). It allowed the requirement to pay determinable fines and restitution for those able to pay. The injunction also mandated an advisory opinion process and a compliant voter eligibility notice, and enjoined the use of the non-compliant voter registration form. Claims of race discrimination, gender discrimination, excessive fines, and Ex Post Facto violations were dismissed.\n\nThe State again appealed the permanent injunction to the Eleventh Circuit, and the McCoy/Singleton plaintiffs cross-appealed. The Eleventh Circuit granted the State's motion to stay the permanent injunction pending appeal, a decision the Supreme Court declined to overturn in *Raysor v. DeSantis, 591 U.S. ____ (2020)*. Ultimately, on September 11, 2020, the Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed the district court's judgment and vacated the permanent injunction, *Jones v. Governor of Fla., No. 20-12003 (11th Cir. 2020)*. The appellate court found that SB7066 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause under rational basis review (overruling its prior heightened scrutiny finding), nor did it violate the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, or the Due Process Clause. The case was remanded for further proceedings on the cross-appeal.",
    "CW-CA-0005": "The case, *Katie A., et al. v. Diana Bonta, et al.*, was initially filed on July 18, 2002, as a statewide class action on behalf of children in California's foster care system or at imminent risk of placement, who had documented mental illnesses or conditions and needed individualized mental health services. The plaintiffs were represented by various private and non-profit legal organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Western Center on Law and Poverty, Protection & Advocacy, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, and National Center for Youth Law. The lawsuit alleged systemic failures by state agencies (California Department of Health Services/Care Services and Department of Social Services, and their directors) and Los Angeles County agencies (Department of Children and Family Services and its directors) to provide legally mandated mental health services. These failures allegedly violated the Medicaid Act's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions (42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.), the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Article I, Section 7(a) of the California Constitution, and California Government Code § 11135 et seq. Claims were brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the provision of necessary community-based mental health services.\n\nThe case was initially presided over by Judge A. Howard Matz, and later reassigned to Judge John A. Kronstadt. An earlier related case, *CV 98-4181 AHM*, was consolidated with this action. Another related case, *Emily Q. v. Bonta*, was also referenced in proceedings.\n\nAfter an First Amended Complaint was filed on December 20, 2002, the court granted class certification on June 18, 2003, for a statewide class, though one named plaintiff, Gary E., was excluded as a class representative. On July 16, 2003, the court approved a settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and the Los Angeles County defendants. This settlement, which was court-enforced, required the county to ensure prompt, individualized mental health services in home-like settings, prevent removal, afford placement stability, and provide care consistent with professional standards.\n\nOn March 14, 2006, the district court granted a preliminary injunction (reported at 433 F.Supp.2d 1065) against the State defendants, mandating the provision of wraparound services and therapeutic foster care (TFC) statewide. However, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded this order on March 23, 2007 (reported at 481 F.3d 1150), finding the district court applied an erroneous legal interpretation of the Medicaid Act's EPSDT provisions. Following remand, a renewed motion for preliminary injunction was filed but was subsequently vacated as moot without prejudice to re-filing.\n\nDisputes over the Los Angeles County settlement's enforcement arose, with plaintiffs filing a motion to compel compliance. These disputes concerned the county's progress in screening, providing services to children not removed from homes, addressing placements with Foster Family Agencies, reducing reliance on congregate care, ensuring intensive services in D-rate homes, training staff, securing funding, and developing adequate data and quality review systems.\n\nUltimately, a comprehensive settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and the State defendants was finalized and approved by the court on December 5, 2011, through a stipulated judgment. This court-enforced settlement aimed to facilitate coordinated, comprehensive, community-based mental health services (Intensive Care Coordination - ICC, Intensive Home Based Services - IHBS, and Therapeutic Foster Care - TFC) by supporting a new service structure and fiscal system, ensuring effective quality-based oversight and training, and specifically addressing the intensive needs of a subclass of foster children. Key deliverables included developing a Medi-Cal Documentation Manual, amending the State Plan for Medicaid, establishing a shared management structure between state agencies, developing cross-system training, improving data collection, and undertaking a statewide readiness assessment of counties. The court retained jurisdiction over this State settlement for 36 months following approval, expiring on December 5, 2014.\n\nRichard Saletta was appointed as a Special Master, and an Advisory Panel also contributed to monitoring. Both the Special Master and Advisory Panel regularly filed reports documenting progress and challenges in implementing both settlement agreements. These reports highlighted successes such as increased DCFS staffing and capacity for Child and Family Team (CFT) facilitation, but also noted continuing challenges including high DCFS caseloads, low CFT meeting frequency, the cessation of an initially promising \"immersion process\" for implementing reforms, underutilization of specialized mental health services like Wraparound and Intensive Field Capable Clinical Services (IFCCS), persistent numbers of children in congregate care, generally low practice quality scores (QSRs), and limitations in the Department of Mental Health's data systems.",
    "CJ-MD-0001": "On January 19, 2006, Vernon Evans, Jr., a death-sentenced inmate, filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS), the Commissioner of the Maryland Division of Correction (DOC), the Wardens of the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center and Metropolitan Transition Center, and unidentified execution personnel. Evans, represented by private counsel, brought the action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the state's lethal injection practices and procedures created a grave and unnecessary risk of cruel and unusual punishment, violating his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to the U.S. Constitution. He sought a permanent injunction against the use of these procedures and a declaratory judgment of their unconstitutionality.\n\nEvans specifically challenged the DOC's three-drug cocktail—sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride—arguing that it unnecessarily risked conscious suffering. He contended that the protocol's use of an ultra-short acting barbiturate (sodium pentothal) in \"bursts\" rather than continuous administration, combined with the absence of adequately trained medical personnel to administer and monitor anesthesia, created a high risk that inmates would be conscious during the administration of the painful paralytic agent (pancuronium bromide) and heart-stopping drug (potassium chloride). Evans, with a history of intravenous drug use, also highlighted the risk of failed peripheral intravenous access, potentially necessitating painful \"cut-down\" or central line procedures by unqualified staff. He argued the state's methods fell below generally accepted standards for animal euthanasia by the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\nOn February 1, 2006, Chief Judge Benson Everett Legg of the U.S. District Court denied Evans's motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, finding that Evans had not shown a substantial and unnecessary risk intrinsic to the procedure or that it was likely to fail as applied to him. Evans appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which denied an injunction pending appeal on February 3, 2006. Evans subsequently dismissed his federal appeal on February 15, 2006.\n\nContemporaneously, on January 20, 2006, Evans, joined by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Maryland (ACLU), and Maryland Citizens Against State Executions (CASE), filed a separate complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. This state action sought injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that the DOC's execution protocols violated the Maryland Death Penalty Procedures Statute (Md. Code Ann., Corr. Servs. §§ 3-905 - 3-909) and Maryland's Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (Md. Code Ann., State Gov't §§ 10-101 - 10-139) because they were not properly adopted regulations. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City denied a temporary injunction. The Maryland Court of Appeals, in a consolidated review (No. 122), later ruled on December 19, 2006, that the organizational plaintiffs lacked standing. However, it found merit in Evans's claim that the DOC's lethal injection checklist constituted a \"regulation\" under the APA and was ineffective because it had not been adopted in conformance with statutory requirements. The Court of Appeals vacated the Circuit Court's order and remanded the case with instructions to enjoin enforcement of the lethal injection checklist until the state complied with the APA or the Legislature exempted the protocols. This ruling was reported as 396 Md. 256 (2006).\n\nFollowing the Maryland Court of Appeals' decision, the federal case proceeded. Chief Judge Legg reopened and denied the state's motion to dismiss on September 14, 2006, and held a bench trial from September 18 to November 15, 2006. On February 21, 2007, the parties filed a consent motion to stay the federal proceedings, citing pending legislative bills in the Maryland General Assembly that could either exempt death penalty protocols from APA requirements or repeal the death penalty entirely. The Baltimore County State's Attorney agreed not to seek a warrant of execution until a final order in the federal litigation. The U.S. District Court granted this motion to stay on February 22, 2007, and required periodic status reports. The case was administratively closed on August 16, 2012, pending the final resolution of these legislative and administrative processes.",
    "PN-NY-0014": "The case, *Jaenean Ligon, et al. v. City of New York, et al.*, was initially filed on March 28, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs were twelve New York City residents (Black and Latino, some minors) and a class of similarly situated individuals, represented by private counsel including the New York Civil Liberties Union Foundation, The Bronx Defenders, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, and Shearman & Sterling LLP. They sued the City of New York, its Police Commissioner, and several New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers, alleging unconstitutional stop, question, search, citation, and arrest policies implemented under \"Operation Clean Halls\" (later renamed the Trespass Affidavit Program, or TAP). The plaintiffs asserted violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution (including the Equal Protection Clause), Article I, Sections 8 and 12 of the New York Constitution, the Fair Housing Act, and New York common law claims for false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, battery, and malicious prosecution. They sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief to halt and reform these practices, and monetary damages.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Shira A. Scheindlin and was related to *Floyd v. City of New York* (08 Civ. 1034) and *Davis v. City of New York* (10 Civ. 699), which also challenged NYPD stop-and-frisk practices. On September 24, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which Judge Scheindlin granted in part on January 8, 2013 (amended February 14, 2013). The ruling found a clear likelihood that the plaintiffs could prove the NYPD engaged in a widespread practice of unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx. On February 11, 2013, the court certified a preliminary injunction class for individuals stopped or at risk of being stopped in or around Bronx TAP buildings without legal justification.\n\nOn August 12, 2013, Judge Scheindlin issued a joint Remedial Order for *Ligon* and *Floyd*, mandating reforms to NYPD policies, training, supervision, monitoring, and discipline regarding stop-and-frisk practices, and appointing Peter L. Zimroth as an independent Monitor to oversee the process. The City of New York appealed both the preliminary injunction and the Remedial Order. Additionally, several police unions (the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, Detectives' Endowment Association, Lieutenants Benevolent Association, Captains' Endowment Association, and Sergeants Benevolent Association) moved to intervene and join the appeal.\n\nOn October 31, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stayed Judge Scheindlin's orders and reassigned the cases to Judge Analisa Torres, citing an appearance of partiality by Judge Scheindlin. Following a change in mayoral administration, the City sought a limited remand to pursue settlement, which the Second Circuit granted on February 21, 2014. On July 30, 2014, Judge Torres denied the police unions' motions to intervene, finding them untimely and lacking a direct, substantial, and legally protectable interest. She also modified the Remedial Order, limiting the Monitor's term to no sooner than three years after the implementation of immediate reforms, contingent on the City demonstrating substantial compliance. The Second Circuit affirmed Judge Torres's denial of intervention and granted the City's motion to dismiss its appeals with prejudice on October 31, 2014, allowing the remedial process to proceed under Judge Torres's supervision.\n\nOn July 19, 2017, the parties reached a Stipulation of Settlement and Order, which resolved the *Ligon* action. Key terms of the settlement included:\n*   **Class Definition:** Expanded to include individuals stopped, frisked, arrested, searched, or summonsed inside or outdoors near TAP buildings without legal justification.\n*   **Principles:** Acknowledged legal rights of residents/visitors, importance of effective and respectful policing, and necessity of constitutional compliance in trespass enforcement.\n*   **NYPD Enforcement Standards:** Required NYPD officers to adhere to specific \"objective credible reason\" (Level 1), \"founded suspicion\" (Level 2), and \"reasonable suspicion\" (Level 3) standards for encounters and stops in or around TAP buildings, explicitly stating what circumstances (e.g., mere presence, refusal to identify, broken locks) are insufficient for suspicion. Mandated completion of standardized Stop Reports and Trespass Crimes Fact Sheets (TCFS) for relevant incidents, and specified limits on frisks and searches.\n*   **Policy Revisions:** Required revisions to NYPD Patrol Guide 212-59 (Interior Patrol of TAP Buildings) and Administrative Guide 303-27 (Trespass Affidavit Program) to incorporate these standards, including new criteria for TAP building enrollment and renewal based on documented criminal activity or complaints.\n*   **Training:** Mandated training for all relevant NYPD members on the new enforcement standards and TAP administration policies.\n*   **Monitoring:** The existing Court-Ordered Monitoring by Peter L. Zimroth was incorporated, to continue for the duration of the *Floyd* action's monitoring, overseeing reforms related to training, supervision, auditing, monitoring, and discipline concerning TAP enforcement. Monitoring for TAP Administration procedures would conclude one year after the settlement's effective date if in substantial compliance.\n*   **Damages & Fees:** The City agreed to pay $235,000 to the Named Plaintiffs for individual claims and $2,585,101 in attorneys' fees and $55,432 in costs/expenses through June 30, 2016, with provisions for future fees.\n*   **Court Jurisdiction:** The court retained jurisdiction to review, enforce, and ensure compliance.\n\nSince the settlement, Peter L. Zimroth has continued to serve as Monitor. His reports (including the First, Second, Eighth, and Tenth Reports) document significant progress in implementing reforms. The NYPD has revised its policies on stop-and-frisk (PG 212-11), racial profiling (PG 203-25), and interior patrols for NYCHA and TAP buildings (PG 212-60, PG 212-59). A new electronic Stop Report form with narrative sections, and a TCFS for trespass arrests, have been implemented. Training programs for recruits, in-service officers, and supervisors have been updated to reflect new policies, including implicit bias and procedural justice training. The NYPD has also expanded the use of body-worn cameras (BWCs) citywide and developed \"RISKS Reviews\" to monitor compliance. An MOU was signed with the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) on November 21, 2019, to expedite BWC footage production for investigations. The NYPD also implemented a program to collect and act on adverse findings regarding officer conduct. Notable outcomes include a significant reduction in TAP building enrollment (from 3,591 in Q1 2017 to 354 in Q2 2019) and a more than 70% decline in trespass arrests in NYCHA properties from 2014-2018. Monitor reviews of BWC footage show high rates of compliance with constitutional standards for encounters, though concerns persist regarding the underreporting of stops and the thoroughness of supervisory reviews and investigations into profiling allegations.",
    "PC-AL-0034": "The U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the United States of America, initially filed this civil rights lawsuit on May 28, 2015, against the State of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC), which operates the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women. The action was brought under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, alleging that the defendants' actions and omissions constituted a pattern or practice of depriving women prisoners of their rights under the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, specifically by failing to protect them from harm and serious risk of harm due to sexual abuse and harassment, and by violating their constitutional right to bodily privacy. The U.S. sought a declaratory judgment affirming these constitutional violations and permanent injunctive relief to ensure lawful conditions of confinement.\n\nThe factual basis for the case stemmed from a U.S. Department of Justice investigation, which concluded that the State of Alabama failed to protect women prisoners at Tutwiler from pervasive sexual abuse and harassment by correctional staff. Findings included instances of rape, fondling, voyeurism, coerced sexual activity in exchange for necessities or to avoid punishment, and a generally \"sexualized environment.\" The investigation highlighted deliberate indifference by officials, inadequate reporting and investigation processes (including retaliation against those who reported abuse), and systemic deficiencies. These deficiencies involved critically low staffing levels (with a particular lack of female officers), inadequate or non-existent gender-responsive policies, insufficient data collection and analysis, and an architectural design that lacked privacy and created numerous blind spots. Prior to this suit, the U.S. Department of Justice had issued findings in 1995 noting inappropriate sexual contact, and reports from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (2007) and the Equal Justice Initiative (2012) had also detailed ongoing sexual violence at Tutwiler.\n\nThe case was presided over by Judge Myron H. Thompson. Rather than proceeding to trial, it was resolved through a Joint Motion to Enter Settlement Agreement. On June 18, 2015, the court granted this motion, adopting the settlement agreement as a consent decree and conditionally dismissing the case without prejudice, while explicitly retaining jurisdiction to enforce the decree. The court’s opinion in the matter is reported at 2:15cv368-MHT (WO).\n\nThe consent decree mandated extensive reforms to address the identified issues. Key terms included: full compliance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) standards; establishing multiple internal and external confidential reporting mechanisms for prisoners and staff, protected from retaliation; ensuring prompt, thorough, and objective investigations into all allegations; implementing appropriate disciplinary actions for staff, with termination being the presumptive sanction for sexual abuse; developing gender-responsive policies, training for all staff (including on LGBTQI inmate management, use of force, and inmate discipline), and a gender-responsive classification system for women prisoners (including risk assessment for victimization/abusiveness); maintaining adequate staffing levels, particularly for female officers; addressing architectural features that compromised prisoner privacy; and establishing robust quality improvement and data collection systems, including a Risk Management System (RMS) and routine inmate polling. The decree is set to terminate upon the defendants achieving and maintaining \"substantial compliance\" with all substantive provisions for three consecutive compliance reports, equating to 18 consecutive months.\n\nA court-appointed monitor, initially Jennie Lancaster and subsequently Kathleen Dennehy (appointed August 26, 2016), oversees compliance. As of the Monitor’s Eighth Compliance Report, filed on August 27, 2019, 41 sections of the agreement were deemed in \"substantial compliance,\" while 2 sections remained in \"partial compliance.\" Persistent challenges noted in the report include chronic understaffing of correctional officers (only 44% of positions filled as of June 30, 2019), ongoing issues with officer recruitment and retention (especially for women), and difficulties in validating the Alabama Peace Officers' Standards and Training Commission’s (APOSTC) Physical Agility/Ability Test (PAAT) for a corrections environment, particularly concerning gender-norming, which continues to impact female candidates. The report also highlighted recurring concerns regarding a small number of staff allegedly using unprofessional, abusive, or racially insensitive language with inmates, and a pattern of inmates making false PREA reports to manipulate housing assignments or target staff.",
    "ED-MI-0001": "On November 8, 2006, a coalition of civil rights organizations, labor unions, and numerous individual Black, Latino/a, Native American, and white students and prospective university applicants, represented by private counsel Scheff & Washington, P.C., filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs challenged Proposal 2, a newly adopted amendment to the Michigan Constitution (Article I, Section 26), which prohibits state entities, including public colleges and universities, from granting preferential treatment based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, education, or contracting. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and First Amendment rights, and argued that Proposal 2 was preempted by Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent its implementation.\n\nThe initial defendants included the Governor of Michigan and the governing boards of the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University, and other public educational institutions. The university governing boards, represented by private counsel Butzel Long, P.C., filed a cross-claim against the Governor, seeking a declaratory judgment and a preliminary injunction to delay Proposal 2's implementation for university admissions and financial aid until the end of the current academic cycle, citing academic freedom under the First Amendment and reliance on the Supreme Court's decision in *Grutter v. Bollinger*. The Michigan Attorney General, Michael Cox, represented by the Michigan Department of Attorney General, intervened as a defendant to defend the constitutionality of Proposal 2. Another group of individual students and faculty members at the University of Michigan, the Cantrell plaintiffs, represented primarily by the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, and private firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, filed a separate class action lawsuit, also challenging Proposal 2 under the Equal Protection Clause, focusing on its impact on the political process. These cases were consolidated before Judge David M. Lawson on January 5, 2007.\n\nThe District Court initially granted a stipulated temporary injunction, delaying Proposal 2's implementation for universities until July 1, 2007, but this was stayed by the Sixth Circuit on appeal by an intervening defendant, Eric Russell, a white law school applicant represented by private firms Center for Individual Rights and Cooper & Kirk, PLLC. Russell had successfully argued that his individual interest in immediate enforcement of the ban was not adequately represented by the other parties.\n\nAfter extensive discovery, which included evidence on the disparate impact of standardized tests and racial segregation in schools, both the Attorney General and Eric Russell moved for summary judgment, arguing Proposal 2 was constitutional. The Cantrell plaintiffs also moved for summary judgment, contending Proposal 2 was unconstitutional. On March 18, 2008, Judge Lawson granted summary judgment to the Attorney General, upholding Proposal 2. The court rejected the plaintiffs' arguments, finding no conventional Equal Protection Clause violation, no preemption by federal statutes, and dismissing the First Amendment claim for lack of standing. The court also dismissed some plaintiffs for lack of standing and denied class certification motions as moot. The Cantrell plaintiffs' subsequent motion to alter or amend the judgment was denied on December 11, 2008.\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. A three-judge panel initially reversed the District Court, finding Proposal 2 unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause's political-process doctrine, but this decision was vacated when the Sixth Circuit granted en banc rehearing on September 9, 2011. On November 15, 2012, the en banc Sixth Circuit again reversed the District Court, holding by an 8-7 vote that Proposal 2 unconstitutionally altered Michigan's political structure by placing special burdens on racial minorities, citing *Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1* and *Hunter v. Erickson*. The court affirmed the dismissal of Eric Russell as an intervenor, finding his interests were now adequately represented by the Attorney General, and affirmed the denial of the university defendants' motion to be dismissed from the case.\n\nThe Michigan Attorney General (now Bill Schuette) sought review from the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari. On April 22, 2014, the Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit's judgment. The plurality opinion, authored by Justice Kennedy, concluded that there is no authority in the Federal Constitution or in the Court’s precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit to the voters the determination whether racial preferences may be considered in governmental decisions, particularly in school admissions. The Court distinguished *Seattle* and *Hunter*, noting that those cases involved specific injuries or risks of injury on account of race, which were not present in this case. The Supreme Court's decision thus upheld the constitutionality of Proposal 2.",
    "CW-DC-0001": "This class action was initially filed on June 20, 1989, by children in foster care under the supervision of the District of Columbia's Department of Human Services (DHS) and children who had been abused or neglected (or were at risk) and known to the Department. The plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from the Children's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a privately funded national organization. The lawsuit named the then-Mayor of the District of Columbia and various officials of the DHS (including the Director, Commissioner of the Commission on Social Services, Acting Administrator of the Family Services Administration, and Acting Chief of the Child and Family Services Division) as defendants in their official capacities.\n\nThe core of the complaint alleged that the District's child welfare system systematically denied children their rights under federal law, the U.S. Constitution (specifically the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause), and District of Columbia law. The causes of action were brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, citing violations of federal statutes including the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, as well as District of Columbia statutes such as the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act of 1977 and the Youth Residential Facilities Licensure Act of 1986. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief to remedy these violations, and attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe factual basis for the case detailed a system in crisis: excessive social worker caseloads, uninvestigated abuse reports, children languishing in \"emergency care\" for years, untrained staff and foster parents, overcrowded and unsupervised foster homes, nonexistent planning for children's futures, inappropriate use of medication, and a severe lack of specialized placements, often resulting in children being sent to distant states. As a consequence, children remained in foster care for an average of nearly five years, more than triple the national average, suffering irreparable harm.\n\nFollowing a non-jury trial held from February 6 to 26, 1991, Judge Thomas F. Hogan issued a Memorandum Opinion on April 18, 1991 (762 F.Supp. 959), finding the D.C. officials liable for violating the federal and local statutory rights of all class members, and the Fifth Amendment constitutional rights of those children in the District's foster care. The Court deemed the evidence \"outrageous\" and the District's dereliction of responsibility \"a travesty.\"\n\nAfter this finding of liability, the parties negotiated a comprehensive Remedial Order, which the Court entered on August 27, 1991, to reform the child welfare system. The District appealed this judgment. On April 16, 1993, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (LaShawn A. v. Kelly, 990 F.2d 1319) affirmed the judgment primarily on the basis of local District of Columbia law, thereby avoiding complex federal statutory and constitutional issues, and remanded the case for the District Court to fashion an order based entirely on local law, if possible. The Supreme Court denied certiorari on this decision.\n\nIn response, the District Court re-entered a Modified Final Order (MFO) on January 27, 1994, which was substantially identical to the original Remedial Order but explicitly relied on D.C. law. The MFO established detailed requirements for protective services, child and family care, emergency placements, planning, adoption, staffing, training, and systemic accountability. The District again appealed, but the D.C. Circuit affirmed the MFO in October 1996 (LaShawn A. v. Barry, 107 F.3d 923), finding that it did not exceed the mandates of local law. The Supreme Court again denied certiorari in June 1997 (Barry v. LaShawn A., 117 S.Ct. 2431).\n\nDue to persistent noncompliance, the District Court, on May 22, 1995 (887 F.Supp. 297), found the D.C. officials in civil contempt and imposed a full general receivership over the child welfare system. This receivership was designed to directly manage and reform the system. The District appealed this decision, and in June 1998, the D.C. Circuit (LaShawn A. v. Barry, 144 F.3d 847) remanded the receivership order, finding that its authorization for the receiver to disregard local law was too broad.\n\nThe receivership was eventually terminated by consent order in October 2000, subject to a probationary period. Following this, the Court approved an Implementation Plan (IP) in 2003, and subsequently an Amended Implementation Plan (AIP) on February 27, 2007, setting forth new benchmarks and strategies for compliance. Disputes over enforcement continued, and on October 7, 2008, the Court issued a Stipulated Order to address ongoing contempt allegations and require a comprehensive annual strategy plan.\n\nIn April 2010, the District Court again found D.C. officials, including Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, in civil contempt for failing to comply with the Stipulated Order (Order, April 5, 2010). The Court simultaneously denied the District's motion to terminate the consent decree and partially denied its motion to modify the Court Monitor's authority. The District appealed these rulings, but the appeals were voluntarily dismissed in 2011.\n\nOn December 17, 2010, the Court approved a new Implementation and Exit Plan (IEP), replacing prior plans and setting specific outcomes and exit standards for the District to achieve by the end of 2011. The IEP also outlined a path for eventual termination of judicial oversight. Through subsequent years, the Court Monitor continued to report on the District's progress, noting both achievements and persistent challenges, particularly in timely investigation closures, quality of services, and permanency outcomes.\n\nOn August 29, 2019, the parties jointly requested and the Court approved an Exit and Sustainability Plan (ESP), replacing the IEP. This plan designated 56 \"Outcomes to be Maintained\" (standards already achieved and no longer requiring external monitoring) and identified 23 \"Outcomes to be Achieved\" that still required improvement. The ESP also included commitments for self-regulation, public reporting, and expanding the placement array, providing a framework for the District to demonstrate substantial compliance and ultimately exit court supervision.\n\nThroughout the litigation, the Court consistently awarded attorneys' fees and costs to the plaintiffs, with significant awards made in February 1998 (1998 WL 35243112), April 2000 (2000 WL 4218003), and through various consent orders for monitoring compliance, with the last recorded consent order for fees and costs covering March 1, 2019, through August 31, 2019. The case remains under the oversight of Judge Thomas F. Hogan, with ongoing monitoring and efforts toward full compliance and termination."
