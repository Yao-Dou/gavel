    "46290": "On March 5, 2025, the Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council, a recognized student organization, filed suit against members of the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents, Chancellor John Sharp, and President Mark A. Welsh III in their official capacities, seeking injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The student organization, represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), challenged the Board's February 28, 2025 resolution banning drag shows from campus \"Special Event Venues.\"\n\nThe dispute arose when the Board abruptly prohibited \"Draggieland,\" an annual student-funded drag show that had been held at the Rudder Theatre for five years and was scheduled for March 27, 2025. The student organization had reserved the venue in May 2024, received approval in October 2024, and sold 168 tickets before the Board held a telephone meeting on February 28, 2025, to adopt its ban. The Board's resolution stated that drag shows involving \"biological males dressing in women's clothing\" with \"exaggerated female makeup\" were inconsistent with the university system's values because they \"demean women\" and \"promote gender ideology.\" The Board cited President Trump's January 20, 2025 executive order entitled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government\" and concerns about Title IX compliance as justifications for the ban.\n\nJudge Lee H. Rosenthal of the Southern District of Texas held a hearing on March 18, 2025, and issued a preliminary injunction on March 24, 2025, finding that the student organization demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on its First Amendment claims. The court determined that drag performances constitute protected expressive conduct under the First Amendment and that the Board's ban was unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination that could not survive strict scrutiny. The court found that the Rudder Theatre functions as a designated public forum that had hosted numerous theatrical performances, political speakers, and beauty pageants without restriction. The court rejected the Board's arguments that drag shows could create a hostile environment for women or violate Title IX, noting no evidence of harassment complaints from past Draggieland performances. The court also found the ban unconstitutionally vague for failing to define terms like \"vulgar,\" \"sexualized,\" or \"lewd.\"\n\nThe preliminary injunction ordered the Board to permit Draggieland to proceed as scheduled on March 27, 2025, at 7:30 p.m. in the Rudder Theatre, with no bond requirement. The Board filed a notice of appeal to the Fifth Circuit on March 28, 2025, along with a motion to stay the injunction pending appeal, which remains pending. The case continues with an initial pretrial conference scheduled for May 8, 2025, before Judge Rosenthal.",
    "46324": "On March 31, 2025, Inclusiv, Inc., a 50-year-old nonprofit organization that partners with credit unions to promote financial security, filed suit against the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Acting Deputy Administrator W.C. McIntosh, and Citibank, N.A. The nonprofit is represented by private counsel from Venable LLP. The case was assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan and was later consolidated with Case No. 25-cv-698 on April 15, 2025, along with several other related cases involving other Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grant recipients.\n\nInclusiv challenges EPA's freeze and attempted termination of its $1.87 billion grant under the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator program, part of the nearly $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund established by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Inclusiv brings claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging EPA's actions violate the Inflation Reduction Act, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, the Anti-Deficiency Act, and EPA's own regulations at 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339-342. The nonprofit also asserts constitutional violations under the Separation of Powers doctrine (specifically the Legislative Vesting Clause, Spending and Appropriations Clauses, and Take Care Clause) and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Against Citibank, which serves as the financial agent holding the grant funds, Inclusiv brings state law claims for breach of contract, conversion, and replevin. Inclusiv seeks declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.\n\nEPA competitively awarded Inclusiv the grant in April 2024, with a formal grant agreement executed on August 8, 2024, for a performance period running through June 30, 2030. The funds were deposited into an account at Citibank pursuant to a Financial Agency Agreement between Citibank and Treasury and an Account Control Agreement among Inclusiv, Citibank, and EPA. By February 2025, Inclusiv had selected 108 credit union subrecipients across 27 states and Puerto Rico to receive $651 million in subawards for clean energy projects in low- and moderate-income communities.\n\nOn February 12, 2025, EPA Administrator Zeldin publicly announced EPA's intention to \"return the entire fund balance to the U.S. Treasury,\" calling the program \"criminal.\" Since mid-February 2025, Inclusiv has been unable to access its funds, as Citibank refused to process disbursement requests despite its ministerial obligations under the Account Control Agreement. On March 11, 2025, Acting Deputy Administrator McIntosh sent termination letters to all GGRF grant recipients, citing unspecified concerns about \"program integrity,\" \"fraud, waste, and abuse,\" and \"misalignment with the Agency's priorities.\" The termination letter did not provide Inclusiv any opportunity to respond or challenge the decision.\n\nInclusiv filed a motion for preliminary injunction on April 1, 2025, and initially filed an emergency motion for temporary restraining order the same day after discovering its account balance had dropped to zero. The nonprofit withdrew the TRO request on April 2, 2025, after receiving assurances that the funds had been moved into a money market account as part of a monthly process. The Court stayed briefing on the preliminary injunction motion on April 10, 2025, pending resolution of related matters in the consolidated lead case. On April 16, 2025, the Court denied Inclusiv's preliminary injunction motion as moot, referring to a preliminary injunction order issued in the lead case.",
    "46391": "On April 11, 2025, five F-1 visa holders - three current students and two post-graduate Optional Practical Training (OPT) workers in the Northern District of California - filed suit against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons, San Francisco ICE Acting Field Office Director Moises Becerra, and President Donald J. Trump in their official capacities. The plaintiffs, proceeding under pseudonyms S.Y., Z.D., Y.W., H.G., and W.X., are represented by private counsel from Van Der Hout LLP.\n\nThe case arose from a widespread pattern beginning April 4, 2025, in which ICE's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) terminated the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems (SEVIS) records of hundreds of F-1 students nationwide. Between April 4 and April 8, 2025, each plaintiff received notice that their SEVIS record had been terminated with the reason listed as \"Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked.\" Three plaintiffs also received notices from the State Department that their F-1 visas had been revoked.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act, alleging that the SEVIS terminations were unauthorized, arbitrary and capricious, and violated due process under the Fifth Amendment. They argued that none of them had violated their F-1 status requirements - two plaintiffs had minor misdemeanor convictions that were not crimes of violence, two had arrests without convictions, and one had a prior deportation for which they had received a waiver and subsequently been granted a new visa. The plaintiffs contended that under federal regulations, these circumstances did not constitute grounds for terminating their SEVIS records or F-1 status.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement actions, arrest, detention, transfer, or removal based on the SEVIS terminations. They argued that terminating SEVIS records effectively strips students of their ability to continue their studies or OPT employment, as the DHS website indicates that SEVIS termination results in loss of employment authorization and triggers potential ICE enforcement action.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Noel Wise but was reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White on April 22, 2025, after being found related to another case, Doe v. Trump. On April 17, 2025, Judge Wise granted the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order, finding they had shown serious questions on the merits and likelihood of irreparable harm. The TRO enjoined defendants from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring the plaintiffs and from imposing any legal effect from the SEVIS terminations. This TRO was extended by Judge White on April 25, 2025.\n\nFollowing briefing and hearings, Judge White granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction on May 22, 2025, maintaining the same protections. The court found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their APA claims that the SEVIS terminations were not in compliance with federal regulations and were arbitrary and capricious. The government filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit on July 21, 2025 (Case No. 25-4523) and subsequently moved to stay the injunction pending appeal on August 8, 2025.\n\nThe case highlighted a broader pattern of SEVIS terminations affecting international students at universities across California and the nation, including the University of California system and Stanford University, creating significant uncertainty for schools and students about the basis and consequences of these administrative actions.",
    "46509": "On April 29, 2025, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), its Board of Directors, and three individual Board members filed suit against President Trump and other executive branch officials challenging the President's attempt to remove three of the Board's five members. The case arose when Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel Trent Morse sent an email on April 28, 2025, stating \"on behalf of President Donald J. Trump\" that the positions of Board members Laura Ross, Thomas Rothman, and Diane Kaplan were \"terminated effective immediately.\" The plaintiffs were represented by the private law firm Saul Ewing LLP.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution, alleging violations of the separation of powers doctrine, the Presentment Clause, the Appropriations Clause, and the Take Care Clause of the Constitution. They sought declaratory judgment that the termination email was legally ineffective and injunctive relief prohibiting defendants from interfering with CPB's governance and operations.\n\nCPB was established by Congress through the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 as a nonprofit corporation explicitly designated as not being \"an agency or establishment of the United States Government.\" The Act provides that Board members are not \"officers or employees of the United States\" and prohibits any federal department, agency, officer, or employee from exercising \"any direction, supervision, or control\" over the Corporation. While the President appoints the nine Board members with Senate confirmation, the Act contains no express provision authorizing presidential removal of Board members. The only removal mechanism specified in the Act is forfeiture of membership for failing to attend at least 50% of Board meetings in a calendar year.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order on April 29, 2025, which the parties later agreed to treat as a motion for preliminary injunction. Judge Randolph D. Moss of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held a hearing on May 14, 2025. Following the President's removal attempt, a member of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) contacted the two remaining Board members about \"getting a DOGE team assigned to the organization,\" heightening concerns about government interference.\n\nOn June 8, 2025, Judge Moss issued a memorandum opinion denying the preliminary injunction. The court found that plaintiffs had not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm. The court analyzed the interaction between the Public Broadcasting Act and D.C. nonprofit corporation law, which permits removal of directors by the appointing authority unless the corporation's articles or bylaws provide otherwise. Notably, CPB's bylaws did not address removal at the time of the President's action, though the Board amended them on May 15, 2025, to require a two-thirds Board vote to confirm any removal. The court concluded that D.C. law permitting removal was not clearly inconsistent with the Act and that CPB could continue functioning through a \"designated body\" provision even with only two directors.\n\nThe parties subsequently agreed to an expedited summary judgment schedule running through October 2025. However, both Laura Ross and Thomas Rothman voluntarily dismissed their claims in July and August 2025, respectively, leaving only the Corporation, the Board, and Diane Kaplan as plaintiffs pursuing the declaratory and injunctive relief claims.",
    "46590": "On April 7, 2025, Harry Wiley, a coal miner with 38 years of experience who had been diagnosed with black lung disease, filed a class action lawsuit against the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Department of Health and Human Services, represented by Petsonk PLLC, Mountain State Justice Inc., and Appalachian Mountain Advocates. The case challenged the defendants' termination of nearly all employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Respiratory Health Division in Morgantown, West Virginia, which effectively shut down the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) that Congress mandated in the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.\n\nThe plaintiff brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706), alleging the agency action was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, as well as a Fifth Amendment due process claim. The lawsuit sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief compelling the defendants to restore the Respiratory Health Division and continue providing the statutorily required health surveillance and job transfer programs under 30 U.S.C. § 843.\n\nThe factual basis centers on NIOSH's statutory obligation to screen coal miners for black lung disease and issue \"Part 90\" determinations that allow miners with evidence of pneumoconiosis to transfer to low-dust jobs without loss of pay. On April 1, 2025, the defendants issued Reduction in Force (RIF) notices to most Respiratory Health Division employees, placing them on administrative leave pending termination dates of June 2 and July 2, 2025. This action halted all CWHSP operations, leaving miners unable to obtain screenings or Part 90 determinations necessary to protect their health.\n\nMr. Wiley, diagnosed with black lung in November 2024 by a local clinic and the West Virginia Occupational Pneumoconiosis Board, submitted medical documentation to NIOSH seeking a Part 90 determination but received no response after the program shutdown. Without this determination, he continues working in dusty conditions that will cause his disease to progress. The proposed class includes all coal miners with evidence of pneumoconiosis seeking Part 90 eligibility.\n\nOn May 7, 2025, Judge Irene C. Berger held a hearing on the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction, receiving testimony from NIOSH employees, miners, and program coordinators about the specialized nature of the black lung screening program and the irreparable harm to miners from its closure. The court found that approximately 5,000 radiographs were processed in fiscal year 2024, and that the highly specialized work could not be transferred to other agencies or employees without extensive training.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, Judge Berger granted the preliminary injunction, finding the plaintiff likely to succeed on the merits of his APA claims. The court ordered that the RIFs be enjoined and rescinded to facilitate full restoration of the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division, including health surveillance through the CWHSP and the job transfer program. The court specifically ordered that in the event of any reorganization, there must be no pause, stoppage, or gap in the protections and services mandated by Congress. The Secretary was ordered to submit written certification of compliance within twenty days. The court set security for the injunction at zero dollars, finding no meaningful harm to the defendants and high likelihood of plaintiff's success on the merits. The case remains pending with trial scheduled for May 4, 2026.",
    "46605": "On May 17, 2025, Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan, a Venezuelan citizen detained at the Desert View Annex facility associated with the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, filed a habeas corpus petition and class action complaint challenging his detention and potential removal under Presidential Proclamation No. 10903. The petitioner, represented by private attorney Joshua Jonathan Schroeder, brought suit against President Donald J. Trump, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, and other federal officials, asserting claims under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and raising constitutional challenges under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The case sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent removal without adequate notice and process.\n\nThe Proclamation, issued on March 14, 2025, invoked the Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. §§ 21 et seq.) for only the fourth time in U.S. history, authorizing the immediate detention and removal of Venezuelan nationals allegedly affiliated with Tren de Aragua, which the President designated as a foreign terrorist organization conducting \"irregular warfare\" against the United States. The petitioner, an asylum applicant who had previously been granted parole to work and reside in the United States pending his asylum proceedings, was arrested during a routine ICE check-in without prior notice or documentation of the arrest basis. He was allegedly told his detention related to his Venezuelan nationality and tattoos that might indicate gang affiliation, though he maintained they were basketball-related.\n\nJudge John W. Holcomb granted a temporary restraining order on May 19, 2025, and certified a class for limited purposes consisting of all noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California subject to the Proclamation. Following a hearing on May 30, 2025, the court issued a preliminary injunction on June 2, 2025, enjoining the government from removing or transferring class members out of the district under the Alien Enemies Act pending further court order regarding adequate notice requirements. The court required a nominal $1 bond.\n\nThe court found the petitioner likely to succeed on his due process claims, noting that detainees subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and opportunity to challenge their removal, as established by the Supreme Court's decisions in Trump v. J.G.G. and A.A.R.P. v. Trump. While the court rejected challenges to the President's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act itself, finding such determinations within executive discretion, it held that constitutional due process protections still apply to removal proceedings under the Act.\n\nA dispute arose regarding the basis for the petitioner's continued detention after he was granted asylum on June 9, 2025. The petitioner filed an emergency application for habeas corpus on June 14, 2025, seeking immediate release, but the court denied it on June 20, 2025, finding the government could detain him pending appeal of the asylum grant under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A). The government filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit on August 1, 2025, challenging the preliminary injunction order, with the appeal assigned docket number 25-4866.",
    "46635": "On May 22, 2025, Shira Perlmutter, the Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office, filed suit challenging her purported removal by President Donald J. Trump. The case arose after President Trump fired Librarian of Congress Carla D. Hayden on May 8, 2025, reportedly over concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Two days later, on May 10, the White House Presidential Personnel Office, through Deputy Director Trent Morse, terminated Perlmutter's position \"effective immediately.\" The timing followed one day after the Copyright Office issued a pre-publication report on copyright and artificial intelligence. President Trump then purported to appoint Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as acting Librarian of Congress without Senate confirmation, and Blanche designated Associate Deputy Attorney General Paul Perkins as acting Register of Copyrights. When Justice Department officials attempted to access the Library of Congress on May 12 to assume these positions, Library staff contacted the U.S. Capitol Police, and the officials left voluntarily.\n\nPerlmutter, represented by the Democracy Forward Foundation and the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP, sued President Trump in his official capacity, Blanche, Perkins, the White House Presidential Personnel officials (Sergio Gor and Trent Morse), and the Executive Office of the President. She brought two ultra vires claims arguing that the President's actions violated both constitutional and statutory authority. First, she contended that the President cannot appoint an acting Librarian of Congress because the Library is not an \"Executive agency\" under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (5 U.S.C. § 3345), and therefore the President lacks authority to make temporary appointments there. Second, she argued that her removal violated the Appointments Clause and separation of powers principles because Congress vested the appointment and removal power for the Register of Copyrights exclusively in the Librarian of Congress under 17 U.S.C. § 701(a), not in the President.\n\nPerlmutter sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent her removal and the defendants from exercising the powers of their claimed positions. She immediately moved for a temporary restraining order on May 22, which Judge Timothy J. Kelly denied on May 28, 2025, finding she had not established irreparable harm. She then filed a motion for preliminary injunction on June 10, which the court similarly denied on July 30, 2025. In a detailed memorandum opinion, Judge Kelly concluded that Perlmutter failed to demonstrate the \"genuinely extraordinary situation\" required under Sampson v. Murray for preliminary relief in government personnel cases. The court found that her temporary loss of a \"statutory right to function,\" her inability to perform statutory duties, and alleged institutional harms to the Library and Copyright Office did not constitute irreparable harm sufficient to warrant an injunction, particularly given the balance of equities and the government's traditional latitude in personnel matters.\n\nFollowing the denial of her preliminary injunction motion, Perlmutter filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit on July 31, 2025, and moved for an injunction pending appeal on August 4. Judge Kelly denied this motion as well on August 20, 2025, reiterating that she had not shown irreparable harm. The case remains pending with cross-motions for summary judgment scheduled for hearing on November 4, 2025, while the appeal proceeds in the D.C. Circuit under case number 25-5285.",
    "45143": "On April 20, 2023, the parents of a student and a school district employee filed this civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Sweetwater County School District #1 Board of Trustees and four individual district officials: the Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent/HR Director, Director of Student Services, and a high school principal. The parents were represented by private counsel from Bailey Stock Harmon Cottam Lopez LLP and the Child & Parental Rights Campaign.\n\nThe parents alleged violations of their fundamental parental rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and their right to free exercise of religion under the First Amendment. The mother, who was also employed as a math teacher in the district, additionally claimed violations of her free exercise and free speech rights under the First Amendment. The parents sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and monetary damages.\n\nThe case arose from the school district's implementation of two related policies. The first, termed the \"Preferred Names Policy,\" required district staff to address students by their preferred names and pronouns, including those associated with the opposite sex. The second, the \"Parent Concealment Policy,\" directed staff to withhold information about students' gender identity assertions from parents unless the student consented to disclosure. \n\nThe factual basis centered on the parents' 16-year-old daughter, who had experienced childhood trauma and was diagnosed with ADHD, PTSD, and symptoms of gender dysphoria, for which she was receiving treatment from a private counselor chosen by the parents. During the 2021-2022 school year, unbeknownst to the parents, their daughter requested to be treated as a boy with a male name and male pronouns at school, and asked that this information be concealed from her parents. District staff complied with these requests for over six months, deliberately using the student's legal name and female pronouns when communicating with parents while using male identifiers at school. The mother discovered this concealment only by accident in March 2022 during a conversation with teachers from her daughter's school. When the parents objected and directed the school to use their daughter's legal name and female pronouns, district officials stated they would continue following the student's wishes rather than the parents' directions.\n\nOn June 30, 2023, Judge Scott W. Skavdahl issued an order granting in part and denying in part the parents' motion for preliminary injunction. The court enjoined the district from preventing employees from responding to parents' inquiries about their children's requested names or pronouns and from requiring employees to lie about such requests, absent reasonable concerns of physical abuse or harm. However, the court denied the preliminary injunction as to other aspects of the policies.\n\nThe parents filed an amended complaint on July 20, 2023. On December 18, 2023, the court ruled on the defendants' motion to dismiss, holding that the parents could not proceed with claims for declaratory and injunctive relief on their parental rights and religious freedom claims but could pursue nominal and compensatory damages. The court dismissed the mother's free speech claim but allowed her free exercise claim as an employee to proceed.\n\nOn April 28, 2025, Judge Skavdahl granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims, dismissing the father from the action entirely and granting judgment in favor of defendants against the mother on all her claims. The court entered final judgment the same day. On May 23, 2025, the parents filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which assigned the case appeal number 25-8027.",
    "PH-IL-0002": "On May 10, 2016, seven current and former residents of the Alexander County Housing Authority filed a class action lawsuit against the housing authority and its current and former executive directors, alleging rampant racial discrimination and family status discrimination at the McBride and Elmwood public housing developments in Cairo, Illinois. The plaintiffs, represented by the Hughes Socol law firm and the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging violations of the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003. They sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and monetary damages. The case was assigned to Chief Judge Michael J. Reagan with referral to Magistrate Judge Reona J. Daly.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that ACHA engaged in a pattern and practice of segregating its public housing developments by race, with approximately 97% of McBride and Elmwood residents being African-American, while white households predominated in other ACHA developments including Connell Smith. This occurred despite African-Americans comprising only 36% of Alexander County's population and despite a 1974 Department of Justice lawsuit that had previously addressed ACHA's racial segregation. The complaint detailed severe maintenance failures at the predominantly African-American developments, including infestations of mice, roaches, and bedbugs; mold; and serious plumbing, heating, and electrical deficiencies, while the Connell Smith development was adequately maintained with security cameras and guards. The plaintiffs also alleged that ACHA prohibited families with children from living in certain developments to prevent African-American families from living in majority-white buildings. Supporting these allegations, on September 30, 2014, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development had issued findings that ACHA violated Title VI through intentional racial segregation at McBride and Elmwood, and HUD ultimately took over ACHA's operations in February 2016.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed three amended complaints between July 2016 and February 2017, ultimately expanding to 35 named plaintiffs while dropping initial rent overcharge claims to focus on the discrimination claims and adding state law claims for breach of residential leases, negligence, and willful and wanton conduct. The defendants were narrowed to ACHA, James Wilson (Executive Director from 1989-2013), and Martha Franklin (Executive Director from April 2013-January 2015), with defendants Thomas Upchurch and Joanne Pink voluntarily dismissed in September 2016 and January 2017. Settlement negotiations began in earnest in 2017, with multiple settlement conferences held before Magistrate Judge Daly between February and June 2017. During this period, counsel withdrew from representing three plaintiffs (LaTonya Lee, Denieshia Childress, and Coretta Cornelius) in April and May 2017 after being unable to maintain contact with them.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the represented plaintiffs filed a stipulation dismissing their claims against all defendants with prejudice and without costs, with each party bearing its own attorneys' fees. The three unrepresented plaintiffs failed to respond to court orders about proceeding with their claims, and on September 12, 2017, Chief Judge Reagan dismissed their claims for failure to prosecute and approved the voluntary dismissal of the represented plaintiffs' claims, closing the case without trial.",
    "16518": "In September 2017, the United States Department of Justice initiated an investigation of the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice's Broad River Road Complex (BRRC), the state's long-term secure facility for adjudicated youth, under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. The investigation, conducted by the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Carolina, examined whether the facility failed to protect youth from violence and subjected them to prolonged isolation.\n\nFollowing extensive document review, facility tours, and interviews with staff and youth, DOJ issued findings letters in February 2020 and April 2022 concluding there was reasonable cause to believe BRRC violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The investigation found a pattern of constitutional violations including failure to protect youth from youth-on-youth violence, excessive force by staff, and punitive and prolonged isolation. Between July 2018 and May 2019, the facility averaged just over 100 youth but reported 134 fights and 71 assaults resulting in 99 injuries. Staff used dangerous tactics including choking, punching, and applying excessive restraints, often in response to verbal non-compliance rather than physical threats. The facility routinely isolated youth for minor infractions such as using profanity or being \"out of place,\" with some youth spending 40-57% of their time in isolation cells—8x8 foot concrete rooms where youth remained alone 23 hours per day without meaningful education or programming.\n\nOn April 14, 2022, the United States filed suit against the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice seeking injunctive relief under 34 U.S.C. § 12601 to remedy the constitutional violations at BRRC. That same day, the parties filed a comprehensive settlement agreement and joint motion to dismiss. The settlement requires DJJ to implement substantial reforms over five years, including conducting a staffing study and implementing appropriate staffing patterns, improving video surveillance coverage, providing structured rehabilitative programming, establishing a positive behavior management system with assistance from consultants, revising use of force policies to limit force to situations of serious and immediate danger, restricting isolation to youth who pose serious and immediate danger after de-escalation efforts fail, creating specialized housing for vulnerable youth, and developing a quality assurance system to track and address incidents. A jointly-selected Subject Matter Expert will monitor compliance and provide reports every six months. The agreement allows for termination after five years if DJJ achieves and maintains substantial compliance for one year. Judge Mary Geiger Lewis granted the joint motion to dismiss on April 20, 2022, with the court retaining jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement if necessary.",
    "46815": "On May 21, 2025, a federal grand jury in the Middle District of Tennessee indicted Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia on two counts of human smuggling: conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v) and (B)(i), and illegal transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) and (B)(i). The second count arose from a November 30, 2022 traffic stop by Tennessee Highway Patrol where Abrego was driving a vehicle containing nine passengers.\n\nAbrego's arrest occurred under unusual circumstances. He had been living in the United States with his family for over a decade when he was removed to El Salvador on March 15, 2025. The United States Supreme Court subsequently found this removal improper in Noem v. Abrego Garcia, 145 S. Ct. 1017 (2025), and ordered the government to facilitate his return. Following his return and the indictment, federal authorities arrested Abrego on June 6, 2025.\n\nThe government immediately sought pretrial detention, arguing that the offenses involved minor victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(1)(E), that Abrego posed a serious flight risk, and that he presented a danger to the community. The government's case relied heavily on testimony from Homeland Security Agent Peter Joseph, who recounted statements from cooperating witnesses—including two men who were themselves involved in the alleged smuggling conspiracy and were closely related family members. These cooperators claimed Abrego transported undocumented individuals for payment of $1,000-$1,500 per trip as part of a smuggling business called \"Trans Express,\" and that he sometimes transported minors and brought his own children on smuggling trips. The government also presented evidence from the November 2022 traffic stop, including a handwritten roster suggesting one passenger might have been a minor, though the handwriting was ambiguous and could have indicated either a 2001 or 2007 birth year.\n\nMagistrate Judge Barbara D. Holmes held extensive hearings on June 13, 2025, and issued a detailed 51-page opinion on June 22, 2025, denying the government's detention motion. The court found the government failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that the case involved minor victims, noting significant reliability problems with the cooperating witnesses' testimony—including their substantial incentives to cooperate (early release from prison, deferred deportation) and evolving statements that grew more incriminating over time. The court also found insufficient evidence of flight risk or danger to the community.\n\nThe government appealed to District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr., seeking revocation of the release order. After additional briefing and an evidentiary hearing on July 16, 2025, where Agent Joseph provided supplemental testimony, Judge Crenshaw issued a 37-page opinion on July 23, 2025. While finding the government had shown by a preponderance that the crimes involved minor victims (entitling it to a detention hearing), the court agreed with the magistrate judge that the government failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that Abrego posed such a danger that no conditions could ensure community safety, or by a preponderance that he was likely to flee.\n\nAbrego was initially represented by the Federal Public Defender's office (Dumaka Shabazz, William Allensworth, and Richard Tennent) but later retained private counsel, including attorneys Sean Hecker, Jenna Dabbs, and David Patton appearing pro hac vice, with local counsel Rascoe Dean. On August 19, 2025, the defense filed a motion to dismiss for vindictive and selective prosecution, arguing Abrego was targeted for prosecution in retaliation for his successful Supreme Court challenge to his removal. On August 22, 2025, the court issued a release order with extensive conditions, including location monitoring, travel restrictions to Maryland and necessary trips to Tennessee, and supervision by a third-party custodian. Trial is scheduled for January 27, 2026, before Judge Crenshaw.",
    "46755": "On July 1, 2025, three city governments (Columbus, Baltimore, and Chicago), along with Doctors for America (a nonprofit organization of over 27,000 physicians and medical trainees) and Main Street Alliance (a network of approximately 30,000 small businesses), filed suit against Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in his capacity as Secretary of Health and Human Services, HHS, Mehmet Oz as CMS Administrator, and CMS. The plaintiffs, represented by Democracy Forward Foundation, challenged the \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Rule\" published on June 25, 2025, which was set to take effect on August 25, 2025.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought their challenge under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that multiple provisions of the Rule were both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious. The Rule purported to address fraudulent and improper enrollments in ACA marketplace plans that had allegedly increased during the temporary expansion of subsidies during COVID-19. However, CMS acknowledged that the Rule would cause at least 1.8 million Americans to lose health coverage in 2026 alone.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or, alternatively, a preliminary injunction to prevent the Rule from taking effect. They challenged nine specific provisions, including: a $5 monthly surcharge on certain low-income enrollees who are automatically re-enrolled; changes to premium adjustment methodology that would increase out-of-pocket costs; expansion of permitted actuarial value variations that would reduce plan coverage; allowing insurers to deny coverage to applicants with past-due premiums; reinstating a one-year failure-to-reconcile tax credit penalty; and various income verification requirements that would create barriers to enrollment.\n\nFollowing a hearing on August 14, 2025, Judge Brendan A. Hurson issued a memorandum opinion and order on August 22, 2025, granting in part and denying in part the motion for stay. The court found that the plaintiffs had standing based on increased costs and uncompensated care they would face from increased uninsured populations. On the merits, the court found plaintiffs likely to succeed on seven of their nine challenges. Specifically, the court held that HHS lacked statutory authority to impose the $5 fee on otherwise fully-subsidized plans and to create a new exception to the guaranteed-issue requirement for past-due premiums. The court also found arbitrary and capricious the failure-to-reconcile provision, special enrollment period verification requirements, certain income verification procedures, and the expansion of actuarial value variations. However, the court denied relief on challenges to the premium adjustment methodology changes and the elimination of a 60-day extension for income verification.\n\nThe court stayed the effective date of the seven challenged provisions it found likely unlawful, determining that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm from implementation including small businesses being forced to close and cities bearing increased uncompensated care costs. The stay applies nationwide pending final resolution on the merits, with the court rejecting the government's request to limit relief only to the plaintiffs. The two provisions not stayed were permitted to go into effect as scheduled.\n\nThe case represents a continuation of litigation over ACA implementation, with Judge Hurson noting that similar challenges to similar provisions had been brought successfully by some of the same city plaintiffs in City of Columbus v. Cochran in 2021, where Judge Chasanow had vacated comparable income verification requirements as arbitrary and capricious.",
    "46576": "On April 10, 2025, sixteen states, the District of Columbia, and the Governor of Pennsylvania filed suit against the U.S. Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for liquidating COVID-19 education relief funds. The plaintiffs, represented by their state attorneys general, brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act alleging the Department's actions were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.\n\nThe dispute centers on Education Stabilization Fund grants totaling over $50 billion that Congress appropriated through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. These funds supported three programs—the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief program, the Homeless Children and Youth program, and the Emergency Assistance to Nonpublic Schools program—designed to address pandemic-related educational impacts including lost instructional time, students' social and emotional needs, and infrastructure improvements like ventilation systems. While the funds had to be obligated by September 30, 2024, federal regulations allowed 120 additional days for liquidation and permitted the Department to grant extensions \"when justified.\"\n\nBetween late 2023 and early 2025, well after the federal government declared the COVID-19 pandemic over in May 2023, the Department granted the plaintiff states extensions to liquidate their funds through March 2026. The states relied on these extensions to budget for programs, hire staff, and enter into contracts for services and construction projects. On March 28, 2025, at 5:03 PM, Secretary McMahon sent a letter rescinding all extensions effective immediately—technically three minutes earlier at 5:00 PM—stating that extending deadlines for COVID-related grants \"years after the COVID pandemic ended is not consistent with the Department's priorities.\" The letter indicated states could apply for project-specific extensions but provided no advance warning of the blanket rescission.\n\nJudge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District of New York granted a preliminary injunction on May 6, 2025, enjoining enforcement of the March 28 letter and requiring fourteen days' notice before any modification of liquidation periods. After the Department issued a new letter on May 11 giving fourteen days' notice that extensions would terminate on May 25, the court issued a second preliminary injunction on June 3, extending the notice requirement to thirty days and directing the Department to process pending payment requests without delay.\n\nThe Department immediately appealed and sought an emergency stay from the Second Circuit. On June 20, 2025, a three-judge panel denied the stay request, with Judge Park dissenting. The majority found the district court likely had jurisdiction despite the government's Tucker Act arguments, distinguishing the Supreme Court's recent decision in Department of Education v. California. The court also found the states had shown likelihood of success on the merits because the Department failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its change in position and did not meaningfully consider the states' reliance interests. The panel noted that states had already begun experiencing harms including employee layoffs, halted construction projects, and disrupted student services, while the government had not shown it would be irreparably harmed or unable to recover funds if it ultimately prevailed.\n\nThe case remains pending in district court, with the preliminary injunctions in effect requiring the Department to maintain the previously approved extension periods during the litigation and provide thirty days' notice before attempting any modifications.",
    "46637": "On May 27, 2025, National Public Radio and three Colorado public radio stations filed suit challenging Executive Order 14290, \"Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,\" issued by President Trump on May 1, 2025. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Zansberg Beylkin LLC. They sued the President, various Cabinet officials, and federal agencies including the Office of Management and Budget, Department of Treasury, National Endowment for the Arts, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The case was assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss.\n\nThe Executive Order directs CPB to terminate all direct and indirect funding to NPR and PBS, and instructs federal agencies to do the same. The Order explicitly states this action is being taken because NPR and PBS do not \"present a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.\" The Order further prohibits local public radio stations from using federal funds to acquire NPR programming, requiring CPB to revise its eligibility criteria to implement these restrictions by June 30, 2025. The accompanying White House fact sheet characterized NPR's content as \"left-wing propaganda\" and criticized specific editorial decisions, including coverage of COVID-19 origins and the Hunter Biden laptop story.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert equitable causes of action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief based on violations of the First Amendment's prohibitions against viewpoint discrimination and retaliation, the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and multiple federal statutes. Most significantly, they argue the Order violates the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which expressly prohibits \"any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States\" from exercising \"any direction, supervision, or control\" over CPB or its grantees. The Act requires CPB to distribute funds based on neutral criteria and designates NPR as the entity managing the Public Radio Satellite System, which serves 379 stations and enables emergency alerts to reach 99 percent of Americans.\n\nNPR produces and distributes programming to 246 independent member stations nationwide, receiving approximately $100 million annually (31 percent of its operating revenue) through membership and licensing fees from these stations. The local member station plaintiffs—Aspen Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio, and KSUT Public Radio—each receive CPB Community Service Grants ranging from $210,000 to $1.4 million annually, representing between 6 and 19 percent of their budgets. Under statutory requirements, a portion of these grants must be used to acquire nationally distributed programming.\n\nFollowing the Order's issuance, the National Endowment for the Arts terminated two grants to NPR effective May 31, 2025, though both grants had been fully paid in February 2025. CPB issued a public statement asserting it would not comply with the Order, maintaining that as a private corporation it is not subject to presidential authority. In response, the Administration has attempted to remove three of CPB's five board members, leading to separate litigation (CPB v. Trump, No. 25-cv-1305). On July 14, 2025, CPB issued a Request for Proposals seeking a new entity to replace NPR as manager of the Public Radio Satellite System.\n\nBoth parties filed motions for summary judgment, with plaintiffs filing on June 13, 2025, and federal defendants filing a cross-motion on July 12, 2025. The federal defendants argue primarily that the claims are not ripe because CPB has not yet terminated funding, and that the government has broad discretion in making funding decisions. Plaintiffs counter that they are already suffering First Amendment injuries from the Order's chilling effect on their speech and that the Order clearly violates both statutory prohibitions and constitutional protections against viewpoint-based discrimination and retaliation for protected speech. Additionally, Congress recently enacted the President's rescission request eliminating CPB funding for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, though funding for fiscal year 2025 and satellite interconnection purposes remains. The case remains pending before Judge Moss.",
    "46340": "On April 3, 2025, six federal employee unions filed suit challenging Executive Order 14251, issued by President Trump on March 27, 2025. The plaintiffs are the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest federal employee union representing approximately 800,000 workers; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United (NNOC/NNU); Service Employees International Union (SEIU); National Association of Government Employees (NAGE); and National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE). They are represented by union counsel and the private firms Bredhoff & Kaiser PLLC and Feinberg, Jackson, Worthman & Wasow, LLP. The unions sued President Trump in his official capacity, along with dozens of federal departments, agencies, and their heads.\n\nThe Executive Order invoked 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) to exclude over 40 cabinet departments, agencies, and subdivisions from the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute's collective bargaining requirements, purportedly based on national security considerations. The order excluded entire cabinet-level departments for the first time in history, including the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, Veterans Affairs, and Energy, as well as agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and General Services Administration. The exclusions affected approximately two-thirds of the federal workforce. A White House Fact Sheet accompanying the order stated that \"hostile Federal unions\" had \"declared war on President Trump's agenda\" and that the \"largest Federal union\" (AFGE) was \"fighting back\" against Trump. The Fact Sheet concluded that \"President Trump supports constructive partnerships with unions who work with him\" but \"will not tolerate\" opposition.\n\nThe unions alleged violations of the First Amendment based on retaliation and viewpoint discrimination, claiming the order was issued in response to their lawsuits against and public criticism of the Trump administration. They also alleged the President acted ultra vires by exceeding his statutory authority, violated Fifth Amendment procedural due process by not providing notice or opportunity to rebut the national security determinations, abrogated property rights in collective bargaining agreements, and violated equal protection principles.\n\nOn April 7, 2025, the unions moved for a temporary restraining order, which Judge James Donato of the Northern District of California denied on April 8, finding insufficient immediacy. The motion was converted to one for preliminary injunction. After briefing and a June 18, 2025 hearing, Judge Donato granted the preliminary injunction on June 24, 2025 (2025 WL 1755442). The court found the unions had raised serious questions under the First Amendment, citing the White House Fact Sheet's hostile statements toward unions as evidence of retaliatory intent. The court also found the unions demonstrated irreparable harm through loss of dues revenue (AFGE suffered an 82% reduction in allotted dues), staff layoffs, and loss of collective bargaining rights. The court ordered defendants to post a $60,000 bond and scheduled further proceedings.\n\nThe government filed a notice of appeal on June 26, 2025, and sought emergency stays from both the district court and the Ninth Circuit. Judge Donato denied the stay request on July 8, 2025. However, the Ninth Circuit granted an administrative stay on July 10, 2025, and ultimately granted the government's motion for a stay pending appeal on August 1, 2025. The appellate court found the government had shown it would likely succeed on the merits and would suffer irreparable harm absent a stay, determining that even assuming some retaliatory animus, the President would have issued the order regardless based on national security concerns.\n\nRelated litigation includes similar challenges to the Executive Order filed in other jurisdictions, including NTEU v. Trump and American Foreign Service Ass'n v. Trump in the D.C. District Court, both of which resulted in preliminary injunctions that were subsequently stayed by the D.C. Circuit. Additionally, on the same night the Executive Order was issued, multiple federal agencies filed suit against AFGE-affiliated local unions in the Western District of Texas seeking declarations that they could terminate collective bargaining agreements pursuant to the order.",
    "46805": "On July 21, 2025, twenty-three nonprofit organizations filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island challenging new conditions that the Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Health and Human Services (HHS) imposed on federal grant programs. The plaintiffs include state domestic violence and sexual assault coalitions, along with organizations providing services to homeless individuals and families. They sued Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his capacity as HHS Secretary, Scott Turner as HUD Secretary, and several federal agencies and their officials. The plaintiffs are represented by a coalition of legal organizations including the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island, the Lawyers' Committee for Rhode Island, Democracy Forward Foundation, the National Women's Law Center, and private counsel.\n\nThe case arose from a series of executive orders issued by President Trump in January 2025 targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, transgender rights, and abortion access. Following these orders, HUD and HHS began imposing new conditions on grant recipients. The HUD conditions, applied to Continuum of Care grants and other programs administered by the Office of Community Planning and Development, prohibit recipients from using grant funds to promote \"gender ideology,\" require certification that recipients do not operate programs violating federal antidiscrimination laws, prohibit funding or promoting \"elective abortions,\" and mandate compliance with all current executive orders. The HHS conditions, incorporated through revised grant policy statements and standard terms, require recipients to certify they do not operate programs that advance or promote DEI, DEIA (diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility), or \"discriminatory equity ideology\" in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws. Additionally, some HHS grants require certification of compliance with Title IX as interpreted through the administration's \"gender ideology\" executive order.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act alleging that the agencies exceeded their statutory authority, acted contrary to law, failed to follow required procedures, and acted arbitrarily and capriciously. They also raised constitutional claims under the First Amendment (arguing the conditions restrict protected speech and compel government-approved viewpoints), the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (arguing the conditions are unconstitutionally vague), the Spending Clause, and separation of powers principles. The complaint emphasizes that the new conditions conflict with existing statutory requirements, particularly those directing grant recipients to serve underserved populations including racial and ethnic minorities and LGBTQ+ individuals, and with existing regulations requiring grantees to treat individuals according to their gender identity.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue these conditions place them in an impossible position: either accept the conditions and risk False Claims Act liability while abandoning core aspects of their missions, or refuse the funding and cease critical services to domestic violence survivors, sexual assault victims, and homeless individuals. The complaint details how the administration explicitly plans to use the False Claims Act as a \"weapon\" against organizations that engage in disfavored DEI activities, with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announcing a \"Civil Rights Fraud Initiative\" targeting federal funding recipients.\n\nOn July 24, 2025, Judge Melissa R. DuBose held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order. On July 28, the court granted the TRO, enjoining HUD from enforcing the challenged conditions on Continuum of Care grants for certain plaintiffs and enjoining HHS from enforcing the anti-DEI certification requirement on Family Violence Prevention Services Act State Domestic Violence Coalition grants for certain plaintiffs. The court found that plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and would suffer immediate and irreparable harm without relief. The TRO has been amended several times to include additional plaintiffs and grant programs, most recently on August 20, 2025, to include Community Development Block Grants.\n\nThe defendants filed notices of compliance with the TRO, and the parties have briefed a motion for preliminary injunction scheduled for hearing on September 4, 2025. The plaintiffs seek to stay the challenged policies under 5 U.S.C. § 705 and to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of all the new conditions pending resolution of the case. The case remains in active litigation with no settlement discussions reported.",
    "46375": "On April 9, 2025, the Southern Education Foundation (SEF), represented by private counsel, filed suit against the U.S. Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon in her official capacity, and President Donald J. Trump in his official capacity, challenging the termination of a federal grant. The case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman.\n\nSEF is a nonprofit organization founded in 1867 that has worked for over 150 years to advance equitable education in the South, including supporting the legal team in Brown v. Board of Education. In October 2022, the Department of Education awarded SEF a five-year, $8.6 million grant to operate the Equity Assistance Center for the southern region (EAC-South) under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which authorizes technical assistance for public school desegregation. EAC-South serves Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and the District of Columbia—a region containing 130 of the 132 open federal school desegregation cases nationwide. The grant was EAC-South's sole source of funding.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14151 directing federal agencies to terminate \"equity-related\" grants and programs. On February 13, 2025, the Department sent SEF a termination letter stating that the grant \"provides funding for programs that promote or take part in DEI initiatives\" that allegedly violate federal civil rights laws. The termination was immediate and without prior notice or opportunity to respond. The Department used identical boilerplate language in terminating multiple education grants. While the letter offered an administrative appeal process, SEF withdrew its appeal on May 16, 2025.\n\nSEF brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act alleging the termination was arbitrary and capricious and violated required procedures, as well as claims under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (vagueness), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the First Amendment (viewpoint discrimination), and ultra vires impoundment of congressionally appropriated funds. SEF sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to reinstate the grant.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, SEF filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. After oral argument on May 12, 2025, Judge Friedman granted the preliminary injunction on May 21, 2025, finding SEF was likely to succeed on the merits of its APA claim that the termination was arbitrary and capricious. The court found the Department provided no reasoned explanation for the termination, conducted no individualized assessment of EAC-South's programming, and failed to articulate any rational connection between facts found and the termination decision. The court also found SEF would suffer irreparable harm from loss of funding that threatened EAC-South's existence and ability to assist school districts with desegregation compliance. The court ordered the Department to reinstate the grant within five business days.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, where the case is docketed as No. 25-5262.",
    "46284": "On March 24, 2025, Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old lawful permanent resident and Columbia University junior, filed a complaint and petition for writ of habeas corpus against federal officials including President Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and other immigration officials in their official capacities. The case, assigned to Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in the Southern District of New York, challenges the government's attempt to deport Ms. Chung in retaliation for her participation in campus protests related to Palestinian rights. Ms. Chung is represented by a team of attorneys including the CLEAR Project at CUNY School of Law, Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel LLP, Human Rights First, and other legal organizations.\n\nMs. Chung came to the United States from South Korea at age seven with her family and became a lawful permanent resident in 2021. Since 2023, she participated in various campus protests at Columbia University concerning Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the university's disciplinary measures against student protesters. On March 5, 2025, she was arrested at a protest outside Barnard College's Milstein building and charged with obstruction of governmental administration, a common misdemeanor charge during protests. The protest concerned the expulsion of three Barnard students for their involvement in Palestinian rights advocacy.\n\nWithin days of her arrest, federal immigration authorities began enforcement actions against Ms. Chung. ICE issued an administrative arrest warrant on March 8, 2025, and agents visited her parents' home seeking her on March 9. Government officials told Ms. Chung's attorneys that the Secretary of State had \"revoked\" her lawful permanent resident status, though they could not explain the legal authority for such action. On March 13, 2025, federal agents executed search warrants at Columbia University residences, including Ms. Chung's dormitory, ostensibly investigating the university for \"harboring\" noncitizens but apparently seeking to arrest Ms. Chung and another student.\n\nThe complaint alleges Ms. Chung's case is part of a broader government policy announced through executive orders and public statements to target noncitizen students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests. The government invoked the \"Foreign Policy Ground\" for deportation under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(4)(C), claiming that Secretary Rubio determined Ms. Chung's presence would have \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\" The complaint details similar enforcement actions against other students, including Mahmoud Khalil, another Columbia student and lawful permanent resident who was arrested on March 8, 2025, with high-level officials including President Trump publicly celebrating his arrest as targeting a \"Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student.\"\n\nMs. Chung brought claims under the First Amendment (retaliation and prior restraint), Fifth Amendment (due process violations), the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, the Accardi doctrine, and the non-delegation doctrine. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent her detention, transfer, and deportation.\n\nOn March 25, 2025, Judge Buchwald granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting the government from detaining or transferring Ms. Chung. The government filed a motion to dismiss on April 11, 2025, arguing primarily jurisdictional grounds. After oral arguments on May 29 and June 5, 2025, the court granted Ms. Chung's motion for a preliminary injunction and partially denied the government's motion to dismiss. The preliminary injunction continues to prohibit the government from arresting, detaining, or transferring Ms. Chung, and requires 72 hours' notice if the government seeks to detain her on any basis other than the Foreign Policy Ground, to allow the court to assess whether such action would constitute First Amendment retaliation.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, the government filed a notice of interlocutory appeal to the Second Circuit, challenging the court's jurisdiction. The government indicated it would not seek to expedite the appeal or stay the preliminary injunction. As of the last docket entry, the appeal remains pending, with the preliminary injunction still in effect protecting Ms. Chung from immigration enforcement actions.",
    "46735": "On June 20, 2025, the Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools filed suit against Linda McMahon in her official capacity as Secretary of Education, the U.S. Department of Education, and Donald J. Trump in his official capacity as President, represented by the private law firm Himes, Petrarca & Fester, Chtd. The School District sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief based on violations of the First Amendment's free speech protections, the Fifth Amendment's due process clause, the Spending Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act, as well as ultra vires claims.\n\nThe case arose from the School District's receipt of a $6 million federal mental health grant distributed over five years under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which Congress passed in 2022 following the Uvalde school shooting to expand mental health services in schools. The Act appropriated $1 billion over five years for mental health supports in schools. After taking office, President Trump issued multiple executive orders targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. On February 14, 2025, the Department of Education issued a Dear Colleague Letter threatening schools with loss of federal funding if they continued DEI programs, though the letter failed to define key terms like \"diversity,\" \"equity,\" or \"inclusion.\" The Department also established an \"End DEI\" complaint portal for reporting alleged discrimination in schools.\n\nOn April 29, 2025, the Department issued a Notice of Non-Continuation of Grant Award to the School District, stating the mental health programs violated federal civil rights law, conflicted with the Department's priorities of merit and excellence in education, undermined student well-being, or constituted inappropriate use of federal funds. The School District had already received $3,605,500 of the grant through December 2025 and was entitled to an additional $2,394,500 through 2027. The grant funding had enabled the School District to hire seven additional mental health professionals, establish wellness rooms that served 830 students (40% of enrollment), reduce bullying reports by 30%, decrease disruptive behavior incidents, and provide 24/7 mental health support through a mobile app. The School District did not seek administrative reconsideration of the non-continuation decision.\n\nThe School District filed a motion for temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction on June 23, 2025. Judge William P. Johnson of the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico held a hearing on July 16, 2025, where the School District presented witness testimony about the irreparable harm from loss of funding. On July 18, 2025, Judge Johnson denied the motion for preliminary injunction and dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. The court concluded that the dispute was essentially a contract claim over grant funding that belonged in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, not in district court. The court found that even though the School District framed its claims as constitutional and statutory violations, the essence of the suit was seeking payment of grant money. The court also found the School District unlikely to succeed on the merits of its First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Spending Clause, ultra vires, and APA claims, and that irreparable harm was not established since money damages could remedy any injury.",
    "46342": "On April 4, 2025, the Association for Education Finance and Policy, Inc. (a nonprofit membership organization of education scholars and practitioners) and the Institute for Higher Education Policy (a nonprofit research organization focused on postsecondary education access) filed suit against Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and the U.S. Department of Education. The case concerns the termination of multiple research and data collection programs at the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), a semi-independent agency within the Department of Education established by the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 to conduct education research and compile statistics.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges specific agency actions taken beginning in February 2025 to terminate IES programs. On February 10, 2025, the Department began canceling numerous IES contracts, terminating studies including the 2020/25 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 2022, and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten 2024. The Department also terminated IES's peer review program for new grant funding and halted processing of applications for access to restricted-use research data. On March 11, 2025, Secretary McMahon announced a reduction-in-force affecting approximately 90% of IES staff positions. These actions were taken, according to agency declarations, at the urging of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging the terminations were contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious. They argued that the Department violated multiple statutory provisions requiring IES to conduct specific research activities and disseminate data. The Institute for Higher Education Policy also alleged unreasonable delay in processing its pending requests for disclosure risk review of research using restricted-use data. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore the terminated programs and enjoin further dismantling of IES operations.\n\nThe case is before Judge Trevor N. McFadden. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from Public Citizen Litigation Group. The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on April 17, 2025, seeking immediate restoration of the terminated programs and staff. Following briefing and oral argument on May 16, 2025, Judge McFadden denied the preliminary injunction motion in a memorandum opinion issued June 3, 2025.\n\nIn denying relief, the court held that the plaintiffs' claims constituted impermissible \"programmatic\" challenges under Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation. The court found that the plaintiffs had improperly bundled together multiple discrete agency actions and sought \"wholesale correction\" of agency operations rather than challenging specific, circumscribed decisions. The court reasoned that while individual contract terminations or program cancellations might be separately challengeable, packaging them together to seek broad relief amounted to requesting \"general judicial review of [the Institute's] day-to-day operations,\" which exceeds the APA's scope. The court also rejected the plaintiffs' constitutional separation of powers claims, finding they merely repackaged the statutory APA arguments.\n\nFollowing the denial of preliminary relief, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on July 16, 2025, narrowing their claims to six specific program terminations and the disclosure risk review delay. As of August 19, 2025, the defendants have a pending renewed motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.\n\nThe underlying facts show that the challenged programs involved long-term longitudinal studies tracking students from early childhood through postsecondary education, with some studies having collected data for multiple years before termination. The plaintiffs and their members rely on this data for research, policy analysis, and publications related to education finance and policy. The terminations occurred without consultation with stakeholders and, according to the plaintiffs, will result in the loss of data already collected and waste of millions in appropriated funds.",
    "46322": "On March 31, 2025, three groups of civil rights and political organizations filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging Executive Order 14,248, issued by President Trump on March 25, 2025. The plaintiffs include the League of United Latin American Citizens, Secure Families Initiative, and Arizona Students' Association (the \"LULAC Plaintiffs\"), represented by the Campaign Legal Center and State Democracy Defenders Fund; the League of Women Voters and several other voting rights organizations (the \"League Plaintiffs\"), represented by the ACLU and other counsel; and the Democratic National Committee, other Democratic Party organizations, and congressional leaders Charles Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries (the \"Democratic Party Plaintiffs\"), represented by private counsel. The three cases were consolidated before Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought ultra vires claims alleging that the President exceeded his constitutional and statutory authority by attempting to unilaterally regulate federal elections. They argued that the Executive Order violated the separation of powers by usurping authority that the Constitution's Elections Clause (Article I, Section 4) reserves to Congress and the States, not the President. The challenged provisions included Section 2(a), which directed the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to require documentary proof of citizenship on the federal voter registration form; Section 2(d), which ordered federal agencies to assess citizenship before providing voter registration forms to public assistance recipients; Section 2(b), which directed agencies to share databases to identify non-citizen voters; and Sections 7(a) and 7(b), which directed enforcement of ballot receipt deadlines. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to prevent implementation of these provisions.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed motions for preliminary injunction on April 7, 2025, arguing that the Executive Order would make it more difficult for eligible citizens to register to vote, particularly those lacking passports or other specified documents. Many of the plaintiff organizations conduct voter registration drives and provide registration assistance, while the Democratic Party Plaintiffs asserted competitive harm to their electoral prospects. The organizations demonstrated that many eligible voters, including students, military families, and naturalized citizens, often lack easy access to the narrow forms of documentary proof specified in the Executive Order.\n\nAfter briefing and a hearing on April 17, 2025, Judge Kollar-Kotelly issued her decision on April 24, 2025. The court granted preliminary injunctive relief as to Sections 2(a) and 2(d), finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their separation-of-powers claims. The court held that neither the Constitution nor any statute grants the President authority to dictate the contents of the federal voter registration form or to direct agencies to assess citizenship before providing registration forms, as these powers belong to Congress and the States. The court emphasized that while Congress was currently debating legislation that would implement similar requirements through the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, the President could not short-circuit the legislative process by executive order.\n\nThe court denied relief as to Sections 2(b), 7(a), and 7(b), finding those challenges either premature or more properly brought by the States themselves. The court noted that several states had already filed separate challenges to these provisions in Massachusetts and Washington federal courts. The preliminary injunction prohibits the EAC and its officials from modifying the federal voter registration form to require documentary proof of citizenship, and prohibits the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Interior, and Small Business Administration from implementing the citizenship assessment requirement for public assistance recipients.\n\nThe Republican National Committee successfully moved to intervene as a defendant on June 12, 2025. Discovery and summary judgment briefing are currently underway, with the parties filing cross-motions for partial summary judgment on the Section 2(a) claims in July and August 2025. The court did not require the plaintiffs to post an injunction bond, finding that the defendants had not shown they would suffer material harm from the preliminary injunction and that requiring a bond might deter legitimate challenges to executive action.",
    "46510": "On April 28, 2025, four state Head Start associations (Washington, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Pennsylvania) and two parent-led organizations (Family Forward Oregon and Parent Voices Oakland) filed suit against Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other federal officials to prevent the dismantling of the Head Start program. The plaintiffs are represented by the ACLU and private counsel including Crowell & Moring, Impact Fund, Feldesman Leifer, and Hoq Law. The case is before Judge Ricardo S. Martinez in the Western District of Washington.\n\nHead Start, created by Congress in 1965 as an outgrowth of the Civil Rights Movement, provides comprehensive early education, health, nutrition, and family support services to low-income children nationwide. The program serves approximately 800,000 children through 1,600 local agencies, with federal funds covering at least 80% of program costs. Congress appropriated $12.27 billion for Head Start in fiscal year 2024, with the same amount continuing through fiscal year 2025. The Head Start Act requires agencies to meet the diverse needs of their communities, including providing linguistically and culturally appropriate services and ensuring at least 10% enrollment of children with disabilities.\n\nBeginning in January 2025, the Trump administration launched a series of actions to eliminate the program. On March 14, 2025, the Administration for Children and Families issued a letter threatening funding consequences for agencies that \"promote\" or \"take part\" in any \"diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.\" On April 1, 2025, HHS abruptly closed half of its regional Head Start offices and laid off 60% of Office of Head Start staff, leaving agencies in 23 states without necessary support. On April 16, 2025, HHS amended its grants policy to require agencies to certify they do not \"advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology,\" with violations potentially triggering funding clawbacks and False Claims Act liability. An April 10, 2025 OMB memorandum stated that the President's budget \"does not fund Head Start\" and directed HHS to work on closing out the program. Between January 20 and April 16, 2025, HHS disbursed nearly $1 billion less in Head Start spending compared to the same period the previous year.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege these actions violate the Constitution's Separation of Powers and Spending Clause by usurping Congress's exclusive authority over federal spending, violate the Fifth Amendment as unconstitutionally vague, violate the First Amendment by suppressing protected speech, and violate the Administrative Procedure Act as arbitrary and capricious agency action contrary to the Head Start Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The vague DEI ban places agencies in an impossible position: they must either refuse to comply and lose federal funding, or attempt to comply and violate their statutory obligations to provide culturally appropriate services and include children with disabilities. The mass staff cuts have created what the Acting Director of the Office of Head Start acknowledged were \"major holes\" in the agency's ability to administer the program.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the dismantling of Head Start. They filed a motion for preliminary injunction on May 16, 2025, followed by a motion for temporary restraining order on July 21, 2025. On August 8, 2025, the court deemed the TRO motion moot based on defendants' stipulation and converted it to a preliminary injunction motion, setting a hearing for September 9, 2025. The court granted plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint on August 19, 2025.\n\nThe impacts have been immediate and severe. At least one Head Start program, Inspire Development Centers in Sunnyside, Washington, was forced to suspend services after receiving no information about funding renewal, leaving 400 children without care and over 70 staff without jobs. Many other programs have been days away from closure, unable to access funds or obtain necessary approvals. The plaintiffs' members report being unable to recruit and retain staff amid the uncertainty, having to change core program components to attempt compliance with the vague DEI ban, and facing the loss of essential services for children with disabilities, dual language learners, and families experiencing homelessness. Parents and caregivers who rely on Head Start face loss of childcare that would force them to leave work or school, with disproportionate impacts on women and particularly women of color.",
    "46734": "On May 29, 2025, eleven Roman Catholic clergy members—including the Archbishop of Seattle, the Bishops of Yakima and Spokane, and several priests from those dioceses—filed suit in federal court challenging Washington Senate Bill 5375 on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds. The plaintiffs are represented by a team of private attorneys from Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, local counsel, and religious liberty organizations including the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and First Liberty Institute. They sued the Governor of Washington, the Attorney General, and all county prosecutors in their official capacities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nThe case centers on SB 5375, signed into law on May 2, 2025 and set to take effect July 27, 2025, which adds clergy to Washington's list of mandatory reporters for child abuse and neglect while explicitly removing their ability to invoke privileged communication defenses. The law requires priests to report suspected abuse even when learned through the Sacrament of Confession. Under Catholic doctrine spanning 2,000 years, the \"sacramental seal\" absolutely forbids priests from revealing anything heard in confession, and direct violation results in automatic excommunication. The plaintiffs face a choice between violating their faith—risking eternal damnation—or violating state law and facing up to 364 days in jail and $5,000 in fines.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that SB 5375 is unconstitutional and permanent injunctive relief preventing its enforcement. They argue the law violates the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment by targeting religious practice while exempting comparable secular conduct, as well as the Equal Protection Clause by discriminating based on religion. The plaintiffs note that Washington simultaneously passed Substitute House Bill 1171, which restored attorney-client privilege protections for lawyers at universities regarding child abuse reporting, while denying similar protections to clergy.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent SB 5375 from taking effect as applied to confessional communications. The United States moved to intervene on June 23, 2025, asserting that SB 5375 violates equal protection by infringing on fundamental religious rights and discriminating based on religion. The Attorney General certified the case as being of general public importance, establishing the United States' statutory right to intervene under 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2. The intervention was granted on July 15, 2025.\n\nOn July 18, 2025, Judge David G. Estudillo of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington granted the preliminary injunction, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on their Free Exercise claim. The court held that SB 5375 is neither neutral nor generally applicable because it treats religious activity less favorably than comparable secular activity and cannot survive strict scrutiny. The injunction prohibits enforcement of SB 5375 regarding the Sacrament of Confession against all Roman Catholic priests in Washington who fall under the administration of the three bishop plaintiffs. The injunction remains in effect pending final judgment.\n\nDuring the litigation, all county prosecutor defendants agreed not to oppose the preliminary injunction and to be bound by it in exchange for a stay of proceedings against them. The case continues against the Governor and Attorney General, who filed their answer on August 7, 2025. The court has indicated it may consolidate this case with a similar challenge filed by Orthodox Church plaintiffs.",
    "46678": "On June 9, 2025, the Governor of California and the State of California, represented by the California Attorney General's office, filed suit against President Donald Trump, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and the U.S. Department of Defense, challenging the federalization of California's National Guard. The case arose from immigration enforcement actions that began on June 6, 2025, when ICE conducted raids at multiple locations in Los Angeles County, including Home Depot stores, a donut shop, and a clothing wholesaler. The raids, which resulted in 70-80 people detained and 44 arrested, sparked protests that included both peaceful demonstrations and incidents of violence, with some protesters throwing objects at federal officers, damaging federal property, and setting fires.\n\nOn June 7, 2025, President Trump invoked 10 U.S.C. § 12406 to federalize the California National Guard, asserting that protests constituted \"a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\" Secretary Hegseth issued orders calling 2,000 California National Guard members into federal service for 60 days, followed by an additional 2,000 members on June 9, along with deployment of 700 Marines from Camp Pendleton. The orders were sent to California's Adjutant General rather than directly through Governor Newsom, who learned of the federalization only after it occurred and had not consented to it.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought ultra vires claims alleging that the federalization exceeded statutory authority because none of the three conditions required under § 12406 were met (foreign invasion, rebellion, or inability to execute laws with regular forces) and because the orders were not \"issued through the governors of the States\" as the statute requires. They also alleged violations of the Tenth Amendment, arguing the federalization infringed on state sovereignty and police powers, and raised concerns about violations of the Posse Comitatus Act if military forces engaged in civilian law enforcement.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief and filed for a temporary restraining order on June 10, 2025. Judge Charles R. Breyer of the Northern District of California held a hearing on June 12 and granted the TRO that same day, finding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits. The court concluded that no rebellion existed in Los Angeles, that the federal government remained able to execute its laws (as evidenced by ICE's continued arrests), and that the federalization orders were not properly issued through the governor. The TRO enjoined defendants from deploying California National Guard members in Los Angeles and ordered them to return control to Governor Newsom.\n\nDefendants immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit and sought an emergency stay. On June 19, 2025, a three-judge panel granted the stay pending appeal, disagreeing with the district court's analysis. The Ninth Circuit held that while the President's decision was subject to judicial review, it warranted substantial deference under longstanding precedent dating to Martin v. Mott (1827). The court found the President likely acted within his authority under § 12406(3) in determining he was \"unable with the regular forces to execute the laws,\" given the violence against federal officers and property. The court also found that transmitting orders through California's Adjutant General, who under state law can issue orders in the governor's name, likely satisfied the statutory requirement.\n\nMeanwhile, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction on June 16, 2025, with a hearing held June 20. Evidence indicated that federalized National Guard members were accompanying ICE agents during enforcement operations, holding secure perimeters in communities, and securing routes for immigration officers. The California National Guard units included members of specialized teams like Taskforce Rattlesnake (wildfire response) and the Counterdrug Taskforce (border drug interdiction), whose federalization for 60 days affected the state's emergency response capabilities. A bench trial on the preliminary injunction was scheduled for August 11-13, 2025. Throughout the proceedings, state and local law enforcement maintained they had sufficient resources to handle the protests, having made over 560 arrests, while the federal government argued that significant violence against federal officers and property damage justified the military deployment.",
    "46287": "On March 25, 2025, two labor unions representing faculty and academic professionals—the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers—filed suit challenging the termination of approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University. The plaintiffs, represented by private attorneys from Protect Democracy Project and Altshuler Berzon LLP, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against multiple federal agencies and officials, including the Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services, along with the National Institutes of Health and General Services Administration.\n\nThe case arose after President Trump issued an executive order on January 29, 2025, directing agencies to combat antisemitism on college campuses. Following reports of antisemitic incidents at Columbia since October 2023, including the occupation of Hamilton Hall and establishment of protest encampments, federal agencies began reviewing Columbia's compliance with civil rights obligations. On March 7, 2025, the agencies announced the immediate cancellation of approximately $400 million in grants and contracts to Columbia, citing the university's \"continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" The agencies terminated grants pursuant to regulatory provisions allowing termination when awards \"no longer effectuate program goals or agency priorities\" and contracts for \"convenience of the Government,\" rather than through Title VI enforcement procedures.\n\nOn March 13, 2025, federal officials sent Columbia a letter outlining nine demands as \"preconditions\" for any continued federal funding relationship, including requirements to expel certain students, abolish the University Judicial Board, ban masks intended to conceal identity, place the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies department under \"academic receivership,\" and reform admissions practices. Columbia responded on March 21 by announcing eighteen reforms, many of which it had been developing for months before receiving the federal demands.\n\nThe plaintiff unions brought ten claims under the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, Tenth Amendment, Spending Clause, Administrative Procedure Act, separation of powers doctrine, and unconstitutional conditions doctrine. They argued that the government violated Title VI's procedural requirements for terminating funding and unconstitutionally coerced Columbia to suppress protected speech and academic freedom. The government countered that it terminated funding pursuant to its discretionary authority under grant terms and regulations, not Title VI, and that plaintiffs lacked standing because they were neither parties to the grants nor intended beneficiaries.\n\nAfter briefing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction filed April 3, 2025, Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil of the Southern District of New York issued an opinion on June 16, 2025, denying the motion and dismissing the case without prejudice for lack of standing. The court found that the plaintiff unions failed to establish either organizational or representational standing, noting that the grants were awarded to Columbia, not to plaintiffs or their members, and that any injuries to faculty members were not fairly traceable to defendants' actions given Columbia's independent decision-making. The court observed that Columbia itself had not challenged the funding terminations and was instead negotiating with the government. The court also noted that the Supreme Court's recent decision in Department of Education v. California suggested that challenges to grant terminations belong in the Court of Federal Claims as contract claims rather than in district court.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on June 16, 2025. The case highlighted tensions between academic freedom concerns and efforts to combat campus antisemitism, while raising fundamental questions about standing requirements and the proper forum for challenging federal funding decisions.",
    "46580": "On May 7, 2025, seventeen states and the District of Columbia filed suit against the U.S. Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration challenging the agencies' freeze of $5 billion in congressionally appropriated funds for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The plaintiffs, represented by their respective attorneys general, sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act and constitutional separation of powers principles.\n\nCongress had established the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program through the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, appropriating $5 billion to be distributed to states between 2022 and 2026 according to a mandatory formula for building EV charging infrastructure. The statute required FHWA to issue guidance and states to submit deployment plans, which FHWA had approved for all plaintiff states for fiscal years 2022-2025. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14,154 directing all agencies to \"immediately pause the disbursement of funds\" from the Infrastructure Act, including NEVI funds. On February 6, 2025, FHWA implemented this directive by rescinding all NEVI guidance, revoking all previously approved state deployment plans, and prohibiting any new obligations of the approximately $2.74 billion in unobligated NEVI funds.\n\nThe plaintiff states alleged violations of the APA for exceeding statutory authority, arbitrary and capricious action, and failure to follow required procedures. They also raised constitutional claims under the separation of powers doctrine and Take Care Clause, arguing that the Executive Branch had improperly seized Congress's spending power. The states demonstrated concrete harms including canceled projects, withdrawn contractors, lost site agreements, budget disruptions, and reassignment of staff. Several states had already entered contracts and begun construction on charging stations when the funding freeze occurred.\n\nJudge Tana Lin heard oral argument on June 17, 2025, and issued a detailed order on June 24, 2025. The court found that defendants likely exceeded their statutory authority, as the Infrastructure Act mandated distribution of NEVI funds and provided only limited circumstances for withholding funds, none of which applied. The court also found the agency action arbitrary and capricious for failing to provide reasoned explanation or consider reliance interests, and determined that defendants violated separation of powers by refusing to spend congressionally appropriated funds based on policy disagreements. The court granted the preliminary injunction for fourteen states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin), ordering defendants to restore their state plans and cease withholding NEVI funds. The injunction was denied for the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont because they failed to submit declarations demonstrating irreparable harm. The court waived any bond requirement and stayed the injunction for seven days to allow for appeal.\n\nWhen defendants did not appeal, the injunction took effect on July 2, 2025. On July 23, 2025, the court granted a motion to intervene filed by several public interest organizations including Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council. The case is proceeding on the merits with dispositive motions scheduled for late August 2025.",
    "46259": "Eight students at Columbia University and Barnard College filed this First Amendment lawsuit on March 13, 2025, challenging what they characterize as a government campaign to suppress pro-Palestine speech on campus through unconstitutional \"jawboning\" - the practice of government officials coercing private parties to punish or suppress disfavored views. The lead plaintiff, Mahmoud Khalil, is named while the remaining seven students proceed under pseudonyms. They are represented by private counsel from Dratel & Lewis, the CAIR Legal Defense Fund, CAIR-New York, and attorney Jonathan Wallace.\n\nThe students sue three groups of defendants: Columbia University (including its Trustees and President Claire Shipman in her official capacity); the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce and its Chairman Tim Walberg; and five federal officials in their official capacities - Attorney General Pam Bondi, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, DOJ Taskforce to Combat Anti-Semitism head Leo Terrell, HHS Acting General Counsel Sean Keveney, and GSA Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum.\n\nThe lawsuit stems from events following the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel. The House Committee began investigating antisemitism on college campuses in February 2024, requesting extensive documents from Columbia and holding high-profile hearings. During an April 17, 2024 hearing, then-Columbia President Minouche Shafik testified before the Committee and promised to crack down on demonstrations the Committee deemed antisemitic. The next day, she called in the NYPD to clear a student encampment, resulting in 108 arrests. Two weeks later, protesters occupied Hamilton Hall, allegedly taking two janitors hostage and causing property damage. The Committee issued subpoenas to Columbia in August 2024, and on October 31, 2024, released a 325-page report that, despite redacting names, included enough detail about disciplinary cases that students could be identified.\n\nThe immediate catalyst for this lawsuit was the Committee's February 13, 2025 letter requesting all disciplinary records related to eleven specific campus incidents, and the federal government's March 2025 actions. On March 3, 2025, federal agencies announced they were reviewing Columbia's $5 billion in federal funding for Title VI compliance. On March 7, the administration announced it had \"canceled ~$400M in federal grants\" to Columbia. On March 13, agency officials issued a letter demanding Columbia implement specific policy changes as a \"precondition for formal negotiations\" about continued federal funding, including expelling students involved in certain protests, eliminating the faculty-run University Judicial Board, placing the Middle Eastern Studies department under \"academic receivership,\" banning masks at protests, and adopting the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Columbia announced compliance with several demands that same day.\n\nThe students assert three main claims under the First Amendment. First, they argue the Committee's records request violates their rights to free speech and association by seeking to expose and chill protected political expression. Second, they claim the federal agencies' funding threats constitute impermissible viewpoint discrimination and coercion. Third, they contend Columbia's compliance with these government demands makes it a state actor violating their First Amendment rights. They also bring a state law breach of contract claim against Columbia for violating its promises of free expression and academic freedom.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that the government's actions violate the First Amendment, permanent injunctions preventing Congress from compelling Columbia to provide disciplinary records and preventing the federal agencies from withholding funding to coerce viewpoint suppression, an injunction preventing Columbia from complying with these demands, and damages for records already disclosed to Congress.\n\nOn March 19, 2025, plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order. Judge Arun Subramanian held a hearing on March 25, and on April 4, 2025, denied the TRO without prejudice. The Court found that the Speech or Debate Clause acts as a jurisdictional bar to claims against Congressional defendants, that plaintiffs failed to establish standing or irreparable harm regarding the March 13 agency letter, and noted Columbia's representation that it had scrubbed personally identifying information from previously produced records. However, the Court ordered Columbia to provide thirty days' notice before furnishing any student records or identities to Congress.\n\nAfter filing a second amended complaint on April 18, 2025, all defendants moved to dismiss on May 23, 2025. The Congressional defendants argue the Speech or Debate Clause provides absolute immunity for their legislative investigation, that they are necessary parties who cannot be joined under Rule 19, and that sovereign immunity bars damages claims. The federal agency defendants argue plaintiffs lack standing, the government's Title VI enforcement actions are lawful, and no First Amendment violation occurred. Columbia argues it is not a state actor, was not coerced, and that its disciplinary processes and policy changes are lawful exercises of private institutional authority. On June 18, 2025, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the individual capacity claims against the federal officials without prejudice, maintaining only the official capacity claims.\n\nThe case involves complex constitutional questions about the limits of congressional investigative power, the scope of government authority to condition federal funding, and when private university actions become state action subject to constitutional constraints. According to the docket, lead plaintiff Mahmoud Khalil is currently detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Louisiana, with other students reporting harassment and threats related to their activism. A preliminary injunction motion filed June 20, 2025, remains pending alongside the motions to dismiss.",
    "46557": "On May 5, 2025, nineteen states, the District of Columbia, and the People of the State of Michigan filed suit against Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and other HHS officials challenging a sweeping agency reorganization. The case arose from HHS's March 27, 2025 announcement that it would terminate 10,000 employees, consolidate twenty-eight divisions into fifteen, close half of its regional offices, and create a new Administration for a Healthy America as part of Secretary Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" initiative. The announcement followed President Trump's Executive Order 14210 directing large-scale reductions in force across federal agencies.\n\nThe states, represented by their attorneys general, alleged that the reorganization violated the Administrative Procedure Act as both arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, violated constitutional separation of powers and appropriations principles, and exceeded the agency's statutory authority. They argued that HHS cannot unilaterally dismantle congressionally-created programs and refuse to spend appropriated funds. The complaint detailed how the mass terminations would cripple statutorily-mandated functions at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including infectious disease laboratories, occupational safety research, maternal health surveillance, and tobacco prevention programs. On April 1, 2025, HHS sent termination notices placing 10,000 employees on immediate administrative leave with final termination scheduled for June 2, 2025, immediately locking them out of email accounts, laptops, and offices.\n\nSecretary Kennedy publicly acknowledged that the reorganization was deliberately hasty, admitting he expected twenty percent of the terminations to be mistakes but chose not to conduct careful review because it would \"take too long\" and cause loss of \"political momentum.\" He later testified to Congress that \"decisive action quickly\" was more important than accuracy. The states documented immediate harms including shuttered CDC laboratories, offline data systems, halted grant processing, and loss of technical assistance for critical public health programs.\n\nOn May 9, 2025, the states moved for a preliminary injunction targeting specific agencies within HHS. After expedited briefing and a May 20 hearing, District Judge Melissa R. DuBose granted the preliminary injunction on July 1, 2025. The court rejected HHS's jurisdictional challenges, finding the states had standing based on concrete injuries, that the Civil Service Reform Act did not require channeling claims through administrative forums, and that the Tucker Act did not require filing in the Court of Federal Claims. On the merits, the court found the March 27 announcement constituted reviewable final agency action that was both arbitrary and capricious—lacking any rational basis or cost-benefit analysis—and contrary to numerous statutes requiring HHS to maintain specific programs and spend appropriated funds. The court enjoined HHS from implementing the planned terminations and reorganization at the CDC, FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, Office of Head Start, and Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.\n\nThe court's order prohibited executing existing termination notices, issuing new ones, or placing additional employees on administrative leave at the specified agencies. The court imposed only a nominal $100 bond. On August 12, 2025, the court clarified the injunction's scope, specifying the particular CDC components and programs covered. Defendants filed a notice of appeal the same day, with the case assigned number 25-1780 in the First Circuit. Related litigation challenging similar reorganizations at other federal agencies was proceeding simultaneously in multiple federal courts, with some courts granting and others denying preliminary relief. The case remains pending with briefing on defendants' motion to dismiss scheduled through September 2025.",
    "46511": "On April 29, 2025, twenty-four states and the District of Columbia filed suit against the Corporation for National and Community Service (operating as AmeriCorps) and its Interim Agency Head Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine, and statutory requirements. The plaintiffs are represented by their respective attorneys general. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland and assigned to Judge Deborah L. Boardman.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from AmeriCorps's sweeping actions in April 2025 to dismantle the federal agency for national service and volunteerism. Following consultations with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team to implement Executive Order 14222, AmeriCorps placed approximately 85 percent of its 720-person staff on administrative leave on April 16, 2025, and subsequently reduced its workforce to 116 employees through reductions in force. On April 15, 2025, the agency ordered all members of the National Civilian Community Corps—a residential volunteer program for young adults—to leave their service posts pending termination from the program. Most significantly, on April 25, 2025, AmeriCorps terminated 1,031 grant-funded programs across the country, representing nearly $400 million in federal funding and affecting approximately 30,000 AmeriCorps members, VISTA members, and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers. The termination letters stated simply that \"the award no longer effectuates agency priorities.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged these actions violated the APA in multiple ways: by failing to engage in required notice-and-comment rulemaking, acting arbitrarily and capriciously, and acting contrary to law. Specifically, they argued AmeriCorps violated a provision in the 2024 and 2025 appropriations acts requiring that the agency \"make any significant changes to program requirements, service delivery or policy only through public notice and comment rulemaking.\" They also raised constitutional separation of powers claims and argued the actions exceeded the agency's statutory authority.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, the states moved for a preliminary injunction. Following briefing and a hearing on May 19, 2025, Judge Boardman issued a memorandum opinion and order on June 5, 2025, granting the preliminary injunction in part. The court found that the mass closure of AmeriCorps programs and removal of NCCC members constituted \"significant changes to service delivery\" that required notice-and-comment rulemaking under the appropriations acts. The court ordered AmeriCorps to restore the affected programs in the plaintiff states by reinstating the terminated grants and returning AmeriCorps and VISTA members to service if they were willing and able to return. The court also ordered the restoration of NCCC members nationwide. However, the court denied the request to enjoin the staff reductions, finding the states lacked standing to challenge those personnel decisions.\n\nOn July 10, 2025, the court modified the preliminary injunction in response to the Supreme Court's June 27, 2025 decision in Trump v. CASA, which held that federal courts lack authority to issue universal injunctions. The modification limited the notice-and-comment requirement to changes that harm the plaintiff states. The preliminary injunction remains in effect until further order of the court, with the plaintiffs having posted a nominal bond of $100 per state.\n\nThe terminated programs had provided critical services including disaster relief, veterans support, education assistance, environmental conservation, and public health initiatives. Many programs served vulnerable populations such as children with disabilities, seniors, and communities recovering from natural disasters. The court found the states would suffer irreparable harm from the loss of these services and the diversion of state resources needed to fill the gaps left by the federal program terminations.",
    "46350": "On April 7, 2025, the American Library Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO filed suit against federal officials to prevent the dismantling of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), a federal agency established by Congress in 1996 to support libraries and museums nationwide. The lawsuit, brought by private counsel from Democracy Forward Foundation and Gair Gallo Eberhard LLP, challenged actions taken pursuant to President Trump's Executive Order 14238 issued on March 14, 2025, which declared IMLS \"unnecessary\" and directed it to reduce operations \"to the minimum presence and function required by law.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, the constitutional separation of powers doctrine, and the Take Care Clause, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the agency's dissolution. They argued that only Congress has the authority to abolish an agency it created by statute, and that the executive branch cannot unilaterally eliminate IMLS or refuse to carry out its statutorily mandated functions, including awarding grants to states, tribes, and libraries as required by the Museum and Library Services Act.\n\nFollowing the Executive Order, Acting Director Keith Sonderling—appointed on March 20, 2025—took swift action to dismantle the agency. On March 31, 2025, all approximately 75 IMLS employees were placed on administrative leave and barred from agency premises and computer systems. By April 3, termination notices were issued to all but about 12 employees. On April 4, Sonderling fired all 23 members of the National Museum and Library Services Board. Beginning April 1, IMLS started terminating grants to state libraries and other recipients, with the plaintiff American Library Association receiving termination notices for its grants on April 8-9, 2025.\n\nThe case came before Judge Richard J. Leon in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. After initially filing a motion for preliminary injunction, plaintiffs converted their request to a motion for temporary restraining order during an April 30, 2025 hearing. On May 1, 2025, the court issued a narrow temporary restraining order preserving the status quo. However, on June 6, 2025, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction without prejudice, finding that plaintiffs had not established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, primarily due to jurisdictional concerns.\n\nThe court's analysis was significantly influenced by recent Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent, particularly Department of Education v. California (April 4, 2025) and the circuit panel's decision in Widakuswara v. Lake (May 3, 2025), a similar case challenging the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for Global Media. These cases held that claims challenging grant terminations are essentially contract claims that must be heard by the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, not in district court under the APA. The court found that because plaintiffs' claims centered on the termination of grant agreements and the resulting loss of funding, and because the relief sought would effectively require specific performance of those contracts, the Tucker Act likely divested the district court of jurisdiction.\n\nRelated litigation includes Rhode Island v. Trump, filed in the District of Rhode Island, where multiple states challenged the same IMLS dismantling and obtained preliminary injunctive relief on May 13, 2025. The existence of that injunction provided some protection for IMLS operations while this case proceeded. As of the June 13, 2025 joint status report, the parties were proceeding toward summary judgment briefing, with defendants also planning to file a motion to dismiss based on the jurisdictional issues identified by the court.",
    "46746": "On June 27, 2025, two environmental organizations—Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity—filed suit in the Southern District of Florida challenging the construction of a mass immigration detention facility at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (TNT) in the Big Cypress National Preserve. The plaintiffs, represented by Earthjustice and Coffey Burlington, sued the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of ICE, the Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM), and Miami-Dade County, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq., and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. The plaintiffs also raised violations of Florida state law regarding FDEM's authority to construct and operate correctional facilities.\n\nThe case arose after FDEM took control of the TNT site on June 23, 2025, pursuant to Governor DeSantis's emergency powers related to illegal immigration, and immediately began constructing what officials called \"Alligator Alcatraz\"—a temporary detention facility designed to house up to 5,000 immigration detainees. The TNT site sits within the Big Cypress National Preserve, an environmentally sensitive wetland ecosystem that serves as habitat for several endangered and threatened species, including the Florida panther, Florida bonneted bat, Everglade snail kite, and wood stork. Construction proceeded rapidly without any environmental impact statement or environmental assessment as required under NEPA for major federal actions significantly affecting the human environment.\n\nThe procedural history included several judges and extensive motion practice. Initially assigned to Judge Jose E. Martinez, the case was reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams after Judge Martinez recused himself on July 16, 2025. The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida successfully intervened as a plaintiff on July 30, 2025, citing the environmental risks the project posed to tribal lands and water resources. The defendants raised significant venue challenges, arguing the case belonged in the Middle District of Florida where the facility is primarily located (in Collier County), rather than the Southern District.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed their motion for preliminary injunction simultaneously with their complaint, seeking to halt construction and operation of the facility until NEPA compliance was achieved. After extensive briefing and a four-day evidentiary hearing from August 6-13, 2025, Judge Williams granted a temporary restraining order on August 7, 2025, prohibiting further construction activities including installation of additional lighting, paving, fencing, or placement of additional structures. On August 21, 2025, the court issued a comprehensive preliminary injunction that immediately prohibited bringing new detainees to the facility, ceased all new construction, and required removal of recently installed infrastructure including fencing, lighting, generators, and waste management systems within sixty days.\n\nThe central legal dispute focused on whether the facility constituted a \"major federal action\" triggering NEPA requirements, despite being constructed by the state with state funds. The court found that NEPA applied based on evidence of substantial federal control and involvement, including federal funding commitments of $450-600 million annually through FEMA's Detention Support Grant Program, ICE's supervision of immigration enforcement activities at the facility through 287(g) agreements with multiple Florida law enforcement agencies, and statements by state officials that the facility was requested and would be fully funded by the federal government. The court rejected the defendants' arguments that the facility was purely a state operation exempt from NEPA and that certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act barred judicial review of immigration detention decisions.\n\nThe court also ruled that venue was proper in the Southern District of Florida, finding that substantial events giving rise to the claims occurred there, including Miami-Dade County's ownership of the property, ICE Miami field office's supervision of detention operations, and environmental impacts affecting the Miccosukee Tribe's lands in Miami-Dade County. The court concluded that the plaintiffs demonstrated irreparable harm through loss of procedural rights under NEPA, habitat destruction affecting endangered species, light and noise pollution impacting their use and enjoyment of the preserve, and potential contamination of wetlands from inadequate stormwater management at the rapidly constructed facility.\n\nBoth state and federal defendants filed notices of appeal and sought stays pending appeal, arguing that the injunction would cause immediate disruption to immigration enforcement operations and public safety. The facility had been operational since July 1, 2025, housing hundreds of detainees to alleviate overcrowding at other facilities before the preliminary injunction effectively ordered its closure.",
    "46388": "On April 11, 2025, two faculty associations—the American Association of University Professors-Harvard Faculty Chapter and the national AAUP, later joined by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)—filed suit in federal district court against multiple federal agencies and their heads. The plaintiffs, represented by private law firms Selendy Gay PLLC and Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC, challenged the Trump administration's threats to withdraw and ultimate termination of billions of dollars in federal research funding from Harvard University.\n\nThe case arose from the administration's campaign against universities it viewed as insufficiently addressing antisemitism and promoting disfavored ideologies. After creating a multi-agency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism in February 2025, defendants announced on March 31, 2025 that they were reviewing Harvard's federal funding for alleged failures to address antisemitism. Three days later, on April 3, defendants sent Harvard a letter demanding sweeping reforms including eliminating all \"DEI programs,\" implementing \"viewpoint diversity\" audits of faculty, instituting mask bans, centralizing student discipline, and overhauling admissions and hiring practices. An April 11 letter expanded these demands further, requiring Harvard to report foreign students who commit conduct violations to immigration authorities and to reform specific academic departments the administration deemed problematic. When Harvard rejected these demands through counsel on April 14, the administration immediately froze over $2 billion in federal funding. Between May 6 and May 12, 2025, various federal agencies formally terminated approximately $2.7 billion in grants to Harvard.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the First Amendment. They alleged defendants violated the APA by failing to follow Title VI of the Civil Rights Act's mandatory procedures for terminating federal funding based on civil rights violations. Title VI requires agencies to make specific findings of noncompliance, attempt voluntary resolution, provide notice and opportunity for a hearing, and report to Congress thirty days before any funding termination becomes effective—none of which occurred here. The plaintiffs also alleged First Amendment violations, arguing defendants engaged in unconstitutional coercion by conditioning federal funding on Harvard's willingness to suppress disfavored viewpoints and unconstitutional retaliation when Harvard refused to comply.\n\nThe administrative record revealed no actual investigation of antisemitism at Harvard. Instead, defendants relied on a politically motivated House report and various unsubstantiated allegations while ignoring Harvard's existing efforts to combat antisemitism, including its January 2025 settlement of two Title VI lawsuits where it agreed to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism and implement various reforms. Public statements by President Trump and defendant Leo Terrell made clear the political motivation, with Trump calling Harvard \"a threat to Democracy\" that \"teaches Hate and Stupidity\" and Terrell stating the goal was to \"bankrupt these universities\" because \"the academic system in this country has been hijacked by the left.\"\n\nThe funding terminations immediately harmed plaintiffs' members by forcing cessation of ongoing research, including clinical trials, causing layoffs of research staff, preventing graduate students from completing degrees, and creating a climate of fear and self-censorship among faculty. Multiple Harvard faculty members submitted declarations detailing how the funding cuts forced them to halt multi-year studies, lay off trained personnel, and abandon research partnerships, with some describing the damage as potentially career-ending. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore funding and prevent similar future actions without compliance with legal procedures.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Allison D. Burroughs and proceeded on an expedited schedule, with the plaintiffs filing for summary judgment on June 2, 2025, supported by amicus briefs from organizations including A Jewish Voice for Peace and Public Citizen. The parties agreed to defer any answer to the complaint until after resolution of dispositive motions, with oral argument scheduled for July 21, 2025.",
    "46625": "On May 21, 2025, five nonprofit organizations filed a class action lawsuit challenging the Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs' abrupt termination of over 370 multi-year grants totaling more than $820 million. The plaintiffs—Vera Institute of Justice, Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Affirmative Action (doing business as Stop AAPI Hate), FORCE Detroit, and Health Resources in Action—sought to represent all entities whose OJP grants were terminated in April 2025. Democracy Forward Foundation and Perry Law served as private counsel for the plaintiffs.\n\nIn April 2025, OJP had sent identical termination notices to grant recipients, including the five plaintiff organizations, stating only that the awards \"no longer effectuate[] the program goals or agency priorities\" pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). The notices offered no individualized explanations and ordered recipients to stop work immediately. The Department claimed it had \"changed its priorities\" to focus on \"more directly supporting certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault,\" yet the terminated grants served these exact purposes—funding violence intervention programs, victim services, law enforcement training, and community safety initiatives.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging the terminations were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. They also asserted constitutional violations, including denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment (both procedural due process and void for vagueness), violations of the separation of powers doctrine and the Spending and Appropriations Clauses, and failure to comply with the Take Care Clause. Additionally, they brought an equitable ultra vires claim against the Attorney General and OJP's acting head. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, including reinstatement of their grants.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction and class certification. The defendants, represented by the Department of Justice, opposed these motions and moved to dismiss, arguing primarily that the court lacked jurisdiction because the claims were essentially contractual and belonged in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. A hearing before Judge Amit P. Mehta on June 26, 2025, revealed the government's inability to explain the terminations—when pressed, DOJ's counsel could not articulate why any individual grant was terminated as inconsistent with the agency's priorities, despite those grants directly serving the stated priorities.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, Judge Mehta denied the preliminary injunction, granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, and denied the class certification motion as moot. While the court found OJP's terminations \"unquestionably arbitrary, at least in lay terms\" and called the government's conduct \"shameful,\" it concluded it lacked jurisdiction over the APA claims, finding them essentially contractual in nature. The court held that under Department of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025), such claims belonged exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims. The court also found the constitutional claims failed on their merits—the due process claim failed because government contracts do not create constitutionally protected property interests, the void-for-vagueness claim lacked merit under National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, and the separation of powers claims were premature since DOJ represented it would re-obligate the funds.\n\nThe case highlighted significant immediate impacts from the terminations. Multiple organizations laid off staff, including violence interrupters and gang outreach specialists. Critical programs ceased operations, including services for deaf crime victims, violence intervention in hospitals, and community-based programs serving at-risk youth. Amicus briefs from eighteen states and the District of Columbia, as well as local governments and community organizations, emphasized how the terminations undermined public safety efforts and harmed vulnerable communities nationwide.",
    "46387": "On April 11, 2025, the law firm Susman Godfrey LLP filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging Executive Order 14,263 issued by President Donald Trump on April 9, 2025. Susman Godfrey, a Texas-based trial firm with over 230 attorneys, represented itself with additional counsel from Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP. The defendants include the Executive Office of the President and numerous federal agencies and their heads sued in their official capacities.\n\nThe Executive Order, titled \"Addressing Risks from Susman Godfrey,\" targeted the firm based on its representation of clients and causes that President Trump opposed. Specifically, the Order accused Susman of \"spearheading efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections\" - a reference to the firm's representation of Dominion Voting Systems in defamation lawsuits related to the 2020 election and its defense of state election officials. The Order also cited the firm's donation to GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders and alleged discriminatory employment practices.\n\nThe Order imposed severe restrictions on Susman Godfrey, including immediate suspension of all security clearances held by firm personnel, requirements that government contractors disclose any business with the firm and potentially face contract termination, limitations on access to federal buildings and engagement with federal employees, and restrictions on federal hiring of Susman employees. Susman received no advance notice or opportunity to respond before the Order was issued.\n\nSusman challenged the Order on multiple constitutional grounds, alleging violations of the First Amendment (retaliation for protected speech, viewpoint discrimination, interference with petition rights and freedom of association), the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (deprivation of liberty and property interests without process, vagueness, and violation of clients' right to counsel), equal protection, and separation of powers principles. The firm sought declaratory judgment that the Order was unconstitutional and permanent injunctive relief.\n\nThree days after filing suit, on April 14, 2025, Susman moved for a temporary restraining order. Judge Loren L. AliKhan held an emergency hearing on April 15 and granted the TRO, enjoining enforcement of Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the Executive Order. The court found that the firm was likely to succeed on its claims that the Order violated the First and Fifth Amendments. By agreement of the parties, the TRO was extended until final judgment.\n\nThis case was one of several challenges to similar executive orders targeting law firms. President Trump had previously issued orders against Perkins Coie LLP, Jenner & Block LLP, and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr LLP, all of which were enjoined by federal courts. Several other firms, including Skadden Arps, Kirkland & Ellis, and Latham & Watkins, negotiated agreements with the Trump Administration to avoid being targeted, collectively committing hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono legal services to causes approved by the President.\n\nBoth parties filed dispositive motions on April 23, 2025 - Susman moved for summary judgment while the government moved to dismiss. The court received twenty-one amicus briefs in support of Susman from various organizations including 775 law professors, 366 former judges, multiple bar associations, the ACLU, and numerous law firms.\n\nOn June 27, 2025, Judge AliKhan issued a comprehensive ruling granting summary judgment to Susman on most of its claims and denying the government's motion to dismiss. The court found that the Executive Order violated the First Amendment through impermissible retaliation and viewpoint discrimination, violated due process by depriving Susman of protected interests without any process and through unconstitutionally vague provisions, violated equal protection by singling out the firm for disparate treatment, violated clients' right to counsel, and exceeded presidential authority in violation of separation of powers.\n\nThe court permanently enjoined the Executive Order in its entirety, declaring it \"unconstitutional and therefore null and void.\" The injunction prohibits all federal agencies and officials from implementing, enforcing, or giving effect to any part of the Order, including relying on its statements in any interactions with Susman, its clients, or government contractors. The Department of Justice was directed to notify all federal entities of the court's order and ensure compliance.\n\nThe court's opinion emphasized that the Order represented an unprecedented assault on the independent bar and the rule of law, noting that every court to consider challenges to similar orders targeting law firms had found grave constitutional violations and permanently enjoined their enforcement.",
    "46245": "On March 18, 2025, the United States Institute of Peace and five of its board members filed suit challenging President Trump's removal of USIP's presidentially-appointed board members and subsequent actions by administration officials to dismantle the organization. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from Zuckerman Spaeder LLP. The case was assigned to Judge Beryl A. Howell in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nUSIP was established by Congress in 1984 as an independent nonprofit corporation to conduct research, education, and training on international peace and conflict resolution. Its board consists of fifteen voting members: twelve appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and three ex officio members (the Secretaries of State and Defense, and the President of the National Defense University). Under 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f), the President may only remove appointed board members for cause (conviction of a felony, malfeasance, persistent neglect of duties, or inability to discharge duties), upon recommendation of eight board members, or upon recommendation of specified congressional committees.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14217 directing the reduction of certain government entities to \"statutory minimums,\" identifying USIP as \"unnecessary.\" On March 14, 2025, the White House Presidential Personnel Office terminated all appointed board members via email without invoking any of the statutory grounds for removal. The three remaining ex officio board members then removed USIP's Acting President, Ambassador George Moose, and appointed Kenneth Jackson (later replaced by DOGE representative Nate Cavanaugh) as acting president.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, representatives from the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with assistance from FBI agents and other law enforcement, forcibly took control of USIP's headquarters building on Constitution Avenue after USIP staff initially denied them entry. The takeover involved threats of criminal investigation against USIP personnel who resisted access. Under DOGE control, nearly all of USIP's 400-plus employees were terminated, its headquarters building (built partially with private donations) was transferred to the General Services Administration without compensation, and approximately $25 million from USIP's accounts and private endowment were transferred to the Treasury.\n\nPlaintiffs sought emergency relief through a temporary restraining order on March 18, which Judge Howell denied on March 19, 2025, finding insufficient showing of likelihood of success on the merits given the ambiguous nature of USIP's status within the federal government structure. On March 31, plaintiffs filed a motion under the All Writs Act to prevent further property transfers, which the court denied on April 1 as partially moot (the building transfer having been completed) and for failure to demonstrate likelihood of success on the merits.\n\nFollowing expedited briefing, the district court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on May 19, 2025, in a 102-page opinion (2025 WL 1428641). The court held that while USIP is part of the federal government for constitutional separation-of-powers purposes, it does not exercise executive power and is not part of the Executive Branch. Alternatively, the court found that even if USIP were within the Executive Branch, the statutory removal restrictions would be constitutional under Humphrey's Executor v. United States because USIP is led by a multi-member, partisan-balanced board of experts exercising de minimis executive power. The court declared the board member removals unlawful and null and void, ordered reinstatement of the removed board members and president, and invalidated all subsequent actions taken by the illegitimately installed leadership.\n\nDefendants appealed to the D.C. Circuit and moved for a stay pending appeal. The district court denied the stay request on May 23, 2025, but a motions panel of the D.C. Circuit granted it on June 27, 2025, finding that USIP exercises substantial executive power in foreign affairs. Plaintiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc on June 29, 2025, arguing the panel's decision went beyond Supreme Court precedent. The full D.C. Circuit denied the petition on July 24, 2025. A related case, Pippenger v. U.S. DOGE Service, involves similar challenges to the President's removal of USIP board members.\n\nThe case raised fundamental questions about the scope of presidential removal authority over officials of congressionally-created entities that operate outside traditional executive branch structures, particularly in the context of the Trump administration's broader effort to reduce or eliminate what it deemed unnecessary governmental entities.",
    "46274": "On March 8, 2025, Climate United Fund filed suit against Citibank, N.A., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in his official capacity, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief after EPA attempted to terminate and claw back billions in grant funding. Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities filed similar suits on March 12 and March 14, respectively, and the cases were consolidated. These nonprofit organizations, along with several state green bank subgrantees including the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank, had been awarded substantial grants under the National Clean Investment Fund program—Climate United received $6.97 billion, Coalition for Green Capital received $5 billion, and Power Forward Communities received $2 billion. The plaintiffs are represented by private law firms including Jenner & Block LLP, Holwell Shuster & Goldberg LLP, and Foley Hoag LLP.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act alleging arbitrary and capricious agency action, violations of the Due Process Clause and Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, and violations of the Inflation Reduction Act and federal regulations governing grant terminations. The grants originated from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion program Congress established through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 to finance clean technology projects nationwide. Following a competitive application process, EPA awarded the grants in April 2024 to support projects including solar power development, electric vehicle infrastructure, and energy-efficient housing.\n\nThe grants required funds to be held at Citibank under a Financial Agency Agreement between Citibank and the Treasury Department, and Account Control Agreements between Citibank, EPA, and the grantees. The agreements allowed EPA to take \"exclusive control\" of funds only under specified conditions, including substantial noncompliance, adequate evidence of waste, fraud, or abuse requiring credible evidence of federal criminal violations, or material misrepresentation of eligibility status. Under the agreements, Citibank was obligated to disburse funds at the grantees' request unless EPA issued a proper Notice of Exclusive Control.\n\nIn February 2025, after the presidential transition, EPA Administrator Zeldin publicly announced EPA's intent to recover the grant funds, stating the program was \"criminal\" and that EPA would not rest until funds were recovered. The FBI subsequently sent Citibank a letter recommending a freeze on the accounts citing potential criminal violations, though it provided no evidence and obtained no warrant. Treasury then directed Citibank not to disburse any funds. When plaintiffs attempted to draw funds from their accounts for legitimate operating expenses and project commitments in mid-February 2025, Citibank refused to process the requests without explanation.\n\nOn March 11, 2025, after the plaintiffs had filed suit and moved for temporary restraining orders, EPA issued nearly identical Notices of Termination to all grantees, citing \"substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the Agency's priorities.\" The notices provided no specific evidence of wrongdoing by any plaintiff. EPA stated it intended to reobligate the funds under new agreements, though the statutory deadline for obligating funds had expired on September 30, 2024.\n\nJudge Tanya S. Chutkan held hearings on March 12 and March 17, 2025. On March 18, she issued a temporary restraining order enjoining EPA from effectuating the termination notices and enjoining Citibank from transferring the grant funds, finding plaintiffs had demonstrated irreparable harm including potential insolvency, loss of partnerships and projects, and reputational damage. The court found EPA had provided no evidence to support its termination under the applicable regulations, which required credible evidence of criminal violations or material noncompliance.\n\nFollowing a preliminary injunction hearing on April 2, 2025, and supplemental briefing regarding the Supreme Court's April 4 decision in Department of Education v. California concerning jurisdiction over grant termination disputes, the court granted plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction on April 15, 2025. The court rejected EPA's jurisdictional arguments that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims as a contract dispute, finding instead that plaintiffs challenged unlawful agency action under the APA and constitutional violations. The preliminary injunction enjoins EPA from effectuating the terminations or issuing Notices of Exclusive Control, enjoins Treasury and EPA from directing Citibank to withhold funds, and orders Citibank to process disbursement requests in accordance with the Account Control Agreements.\n\nEPA filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit on April 16, 2025. The preliminary injunction remains in effect pending appeal, with the court temporarily staying disbursements until April 17 to allow EPA to seek relief from the appellate court. The case centers on whether EPA can lawfully terminate and claw back billions in already-disbursed grant funds based on changed policy priorities without following required procedures or demonstrating the regulatory prerequisites for termination.",
    "46142": "On February 19, 2025, three nonprofit organizations—the National Urban League, the National Fair Housing Alliance, and the AIDS Foundation of Chicago—filed suit against President Trump and numerous federal officials challenging three executive orders issued on January 20-21, 2025. The plaintiffs are represented by the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Covington & Burling LLP, and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. The organizations alleged that Executive Order Nos. 14151, 14168, and 14173 violate their First Amendment free speech rights and Fifth Amendment due process rights.\n\nThe challenged executive orders target diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) programs and transgender recognition in federal contracting and grant-making. The first order directs agencies to terminate \"equity-related\" grants and contracts and to compile lists of grantees who received funding for DEI programs. The second order, titled \"Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism,\" seeks to end federal funding for what it terms \"gender ideology\" and prohibits federal funds from being used to promote recognition of transgender identities. The third order requires federal contractors and grantees to certify they do not operate DEI programs that violate federal anti-discrimination laws and directs the Attorney General to develop enforcement plans targeting private sector DEI programs.\n\nThe plaintiff organizations, which have long histories of serving marginalized communities, rely heavily on federal funding—35% of the National Urban League's budget, approximately 27% of the National Fair Housing Alliance's budget, and 84% of the AIDS Foundation of Chicago's budget come from federal sources. Following the executive orders, federal agencies began implementing them through stop-work orders and funding terminations. The Department of Labor directed the National Urban League to cease DEI-related activities, and the Environmental Protection Agency suspended and later terminated a $500,000 grant to the National Urban League for an environmental justice program serving Black communities.\n\nOn February 28, 2025, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction before Judge Timothy J. Kelly, arguing that the executive orders' provisions were unconstitutionally vague and imposed viewpoint-based restrictions on speech. Do No Harm, an organization opposing DEI programs in healthcare, sought to intervene as a defendant on March 5, 2025, but the court denied the motion without prejudice on March 12, 2025, allowing the organization to participate as amicus curiae.\n\nOn May 2, 2025, Judge Kelly denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. The court found that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge several provisions that were merely intra-governmental directives causing no concrete harm to the organizations. For the provisions where standing existed, the court determined plaintiffs had not shown a likelihood of success on their constitutional claims, finding they had brought facial rather than as-applied challenges and had not demonstrated that the provisions implicated protected property or liberty interests necessary for their due process claims. The court also rejected the First Amendment claims, reasoning that the government need not subsidize speech to avoid infringing on free speech rights.\n\nFollowing the denial, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 30, 2025, with the National Fair Housing Alliance no longer participating as a plaintiff, leaving the National Urban League and AIDS Foundation of Chicago to continue the litigation. The amended complaint includes additional factual allegations about enforcement actions taken against the plaintiffs, including specific examples of how the orders have forced them to alter their programming and communications.",
    "46110": "On February 12, 2025, five federal employee unions filed suit challenging the Trump Administration's coordinated efforts to dramatically reduce the federal workforce. The unions—National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), and United Automobile Workers (UAW)—collectively represent hundreds of thousands of federal employees across numerous agencies.\n\nThe case challenges three distinct but related executive actions. First, on January 20, 2025, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) directed all federal agencies to identify their probationary employees and promptly determine whether they should be retained. By February 5, agencies had to submit their retention decisions to OPM with only a 200-character justification for keeping any probationary employee. Second, on January 28, OPM launched a \"Fork in the Road\" deferred resignation program, offering federal employees the option to resign while retaining full pay and benefits through September 30, 2025, and being exempt from in-person work requirements. The program warned employees who chose to stay that OPM could not guarantee the certainty of their positions. Approximately 75,000 employees accepted the deferred resignation offer before the program closed on February 12. Third, on February 11, President Trump issued Executive Order 14210, directing agencies to promptly prepare for large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), prioritizing the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, components the Administration suspends or closes, and employees not typically designated as essential during government shutdowns.\n\nThe unions alleged these actions violated constitutional separation of powers principles by undermining Congress's authority to create, fund, and set the missions of federal agencies. They argued that decimating the federal workforce through executive action usurped Congress's legislative role in establishing agency workforces and funding. The unions also claimed violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, asserting that the planned RIFs violated statutory requirements under 5 U.S.C. § 3502 and implementing regulations, including mandatory notice periods, proper justifications for RIFs, and required competitive area determinations.\n\nEvidence of immediate harm emerged quickly. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau began terminating employees on February 11, explicitly citing the Executive Order. By mid-February, agencies including the FDA, Department of Energy, HHS, Bureau of Land Management, EPA, National Park Service, and Food and Nutrition Service had terminated substantial numbers of probationary employees. NTEU alone lost approximately 1,250-1,500 dues-paying members, with projections of losing up to half its membership and revenue if all affected employees were terminated.\n\nOn February 14, the unions filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to halt implementation of the Executive Order's Section 3(c), the mass firing of probationary employees, and any further extension of the deferred resignation program. Judge Christopher R. Cooper held a hearing on February 18, 2025.\n\nOn February 20, 2025, Judge Cooper denied the unions' request for emergency relief, ruling that the court likely lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their claims. The court held that the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute channels federal labor-management disputes to the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) for administrative review first, followed by appellate court review. The court determined that even though the unions faced potential irreparable harm from lost membership and dues revenue, this did not constitute the type of \"here-and-now injury\" that would permit bypassing the statutory review scheme. The court noted that the unions' constitutional separation of powers claims could still be adjudicated through the FLRA process or ultimately by an Article III court on appeal.\n\nAs of the last docket entry, the case remained pending with defendants' answer to the amended complaint due May 15, 2025, though the denial of preliminary relief and jurisdictional ruling significantly limited the unions' ability to obtain immediate judicial intervention against the Administration's workforce reduction initiatives.",
    "46098": "On February 11, 2025, eight organizations involved in administering foreign assistance programs filed suit against President Trump and other federal officials challenging the administration's freeze of congressionally appropriated foreign aid funding. The plaintiffs—Global Health Council, Small Business Association for International Companies, HIAS, Management Sciences for Health, Chemonics International, DAI Global, Democracy International, and the American Bar Association—are nonprofits and businesses that partner with USAID and the State Department to implement foreign assistance programs worldwide. These organizations, represented by the private law firm Arnold & Porter, depend heavily on federal funding, with some receiving over 90% of their revenue from USAID contracts and grants.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from Executive Order 14,169, issued on President Trump's first day in office (January 20, 2025), which declared that U.S. foreign aid programs were \"antithetical to American values\" and ordered an immediate pause on all foreign assistance funding. The Secretary of State and USAID officials implemented this order through memoranda directing the suspension of new funding obligations and requiring stop-work orders on existing awards. Within weeks, the agencies suspended or terminated thousands of grants and contracts. Plaintiffs alleged these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act as arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, violated constitutional separation of powers principles by impounding congressionally appropriated funds, violated the Impoundment Control Act and Anti-Deficiency Act, and constituted ultra vires action exceeding statutory authority.\n\nJudge Amir H. Ali of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted partial emergency relief on February 13, 2025, issuing a temporary restraining order that enjoined defendants (except the President) from enforcing the funding freeze for awards existing as of January 19, 2025. The court found plaintiffs demonstrated likelihood of success on their APA claims, noting defendants failed to consider the serious reliance interests of businesses and organizations dependent on these funds. When defendants failed to comply promptly with the TRO, plaintiffs filed multiple motions to enforce, leading to additional court orders on February 20, February 21, and February 25 requiring immediate compliance and payment of funds owed for work already completed.\n\nOn March 10, 2025, after extensive briefing and hearings, Judge Ali issued a preliminary injunction requiring defendants to make available for obligation the full amount of foreign assistance funds Congress appropriated in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024. The court found plaintiffs likely to succeed on their claim that the Executive Branch violated separation of powers by unilaterally withholding appropriated funds without following procedures in the Impoundment Control Act. The court set a benchmark requiring processing of approximately 300 payments per day to come into compliance. Defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the D.C. Circuit on April 1, 2025, which remains pending.\n\nThe case was consolidated with AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. U.S. Department of State (No. 25-cv-400), a related challenge to the funding freeze filed by other grantees. The litigation revealed that defendants had terminated over 90% of USAID awards and approximately 60% of State Department foreign assistance awards, affecting programs providing humanitarian aid, health services, and development assistance globally. Plaintiffs reported severe impacts including mass employee layoffs, office closures, threats to organizational survival, and disruption of critical services to vulnerable populations worldwide.\n\nAs of the last documented status report, defendants continued working toward compliance with the preliminary injunction's payment requirements while the substantive legal issues proceed on appeal. The case represents a significant constitutional dispute over the Executive Branch's authority to refuse to spend congressionally appropriated funds based on policy disagreements, with the district court ruling that such unilateral impoundment violates the separation of powers and statutory frameworks governing federal spending.",
    "46090": "On February 9, 2025, six plaintiffs filed suit challenging the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The plaintiffs included the National Treasury Employees Union and the CFPB Employee Association (both representing Bureau employees), the National Consumer Law Center, the NAACP, the Virginia Poverty Law Center, and Rev. Eva Steege, an 83-year-old pastor seeking help with student loan forgiveness who later died and was substituted by her husband Ted Steege. They were represented by a combination of private counsel from Gupta Wessler LLP, Public Citizen Litigation Group, and the union's general counsel, with Tzedek DC participating as amicus curiae.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from rapid actions taken after President Trump designated Russell Vought as Acting Director of the CFPB on February 7, 2025. That day, Elon Musk posted \"CFPB RIP\" with a tombstone emoji, and the Bureau's website was taken offline. On February 8, Vought directed employees to cease most activities unless \"required by law,\" and on February 10, he issued what became known as the \"stop work order,\" instructing all employees not to perform any work tasks without written approval. President Trump told reporters the CFPB \"was a very important thing to get rid of.\" Between February 11-13, the Bureau terminated all probationary and term employees (approximately 215 people), cancelled contracts across five divisions, and prepared a reduction in force that would eliminate 80-90% of the remaining workforce, leaving fewer than 200 employees from an original staff of over 1,200.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under both constitutional and statutory theories. They alleged violations of the separation of powers and the Take Care Clause, arguing that the executive branch was unconstitutionally attempting to eliminate an agency created by Congress. They also raised claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, asserting the actions exceeded statutory authority and were arbitrary and capricious. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the dismantling of the CFPB.\n\nOn February 14, 2025, the parties entered a consent order before Judge Amy Berman Jackson that prohibited the Bureau from deleting data, terminating employees except for cause, issuing reduction-in-force notices, or transferring funds while the court considered the preliminary injunction motion. After a two-day evidentiary hearing on March 10-11, where the Bureau's Chief Operating Officer Adam Martinez testified and contradicted his earlier declarations, the district court found that defendants were in fact engaged in an effort to shut down the agency entirely in violation of law.\n\nOn March 28, 2025, Judge Jackson granted a preliminary injunction. The order required reinstatement of terminated employees including the Private Student Loan Ombudsman, prohibited terminations except for cause, barred work stoppages, required rescission of contract terminations, and mandated that the Bureau maintain its consumer complaint functions including a toll-free number, website, and database as required by statute.\n\nDefendants appealed, and on April 11, 2025, the D.C. Circuit partially stayed the injunction to allow terminations and work stoppages that defendants determined were unnecessary for statutory duties. When the Bureau then issued RIF notices to over 1,400 employees (more than 80% of the workforce), plaintiffs returned to court. The district court temporarily halted the RIF on April 18, and the Circuit subsequently lifted its partial stay on April 28.\n\nThe appeal was ultimately decided on August 15, 2025, when the D.C. Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction entirely. The appellate court held that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the employment-related claims brought by NTEU and the CFPB Employee Association because such claims must proceed through the Civil Service Reform Act's specialized review scheme. As for the remaining plaintiffs' claims, the court found they did not challenge discrete, final agency action reviewable under the APA but rather sought improper \"wholesale judicial supervision\" of agency management. The court also rejected the constitutional claims, holding that allegations of statutory violations by executive officials do not automatically create separation-of-powers violations giving rise to equitable review outside the APA framework.",
    "PN-NY-0014": "On March 28, 2012, Jaenean Ligon and eleven other African-American and Latino residents of the Bronx filed a civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the City of New York, NYPD Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, and several individual police officers. The plaintiffs, represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union, The Bronx Defenders, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, and Shearman & Sterling LLP, challenged the NYPD's enforcement practices under the Trespass Affidavit Program (TAP), also known as Operation Clean Halls. This program allows building owners to authorize NYPD officers to patrol inside and around private residential apartment buildings to combat criminal activity.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the NYPD had an unconstitutional policy and practice of stopping, questioning, frisking, searching, and arresting residents of TAP buildings and their guests without reasonable suspicion or probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. They further alleged that these practices disproportionately targeted Black and Latino individuals in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the NYPD to reform its policies, training, supervision, monitoring, and disciplinary procedures regarding stops and frisks.\n\nFollowing a seven-day evidentiary hearing in October and November 2012 before Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, the court granted a preliminary injunction on January 8, 2013 (amended February 14, 2013). The court found that plaintiffs had shown a clear likelihood of proving that the City displayed deliberate indifference toward a widespread practice of unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx. On February 11, 2013, the court certified a class of all individuals who have been or are at risk of being stopped outdoors within the vicinity of Bronx TAP buildings without legal justification. On August 12, 2013, Judge Scheindlin issued a remedial order in conjunction with the related Floyd v. City of New York case, appointing Peter L. Zimroth as an independent monitor and ordering comprehensive reforms including new policies, training programs, supervision procedures, and a pilot program for body-worn cameras.\n\nThe City appealed these orders, leading to significant appellate intervention. On October 31, 2013, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the district court's orders and, citing concerns about the appearance of impartiality, reassigned the case from Judge Scheindlin to a new district judge to be chosen randomly. The case was subsequently assigned to Judge Analisa Torres. Several NYPD police unions - including the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, Detectives' Endowment Association, Lieutenants Benevolent Association, and Captains Endowment Association - attempted to intervene in the case to continue the City's appeal after newly-elected Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the City's intention to withdraw its appeals and settle the cases. On July 30, 2014, Judge Torres denied the unions' motions to intervene as untimely, and the Second Circuit affirmed this decision on October 31, 2014.\n\nThe parties reached a comprehensive settlement that was approved by the court on July 19, 2017. The settlement requires the NYPD to adopt specific standards for investigative encounters in and around TAP buildings, including that mere presence in or exit from a TAP building does not constitute reasonable suspicion for a stop. The agreement mandates revision of Patrol Guide procedures, implementation of new training programs, documentation requirements for all stops, and supervisory review of stops for constitutional compliance. Buildings may only be enrolled in TAP if there has been recent criminal activity, and enrollment must be reviewed every six months. The settlement provides for continued monitoring by the independent monitor for up to five years, with the possibility of earlier termination if the City demonstrates substantial compliance with all material aspects of the reforms. The monitor has since filed multiple reports documenting the NYPD's progress in implementing required changes to policies, training, supervision, and auditing procedures, though noting ongoing challenges with underreporting of stops and ensuring that written policy changes are implemented in practice.",
    "PB-CT-0007": "On November 9, 2010, six same-sex couples and one widower from Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire filed suit challenging Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as a violation of the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection. The plaintiffs, represented by Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders along with several private law firms, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against multiple federal agencies including the Office of Personnel Management, the Social Security Administration, and the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nThe plaintiffs were all legally married under their respective state laws but were denied various federal benefits because DOMA defined \"marriage\" for all federal purposes as only between one man and one woman. The specific harms included denial of federal employee health benefits, Family Medical Leave Act protections, Social Security survivor benefits, qualified preretirement survivor annuities under ERISA-governed pension plans, joint tax filing status, and Medicare cost supplements through state retirement systems. For example, Joanne Pedersen, a retired federal employee, could not add her wife Ann Meitzen to her federal health insurance plan, while Gerald Passaro was denied both survivor benefits from his deceased husband's pension plan and the Social Security lump-sum death benefit.\n\nDOMA had been enacted in 1996 in response to Hawaii's Baehr v. Lewin decision, which threatened to allow same-sex marriages. The law affected over 1,138 federal statutes and regulations. Congress justified DOMA based on defending traditional marriage, expressing moral disapproval of homosexuality, protecting state sovereignty, and preserving federal resources.\n\nA significant procedural development occurred in February 2011 when Attorney General Eric Holder notified Congress that the Department of Justice would no longer defend DOMA's constitutionality, though it would continue to enforce the law pending judicial resolution. The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the House of Representatives intervened to defend the statute's constitutionality.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, Judge Vanessa L. Bryant of the District of Connecticut granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied BLAG's motion to dismiss. The court conducted an extensive analysis of whether sexual orientation constitutes a suspect or quasi-suspect class, examining factors including the history of discrimination against gay and lesbian individuals, whether sexual orientation affects ability to contribute to society, the immutability of sexual orientation, and the political power of the class. While the court concluded that heightened scrutiny was warranted, it ultimately applied rational basis review and still found DOMA unconstitutional.\n\nThe district court systematically rejected every justification offered for DOMA. It found no rational relationship between denying federal benefits to married same-sex couples and the goals of defending traditional marriage, promoting responsible procreation, ensuring children have parents of both sexes, defending traditional morality, preserving government resources, or maintaining uniformity in federal benefits administration. The court noted that DOMA actually created complexity and inconsistency rather than uniformity by requiring the federal government to identify and exclude same-sex marriages from federal recognition.\n\nFollowing the district court's judgment on August 2, 2012, both the federal defendants and BLAG appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, where the case was docketed as No. 12-3273. Multiple parties subsequently filed petitions for writs of certiorari before judgment with the Supreme Court, seeking expedited review of this significant constitutional question alongside other pending DOMA challenges.",
    "PC-AL-0034": "On May 28, 2015, the United States filed a civil rights enforcement action against the State of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Corrections concerning conditions at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women. The case was brought under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, alleging violations of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuit was assigned to Judge Myron H. Thompson in the Middle District of Alabama. The United States was represented by attorneys from the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, Special Litigation Section, along with the U.S. Attorney's Office, while the defendants were represented by in-house counsel from the Alabama Department of Corrections.\n\nThe lawsuit followed a Department of Justice investigation that began in February 2013 and concluded with findings issued in January 2014. The investigation revealed a pattern and practice of sexual abuse and sexual harassment of women prisoners by correctional staff at Tutwiler. The DOJ found that for nearly two decades, Tutwiler staff had sexually abused and harassed women prisoners with impunity, including rape, sodomy, sexual assault, fondling, exposure, coerced oral sex, and voyeurism. Staff created a toxic, sexualized environment where prisoners were compelled to submit to sexual advances to obtain basic necessities or avoid punishment. The investigation documented that at least 36 percent of staff had engaged in sexual misconduct with prisoners. Despite having knowledge of these conditions for over eighteen years, including from a prior 1995 DOJ investigation, prison officials had failed to take reasonable steps to protect the women in their custody.\n\nRather than proceed to litigation, the parties negotiated a comprehensive settlement agreement that was filed simultaneously with the complaint on May 28, 2015. The court entered the settlement as a consent decree on June 18, 2015, conditionally dismissing the complaint without prejudice while retaining jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. The settlement required the State to implement sweeping reforms to ensure constitutional conditions at Tutwiler, including full compliance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) standards, development of gender-responsive policies and procedures, improved staffing and recruitment of female officers, comprehensive staff training, enhanced camera surveillance systems, an inmate grievance system, improved classification procedures, and regular data collection and quality improvement measures.\n\nThe agreement provided for an independent monitor to assess compliance, with Jennie Lancaster initially appointed in September 2015, followed by Kathleen Dennehy who assumed the role in August 2016. The monitors conducted regular compliance visits and filed detailed reports with the court every six months. Through eight compliance reports filed between February 2016 and August 2019, the monitors documented steady progress in implementing the required reforms. By the eighth report in August 2019, ADOC and Tutwiler had achieved substantial compliance with 41 of 43 settlement provisions, with only staffing levels and one classification-related provision remaining in partial compliance. The monitoring reports documented significant improvements including implementation of comprehensive PREA policies, staff training on gender-responsive approaches, installation of a state-of-the-art camera system, development of new gender-responsive programming, and creation of accountability systems for addressing sexual abuse allegations. While challenges remained, particularly regarding chronic understaffing of correctional officers, the facility had undergone substantial transformation from the conditions that prompted federal intervention.",
    "ED-MI-0001": "On November 8, 2006, the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (BAMN), along with numerous student and organizational plaintiffs, filed a federal lawsuit challenging Michigan's Proposal 2, a voter-approved constitutional amendment that had passed the previous day by a 58-42% margin. The amendment, which became Article I, Section 26 of the Michigan Constitution, prohibited state institutions, including public universities, from granting preferential treatment based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, education, and contracting. The plaintiffs sued Governor Jennifer Granholm and the governing boards of Michigan's three major public universities, asserting that Proposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and federal civil rights statutes. The Michigan Attorney General intervened as a defendant on December 14, 2006.\n\nOn December 19, 2006, a separate group of University of Michigan faculty members and students, known as the Cantrell plaintiffs and represented by the ACLU and other counsel, filed a similar challenge focusing on a \"political restructuring\" theory under the Equal Protection Clause. They argued that Proposal 2 unconstitutionally restructured Michigan's political process by requiring racial minorities to seek a constitutional amendment to restore race-conscious admissions policies, while those seeking other types of admissions preferences could simply lobby university boards or administrators. District Judge David M. Lawson consolidated both cases on January 5, 2007.\n\nThe litigation's procedural history proved complex. Initially, the district court issued a preliminary injunction on December 19, 2006, postponing Proposal 2's application to university admissions until July 1, 2007, based on a stipulation among the parties. However, Eric Russell, a white applicant to the University of Michigan Law School, successfully intervened and appealed, leading the Sixth Circuit to stay the injunction on December 29, 2006. Both plaintiff groups moved for class certification in May 2007, though the court ultimately did not rule on these motions before deciding the case on summary judgment.\n\nOn March 18, 2008, after extensive discovery, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Attorney General, rejecting both plaintiff groups' arguments that Proposal 2 violated equal protection. The court distinguished the case from Hunter v. Erickson and Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, Supreme Court precedents that had invalidated laws placing special burdens on racial minorities' ability to achieve beneficial legislation through the political process. The district court held that those cases protected minorities from impediments to obtaining \"equal treatment\" but not from barriers to securing \"preferential treatment.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed, and on July 1, 2011, a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed, finding Proposal 2 unconstitutional under the Hunter-Seattle political-process doctrine. The panel held that Proposal 2 targeted programs that \"inure primarily to the benefit of the minority\" and restructured the political process to place special burdens on racial minorities' ability to enact beneficial policies. However, the Sixth Circuit granted en banc review and, on November 15, 2012, reversed the panel decision by an 8-7 vote, upholding Proposal 2's constitutionality.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted certiorari and, on April 22, 2014, affirmed the en banc decision in Schuette v. BAMN, though without a majority opinion. Justice Kennedy's plurality opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, concluded that Michigan voters had the authority to prohibit racial preferences through the democratic process, distinguishing the case from Hunter and Seattle. Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concurred in the judgment but argued the political-process doctrine should be overruled entirely. Justice Breyer concurred separately, finding that Proposal 2 did not diminish minorities' political participation since it moved decision-making from unelected administrators to voters. Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg dissented, arguing that Proposal 2 violated equal protection by restructuring the political process along racial lines.\n\nThe case arose against the backdrop of the Supreme Court's 2003 decisions in Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter v. Bollinger, which had struck down the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions system but upheld its law school's more limited use of race-conscious admissions. Ward Connerly, who had championed similar measures in California, and Jennifer Gratz, the lead plaintiff in Gratz, mobilized the campaign for Proposal 2. Evidence suggested the signature-gathering process involved methods that \"undermined the integrity and fairness of our democratic processes,\" according to the Sixth Circuit, though the measure ultimately appeared on the ballot and passed. The litigation thus represented the culmination of a decades-long battle over affirmative action in Michigan's public universities, with the plaintiffs unable to prevent the implementation of a constitutional amendment that eliminated race-conscious admissions policies that had been in place since the 1970s.",
    "DR-CA-0033": "On August 22, 2005, Maurizio Antoninetti, a paraplegic who uses a wheelchair, filed suit against Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. in the Southern District of California, alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the California Disabled Persons Act (CDPA), the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, and California Health & Safety Code provisions. Antoninetti was represented by private attorney Amy B. Vandeveld. The case was initially assigned to Judge Napoleon A. Jones, Jr. and later transferred to Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz.\n\nThe lawsuit arose from Antoninetti's visits to two Chipotle restaurants in San Diego and Encinitas, California. The central issue involved the design of Chipotle's food service areas, where customers move along a line next to food preparation counters to order customized Mexican food items. These counters were separated from the customer line by a 44-inch high wall topped with a transparent sneeze guard, bringing the total height to 46 inches. Since the average eye level of wheelchair users ranges from 43 to 51 inches, Antoninetti could not see over the wall to view the available food ingredients or watch his order being prepared, an experience that Chipotle marketed as integral to dining at its restaurants.\n\nAntoninetti sought injunctive relief requiring Chipotle to lower the walls, as well as monetary damages and attorney's fees. He also raised claims regarding inaccessible parking lots, restrooms, and entrances, though these issues were largely resolved through modifications Chipotle made after the lawsuit was filed. A related class action (Case No. 06cv2671) was filed on December 6, 2006, and the cases were consolidated for discovery purposes only in March 2007.\n\nFollowing cross-motions for summary judgment in April 2007, the district court issued a partial ruling on June 14, 2007. The court held that ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) Section 7.2(2) regarding sales and service counters applied to the food preparation areas, rather than Section 4.33.3 regarding sight lines in assembly areas as Antoninetti argued. The court found that factual issues remained regarding whether Chipotle's accommodation practices constituted \"equivalent facilitation\" under the guidelines.\n\nThe case proceeded to a four-day bench trial in November-December 2007. On January 10, 2008, the district court issued its findings distinguishing between Chipotle's unwritten accommodation policy in place during Antoninetti's visits and a written \"Customers with Disabilities Policy\" adopted in February 2007. The court found that while the unwritten policy violated the ADA because it relied on subjective employee judgment, the written policy—which required managers to proactively offer accommodations such as showing food samples in cups or describing items—constituted equivalent facilitation and complied with the ADA. The court awarded Antoninetti $5,000 in statutory damages under the CDPA for five \"bona fide\" visits but denied damages for three visits made for litigation purposes. Critically, the court denied injunctive relief to lower the walls.\n\nAntoninetti appealed, and on July 26, 2010, the Ninth Circuit reversed key portions of the district court's decision in a published opinion (643 F.3d 1165). The appellate court held that both Chipotle's unwritten and written accommodation policies violated the ADA, finding that the policies did not provide equivalent facilitation because they offered separate and unequal experiences compared to what non-disabled customers enjoyed. The Ninth Circuit remanded with instructions to enter judgment against Chipotle and issue appropriate injunctive relief.\n\nOn remand, Antoninetti's death on May 9, 2011, mooted the claim for injunctive relief, as his widow (who was substituted as plaintiff) could not demonstrate future harm. The district court maintained the $5,000 damages award for the five non-litigation visits. The attorneys' fees dispute resulted in multiple proceedings, with the district court ultimately awarding $545,079.05 in fees after the Ninth Circuit's favorable ruling, substantially more than the $136,537.83 initially awarded when Antoninetti was deemed to have achieved only limited success.",
    "CJ-FL-0009": "Between June 15 and July 1, 2019, seventeen individuals with felony convictions and three civil rights organizations filed five related lawsuits that were consolidated in the Northern District of Florida, challenging Florida's system for restoring voting rights to former felons. The individual plaintiffs had completed their prison terms and supervision but had outstanding legal financial obligations (LFOs) including fines, fees, costs, and restitution that they claimed they were unable to pay. The organizational plaintiffs were the League of Women Voters of Florida, the Florida State Conference of the NAACP, and the Orange County Branch of the NAACP. The defendants, all sued in their official capacities, included Florida's Governor, Secretary of State, and various county Supervisors of Elections. The plaintiffs were represented by a coalition of civil rights organizations including the ACLU, Campaign Legal Center, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Brennan Center for Justice, and Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nThe case arose from Florida's Amendment 4, a voter-initiated constitutional amendment passed in November 2018 with 64.55% support, which automatically restored voting rights to most felons \"upon completion of all terms of sentence including parole or probation.\" The amendment excluded those convicted of murder or felony sexual offenses. In May 2019, the Florida Legislature enacted Senate Bill 7066, which defined \"completion of all terms of sentence\" to include payment of all fines, fees, costs, and restitution imposed as part of the criminal sentence, even if converted to civil liens. The Florida Supreme Court later agreed with this interpretation in an advisory opinion issued January 16, 2020.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that conditioning the right to vote on payment of LFOs violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause (as wealth discrimination against those unable to pay), the Twenty-Fourth Amendment (as an unconstitutional poll tax on fees and costs), the Due Process Clause (both as void for vagueness and denial of procedural due process), the First Amendment, and the National Voter Registration Act. The case was initially assigned to Chief Judge Mark E. Walker, who recused himself on July 17, 2019, with the case then reassigned to Judge Robert L. Hinkle.\n\nAfter an evidentiary hearing, Judge Hinkle granted a preliminary injunction on October 18, 2019, holding that the State could not prevent the seventeen individual plaintiffs from registering to vote based solely on their inability to pay LFOs they genuinely could not afford. The injunction allowed plaintiffs who asserted inability to pay to register, and those who showed inability to pay to vote. On appeal, a three-judge panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction on February 19, 2020, in Jones v. Governor of Florida, 950 F.3d 795, applying heightened scrutiny and finding the LFO requirement likely violated equal protection as applied to indigent felons.\n\nJudge Hinkle certified a class of all persons eligible to vote but for unpaid LFOs and a subclass of those genuinely unable to pay. After an eight-day trial on the merits, the district court issued a 125-page opinion on May 24, 2020, entering a permanent injunction. The court found that the overwhelming majority of affected felons were genuinely unable to pay their LFOs and would be permanently disenfranchised. The court held that the LFO requirement violated equal protection as applied to those unable to pay and that fees and costs imposed as taxes violated the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. The injunction prohibited enforcement of the LFO requirement against those genuinely unable to pay and against anyone for fees and costs, while allowing the State to require payment of fines and restitution from those able to pay.\n\nThe State appealed and successfully petitioned for initial en banc review. On September 11, 2020, the en banc Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court's judgment and vacated the injunction. The en banc court held that rational basis review, not heightened scrutiny, applied to the felon reenfranchisement scheme and that conditioning voting on completion of all terms of sentence, including financial obligations, was rationally related to Florida's legitimate interests. The court also rejected the Twenty-Fourth Amendment claim, holding that fees and costs imposed as part of a criminal sentence are not \"taxes\" within the meaning of that amendment.\n\nThe factual record revealed significant administrative problems with Florida's system. Many felons could not determine what they owed because records were unavailable, incomplete, or inconsistent. Some counties had destroyed older records, while others charged fees just to obtain copies of judgments. The State acknowledged it was unable to determine the amounts owed by many of the plaintiffs despite extensive litigation efforts. Evidence showed that approximately 80% of otherwise-eligible felons had unpaid LFOs, that the Florida Clerk of Courts Association anticipated 83% of all LFOs would remain unpaid due to inability to pay, and that at the time of trial, 85,000 felons had registered to vote but the State had not completed screening any of them for eligibility.",
    "CW-CA-0005": "On July 18, 2002, five foster children filed a federal class action lawsuit in the Central District of California against state and county officials responsible for child welfare and health services in California. The plaintiffs—Katie A., Mary B., Janet C., Henry D., and Gary E.—proceeded through next friends (guardian representatives) and were represented by a coalition of legal services organizations including the ACLU of Southern California, Western Center on Law and Poverty, National Center for Youth Law, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, and Protection & Advocacy Inc.

The lawsuit was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Directors of the California Department of Health Services (later Health Care Services), the California Department of Social Services, Los Angeles County, and the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged violations of the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions of the Medicaid Act, which requires states to provide comprehensive mental health services to Medicaid-eligible children under age 21. They also claimed violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and California constitutional provisions. The complaint described a system where foster children with serious mental health needs were denied necessary services, leading to multiple failed placements, unnecessary institutionalization, and inadequate treatment.\n\nOn June 18, 2003, Judge A. Howard Matz certified a statewide class of children in California who: (a) are in foster care or at imminent risk of foster care placement; (b) have a documented mental illness or condition; and (c) need individualized mental health services in home or home-like settings. The class definition specifically included services such as professionally acceptable assessments, behavioral support, case management, family support, crisis support, and therapeutic foster care.\n\nThe case proceeded on two tracks. First, the plaintiffs reached a settlement with the Los Angeles County defendants in April 2003, which the court approved on July 16, 2003 after a fairness hearing. This settlement established objectives for providing necessary mental health services to class members in Los Angeles County and created a six-member Advisory Panel to monitor implementation. The settlement required the county to ensure mental health needs were identified and services provided, expand wraparound services, enhance permanency planning, and increase placement stability.\n\nThe litigation against the state defendants continued. On March 14, 2006, the district court granted plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering the state to provide wraparound services and therapeutic foster care (TFC) to class members within 120 days. The court found these services fell within California's EPSDT obligations under Medicaid. However, on March 23, 2007, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that while the state must provide all required component services under EPSDT, it was not necessarily required to provide them in the specific bundled forms of wraparound and TFC programs. The appellate court directed the district court to first determine whether the state was providing all required individual services effectively before considering whether bundling was necessary.\n\nFollowing years of continued litigation and negotiation, the parties reached a comprehensive settlement with the state defendants in 2011. On December 5, 2011, the court entered a stipulated judgment approving the settlement agreement. The state settlement required development of a Documentation Manual for Intensive Care Coordination (ICC) and Intensive Home Based Services (IHBS), amendments to California's Medicaid State Plan, establishment of a shared management structure between state departments, and creation of a Core Practice Model for delivering mental health services to foster children. The settlement particularly focused on a subclass of children with more intensive needs who required immediate access to mental health services. The court retained jurisdiction through December 2014 to monitor implementation.\n\nPost-settlement implementation proved challenging. The Advisory Panel's reports from 2015 through 2018 documented ongoing concerns about slow progress, underutilization of intensive services, inadequate data systems, and low performance on quality measures. Despite some improvements in staffing and development of Child and Family Team capacity, the Panel found that many foster children continued to experience placement instability, inadequate mental health services, and unnecessary group home placements. The Panel made numerous recommendations for improving service delivery, including ensuring immediacy and intensity of mental health services, improving placement stability, strengthening teaming processes, and enhancing supervision and training.\n\nA Special Master appointed to facilitate implementation reported similar concerns through 2014, noting particular challenges with therapeutic foster care approval from federal authorities and gaps in the mental health data system's ability to track key performance indicators. The court's jurisdiction formally ended in 2015, though monitoring through the Advisory Panel continued for several years to track ongoing compliance efforts. Throughout the litigation, disputes arose over discovery, particularly regarding depositions of named plaintiffs and counsel, which were resolved through protective orders maintaining confidentiality of sensitive information about the foster children involved.",
    "PC-VA-0022": "On December 19, 2014, Eric J. DePaola, an inmate proceeding pro se, filed a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Virginia Department of Corrections and numerous prison officials, challenging his prolonged solitary confinement at Red Onion State Prison. The case was initially filed with co-plaintiffs Denis Rivera and Luis Velazquez, but Judge James P. Jones severed the cases on April 8, 2015, creating separate actions for each plaintiff.\n\nDePaola, who was sentenced to 38 years in prison at age 16 for crimes including malicious wounding, use of a firearm, statutory burglary, and abduction, has been held in administrative segregation (solitary confinement) since September 2009, following an incident where he stabbed a prison guard. The injury was non-fatal, but resulted in an additional conviction for malicious wounding. DePaola alleged violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe factual basis of DePaola's claims centered on the harsh conditions of his confinement and the permanence of his segregation status. He described being confined to an 8-by-10-foot cell for 24 hours daily except for three 15-minute showers per week and five hours of weekly recreation in what he called a \"dog style cage.\" The conditions included constant bright lighting, no physical human contact except when being shackled, cavity searches before leaving his cell, and meals eaten alone in his cell. DePaola reported suffering mental deterioration, anxiety, night terrors, physical deterioration, headaches, weight loss, and vision problems from the constant fluorescent lights.\n\nCentral to DePaola's constitutional claims was Virginia's Operating Procedure 830.A, which classifies certain inmates as \"Intensive Management\" (IM) based on their perceived potential for extreme violence. Unlike inmates in \"Special Management\" (SM) classification who can progress through a Step-Down Program back to general population, IM inmates like DePaola are permanently barred from returning to general population. DePaola's IM designation, based on his 2009 stabbing incident, means he will remain in solitary confinement until his projected release date in 2040—a total of 31 years.\n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss on October 13, 2015, which Judge Jones denied on May 18, 2016, allowing DePaola to file an amended complaint. The defendants then moved for summary judgment on July 28, 2016. Despite DePaola's opposition arguing that genuine disputes of material fact existed regarding both his procedural due process and Eighth Amendment claims, Judge Jones granted summary judgment for the defendants on September 28, 2016. DePaola filed a timely notice of appeal on October 6, 2016, and the case proceeded to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals (Case No. 16-7358), where the district court's decision was affirmed on November 22, 2017.",
    "CJ-MD-0001": "Vernon Evans, Jr., a death row inmate convicted of two murders in 1984 and re-sentenced to death in 1992, filed a civil rights action on January 19, 2006, against Maryland corrections officials challenging the state's lethal injection protocol. Evans, represented by private counsel from Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP and the Office of the Public Defender, brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that Maryland's execution procedures would violate his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment. Evans did not challenge the constitutionality of his death sentence or lethal injection generally, but rather the specific practices and procedures Maryland employed.\n\nThe complaint centered on Maryland's use of a three-drug cocktail consisting of sodium pentothal (an anesthetic), pancuronium bromide (a paralytic agent), and potassium chloride (which stops the heart). Evans alleged that the Division of Correction's protocols created a grave risk that he would suffer excruciating pain during execution due to inadequate anesthesia administration by unqualified personnel, lack of monitoring for anesthetic depth, and potential complications from intravenous access given his history of drug use and compromised veins. Medical experts testified that pancuronium bromide would mask any signs of consciousness while causing suffocation, and potassium chloride would cause agonizing pain if administered to an inadequately anesthetized person. The case revealed that Maryland had experienced problems with at least one prior execution, that of Tyrone Gilliam, where IV lines leaked during the procedure.\n\nOn January 20, 2006, Evans filed emergency motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to halt his execution scheduled for the week of February 6, 2006. Chief Judge Benson Everett Legg conducted hearings on January 24, 27, and February 1, 2006, with testimony from medical experts including anesthesiologists and trauma physicians. On February 1, 2006, Judge Legg denied both the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, finding that Evans had not demonstrated the likelihood of success on the merits necessary for preliminary relief. The court also denied Evans's motion for a stay pending appeal on February 2, 2006.\n\nEvans immediately appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which dismissed the appeal as moot on February 15, 2006, after Maryland agreed to stay the execution pending state court proceedings. Simultaneously, Evans and three organizational co-plaintiffs (NAACP, ACLU, and Maryland Citizens Against State Executions) filed a separate action in Baltimore City Circuit Court arguing that the execution protocols constituted regulations that had not been properly adopted under Maryland's Administrative Procedure Act and that specific provisions violated the state's death penalty statute.\n\nIn a significant ruling on December 19, 2006, the Maryland Court of Appeals found merit in the administrative law claim, holding that portions of the execution protocol directing the manner of administering lethal injection were ineffective until either adopted as regulations in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act or exempted from those requirements by the Legislature. The court rejected Evans's other claims, including allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel under Wiggins v. Smith and racial discrimination in jury selection under Batson v. Kentucky.\n\nFollowing the Maryland Court of Appeals decision, the parties engaged in consent motions to delay compliance with court orders while the state worked on adopting proper regulations. The federal case remained stayed, with periodic status reports filed through at least 2012. Throughout the litigation, protective orders were in place to shield the identities of execution team members, and extensive discovery occurred regarding Maryland's execution procedures, training, and personnel qualifications. The case highlighted broader concerns about the administration of lethal injection nationwide and the intersection of medical ethics, constitutional requirements, and state administrative law in capital punishment procedures.",
    "CW-DC-0001": "On June 20, 1989, seven children in or at risk of entering the District of Columbia's foster care system filed a class action lawsuit in federal district court against the Mayor and other DC officials responsible for child welfare services. The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union's Children's Rights Project and other attorneys, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that the District's child welfare system violated their rights under federal statutes including the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, the District's Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act of 1977, and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The class encompassed approximately 2,500 children in the District's legal or physical custody due to abuse or neglect, as well as thousands more children known to be at risk but not in custody.\n\nAfter a two-week bench trial in February 1991 before Judge Thomas F. Hogan, during which the court heard extensive testimony and accepted over 1,000 stipulated facts, the court issued a comprehensive 102-page opinion finding the District liable. The court concluded that the District's child welfare system failed to comply with federal law, District law, and constitutional requirements. The evidence revealed systemic failures including uninvestigated abuse reports, excessive worker caseloads, children remaining in \"emergency care\" for years rather than the mandated 90 days, lack of case planning, inappropriate placements, untrained workers and foster parents, and absence of services to families. Children in the District's foster care remained there an average of nearly five years—more than three times the national average.\n\nFollowing the liability finding, the parties negotiated an 84-page consent decree that was entered as a Modified Final Order on November 18, 1993, after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals remanded with instructions to base the order entirely on District law rather than federal law. The order required comprehensive reforms including timely investigations of abuse reports within 48 hours, provision of services to prevent removals, appropriate placements in family-like settings, development of case plans, regular visitation, and numerous other specific requirements. The Center for the Study of Social Policy was appointed as Court Monitor to oversee implementation.\n\nWhen the District failed to comply with the remedial order, Judge Hogan held the defendants in contempt in May 1995 and imposed a general receivership over the entire child welfare system. The receivership continued until 2001, during which time court-appointed receivers directly managed the system with authority to override local law when necessary to achieve compliance. Even after the receivership ended, the District remained under court supervision with detailed implementation plans setting specific performance benchmarks and deadlines. Limited receiverships were reimposed in certain areas when compliance faltered.\n\nThroughout the case's multi-decade history, monitoring reports documented both progress and persistent challenges. While the number of children in foster care decreased significantly and some standards were met, core problems persisted including untimely investigations, inadequate services to families, inappropriate placements, and lack of permanency planning. As late as 2019, the parties were still negotiating exit and sustainability plans, with the Monitor continuing to assess compliance with remaining requirements thirty years after the initial filing."
