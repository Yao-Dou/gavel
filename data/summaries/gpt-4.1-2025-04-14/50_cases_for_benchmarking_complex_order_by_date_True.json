    "46567": "This case was filed on May 5, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island by a Venezuelan national detained at the Wyatt Detention Facility. The petitioner, represented by private attorneys and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), seeks a writ of habeas corpus and injunctive relief, challenging his imminent removal from the United States under a presidential proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), 50 U.S.C. §§ 21–24. The respondents are federal executive officials and departments, including the President (in his official capacity), Attorney General, Secretaries of Homeland Security, State, and Defense, as well as regional and facility-level immigration officials.\n\nThe petitioner claims that the President’s March 14, 2025, Proclamation unlawfully invokes the AEA to authorize the summary removal of certain Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang. The Proclamation designates these individuals as “alien enemies” and permits their immediate removal—without the procedural protections typically afforded under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), Convention Against Torture (CAT), or due process. The petitioner argues that the AEA only applies in times of declared war or actual military invasion by a foreign nation or government, neither of which, he asserts, exist with respect to Venezuela or the TdA. The petitioner denies any gang affiliation and claims he is at risk of summary removal based on unreliable identification criteria such as tattoos. He has a pending asylum application and fears persecution or torture if removed to El Salvador or Venezuela.\n\nThe petitioner seeks a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent his removal while the case is pending, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting application of the Proclamation to him without adequate notice and an opportunity to respond. The asserted causes of action include violations of the AEA, INA, CAT, and the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, as well as the Suspension Clause.\n\nJudge Melissa R. DuBose is presiding over the matter. On the day of filing, the court issued an order requiring at least 48 hours’ advance notice before the petitioner could be moved outside Rhode Island. This was later amended to require 72 business hours’ advance notice to the court and the petitioner before any such transfer. The court has not ruled on the ultimate merits or issued a final injunction as of the latest docket entries.\n\nThe case is part of a broader context of nationwide litigation challenging the same Proclamation. Several federal courts (including in D.C., Texas, Colorado, and New York) have issued preliminary or permanent injunctions against similar removals, finding likely statutory and constitutional violations. Notable reported opinions cited include J.G.G. v. Trump, 2025 WL 825115; J.A.V. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1257450; D.B.U. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1163530; and G.F.F. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1166480.\n\nThe underlying factual basis includes evidence that individuals have been removed under the Proclamation without meaningful notice or opportunity to contest their designation as gang members, sometimes based on questionable criteria. At least 137 Venezuelans were sent to a Salvadoran prison under these procedures, and reports suggest many had no connection to TdA. The petitioner specifically alleges he was denied a bond hearing and identified as a TdA member without opportunity to testify, based solely on physical characteristics.\n\nTo date, the court’s orders have preserved the petitioner’s presence in Rhode Island pending further proceedings, but no trial or final judgment has occurred, and there is no record of settlement, appeals, or court-appointed monitoring. The case continues as part of broader national litigation over the scope of executive authority under the Alien Enemies Act and attendant due process protections.",
    "46582": "On April 30, 2025, a habeas corpus petition and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas by a Palestinian woman residing in the United States since 2016. The petitioner, represented by private counsel and advocacy organizations including the Texas Civil Rights Project, Southern Poverty Law Center, CUNY School of Law, and Muslim Advocates, challenges her ongoing detention by federal immigration authorities.\n\nThe petitioner had lawfully entered the United States on a tourist visa and later became a student in New Jersey, maintaining lawful status until 2022, when she withdrew from her student visa program based on erroneous advice. While living in New Jersey, she attended peaceful demonstrations supporting Palestinian rights, including an April 2024 protest near Columbia University. She was arrested at the protest for a local ordinance violation, but the charges were promptly dismissed.\n\nIn March 2025, following a series of executive orders and policies issued by President Trump targeting noncitizens perceived as supporting Palestinian rights, federal agents investigated the petitioner, focusing on her protest activities and a single monetary transfer to a family member in Palestine. Despite finding no evidence of national security violations, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents detained her after a voluntary interview, transferred her over 1,500 miles from her home to the Prairieland Detention Facility in Texas, and publicly accused her of supporting terrorism without substantiation.\n\nAn immigration judge found that the petitioner was neither a danger to the community nor a flight risk and granted her release on a $20,000 bond on April 3, 2025. Nonetheless, DHS exercised its regulatory authority to appeal and automatically stay her release, resulting in her continued detention without further judicial review for up to 130 days. The petitioner alleges that this continued confinement is in retaliation for her protected speech and association, in violation of her First Amendment rights, and that the procedures applied to her, including the automatic stay, violate her Fifth Amendment rights to procedural and substantive due process.\n\nThe petitioner further claims that her confinement at the Prairieland Detention Facility has resulted in severe deprivations, including overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, denial of adequate medical care, and, critically, ongoing violations of her religious freedom. As a practicing Muslim, she alleges she has been denied halal meals, appropriate accommodations for prayer, and modest clothing by the facility’s warden and ICE field office director, in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.\n\nThe legal foundation for her claims includes habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and RFRA. The remedies sought are her immediate release from detention, declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent further violations of her constitutional and statutory rights, and court orders prohibiting future re-detention absent specific procedural safeguards.\n\nThe case is presided over by Judge Rebecca Rutherford, Magistrate Judge, with oversight from District Judge Sam A. Lindsay. Significant filings include a motion for preliminary injunction seeking release pending judgment, which was heard on June 5, 2025, with the petitioner participating remotely. On June 27, 2025, the magistrate judge recommended that the petitioner be immediately released from detention pending final judgment, a recommendation that remains pending before the district judge following objections from both parties.\n\nThere are no consolidated or directly related cases in this court, but the complaint references parallel enforcement actions and similar challenges brought by other noncitizens detained or targeted under the same executive orders. No trial has been held to date, and the case is ongoing.\n\nThe petitioner’s confinement arises from the federal government’s new policy targeting noncitizens for immigration enforcement based on their perceived support for Palestinian rights, with the government relying on protest participation and protected association as grounds for adverse action. The petitioner alleges that, in her case, these actions have led to unlawful and retaliatory detention and severe violations of her religious and constitutional rights.",
    "46496": "On April 24, 2025, three nonprofit organizations—Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, Southern Border Communities Coalition, and Urban Justice Center—filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. The plaintiffs, represented by private and advocacy counsel (including Public Citizen and Democracy Forward Foundation), challenge DHS’s March 21, 2025, decision to close three internal oversight offices: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS Ombudsman Office), and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO).\n\nThe plaintiffs, all organizations that regularly interact with these oversight offices on behalf of their members or clients, allege that the closure was abrupt and total. Nearly all employees of the three offices were placed on administrative leave and issued reduction-in-force notices with separation dates of May 23, 2025. The government instructed employees not to perform any official duties, including processing pending complaints or transferring cases. Congressional appropriations for these offices for fiscal year 2024 remained in place at the time of closure.\n\nThe plaintiffs bring their action under the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging that the elimination of the oversight offices was ultra vires and violated Congress’s statutory directives. Specifically, the plaintiffs assert that Congress mandated the existence and functioning of these offices through various provisions in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. §§ 345, 272, and 205) and related appropriations. The plaintiffs also claim that the shutdown was arbitrary and capricious under the APA (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)), exceeded statutory authority (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)), violated the constitutional separation of powers, and flouted the Impoundment Control Act and Anti-Deficiency Act.\n\nThe remedy sought is declaratory and injunctive relief, specifically an order requiring DHS to restore the CRCL, CIS Ombudsman, and OIDO offices, reinstate employees and contractors necessary to carry out their statutory functions, resume complaint processing, and refrain from further actions impeding the offices’ operations.\n\nJudge Ana C. Reyes presides over the matter. The case does not involve class action plaintiffs, consolidated, or directly related cases, though the plaintiffs’ advocacy is tied to other ongoing litigation and administrative oversight efforts.\n\nPlaintiffs filed motions for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order to halt the dissolution and require immediate reinstatement of the offices’ functions. Evidentiary hearings and status conferences were held in May and June 2025, during which the government contended that it was taking steps to re-staff the offices and resume statutory functions, while plaintiffs disputed the effectiveness and good faith of these efforts. The record contains references to ongoing disputes over the government’s hiring process, budgetary statements suggesting possible elimination of OIDO, and the lack of adequate staff to perform statutory functions.\n\nAs of July 2025, the Court has not issued a final ruling on the merits or entered a decree. The preliminary injunction motion was denied as moot following a joint motion for expedited discovery and summary judgment briefing, and the case is proceeding toward dispositive motions. No settlement or consent decree has been reached, and there is no court-appointed monitor or reported opinions to date.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on the plaintiffs’ regular use of DHS oversight offices to address civil rights, immigration, and detention-related complaints, and their asserted harm from losing these avenues for redress. Plaintiffs allege that the closures have impeded their ability to advocate for clients, forced them to use less effective or more burdensome alternatives, and undermined congressional oversight of DHS activities.\n\nThe case remains pending, with summary judgment briefing scheduled and ongoing disputes regarding the restoration and future funding of the oversight offices.",
    "46432": "This case was filed on April 18, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota by a Bangladeshi national who was a 20-year-old student lawfully enrolled at Minnesota State University, Mankato, on an F-1 visa. The petitioner was represented by private counsel from Fredrikson & Byron, the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, The Advocates for Human Rights, and the University of Minnesota Detainee Rights Clinic. The respondents were federal and local officials responsible for immigration enforcement and detention, including the President of the United States, the Attorney General, senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Secretary of State, and local county officials.\n\nThe petitioner challenged his continued detention by federal immigration authorities after being arrested on March 28, 2025, following the purported revocation of his visa and termination of his SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System) record. At the time of his arrest, he was in good academic standing and had no disqualifying immigration violations. The government initially cited failure to maintain status and later invoked visa revocation and public safety rationales. The petitioner alleged that his enforcement was not based on any legitimate immigration violation but was in retaliation for his public speech, particularly his advocacy for Palestinian human rights on social media. He claimed his arrest was part of a broader campaign targeting international students for their political expression.\n\nThe legal claims were brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas corpus), alleging violations of the First Amendment (free speech), Fifth Amendment (due process), and the Administrative Procedure Act. The petitioner sought immediate release, declaratory and injunctive relief, and a halt to any transfer or removal from the district pending adjudication.\n\nAfter the petitioner was ordered released on bond by an Immigration Judge, federal authorities invoked an automatic administrative stay, preventing his release without individualized findings of danger or flight risk. The petitioner’s subsequent requests for emergency relief resulted in a temporary restraining order on April 22, 2025, by Judge Jerry W. Blackwell, barring his removal or transfer from the district. The TRO was repeatedly extended through June 17, 2025, for good cause, to preserve the court’s jurisdiction and prevent irreparable harm.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Judge Blackwell granted the petitioner’s motion for release on bail pending adjudication, finding that the petitioner presented substantial constitutional claims and faced exceptional circumstances, including deteriorating medical conditions and ongoing academic harm. The court found that the government’s justification for detention shifted over time and was not supported by the evidence.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, the court granted the petition for writ of habeas corpus, concluding that the petitioner’s arrest and detention violated the First Amendment because they were motivated by protected political speech, and that the government failed to show it would have taken the same action absent that speech. The court also found violations of the Fifth Amendment due process clause, both because the detention served punitive or retaliatory purposes and because the government invoked the automatic stay provision without any individualized showing or meaningful opportunity for review. Additionally, the court determined that the termination of the petitioner’s SEVIS record was arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law or agency policy, thus violating the Administrative Procedure Act. The petitioner was ordered to remain released under the original bond and conditions set by the Immigration Judge.\n\nThe final judgment was entered on June 18, 2025, granting the writ and maintaining the petitioner’s release. No trial was held, as the matter was resolved on the written record. The government appealed the decision to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Jerry W. Blackwell presided over all rulings. No settlement, court-appointed monitor, or disputes over settlement enforcement occurred. The case referenced but did not consolidate with several similar cases involving international students and immigration enforcement in the district. The factual basis centered on the petitioner’s protected speech, the shifting and pretextual enforcement rationale, and the lack of lawful grounds for detention.",
    "46477": "This case was filed on April 14, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan by a group of international students and recent graduates from public universities and vocational programs in Michigan and several other states. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, challenged actions taken by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its officials, including the DHS Secretary, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Detroit ICE Field Office Director. The plaintiffs are individuals (not a certified class) whose F-1 or M-1 nonimmigrant student status records were terminated in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), which tracks the status of foreign students.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that DHS terminated their SEVIS records without valid regulatory grounds, causing immediate adverse consequences including loss of employment authorization, disruption of studies, risk of arrest or removal, and uncertainty regarding their legal status. The terminations were justified by DHS as relating to criminal records checks or visa revocations, but the plaintiffs denied any qualifying criminal convictions or immigration violations that would support loss of status under the applicable regulations. The underlying cause of action is based on the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), with the plaintiffs claiming the agency action was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)), and also alleged violations of the Due Process Clause of the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to set aside the SEVIS terminations, restore their records, prevent further adverse action absent valid grounds, and prohibit arrest, detention, or removal based on the terminations. Judge Jane M. Beckering presided over the case. On April 23, 2025, the court granted a Temporary Restraining Order requiring DHS to restore the plaintiffs’ SEVIS records retroactively, refrain from terminating or altering these records without lawful cause, and prohibit related enforcement actions. The court found that plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on their APA claims, irreparable harm absent relief, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored interim relief.\n\nFollowing further briefing and a hearing on May 6, 2025, the court issued a Preliminary Injunction on May 7, 2025, continuing the protections of the TRO throughout the pendency of the case. The order required DHS to keep the plaintiffs’ SEVIS records active, to annotate the records as restored retroactively, and to ensure that no adverse immigration actions would be taken based on the terminations. The court again found no regulatory or statutory basis for the terminations and rejected DHS’s arguments that general statutory authority permitted the actions. The court waived the security requirement for injunctive relief and denied a motion to hold DHS in contempt after the agency restored the records.\n\nThe case did not proceed to trial during the period covered by the record. On July 7, 2025, DHS officials filed an interlocutory appeal of the preliminary injunction order. As of the last docket entry, the case remained pending, with the preliminary injunction in place and no final judgment entered. There were no class claims, no consolidated or related cases identified in the record, and no court-appointed monitor or reported monitor’s findings. The court’s decrees are court-enforced, and compliance disputes were resolved during the preliminary phase. The factual basis of the case centered on the abrupt and unilateral termination of lawful student status records without notice or lawful justification under U.S. immigration law and regulations.",
    "46239": "This case was filed on March 17, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by Erie County, New York, a municipal entity, against the Corporation for National and Community Service (AmeriCorps) and its interim agency head, Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, in her official capacity. Erie County was represented by private counsel from Gerstein Harrow LLP.\n\nThe dispute centered on a federal grant awarded to Erie County under the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), which funds community-based volunteer services for older adults, including Meals on Wheels. Erie County applied for a three-year, approximately $250,000 grant in October 2023, and the grant was approved in January 2024. AmeriCorps regulations, in place since 1999, require grantees to establish advisory councils “of a diverse composition that reflects the demographics of the service area.” Erie County’s grant application described its efforts to foster diversity and inclusion within its volunteer programs and advisory council, in compliance with these rules.\n\nAfter the grant was awarded, President Trump issued Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 in January 2025, directing federal agencies to end “equity-related” programs and require grant recipients to certify that they do not “promote DEI” (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) activities in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws. In February 2025, AmeriCorps notified Erie County that language in its grant application referencing diversity and DEI required clarification and requested that Erie County either certify it did not promote DEI activities, amend its application, or relinquish the grant. Erie County responded that it adhered to AmeriCorps guidelines, but AmeriCorps insisted on a specific certification. The agency also indicated that failure to respond could result in grant termination, though it suspended enforcement while a preliminary injunction against the executive orders was in effect in a separate case.\n\nErie County filed suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that AmeriCorps’ new certification requirements were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act and violated the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution by imposing vague and unauthorized conditions on federal funding. Erie County moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent AmeriCorps from enforcing the new certification requirement and to ensure continued disbursement of grant funds.\n\nThe case was assigned to Chief Judge James E. Boasberg. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that Erie County was not at imminent risk of irreparable harm, that any dispute was not ripe, that the court lacked jurisdiction, and that AmeriCorps’ actions were within its discretion under grant statutes and regulations.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, before the court ruled on any substantive motions, Erie County voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice, stating that AmeriCorps had changed its certification requirements since the filing of the suit. No reported opinions, trials, decrees, settlements, or monitors were issued in this matter. There were no related or consolidated cases in this docket, though the parties referenced a preliminary injunction in a separate District of Maryland case challenging the same executive orders.",
    "46230": "This case was filed on March 14, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by twelve individual plaintiffs, all career civil servants formerly employed in the Office of Equity Assurance (OEA) within the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), part of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, challenged actions taken by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs following the issuance of Executive Order 14151 by President Trump on January 20, 2025, which directed the termination of all federal diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) programs and related offices.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that, in the wake of this executive order, the VA erroneously designated the OEA as a DEIA office, placed all OEA employees on administrative leave, and subsequently initiated a reduction in force (RIF) resulting in their terminations. The plaintiffs claimed that these actions were taken without proper notice, due process, or opportunities for reassignment, and that the RIF procedures deviated from established agency practice and relevant regulations. They asserted that, unlike other affected offices, the VA denied them access to various employment benefits and professional opportunities, stigmatized them as DEIA employees, and impeded their future federal employment prospects.\n\nThe legal claims were brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the First Amendment (freedom of speech and association), and the Fifth Amendment (due process and equal protection), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to bar the VA from designating OEA and its staff as DEIA-related, as well as compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees.\n\nJudge Rudolph Contreras presided over the case. Early in the proceedings, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to halt their designation as DEIA employees and restore access to employment resources. The court denied this motion on May 2, 2025, after a hearing, for reasons stated on the record. No reported written opinions were issued on the merits of the claims, and the docket reflects no trial or decision on the merits.\n\nAlthough the plaintiffs initially identified the case as related to another federal lawsuit (Perkins Coie LLP v. U.S. Department of Justice et al., No. 1:25-cv-00716), the court found the cases were not factually or transactionally related and reassigned this matter randomly. There is no indication of consolidated cases, decrees, settlements, court-appointed monitors, or appeals.\n\nOn July 17, 2025, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice. No court-enforced settlement or decree was entered, and no further disputes or monitoring were recorded.\n\nThe underlying factual basis for the case centered on the plaintiffs' role in the OEA, which was tasked with identifying and addressing disparities in the delivery of veterans’ benefits. The plaintiffs contended they were not engaged in DEIA work as characterized by the executive order and that the government’s actions—publicly and administratively—damaged their reputations and careers, and violated their legal rights. The court’s denial of emergency relief and the subsequent voluntary dismissal concluded the litigation at the district court level.",
    "46242": "This case was filed on March 5, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah. The parties bringing the suit are BlueRibbon Coalition, Inc. (a national non-profit focused on public land access), the Sage Riders Motorcycle Club (a Utah-based recreational group), and an individual member, Paul Wells. They are represented by private counsel. The defendants are the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Department of the Interior, both federal agencies responsible for public land management.\n\nThe dispute centers on BLM’s approval of the San Rafael Swell Travel Management Plan (TMP), finalized on December 31, 2024, which closed 665 miles of routes to motorized use within the San Rafael Swell Travel Management Area in Emery County, Utah. The plaintiffs allege that these closures were adopted in violation of several federal statutes, including the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act (“Dingell Act”), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Specifically, they claim that BLM’s TMP unlawfully created “buffer zones” around new wilderness areas, closed access to historic and recreational sites, and failed to adequately consider public input or provide required environmental review. Plaintiffs also argue that the agency relied on invalid or improperly authorized regulations and failed to comply with required procedures for approving and implementing the travel plan.\n\nThe causes of action are founded on the APA (5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706), the Dingell Act (16 U.S.C. § 1132 et seq.), and NEPA (42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)), with the plaintiffs seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to set aside the TMP and enjoin its enforcement. They also request attorneys’ fees and costs. No class action is involved; the plaintiffs act in their organizational and individual capacities.\n\nThe case is presided over by Judge David Nuffer. Early proceedings included the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief to halt implementation of the TMP, arguing irreparable harm if route closures and physical obliteration of trails proceed before the case is resolved. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA), a conservation non-profit, moved to intervene as a defendant, citing its longstanding interest in protecting the area’s environmental and cultural resources. The court granted SUWA’s intervention as of right on April 21, 2025, finding that SUWA’s interests might be impaired and were not adequately represented by the federal defendants.\n\nNo trial, settlement, consent decree, or monitor has been established as of the most recent docket entries. The case is proceeding on an administrative record, with a briefing schedule ordered for dispositive motions and review under the APA.\n\nThe factual basis of the dispute includes a history of contentious travel management planning in the San Rafael Swell, extensive public input, previous litigation and settlement over BLM’s management of OHV routes, and the recent congressional designation of new wilderness and recreation areas. Plaintiffs allege that the TMP’s route closures exceed BLM’s statutory authority, fail to comply with environmental review requirements, and deprive them of recreational access and access to historic property. The federal agencies and intervenor contest these claims, defending the TMP as a lawful exercise of BLM’s land management discretion and consistent with federal law. The litigation is ongoing.",
    "46039": "On February 4, 2025, a professional association representing FBI agents, alongside several current FBI personnel (special agents, forensic specialists, and analysts), filed suit against the U.S. Department of Justice and the United States in the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and nonprofit legal organizations, brought the case in response to anticipated public disclosure of their identities and roles in federal investigations and prosecutions related to the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that following the inauguration of President Trump in January 2025, the administration issued sweeping pardons for individuals prosecuted for January 6-related offenses. The complaint details a subsequent campaign of public threats and harassment by some pardon recipients and administration allies targeting law enforcement personnel involved in those investigations. The plaintiffs further allege that senior Department of Justice officials initiated efforts to collect and possibly disseminate lists identifying FBI employees who participated in January 6 and other politically sensitive investigations, including requiring agents to submit detailed questionnaires about their roles. Plaintiffs contend that these actions were accompanied by the firing or forced resignation of numerous prosecutors and agents, and the threat of further mass terminations.\n\nThe legal claims arise under the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a), the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706), and the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs allege violations of the Privacy Act’s restrictions on disclosure of records (§ 552a(b)), requirements for accuracy in dissemination (§ 552a(e)(6)), First Amendment retaliation based on perceived political affiliation, and Fifth Amendment due process and privacy violations. They seek injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent the public release or dissemination of personally identifying information about FBI personnel involved in these investigations, as well as writs of mandamus to compel the government to rescind allegedly unlawful termination orders.\n\nJudge Jia M. Cobb presides over the case. It was consolidated with a related action filed by other individual FBI employees raising nearly identical claims. Plaintiffs promptly moved for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) to prevent disclosure or further collection of agent information. The government opposed, arguing that the information gathering was an internal process permitted under the Privacy Act, that no names were to be released publicly, and that any claims of imminent harm were speculative. The government stated that only anonymized data had been shared within the Department of Justice, and that no public disclosure was planned.\n\nOn February 7, 2025, the court entered a consent order, with the government agreeing not to publicly disseminate the list of FBI personnel (including any versions linking unique identifiers to names) pending a ruling on plaintiffs’ anticipated motion for preliminary injunction. The order allows the government, with two business days’ notice, to terminate this restriction in the future at its discretion. The case remains at the preliminary injunction stage, with further briefing scheduled. No reported opinions, trial, decree, settlement, or appeals have occurred to date.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on high-level government actions following the 2025 presidential inauguration, including mass pardons, reported targeting of law enforcement personnel for termination, and the threatened public identification of agents involved in politically sensitive investigations, all set against a backdrop of documented threats and harassment against such personnel. Plaintiffs allege these actions present ongoing risks to their safety, reputations, and employment, and violate statutory and constitutional protections.",
    "46681": "On February 3, 2025, a private citizen filed suit in the U.S. Court of International Trade challenging the President’s imposition of tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. The plaintiff acted pro se, without attorney representation, and brought the case against the United States and President Donald J. Trump. The plaintiff alleged that recent executive orders imposing tariffs violated Article I, Sections 7 and 8 of the U.S. Constitution by usurping Congress’s exclusive authority to impose tariffs and raise revenue, thereby breaching the separation of powers. The complaint also challenged several federal statutes and legislative acts, including the Tariff Act of 1930, the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1934, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the Trade Act of 1974, and the National Emergencies Act of 1976, under which the President asserted authority to act. The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the collection of these tariffs, a ruling that the President cannot constitutionally be delegated tariff-imposing powers, and an order compelling the President to adhere to constitutional duties. The plaintiff did not seek a jury trial.\n\nThe United States, represented by the Department of Justice, moved to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(1), arguing lack of Article III standing and prudential standing. The government contended that the plaintiff, as a consumer rather than an importer, did not allege a particularized or concrete injury traceable to the tariffs or redressable by the court, and that only parties directly affected by the tariffs—such as importers—were properly situated to challenge their validity.\n\nJudge Jennifer Choe-Groves presided over the case. On May 23, 2025, the court granted the government’s motion to dismiss without prejudice, holding that the plaintiff failed to establish Article III standing. The court found the plaintiff’s alleged injury—a general breach of the constitutional contract and speculative economic harm as a consumer—was neither concrete nor particularized, but rather shared broadly with the public. As a result, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and did not address the merits of the constitutional claims. No trial was held, no decree or settlement was entered, and there were no reported opinions or appeals at this stage. The court granted the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint to address the identified deficiencies by June 23, 2025.",
    "46758": "On June 20, 2025, a group of individual Latino residents of the Los Angeles area—some U.S. citizens, some lawful residents, and some noncitizens—along with three membership organizations representing workers and immigrants, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The case is a putative class action. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel, including attorneys from legal services and civil rights organizations. The defendants are senior officials and agencies of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), represented by government counsel.\n\nThe case arises from “Operation At Large,” a large-scale federal immigration enforcement operation launched in Los Angeles on June 6, 2025. Plaintiffs alleged that federal agents, organized in “contact teams” or “roving patrols,” were conducting widespread stops and detentions of individuals in public places and at businesses such as carwashes, bus stops, and Home Depots, targeting people based on apparent race or ethnicity, language, location, and type of work. Numerous sworn declarations described stops where agents detained and interrogated individuals, sometimes using force or threats, without reasonable suspicion or probable cause that the persons were unlawfully present in the United States. U.S. citizens and lawful residents were among those stopped.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the U.S. Constitution, specifically alleging violations of the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable seizures. They sought injunctive and declaratory relief to prohibit federal agents from conducting detentive stops for immigration enforcement without individualized, reasonable suspicion that a person is unlawfully present in the United States. They also sought class certification for a class of all individuals at risk of such stops in the Central District of California.\n\nJudge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong presided over the case. After expedited briefing, on July 11, 2025, the district court granted plaintiffs’ applications for a temporary restraining order (TRO). The order enjoined federal defendants from conducting detentive stops in the Central District unless agents had reasonable suspicion that the person stopped was unlawfully present, and specifically prohibited reliance solely on apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at certain locations, or type of work as bases for reasonable suspicion. The court found plaintiffs likely to succeed in showing that the challenged stops were part of an officially sanctioned pattern of conduct not supported by reasonable suspicion and that such practices were likely to recur, warranting district-wide injunctive relief.\n\nThe federal defendants appealed the TRO to the Ninth Circuit and sought a stay. The Ninth Circuit, in a published order on August 1, 2025 (25-4312), denied the stay in all respects except to suspend the clause “except as permitted by law” in the district court’s order as impermissibly vague. The appellate court affirmed the district court’s findings that plaintiffs and the class had standing, that a pattern of stops without reasonable suspicion was likely to recur, and that the TRO’s substantive terms were consistent with the Fourth Amendment and not impermissibly vague or overbroad, given the scope and nature of the relief sought.\n\nSeparately, one named individual plaintiff, Carlos Osorto, sought and obtained habeas corpus relief from immigration detention. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym granted his ex parte application for release on July 30, 2025. The court found that Osorto’s ongoing detention, combined with inconsistent positions taken by DHS regarding his entitlement to a bond hearing and his serious medical needs, constituted extraordinary circumstances justifying immediate release on a $5,000 bond and electronic monitoring.\n\nThe case has involved multiple important filings, including motions for TRO, opposition briefs, reply briefs, motions to intervene by city and county governments, and motions for class certification and preliminary injunctions. No trial has taken place as of August 2025, and proceedings on preliminary injunction and class certification are ongoing. Reported opinions include 2025 WL 1915964 (district court TRO) and the Ninth Circuit’s published order on the stay.\n\nNo settlement or consent decree has been entered, and the TRO remains in effect (as modified by the Ninth Circuit). The court’s order is district-wide but limited to the Central District of California. The court has not appointed a monitor. The factual basis for the case centers on federal immigration enforcement practices in Los Angeles in June and July 2025, involving widespread stops and detentions based on broad profiles rather than individualized suspicion.",
    "46378": "The case was filed on April 10, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan by four international students—two at the University of Michigan and two at Wayne State University—against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, and the Detroit Field Office Director of ICE, all in their official capacities. The students were represented by private counsel, including cooperating attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union Fund of Michigan.\n\nThe students alleged that, beginning around April 4, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its agencies terminated their active records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a federal database used to monitor noncitizen students in the United States. The terminations were reportedly based on either criminal history checks or visa revocations, as reflected in SEVIS termination notices received by the students’ universities. The students stated that they had not been convicted of any crimes; some had only minor prior encounters with law enforcement, such as dismissed arrests or traffic violations. Two students were notified by the Department of State that their visas were “prudentially” revoked, while the other two were not notified of any visa action.\n\nThe students claimed they received no advance notice, explanation, or opportunity to respond before the SEVIS terminations, and only learned of the actions through their universities. They asserted that these actions placed them at risk of immediate removal, loss of student status, loss of employment, and disruption of their education and future prospects. The complaint also alleged that these SEVIS terminations were part of a broader, nationwide pattern affecting hundreds of international students at numerous U.S. universities.\n\nThe core legal claims were that the government’s actions violated the students’ Fifth Amendment procedural due process rights and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Specifically, the students argued that SEVIS record termination amounted to termination of F-1 student status, for which federal regulations require cause and due process. They sought emergency relief—including a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction—requiring restoration of their SEVIS records and F-1 status, prohibiting removal or detention based on the terminations, and preventing further adverse actions without proper process.\n\nThe government opposed the emergency relief, arguing that SEVIS is an administrative database that does not, by itself, control or conclusively reflect a student’s lawful immigration status. The government stated that the termination of SEVIS records did not equate to termination of F-1 status, that the students were not subject to removal proceedings, and that no immediate harm or irreparable injury was present. The government also noted that the students could seek administrative reinstatement of their status and that judicial review under the APA was not available because no final agency action affecting legal rights had occurred.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, Judge Stephen J. Murphy III denied the motion for a temporary restraining order. The court found the factual and legal record insufficient to determine whether the SEVIS terminations were synonymous with loss of F-1 status or had independent legal consequences. The court noted that the government expressly disclaimed any current intent to remove the students or to treat them as out of status, and that the plaintiffs had not shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm. The judge set a schedule for further briefing and an evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction. No final merits ruling or settlement had been entered as of the TRO denial, and no class action was asserted; the plaintiffs proceeded as individuals. No appeals or consolidated cases were referenced at this stage.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on the DHS’s termination of SEVIS records for several Michigan university students—without individualized notice or hearing—based on alleged criminal history or visa revocation, and the resulting risk of loss of lawful status, employment, and educational opportunity. The case remains pending, with further proceedings scheduled to resolve the plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.",
    "46385": "This case was filed on April 9, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs are two law professors and clinical legal educators at Northwestern University’s Pritzker School of Law—one the director of the Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic and the other a long-serving leader of the Center on Negotiation, Mediation, and Restorative Justice. The defendants are the United States House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce, its chair and subcommittee chair, all sued in their official capacities. Northwestern University, its president, and its board chair are named as nominal defendants due to their possession of the records at issue and because they are targets of the committee’s demands.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by private counsel, including attorneys from People’s Law Office, Loevy & Loevy, and the Center for Constitutional Rights.\n\nThe lawsuit arises from a March 27, 2025, letter from the House Committee demanding that Northwestern University produce extensive records related to the operation, funding, and governance of its legal clinics, particularly focusing on the plaintiffs’ clinics and the plaintiffs’ own employment records. The Committee’s stated justification was concern over the university’s provision of legal representation to pro-Palestinian protestors in a civil suit, which the Committee described as supporting “illegal, antisemitic conduct” and “left-wing political activism.”\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the Committee’s demands are not legitimately related to any valid legislative purpose and are instead intended to punish and intimidate institutions and individuals based on perceived political viewpoints and associations. The complaint asserts that such demands violate the First Amendment (freedom of speech, association, academic freedom, and right to petition), the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection guarantees, and the Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief—specifically, an order barring Northwestern from producing the demanded documents and declaring the Committee’s demands unconstitutional.\n\nThe factual background details a pattern of targeting by the federal government and Congress under the Trump Administration, including threats to withdraw federal funding from universities and punitive executive orders directed at law firms representing disfavored clients. The complaint outlines the clinics’ roles in providing legal services to marginalized individuals and describes the chilling effect and potential harm to students, clients, donors, and academic programs if Northwestern were to comply with the Committee’s demands.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent Northwestern from complying with the Committee’s deadline for document production, set for April 10, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. Central Time. Judge Andrea R. Wood, acting as emergency judge, held a hearing on the TRO motion on April 10, 2025. The motion was denied as moot and without prejudice; details as to the mootness were stated on the record but are not specified in the docket entry provided. The case was assigned to Judge Elaine E. Bucklo for further proceedings.\n\nNo reported judicial opinions have been issued to date. No trial has been held, and there is no indication of settlement or a court-enforced decree. As of June 24, 2025, the proceedings are stayed by joint motion of the parties, with a joint status report due in September 2025.\n\nThe underlying facts supporting the legal claims center on the Committee’s document demand targeting the clinics and their leadership, the context of broader executive and legislative actions aimed at suppressing certain speech and advocacy, and the threatened loss of federal funding. The plaintiffs argue these actions constitute unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination and threaten irreparable harm to academic freedom, legal advocacy, and the rights of clients and donors.\n\nNo consolidated or related cases are referenced as being joined for proceedings or directly connected. No special monitor or court-appointed oversight is involved.\n\nThe presiding judge for substantive proceedings is Judge Elaine E. Bucklo. The emergency motion was handled by Judge Andrea R. Wood as emergency judge.\n\nIn summary, this case presents constitutional challenges by faculty of a university legal clinic to congressional demands for sensitive information, arising in the context of wider federal efforts to control or punish advocacy and association deemed politically disfavored. The matter is currently stayed, with no final court ruling on the merits or injunctive relief as of the latest docket entries.",
    "46353": "This case was filed on April 7, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by an individual plaintiff, an international student employed under post-graduate STEM Optional Practical Training (OPT) and residing in the district. The plaintiff is represented by private counsel from Van Der Hout LLP and proceeds under a pseudonym due to concerns about retaliation.\n\nThe defendants are the President of the United States, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Acting Field Office Director of ICE’s San Francisco Office, all sued in their official capacities.\n\nThe plaintiff challenges ICE’s termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record, which ICE marked as “Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status” on March 28, 2025, citing a minor misdemeanor conviction. The plaintiff alleges that the conviction is not for a crime of violence, did not carry a potential sentence of more than one year, and was previously disclosed to DHS, which had granted immigration benefits thereafter. The complaint asserts that the college did not initiate the SEVIS termination and that the plaintiff remains in compliance with all F-1 visa requirements.\n\nThe plaintiff alleges that the federal government, since late March 2025, has engaged in a widespread policy of terminating SEVIS records and revoking visas for hundreds of international students, disproportionately affecting African, Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim, and Asian students. The complaint further alleges that these actions have led to arrests, detentions, and transfers of affected students to detention facilities far from their communities, without prior notice or process.\n\nThe legal claims are brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Declaratory Judgment Act, and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The plaintiff alleges that ICE lacked statutory or regulatory authority to terminate the SEVIS record based on the cited grounds, that the termination was arbitrary and capricious under the APA, and that the plaintiff was denied procedural due process. The complaint also alleges a discriminatory pattern in violation of the Accardi doctrine.\n\nThe statutory and constitutional bases invoked include 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(F)(i), 1227(a)(1)(C), 1372 (governing F-1 status and SEVIS), APA provisions (5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706), and the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief—specifically, to set aside the SEVIS termination, restore the SEVIS record and F-1 status, enjoin any enforcement action arising from the termination or minor conviction, and prevent detention, transfer, or removal during litigation.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White. Shortly after filing, the plaintiff moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent arrest, detention, or removal, and to preserve their ability to work and maintain status while the case proceeded. The government opposed, arguing that a SEVIS record termination does not itself terminate F-1 status, that no final agency action had occurred, and that the plaintiff had not shown irreparable harm.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, Judge White granted the TRO, enjoining defendants from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring the plaintiff, and prohibiting any legal effect from the SEVIS termination or potential visa revocation during the proceedings. The TRO was subsequently extended for an additional 14 days following a hearing on April 25, 2025. At that hearing, the government reported that SEVIS records for the plaintiff and similarly situated individuals were being restored to active status pending the issuance of a new policy governing SEVIS terminations.\n\nThe court scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing for May 13, 2025, and set a briefing schedule for further submissions on the merits and scope of relief. The parties engaged in further briefing, and the SEVIS record for the plaintiff was confirmed as reactivated, with a new Form I-20 issued by the school.\n\nSeveral related cases involving similar claims by other international students were consolidated or related before Judge White. As of the last available orders, the court’s temporary restraining order remains in effect, and the status of the case is ongoing, with preliminary injunction proceedings underway.\n\nThere are no reported opinions yet in this case. No settlement, decree, or monitor has been appointed, and no trial or appeal has occurred as of the date of the latest filings. The legal issues at stake concern the authority of ICE to terminate SEVIS records absent underlying status violations, the procedural rights of international students, and the legal consequences of SEVIS terminations for F-1 status and employment authorization.",
    "46337": "On April 3, 2025, nineteen states, each represented by their respective attorneys general, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the President of the United States, the Attorney General of the United States, the United States Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and its commissioners, and the Secretary of Defense. The states were represented by public (state attorney general) counsel. The case was assigned to Chief Judge Denise J. Casper.\n\nThe states challenged Executive Order No. 14248, issued by President Trump on March 25, 2025, which directed sweeping changes to federal election administration. The Executive Order required, among other things, (1) the EAC to amend the federal mail voter registration form to require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship, (2) the Secretary of Defense to require similar documentation for military and overseas voters using the federal post card application, (3) federal and state voter registration agencies to assess citizenship before providing registration forms to public assistance recipients, (4) enforcement against states whose laws allowed counting of mail ballots received after Election Day or permitted voters to cure minor ballot defects after Election Day, and (5) the conditioning of federal election funding on states’ compliance with a new ballot receipt deadline of Election Day.\n\nThe states argued that the Executive Order exceeded presidential authority, violated the Elections Clause and Electors Clause of the Constitution by usurping powers reserved to Congress and the states, and conflicted with the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). They sought a declaratory judgment and preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting enforcement of the challenged provisions.\n\nOn June 13, 2025, Judge Casper granted the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the states were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the Executive Order’s provisions requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration and military/overseas voting, pre-assessment of citizenship by public assistance agencies, federal enforcement against states’ ballot receipt laws, and conditioning of HAVA funding on compliance with an Election Day ballot receipt deadline were all unauthorized by the Constitution or federal statutes and intruded on state sovereignty. The court determined that these provisions would inflict imminent and irreparable harm on the states by imposing costly and disruptive new administrative burdens, threatening the loss of vital federal election funds, and potentially disenfranchising eligible voters.\n\nThe injunction specifically barred the EAC and its commissioners, the Secretary of Defense, and the Attorney General (but not the President in his official capacity) from: (1) implementing the documentary proof of citizenship requirement for the federal voter registration form and federal post card application; (2) requiring pre-assessment of citizenship by voter registration agencies before providing registration forms to public assistance recipients; (3) initiating civil or criminal enforcement actions against the thirteen plaintiff states whose laws allow counting of ballots received after Election Day or curing of ballots (California, Nevada, Massachusetts, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Rhode Island); and (4) conditioning federal election funding on adoption of an Election Day ballot receipt deadline for those states. The court also declined to require the states to post a bond.\n\nNo trial has been held yet, and the case remains at the preliminary injunction stage. The defendants have since filed a motion to dismiss and appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Judge Denise J. Casper presides. The case remains ongoing as of August 2025.\n\nThe factual basis underlying the case is that the Executive Order, if implemented, would require states to overhaul voter registration systems, impose new documentation and administrative requirements, threaten loss of critical federal election funds, and potentially disenfranchise eligible voters, including those lacking ready access to citizenship documents. The challenged provisions also conflict with longstanding state laws and practices regarding voter registration and ballot processing.",
    "46238": "This case was filed on March 17, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey by two individual plaintiffs, both transgender men who serve as active-duty members of the United States Air Force. The plaintiffs challenged a series of executive orders and implementing policies issued by President Donald J. Trump and the Department of Defense in early 2025, which reversed prior policy and banned transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. military. The challenged orders required all service members to serve in their birth sex and prohibited recognition of gender identity for purposes of military service, pronoun usage, and access to facilities. The plaintiffs, both of whom had previously transitioned and served openly under prior policy, alleged that these new orders led to immediate adverse actions, including forced administrative leave and the imminent threat of involuntary separation from service.\n\nThe plaintiffs were represented by private counsel as well as attorneys from civil rights organizations including GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders and the National Center for Lesbian Rights. The lawsuit was not a class action, but was brought by the individual service members. The defendants were the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force, and the Department of the Air Force, all sued in their official capacities.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted multiple causes of action under the U.S. Constitution, specifically alleging violations of the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. They argued that the new policies discriminated on the basis of sex and transgender status, lacked any rational or sufficient governmental justification, and were motivated by animus. They also asserted claims for procedural due process, estoppel, and injunctive relief.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Christine P. O’Hearn. On March 18, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent the initiation of administrative separation proceedings against them. The court, after briefing and oral argument, granted a 14-day TRO on March 24, 2025, enjoining the government from initiating separation actions against the plaintiffs based on their transgender status and from enforcing the challenged orders as to them. In her order, Judge O’Hearn found that the plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claims and faced immediate, irreparable harm if the policies were enforced.\n\nNo trial was held, and there were no reported opinions or appeals in this case. The court’s TRO was limited to the two individual plaintiffs and did not address classwide or nationwide relief. The case referenced a related nationwide preliminary injunction issued by a federal district court in the District of Columbia in the case Talbott v. United States, which enjoined enforcement of the same executive orders and policies on a nationwide basis.\n\nFollowing the issuance of the TRO and ongoing related litigation in other federal courts, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their case without prejudice on May 15, 2025. There were no consent decrees, settlements, or court-appointed monitors. The court did not retain jurisdiction following dismissal, and there are no reported disputes over enforcement.\n\nThe underlying facts of the case centered on the plaintiffs’ long and honorable military service, the abrupt change in federal policy banning transgender persons from military service, and the plaintiffs’ removal from duty and threatened discharge solely because of their transgender status. The remedy sought was injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent enforcement of the ban as to the plaintiffs and to protect their right to continue serving on equal terms.",
    "46234": "This case was filed on March 15, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, by a group consisting of a non-citizen graduate student at Cornell University (a citizen of the United Kingdom and The Gambia), his professor (a U.S. citizen), and another U.S. citizen graduate student. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel and lawyers from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and Project TAHA. The case was presided over by Judge Elizabeth C. Coombe.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged the enforcement of two executive orders issued by the President of the United States: Executive Order 14161, \"Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,\" and Executive Order 14188, \"Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism.\" The defendants included the President in his official capacity, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Secretary of DHS, and, in the amended complaint, the Department of State and its Secretary, the Attorney General, and relevant immigration officials.\n\nThe case was brought on behalf of both the individual plaintiffs and similarly situated persons but was not styled as a class action. The main plaintiff, a non-citizen Ph.D. student at Cornell, had a long record of advocacy for Palestinian rights and criticism of U.S. and Israeli government policies. The complaint alleged that, following issuance of the executive orders, the federal government began targeting non-citizen students for removal or criminal prosecution based on participation in protests and speech critical of the U.S. or Israeli governments, conflating such criticism with support for terrorism or anti-Semitism.\n\nThe legal claims were grounded in the First Amendment (freedom of speech, association, and the right to receive information), the Fifth Amendment (due process and vagueness), the Administrative Procedures Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Accardi doctrine. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to block enforcement of the executive orders as applied to protected speech and association, to enjoin the defendants from deporting or detaining the non-citizen based on his advocacy, and to vacate the revocation of his student visa.\n\nThe factual basis for the case included a pattern of public statements from the President and administration officials threatening to deport or prosecute students who participated in pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel protests, the active monitoring of universities, and actual enforcement actions, including the revocation of the main plaintiff's visa and attempts by DHS and ICE to locate and detain him. The complaint alleged that these actions chilled protected speech and association for both non-citizens and citizens.\n\nSignificant filings included motions for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement actions against the main plaintiff and to protect the speech rights of all plaintiffs. The court denied the TRO on March 27, 2025 (2025 WL 327875), ruling that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1252, and that plaintiffs had not established standing or a sufficient showing of imminent irreparable harm. The court found that the claims relating to the commencement of removal proceedings must be addressed through the immigration court process and, if necessary, on appeal after a final order of removal. The court also found the claims of the citizen plaintiffs insufficiently concrete or redressable at this stage.\n\nAn amended complaint and habeas petition were filed on March 27, 2025, adding further factual allegations and claims regarding the revocation of the visa and the process for removal. No trial or reported opinions occurred, and the case did not proceed to a final merits ruling. On March 31, 2025, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i), and the court ordered the case closed. There were no decrees, settlements, or court-appointed monitors. No appeals were filed as the case was dismissed at the plaintiffs’ request.\n\nIn summary, the case challenged the use of executive orders and related immigration enforcement actions against a non-citizen student and others on First and Fifth Amendment grounds, seeking to protect expressive and associational rights in the context of protests and campus advocacy, but was dismissed without prejudice following denial of interim injunctive relief and before resolution on the merits.",
    "46216": "This case was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on March 12, 2025, by two physicians and Harvard Medical School professors. The plaintiffs challenged the removal of their peer-reviewed medical articles from the federally funded Patient Safety Network (PSNet), an online resource operated by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The federal defendants included the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), its Acting Director, HHS and its Secretary, AHRQ, and AHRQ’s Acting Director. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Media Freedom & Information Access Clinic at Yale Law School.\n\nThe case arose after President Trump issued Executive Order 14168, “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” on January 20, 2025. The order directed federal agencies to remove any outward-facing media, including web content, that “promotes or inculcates gender ideology.” OPM implemented this directive through a memorandum mandating that all agencies take down such materials, citing its statutory authority. HHS and AHRQ responded by removing content from PSNet that contained terms such as “LGBTQ,” “transgender,” and related language, identified through targeted word searches.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ removed articles discussed diagnostic safety concerning suicide risk and endometriosis, each referencing higher risks or diagnostic considerations for LGBTQ and transgender individuals. The AHRQ notified the authors that their articles would only be restored if they agreed to delete or alter references to these terms, which the plaintiffs refused, asserting scientific integrity and accuracy.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought suit under the First Amendment, claiming unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination in a government-created limited public forum, and under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging that the agency actions were arbitrary and capricious and exceeded statutory authority. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including restoration of their censored materials and an order enjoining further censorship.\n\nJudge Leo T. Sorokin presided over the case. The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. After full briefing and a hearing, the Court granted the motion in part on May 23, 2025. The Court found that the removal of the articles constituted viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment and likely arbitrary and capricious action under the APA. Judge Sorokin ordered the defendants to restore, within seven days, the plaintiffs’ unaltered articles and all other content authored by private parties that was removed from PSNet pursuant to implementation of the Executive Order. The injunction did not require the court to supervise future content decisions or enjoin all possible future implementation of the Executive Order.\n\nAs of the Court’s ruling, PSNet’s technical support contract had expired, but the Court determined that restoration of the censored materials remained technically feasible and necessary to remedy ongoing constitutional harm. The litigation remains pending, with a motion to dismiss filed by the defendants on June 16, 2025, arguing mootness, lack of standing, and ripeness.\n\nNo trial has been held, no settlement or consent decree has been entered, and the preliminary injunction remains in effect pending further proceedings. There is no court-appointed monitor, nor have there been any reported disputes over settlement enforcement or decree compliance. The case is not a class action and involves only the two individual physician plaintiffs. There are no noted consolidated or related cases directly in this court, though reference is made to similar litigation in the District of Columbia.",
    "46207": "This case was filed on March 7, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by a group of incarcerated transgender individuals, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, the Transgender Law Center, Morgan Lewis LLP, and the ACLU Foundation of the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs brought the action on behalf of themselves and a class of all people in Bureau of Prisons (BOP) custody diagnosed with gender dysphoria who are or would be eligible for gender-affirming health care but for the ban imposed by Executive Order 14168 and its implementing memoranda. The defendants are the President of the United States, the Attorney General, and senior BOP officials, all sued in their official capacities.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges the implementation of Executive Order 14168, signed by President Trump on January 20, 2025, which directed the BOP to prohibit the use of federal funds for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug intended to conform an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex. The BOP issued two memoranda in February 2025 to implement this policy, resulting in the categorical denial of gender-affirming health care and accommodations, including hormone therapy and access to gender-affirming clothing or commissary items, for transgender inmates. Prior to the executive order, BOP policy allowed individualized, medically-indicated gender-affirming care in accordance with accepted medical standards.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that these actions violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment by denying medically necessary care, the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by discriminating on the basis of disability. They further allege that the BOP’s actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to constitutional right. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to set aside the challenged policies and require the BOP to restore access to gender-affirming care.\n\nJudge Royce C. Lamberth presides over the case. The court provisionally certified the class, finding numerosity, commonality, and adequacy of representation under Rule 23, and appointed plaintiffs’ counsel as class counsel. The court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and class certification on June 3, 2025, ordering the BOP to make available social accommodations and hormone therapy to all class members as previously provided before the executive order. The ruling was based on the likelihood of plaintiffs’ success on their APA claims, finding that the BOP’s actions lacked reasoned explanation, treated gender dysphoria differently from other medical conditions without justification, and failed to consider the reliance interests of affected inmates. The court did not reach the constitutional claims at this stage.\n\nNo trial has occurred, and the case is ongoing. There have been no reported appeals as of the date of the latest order. The court has not issued a final decree or settlement; preliminary injunctive relief remains in effect. The court has not appointed a monitor. The case is related to Doe v. McHenry, another challenge to federal prison policies affecting transgender inmates. The factual basis centers on the abrupt termination of gender-affirming care for transgender people in BOP custody, the resulting harms to class members’ health and well-being, and the administrative process leading up to and following the executive order.",

The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the defendants to process and produce records in response to eight FOIA requests—including two requests for expedited processing—concerning the activities, communications, and leadership of DOGE and its key personnel, particularly Elon Musk.\n\nThe underlying facts center on the creation and rapid expansion of DOGE, which was announced by President Trump in November 2024, with Elon Musk publicly identified as its head. DOGE was established through executive orders that restructured the U.S. Digital Service, created the USDS Temporary Organization, and embedded DOGE teams across at least fifteen federal agencies. Public reporting and the complaint allege DOGE staff, under Musk’s direction, exercised substantial authority: issuing directives to federal agencies, gaining access to sensitive government systems, freezing funds and contracts, and overseeing mass personnel actions. The White House and the government have issued conflicting statements about DOGE’s structure, Musk’s role, and to whom DOGE staff are accountable.\n\nOn January 30 and February 3, 2025, American Oversight submitted multiple FOIA requests to DOGE and OMB, seeking communications, records of key personnel, and information related to the firing of inspectors general from numerous agencies. The requests cited an urgent public interest due to widespread media attention and concerns over government integrity. The defendants acknowledged receipt of these requests but failed to issue determinations within the statutory deadlines or grant expedited processing. American Oversight alleges that DOGE failed to preserve potentially responsive records, including communications on ephemeral messaging platforms.\n\nThe case is before Judge Beryl A. Howell. There are no consolidated cases, but the complaint references other related litigation involving DOGE’s status and activities, including American Federation of Labor & Congress of Industrial Organizations v. Department of Labor and CREW v. U.S. DOGE Service, in which courts have examined similar agency status questions.\n\nKey filings include American Oversight’s motion for a preservation order, which the court granted, requiring the defendants to preserve all potentially responsive records. The defendants filed an answer denying or deflecting on most factual allegations regarding their agency status and the extent of their authority. A central dispute in the case is whether DOGE and its components are “agencies” subject to FOIA, or whether they fall within the President’s immediate personal staff and are therefore exempt. The court has not yet ruled on the merits of this question.\n\nAmerican Oversight filed a motion for limited discovery to obtain evidence regarding DOGE’s actual authority, structure, and operations, arguing that factual development is necessary to resolve whether DOGE wields independent authority and is thus subject to FOIA. The government opposes discovery, asserting the issue can be resolved as a matter of law.\n\nThe relief sought includes orders requiring the defendants to process all FOIA requests (including expedited requests), conduct adequate searches, and produce all non-exempt responsive records, along with Vaughn indexes for any claims of exemption. American Oversight also seeks attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nAs of the latest docket entries, the case remains in pre-discovery motion practice, with the court considering whether to permit limited discovery on the threshold question of DOGE’s agency status. No reported opinions or substantive rulings on the merits have yet been issued, and no decree, settlement, or monitoring has occurred. The plaintiff’s claims rest on both statutory interpretation and a detailed factual record regarding DOGE’s actual conduct and role within the executive branch.",
    "46602": "This case arises from actions taken by the federal government in 2025 to terminate longstanding federal grant funding for state and jurisdictional humanities councils across the United States. On May 15, 2025, the Oregon Council for the Humanities (a nonprofit distributing NEH funds in Oregon) and the Federation of State Humanities Councils (a national nonprofit whose members are nearly all such state councils) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. Both are represented by private counsel.\n\nThe lawsuit targets the United States DOGE Service (a newly created executive office component), its Acting Administrator, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the NEH’s advisory council, and NEH’s Acting Chairman. The plaintiffs challenge federal actions that began in March and April 2025, when DOGE and NEH leadership, acting on directives from the Trump Administration and pursuant to new executive orders, abruptly terminated nearly all NEH grants to state and jurisdictional humanities councils. This included the elimination of nearly all staff in NEH’s Office of Federal/State Partnership, mass termination of grants (including those already approved and in progress), and suspension or delay of reimbursements to the councils. The plaintiffs allege these actions were taken without notice, individualized review, or opportunity for appeal, and that they disregarded statutory funding formulas and procedures.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers, and related statutes. They alleged that the defendants’ actions violated the statutory framework governing NEH (20 U.S.C. § 956), which requires NEH to fund state humanities councils using mandatory formulas and to provide notice and hearing before terminating grants. Plaintiffs also alleged violations of the Appropriations Clause, the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), and the Take Care Clause, arguing that the executive branch cannot unilaterally refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress or bypass the statutory process for impounding or rescinding funds.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to set aside the grant terminations, compel NEH to allocate and disburse congressionally appropriated funds according to statutory formulas, and prohibit the reallocation of those funds for other purposes. They also requested a preliminary injunction to prevent further harm during litigation.\n\nAfter plaintiffs filed suit, NEH attempted a partial rescission, restoring some grant funding but at half the previous level, and maintained the termination of numerous other grants. Plaintiffs argued this did not cure the unlawfulness or the harm.\n\nJudge Michael H. Simon presided over the case. On August 6, 2025, the court granted in part the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and stay under the APA. The court found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of several claims. It held that NEH had violated both the Separation of Powers and federal law by refusing to spend appropriated funds as directed by Congress, failing to follow the statutory formula and procedures for funding state humanities councils, and terminating grants without the required findings, notice, or opportunity for hearing. The court concluded that the ICA did not provide a private right of action but could serve as a standard for “contrary to law” claims under the APA. The court also found that the abrupt cessation of funding caused irreparable harm to the plaintiffs and to public access to humanities programming across the country.\n\nThe court issued an injunction and stay prohibiting NEH and related defendants from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations of grants to the plaintiffs (including Federation member councils), from further terminating or suspending approved grants except as permitted by statute, and from reallocating or disbursing the obligated funds to any party other than the plaintiffs. The court directed this relief to be prohibitory, not mandatory, and declined to require a bond. The court found venue proper in Oregon and confirmed the associational standing of the Federation to seek relief for its members.\n\nAs of the court’s order, no trial had occurred, no settlement had been reached, and no appeals had been decided. The court’s opinion addresses only preliminary relief pending further proceedings. The case remains ongoing, with the preliminary injunction and stay in place.",
    "46478": "This case arises from a challenge by two private, family-owned American companies that develop and sell educational products for children, Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc., to a series of executive orders issued by the President of the United States. The case was filed on April 22, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and is presided over by Judge Rudolph Contreras. Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel.\n\nThe plaintiffs import most of their products from China and other countries. Beginning in early 2025, the President issued a series of executive orders invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”), 50 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq., to impose broad tariffs on imported goods. These included: an initial 10% tariff on all Chinese imports (later raised to 20%), a 10% \"universal tariff\" on nearly all other imports, and additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from specific countries, some as high as 125%. The President declared national emergencies relating to illicit fentanyl from China and to large, persistent U.S. trade deficits, and asserted that these circumstances authorized the imposition of the tariffs under IEEPA. The Department of Homeland Security and other agencies implemented the tariffs by making changes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that these tariffs have caused them immediate and irreparable harm, including dramatic increases in costs, lost sales, customer cancellations, and the threat of business failure. They argue that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs, and that the challenged executive orders exceed statutory authority and violate the Constitution, including the nondelegation doctrine. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the collection of tariffs imposed under these orders.\n\nDefendants, including multiple federal officials and agencies responsible for implementing the tariffs, moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), asserting that the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction over tariff-related cases. Plaintiffs opposed transfer, maintaining that IEEPA is not a law “providing for” tariffs as required for CIT jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i).\n\nOn May 29, 2025, Judge Contreras denied the government’s motion to transfer and granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court held that it had jurisdiction, finding that IEEPA is not a law “providing for” tariffs because it does not mention tariffs, duties, or similar terms, and because the statutory term “regulate importation” does not encompass the power to impose tariffs. The Court found plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits, concluding that the President lacks statutory authority under IEEPA to impose tariffs, and that the agency actions implementing the tariffs are therefore ultra vires and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Court did not reach the nondelegation or alternative statutory arguments.\n\nThe Court found that plaintiffs had demonstrated irreparable harm, including the threat to their businesses’ survival and unrecoverable losses, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored a preliminary injunction limited to plaintiffs. The order enjoined collection of tariffs from the plaintiffs under the challenged executive orders, but stayed its effect for 14 days to allow for appeal.\n\nOn June 2, 2025, the government moved to stay the injunction pending appeal, citing national security and foreign policy harms and ongoing international negotiations. The Court granted the stay on June 3, 2025, noting that a related permanent injunction issued by the CIT had itself been stayed by the Federal Circuit.\n\nNo trial has occurred; no reported opinions beyond the District Court’s May 29, 2025 memorandum opinion and order have issued. The matter is currently stayed pending appeal to the D.C. Circuit.\n\nNo settlements, court-appointed monitors, or consent decrees are present in the record. The factual basis of the case is the impact of the President’s IEEPA-based tariffs on the plaintiffs’ import-dependent businesses and the broader assertion of presidential tariff authority absent clear congressional authorization. No disputes over settlement enforcement or monitors’ reports appear in the record. This is not a class action. There are no consolidated or related cases in this court, but similar cases have been filed in other federal courts and the CIT.",
    "46390": "This case arises from a challenge by Venezuelan civil immigration detainees in Colorado to the federal government’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act (“AEA”), 50 U.S.C. § 21 et seq. On March 14, 2025, the President issued a Proclamation invoking the AEA to authorize the summary removal of Venezuelan noncitizens alleged to be members of the criminal gang Tren de Aragua (“TdA”). The Proclamation permitted removals without the procedures guaranteed by federal immigration law and without individualized process to contest the government’s designation.\n\nThe plaintiffs—Venezuelan men detained at the Denver Contract Detention Facility—filed this action on April 12, 2025, as a putative class action on behalf of all noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to the Proclamation. They were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Foundation, the ACLU of Colorado, and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network. The named plaintiffs alleged that they were at imminent risk of summary removal to El Salvador under the Proclamation, based on accusations of TdA membership that they denied.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted that the government’s actions violated the AEA itself, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Convention Against Torture, and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. They argued that the AEA authorizes such removals only in time of declared war or military invasion by a foreign nation or government, and that neither the Proclamation nor the facts established that predicate. They also challenged the sufficiency of government notice and process, citing evidence that the government’s notices were in English only, provided as little as twelve hours’ advance warning, and failed to inform detainees of how to contest their designation.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, Judge Charlotte N. Sweeney issued an emergency order under the All Writs Act barring the removal of the named plaintiffs and the putative class from Colorado. After briefing and a hearing, the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 22, 2025, provisionally certifying the class and requiring the government to provide at least 21 days’ notice, in a language understood by the detainee, before any removal under the Proclamation. The court found that plaintiffs had standing and jurisdiction was proper under habeas corpus statutes. Judge Sweeney held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, finding the Proclamation’s invocation of the AEA was not supported by a military invasion or action by a foreign government, and that the government’s notice procedures were constitutionally deficient.\n\nThe government sought a stay of the TRO both in the district court and the Tenth Circuit. The district court denied a stay, and the Tenth Circuit also denied the motion on April 29, 2025, holding that the government had not shown a likelihood of irreparable harm because no imminent removals were scheduled.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, Judge Sweeney granted a preliminary injunction, enjoining the government from detaining, transferring, or removing the named plaintiffs and class members under the AEA and Proclamation from the District of Colorado. The court found that the Proclamation exceeded the statutory authority of the AEA, which is limited to times of declared war or military invasion by a foreign nation or government, and that the Proclamation’s reliance on alleged gang activity fell outside the statute’s scope. The court also certified the class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), finding the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements satisfied.\n\nThroughout, the court emphasized that its orders did not bar the government from prosecuting or removing detainees under ordinary immigration laws, but only from doing so under the AEA Proclamation. On July 7, 2025, the government filed a notice of appeal from the preliminary injunction and class certification orders. As of the notice of appeal, the preliminary injunction remains in effect, and no trial has been held. There is no evidence in the record of a court-appointed monitor or post-settlement enforcement disputes. The court’s orders have not been superseded by any higher court, and the case remains pending on appeal.",
    "46499": "On April 11, 2025, a group of individual international students lawfully present in the United States under F-1 student status initiated suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs are Chinese national students and recent graduates pursuing undergraduate or advanced degrees at U.S. universities, including the University of California, Berkeley; Carnegie Mellon University; University of Cincinnati; University of Texas at Dallas; New York University; and the University of Southern California. They are represented by private counsel at DeHeng Law Offices PC, with the Chinese American Legal Defense Alliance joining as additional counsel in later filings. The defendants are the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and, in the amended complaint, the Secretary of State. All are sued in their official capacities.\n\nThe case arises from an unprecedented enforcement action in early April 2025, when DHS, through ICE and in coordination with the Department of State, conducted a nationwide sweep that resulted in the abrupt termination of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records of hundreds, and possibly thousands, of international students holding F-1 visas. Termination of SEVIS records renders students immediately out of status, subject to loss of work authorization, forced suspension of studies, loss of housing, and potential accrual of unlawful presence, with severe consequences for reentry to the United States. Most affected students, including the plaintiffs, received no prior notice or individualized explanation, and were not charged with or convicted of any crime. Some had only minor or dismissed legal encounters, while others had no adverse record. Additionally, the Department of State, acting in concert with ICE, revoked the F-1 visas of many affected students.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that these terminations and visa revocations were carried out without notice, explanation, or due process, and were based on an arbitrary policy of targeting students who appeared in a database search (the National Crime Information Center), irrespective of the underlying reason. Plaintiffs challenged these actions under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, and on constitutional grounds for violating the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. They specifically assert that the terminations violated regulatory limits on agency-initiated termination of nonimmigrant status (8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d)), and that the government’s own policy guidance prohibits SEVIS termination solely on the basis of visa revocation. Plaintiffs also challenge the statutory authority for the mass visa revocations, arguing that 8 U.S.C. § 1201(i) does not permit such wholesale action or its use against individuals already present in the United States.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a nationwide declaratory judgment and both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, requesting restoration of their SEVIS status, reinstatement of affected F-1 visas, and an order barring future terminations or revocations without lawful process.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Susan Illston but later reassigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White and consolidated with other related cases involving similar claims. Early in the proceedings, the plaintiffs moved for a nationwide TRO. On April 18, 2025, Judge Illston granted an ex parte TRO as to the named plaintiffs, enjoining DHS and ICE from taking adverse enforcement action, including arrest or removal, based on the SEVIS termination, pending further hearing. As more cases were filed, the court coordinated the matters for joint consideration.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, Judge White granted preliminary injunctive relief to all named plaintiffs and, on a nationwide basis, to similarly situated F-1 students whose SEVIS records had been terminated under the April 2025 enforcement initiative. The court found that SEVIS record termination effectively terminates F-1 status, resulting in loss of lawful presence and severe consequences, and that the government’s actions were likely arbitrary and capricious and not authorized by regulation. The injunction barred the defendants from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring any plaintiff or similarly situated individual nationwide, from imposing any legal effect due to the SEVIS terminations, and from re-terminating SEVIS records except as permitted by regulation. The order also barred the government from reversing the reinstatement of SEVIS records for these individuals without court approval.\n\nThe government subsequently appealed the injunction to the Ninth Circuit and moved for a stay pending appeal, arguing that the nationwide scope of relief exceeded the court’s authority, particularly in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc., and that no irreparable harm had been shown following the retroactive restoration of SEVIS records.\n\nMeanwhile, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 29, 2025, adding further factual allegations and additional plaintiffs whose visas remained revoked. They sought an amended preliminary injunction to address the continued harms resulting from the Department of State’s mass revocation of visas, which had not been reversed alongside the restoration of SEVIS records. The amended complaint and motion emphasized the lack of statutory or regulatory authority for the mass visa revocations, the ongoing inability of affected students to travel or return home, and the chilling effect on their education and professional opportunities.\n\nNo trial has occurred as of the latest filings. The court’s preliminary injunction remains in effect, with the government’s motion for stay and the plaintiffs’ motion for further injunctive relief pending. The court scheduled a further case management conference for September 26, 2025. No class has been certified, but the court’s preliminary injunction currently provides nationwide relief to all similarly situated F-1 students whose SEVIS records were terminated under the challenged policy. \n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on the abrupt, process-free termination of lawful student status and visas for numerous international students, without individualized review, resulting in immediate and severe educational and immigration consequences, and raising systemic questions about the scope of agency authority and the procedural rights of noncitizens lawfully present in the United States.",
    "46319": "On March 31, 2025, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), a labor union representing federal employees in thirty-seven agencies, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit was brought against the President of the United States and the heads of various federal agencies and departments, all in their official capacities. The litigation followed the issuance, on March 27, 2025, of Executive Order No. 14,251, which, by presidential determination under 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1), excluded over thirty federal agencies or subdivisions—including twelve where NTEU represents employees—from coverage under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). This action stripped the collective bargaining rights of approximately two-thirds of the federal workforce, including about 104,000 NTEU-represented employees.\n\nThe agencies affected were directed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to cease honoring collective bargaining agreements and to discontinue payroll deductions for union dues, actions which immediately impaired NTEU’s ability to represent its members and caused substantial loss of revenue. The government’s own public statements, including a White House Fact Sheet and OPM Guidance, indicated that the Executive Order was motivated not by particularized national security concerns but by a desire to make federal employees easier to fire and to retaliate against unions perceived as obstructing the administration’s agenda. The Fact Sheet described certain unions, including NTEU, as “hostile” and acknowledged targeting unions that had opposed the President’s policies.\n\nNTEU alleged that the Executive Order exceeded the President’s limited authority under 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1), which allows agency or subdivision exclusions only if the entity’s primary function is intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work, and only if the statute cannot be applied consistent with national security. NTEU asserted that none of the agencies or subdivisions excluded by the order plausibly met these criteria, pointing to the agencies’ long histories of collective bargaining without adverse national security impact. NTEU further alleged that the Executive Order was unlawful and ultra vires as it conflicted with both the FSLMRS and Congress’s explicit intent to protect collective bargaining in the federal sector, and that it was also unconstitutional First Amendment retaliation for NTEU’s protected litigation and advocacy against administration policies.\n\nNTEU sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent implementation of the Executive Order as to the agencies where it represents employees, as well as a declaration that the OPM Guidance was unlawful. NTEU was represented by private counsel.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman. On April 4, 2025, NTEU moved for a preliminary injunction. On April 25, after briefing and oral argument, the court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining implementation of the Executive Order and OPM Guidance as to the affected NTEU-represented agencies, finding that NTEU was likely to succeed on the merits of its ultra vires claims, had shown irreparable harm, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored relief. The court determined that the President’s stated justifications for the order were pretextual, that the agencies did not have a primary national security function, and that the order was motivated by improper policy and retaliatory considerations.\n\nThe government appealed and obtained a stay of the injunction from the D.C. Circuit on May 16, 2025, pending appeal. The appellate panel held that NTEU had not shown irreparable harm sufficient for preliminary relief, but did not address the merits of NTEU’s statutory or constitutional claims.\n\nFollowing the stay, the parties proceeded to cross-motions for summary judgment. NTEU reiterated its legal and factual arguments that the Executive Order’s exclusions were both individually and collectively ultra vires and retaliatory. The government, represented by the Department of Justice, opposed on jurisdictional grounds, arguing that such claims must be channeled through the FLRA’s administrative process (which NTEU argued was unavailable, since the Executive Order itself removed the agencies from FSLMRS coverage). The government also argued there was no cause of action or waiver of sovereign immunity, and that, on the merits, the President’s determinations under § 7103(b)(1) were non-reviewable, discretionary, and lawful.\n\nNo trial has occurred. The case is pending on cross-motions for summary judgment, with briefing completed as of July 17, 2025. The court has not yet issued a final ruling on the merits. There are no consolidated or related cases in the district court, but a parallel case involving similar issues is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n\n**Judge:** Paul L. Friedman  \n**Filing Date:** March 31, 2025  \n**Type of Counsel:** Private  \n**Cause of Action:** Ultra vires claims under 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1); First Amendment retaliation  \n**Statutory/Constitutional Basis:** FSLMRS; First Amendment  \n**Remedy Sought:** Declaratory and injunctive relief  \n**Appeal:** Preliminary injunction stayed by D.C. Circuit (May 16, 2025), appeal pending  \n**Factual Basis:** Executive Order excluding agencies from collective bargaining based on purported national security grounds, with evidence showing policy and retaliatory motivations and lack of statutory basis for exclusions.  \n**Significant Terms of Relief Sought:** Restore NTEU’s collective bargaining rights, enjoin agency implementation of the Executive Order, and declare the order unlawful as applied to NTEU-represented agencies.  \n**Monitoring/Special Master/Settlement:** None.  \n**No trial or decree has been entered.**",
    "46285": "This case was filed on March 24, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by three nonprofit immigrant rights membership organizations: the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), UndocuBlack Network, and CASA, Inc. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from Justice Action Center and the in-house legal teams of CASA and CHIRLA.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenge a series of policies and directives issued by the Trump administration after January 20, 2025, which expanded the application of \"expedited removal\" procedures to noncitizens who had previously been paroled into the United States through humanitarian parole programs. The key government defendants are the Secretary of Homeland Security (Kristi Noem), the Acting Directors of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the President of the United States (Donald J. Trump), all sued in their official capacities.\n\nExpedited removal is a statutory procedure under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) that allows for rapid deportation of certain noncitizens with minimal process, historically used primarily for individuals encountered at the border or shortly after entry without valid documents or with fraud/misrepresentation. Historically, individuals paroled into the U.S. at ports of entry for humanitarian reasons were not subject to expedited removal once inside the country.\n\nThe complaint alleges that, beginning in January 2025, the administration took three principal actions: (1) the January 23, 2025 Huffman Memorandum directed DHS personnel to consider applying expedited removal to any eligible noncitizen, including those previously granted parole, and to terminate removal proceedings or parole status as needed; (2) a February 18, 2025 ICE Directive instructed field personnel to apply expedited removal to “paroled arriving aliens” not seeking asylum, stating there was “no time limit” for such action; and (3) the March 25, 2025 Federal Register Notice formally terminated parole programs for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV process), and ended all grants of parole under those programs, with the explicit aim of making these populations eligible for expedited removal.\n\nPlaintiffs assert that these actions unlawfully expose their members—who include many individuals paroled into the country through the now-terminated CHNV and CBP One parole processes—to summary deportation without the due process protections of standard removal proceedings before an immigration judge. They argue that both the statute (8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)) and the agency’s own regulations do not permit expedited removal of individuals who have been lawfully paroled into the United States at a port of entry, regardless of whether their parole has expired or been terminated, and that the recent directives and policy changes are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nPlaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to bar the government from subjecting individuals who have previously been granted parole at a port of entry to expedited removal, as well as vacatur of the relevant policy directives and termination notices. They also request an order requiring the government to facilitate the return of any of their members wrongfully removed under these policies, and attorneys’ fees.\n\nJudge Jia M. Cobb is presiding over the case. On August 1, 2025, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a stay of agency action under 5 U.S.C. § 705. The Court held that the challenged agency actions—namely, the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, the February 18 ICE Directive, and the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice—likely exceeded DHS’s statutory authority and were arbitrary and capricious. The Court found that neither the “Arriving Aliens” nor the “Designation” provisions of the expedited removal statute authorized applying expedited removal to individuals who had ever been paroled into the United States at a port of entry, even if their parole had expired or was terminated. The Court also found the agency’s legal justifications internally inconsistent and insufficiently explained, and determined that Plaintiffs’ members faced imminent irreparable harm, such as denial of meaningful process for immigration relief, risk of wrongful removal, and family separation.\n\nThe Court stayed the challenged agency actions as to all noncitizens paroled into the United States at a port of entry, not just members of the plaintiff organizations, pending final resolution of the case. The stay does not reinstate the CHNV parole programs themselves but blocks the use of expedited removal against the affected parolee populations under the challenged directives.\n\nOther related litigation challenging the broader expansion of expedited removal (e.g., Make the Road New York v. Huffman, D.D.C. 25-cv-00190) and the termination of parole programs (e.g., Doe v. Noem, D. Mass. 1:25-cv-10495) is pending, but this case is focused on the intersection of those issues as they affect individuals who were previously granted parole at a port of entry.\n\nAs of this summary, the government has appealed the stay order to the D.C. Circuit. No trial has been held, and no final merits ruling has been issued. No court-appointed monitor or special master has been assigned, and there are no consolidated cases. The case remains ongoing and under active judicial management.",
    "46179": "On February 24, 2025, two Senate-confirmed members of the United States Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), both affiliated with the Democratic Party, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The PCLOB is an independent, multi-member expert agency created by Congress to oversee executive branch counterterrorism policies and ensure the protection of privacy and civil liberties. The plaintiffs challenged their removal from the Board by the President, which they alleged was done without cause and in violation of statutory protections for Board members’ tenure.\n\nThe core factual basis of the case was that, in January 2025, shortly after the President took office, the White House requested the resignation of all three Democratic members of the PCLOB. When the plaintiffs did not resign, they were notified by email that their positions were terminated. No cause was provided for their removal. The President left the Board’s sole Republican member in place, which deprived the Board of a quorum necessary to conduct its statutory functions.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the PCLOB’s organic statute, as amended by Congress in 2007, prohibits removal of Board members without good cause. They relied on statutory text and structure—specifically, the removal of prior language stating that members served at the pleasure of the President, the establishment of fixed six-year terms, the requirement for nonpartisanship and expertise in the Board’s composition, and the Board’s independent oversight and advisory functions for both Congress and the executive branch. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including reinstatement to their positions, as well as a writ of mandamus if necessary.\n\nThe defendants, including the United States, the remaining Board member, the PCLOB Executive Director, the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel, and the President (all sued in their official capacities), argued that there was no explicit statutory restriction on removal and that, absent such explicit language, the President retained at-will removal authority. They further contended that, even if removal protections existed, reinstatement was not an appropriate remedy.\n\nJudge Reggie B. Walton presided over the case. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the matter was briefed and argued on an expedited schedule. On May 21, 2025, the court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs. Judge Walton held that, while the PCLOB’s statute contained no express removal provision, its structure and function clearly indicated Congress’s intent to restrict presidential removal of Board members absent good cause. The court found the President’s removals unlawful and declared them null and void. The court ordered that both plaintiffs be reinstated as Board members for the remainder of their terms and enjoined the relevant federal officials and their subordinates from treating the plaintiffs as removed or otherwise interfering with their service.\n\nThe court’s order provided specific declaratory and injunctive relief, but did not award monetary damages, as the plaintiffs had withdrawn that request and the compensation structure for Board members rendered backpay unavailable. The judgment closed the district court case.\n\nThe defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and sought a stay of the district court’s judgment. Judge Walton denied a stay, but on July 1, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal. The appellate court concluded that the government had satisfied the requirements for a stay, emphasizing that the PCLOB statute did not expressly restrict the President’s removal power, and that the Board’s functions did not support an implied removal restriction under Supreme Court precedent, as PCLOB is not an adjudicatory body. The appellate court further found that allowing the removed members to continue serving would interfere with the President’s constitutional authority and cause irreparable harm to the executive branch, and thus stayed the district court’s order pending further proceedings.\n\nNo reported opinions or consolidated or related cases are referenced outside the immediate proceedings and cited authorities. There is no court-appointed monitor and no settlement or consent decree. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel. The case remains pending on appeal and the district court’s judgment is stayed.",
    "46106": "This case was filed on February 11, 2025, in the Southern District of New York by unions representing federal employees (the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO and the Association of Administrative Law Judges, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Judicial Council 1, AFL-CIO), along with several individual current and former federal employees. The defendants are the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and its Acting Director Charles Ezell, as well as entities and officials associated with the U.S. DOGE Service—an entity established by executive order on January 20, 2025 (in connection with President Trump’s inauguration), including the U.S. DOGE Service, its Temporary Organization, its Acting Administrator, and Elon Musk (who leads the DOGE Temporary Service).\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by private counsel, including attorneys from Lex Lumina LLP, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the State Democracy Defenders Fund, and The Chandra Law Firm.\n\nThe case arises from President Trump’s creation of the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) via executive order, reconstituting the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. DOGE Service and establishing a DOGE Service Temporary Organization within the Executive Office of the President. The executive order directed agencies—including OPM—to ensure DOGE had prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software, and IT systems, subject only to consistency with the law.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that, beginning on January 20, 2025, OPM granted broad, ongoing, and “administrative” access to its highly sensitive personnel systems and records to individuals affiliated with DOGE, including Elon Musk and several young technologists—some of whom had recently worked for Musk’s private companies and, in at least one case, had a history of alleged cybersecurity misconduct. The complaint asserts that these DOGE agents were given access without normal security vetting, proper background checks, or required cybersecurity/privacy training, and that their access included the ability to read, modify, and export personal data for tens of millions of current and former federal employees, job applicants, and their family members. The records at issue included social security numbers, demographic and health data, employment and financial information, and data related to national security positions.\n\nPlaintiffs claim these disclosures and practices violated the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a), which strictly regulates the disclosure and safeguarding of records in federal systems of records, limiting access to those with a legitimate need in the performance of their duties, and requiring robust administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. They also assert that OPM’s actions were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and that the DOGE Defendants acted ultra vires (beyond legal authority), since DOGE had no statutory power to direct or control OPM systems or access personnel records.\n\nPlaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief halting further disclosure, requiring the return or destruction of unlawfully obtained records, and mandating future compliance with the Privacy Act and related federal security standards. They do not seek monetary damages.\n\nThe case is presided over by Judge Denise L. Cote. After an initial motion for a temporary restraining order, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. Defendants moved to dismiss, arguing lack of standing, failure to state a claim, and that the Privacy Act and APA did not provide a basis for the relief sought.\n\nOn April 3, 2025, Judge Cote denied the motion to dismiss as to the core APA and ultra vires claims, holding that the plaintiffs had plausibly alleged ongoing violations of the Privacy Act and APA, and that they had standing based on concrete privacy and security harms analogous to the tort of intrusion upon seclusion. The judge found that granting broad access to sensitive personal data without proper safeguards or need was, in itself, an actionable injury, even if there was no evidence of public disclosure.\n\nAfter further proceedings—including review of the administrative record and a hearing with cross-examination of witnesses—Judge Cote on June 9, 2025, granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that OPM had in fact granted DOGE agents sweeping administrative access to multiple OPM systems containing personally identifiable information, often without proper vetting or training, and in violation of both Privacy Act restrictions and OPM’s own established cybersecurity protocols. The court determined that these actions constituted unlawful disclosures and a failure to maintain appropriate safeguards, and that the risk of further harm, including cybersecurity breaches, was ongoing and irreparable. The court also found that injunctive relief was in the public interest and not outweighed by the government’s interest in IT modernization, since such modernization could be achieved without violating privacy laws.\n\nThe court’s order required OPM to report on post-March 2025 procedures to ensure compliance with the Privacy Act, barred further unauthorized disclosures to DOGE agents, and mandated the establishment of proper security safeguards. The order was administratively stayed for fourteen days and conditioned on the posting of a bond by the plaintiffs. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the injunction and required continued reporting by OPM.\n\nNo trial has occurred, and, as of the preliminary injunction, no court-appointed monitor or special master has been assigned. The court’s opinion reflects that the case is part of a broader set of related cases nationwide challenging DOGE-related access to sensitive federal personnel data, several of which have resulted in similar preliminary relief.\n\nNo final settlement or consent decree has been reached, and no disputes over settlement enforcement are noted in the record to date. The case remains ongoing.",
    "46095": "This case concerns a legal challenge by a coalition of prominent research universities, academic associations, and universities (including public and private institutions) to a sudden policy change by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) regarding the reimbursement of indirect costs, also known as facilities and administration (F&A) costs, on federal research grants. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on February 10, 2025, immediately after the NIH, part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), issued a Supplemental Guidance (NOT-OD-25-068) on February 7, 2025. This guidance imposed an across-the-board 15% cap on indirect cost reimbursements for all existing and future NIH grants to institutions of higher education, superseding previously negotiated rates that were typically much higher and tailored to each institution.\n\nThe Plaintiffs include several major higher education associations (the Association of American Universities, the American Council on Education, and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities), as well as numerous universities such as Brandeis, Brown, the Regents of the University of California, Caltech, Carnegie Mellon, the University of Chicago, Cornell, George Washington University, Johns Hopkins, MIT, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Rochester, and Tufts. The Defendants are HHS, NIH, and their respective acting officials. Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from Jenner & Block LLP and Clement & Murphy PLLC.\n\nPlaintiffs claimed that the NIH’s action violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), relevant federal appropriations statutes—specifically, Section 224 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024—and the governing federal grant regulations (45 C.F.R. § 75.414 and related provisions). They asserted that the new guidance was issued without statutory authority, was arbitrary and capricious, failed to follow legally required procedures such as notice-and-comment rulemaking, and unlawfully applied retroactively to existing grants. Plaintiffs sought a nationwide injunction barring enforcement of the new 15% cap and restoration of the prior negotiated rates.\n\nThe case was heard by Judge Angel Kelley. Plaintiffs moved immediately for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent imminent harm, citing the risk of disruption to ongoing and future research, loss of jobs, and threats to clinical trials and infrastructure due to drastic and immediate cuts in grant funding. The Court granted emergency relief, maintaining the status quo while the matter was fully briefed and argued.\n\nAfter full briefing and a hearing, the Court found for the Plaintiffs. The Court held that it had jurisdiction under the APA and was not barred by the Tucker Act, as the claims were rooted in statutes and regulations, not contract. The Court determined that the NIH’s guidance violated both the plain language of the relevant regulations and the 2024 appropriations rider, which explicitly prohibited NIH from imposing across-the-board caps or modified reimbursement approaches for indirect costs. The Court found that the agency failed to provide a reasoned explanation, disregarded long-standing reliance interests of research institutions, failed to follow required notice-and-comment procedures, and retroactively impaired rights under existing grants in violation of administrative law.\n\nOn March 5, 2025, the Court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction barring NIH and HHS from implementing, applying, or enforcing the 15% cap guidance for any current or future grants. The injunction was later converted, with the parties’ assent, into a permanent injunction with final judgment entered April 4, 2025. The judgment vacated the NIH guidance in full and ordered the agencies not to enforce it. The Court held that the rulemaking was unlawful on multiple grounds, including violation of APA procedural requirements, lack of statutory authority, and arbitrary and capricious agency action.\n\nThe NIH and HHS, through the Department of Justice, timely appealed the final judgment and permanent injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. As of the date of final judgment, the challenged 15% cap remains unenforceable nationwide, and the prior negotiated indirect cost rates must be honored for all NIH grants.",
    "46023": "This lawsuit was filed on February 3, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by three organizations—Alliance for Retired Americans, the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, and the Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO—each representing large memberships of retirees and federal employees. The defendants are the Secretary of the Treasury (in his official capacity), the Department of the Treasury, and its Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Bureau). Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel, including Public Citizen Litigation Group and the State Democracy Defenders Fund.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the Department of the Treasury unlawfully granted members of the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE)—a federal initiative established by executive order in January 2025 and associated with USDS (United States DOGE Service) and Elon Musk—unfettered access to the Bureau’s systems and records. These systems contain sensitive personal and financial information of millions of individuals, including federal employees, retirees, Social Security recipients, and taxpayers, all of whom must interact with the federal government for payments, collections, and benefits. Plaintiffs claim that this access was provided without following the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code, which restrict disclosure and use of personal and tax data, and without the proper notice or safeguards required by law.\n\nThe legal basis for the case is the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), under which plaintiffs assert that the Treasury’s actions are contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and in excess of statutory authority. Specifically, plaintiffs claim that the Bureau’s disclosure of information to DOGE members violated the Privacy Act’s restrictions on disclosure of records and failed to comply with the Act’s requirements for altering systems of records or expanding access. Plaintiffs also allege violations of the Internal Revenue Code’s confidentiality provisions regarding taxpayer data. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order prohibiting further disclosure of personal and financial information to DOGE or its affiliates and requiring the Treasury to comply with federal privacy laws.\n\nJudge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly is presiding over the case. Early in the litigation, the parties agreed to a consent order temporarily restricting access to the Bureau’s payment systems, limiting it to certain Treasury employees and DOGE Team members on a “read-only” basis, with additional limitations as the case developed. The court held an evidentiary hearing and converted plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order into a motion for preliminary injunction. The court denied the preliminary injunction, ruling that plaintiffs had not shown a likelihood of irreparable harm under the D.C. Circuit’s standard, but found that the plaintiffs had plausibly alleged standing and that the court had subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe case has not been consolidated with other litigation, but the court and parties referenced related cases in other federal jurisdictions with overlapping issues regarding DOGE access to federal systems. The court ordered production of the administrative record and permitted limited, expedited discovery focused on the details of how DOGE access was implemented and controlled at the Treasury.\n\nBoth sides have now moved for summary judgment. Defendants argue that plaintiffs lack standing, that no final agency action is at issue, that the APA does not permit this type of prospective injunctive relief for alleged Privacy Act or Internal Revenue Code violations, and that, in any event, Treasury employees’ access was lawful, appropriately limited, and not arbitrary or capricious. Plaintiffs counter that the agency’s actions were a marked and unlawful departure from legal privacy protections and agency procedures, and that the access provided to DOGE was not justified by any legitimate or well-defined agency purpose.\n\nNo trial has been scheduled. As of this summary, the court has not yet ruled on the cross-motions for summary judgment. No final decree or settlement has been reached; thus, there are no ongoing court-ordered terms, monitoring, or settlement enforcement at this stage.\n\nThe factual basis for the case centers on the accelerated implementation of the DOGE initiative at the Treasury Department after the 2025 presidential inauguration, the removal of senior Bureau personnel who resisted DOGE access, and the subsequent provision of broad, ongoing access to the Bureau’s payment systems—containing names, Social Security numbers, bank account information, and other sensitive data—without public notice, the required privacy documentation, or individual consent. Plaintiffs allege that, as a result, their members’ privacy rights under federal law have been systematically compromised, and they seek court intervention to halt further unauthorized disclosures.",
    "46563": "This case, filed on May 2, 2025, in the Western District of Washington, involves a coalition of cities, counties, and local agencies challenging the federal government's imposition of new conditions on federal grant funding. The plaintiffs include major cities and counties (such as King County, New York City, San Francisco, Boston, and others), local transit agencies, airport authorities, and housing authorities. These plaintiffs rely on substantial annual federal funding—amounting to billions of dollars—distributed through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), including DOT’s operating administrations: the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). The plaintiffs are represented by a combination of private counsel, local government attorneys, and legal non-profits.\n\nThe case is not a class action but involves a broad coalition of local government entities and agencies with significant reliance on federal grants for homelessness assistance, public transit, transportation infrastructure, and airport improvements. The defendants are federal agencies and their heads, sued in their official capacities.\n\nThe lawsuit centers on a series of executive orders and policy directives issued by President Trump beginning in January 2025, after his inauguration. These orders direct federal agencies to attach new and expansive conditions to federal grants—conditions that were not included in the original Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs), were not authorized by Congress, and, according to plaintiffs, are not germane to the statutory purposes of the grant programs. The challenged conditions include requirements that recipients:\n\n- Certify they do not operate any programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, interpreting federal nondiscrimination law as broadly prohibiting all forms of DEI.\n- Cooperate with federal immigration enforcement and not “abet” sanctuary policies or facilitate illegal immigration, including using specific federal systems to verify immigration status.\n- Not use grant funds to “promote gender ideology,” as defined in an executive order that adopts a restrictive and exclusionary understanding of gender identity.\n- Not use grant funds to “promote elective abortion,” going beyond the Hyde Amendment’s actual statutory restrictions.\n- Agree that compliance with these policies is “material” to payment decisions for purposes of the False Claims Act, exposing recipients to potential treble damages and penalties.\n- Comply with “all current Executive Orders,” effectively importing future policy changes into grant requirements.\n\nPlaintiffs allege these federal conditions are not authorized by the statutes governing the grants (such as the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act for HUD’s Continuum of Care program and multiple statutes for DOT’s programs), and that they are unconstitutionally vague, violate the Spending Clause and Tenth Amendment (by being coercive and unrelated to the grants’ purposes), and contravene the separation of powers. Plaintiffs further allege that the conditions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and imposed without required procedures.\n\nJudge Barbara J. Rothstein presides over the case. Early in the litigation, plaintiffs sought and obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) and, subsequently, preliminary injunctions against enforcement of the challenged conditions. The court found subject-matter jurisdiction and concluded that the claims did not sound in contract (and thus were not subject to the Tucker Act’s exclusive jurisdiction for contract claims against the federal government). The court determined that the source of the rights asserted was the Constitution and federal statutes, and that plaintiffs sought equitable relief to prevent unlawful conditions on grants, not damages or specific performance.\n\nThe court granted injunctive relief, finding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, that the new conditions likely exceeded the agencies’ statutory and constitutional authority, and that the conditions were unrelated to the programs’ purposes and imposed ambiguous, coercive, and vague requirements. The court also found irreparable harm, reasoning that local governments faced an impossible choice between accepting unconstitutional conditions or losing essential funding, with devastating consequences for homelessness services, transportation, and public safety. The court’s orders enjoined HUD, DOT, and their operating administrations from imposing or enforcing the challenged conditions, from withholding or conditioning funds based on those terms, and from requiring certifications related to those conditions. The court declined to require plaintiffs to post a bond.\n\nAfter the initial injunction, additional plaintiffs joined the case, including more cities, counties, and local agencies. The court extended the preliminary injunction to these new plaintiffs and to additional DOT programs as the agencies expanded the challenged conditions across their entire grant portfolio. No trial has yet occurred, and there are no reported opinions beyond the preliminary injunction decisions. The federal government has appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nNo class has been certified. There is no court-appointed monitor, and no settlement or consent decree has been reached as of the date of the most recent filings. The case remains active, with the preliminary injunction in effect pending further orders or appellate review.\n\nThe factual basis of the case is that the new federal grant conditions, imposed abruptly and without notice, threaten to withhold or disrupt billions of dollars in funding for vital local public services, with the effect of coercing local governments to implement federal policy directives unrelated to the purpose of the funded programs. Plaintiffs detailed the immediate and long-term harms to their residents, including risks to public safety, housing stability, and critical infrastructure, should the challenged conditions be enforced.",
    "46484": "On April 23, 2025, a legal services organization representing the interests of legal professionals filed suit in federal court against the U.S. Department of Justice and two high-ranking officials in their official capacities. The case arose after the Department of Justice, following public criticism by the organization of the presidential administration and its recent participation in a lawsuit against the federal government, issued a memorandum barring DOJ employees from participating in that organization’s events during official time. The next day, DOJ terminated a series of grants to the organization’s commission that provided training and assistance for legal professionals working with victims of domestic and sexual violence. DOJ offered only a brief explanation, stating that the grants “no longer effectuate agency priorities,” but did not terminate similar grants to other organizations.\n\nThe organization alleged that this termination was unlawful retaliation for engaging in protected First Amendment activities, including public advocacy and the filing of litigation. Additional claims were brought under the First and Fifth Amendments (including viewpoint discrimination, unconstitutional conditions, and due process and equal protection violations), as well as under the Administrative Procedure Act. The organization sought declaratory and injunctive relief—specifically, an order barring DOJ from enforcing or otherwise giving effect to the grant terminations, preventing reallocation of the grant funds, and requiring DOJ to process the grants in the customary manner and timeframe.\n\nThe organization was represented by private counsel from a nonprofit legal services group. The case was assigned to Judge Christopher R. Cooper.\n\nShortly after filing, the organization moved for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. The court scheduled expedited briefing and a hearing. DOJ did not contest that the organization’s speech was protected or that similar grants to other groups continued, but argued primarily that the court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act and that the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, Judge Cooper issued a memorandum opinion and order granting the organization’s motion for a preliminary injunction on its First Amendment retaliation claim. The court held that the claim arose from the Constitution, not the grant contract, and thus federal question jurisdiction was proper. The court found the evidence strongly suggested DOJ terminated the grants as retaliation for protected First Amendment activity, noting the close temporal proximity between the DOJ memorandum and the grant cancellations, the lack of performance issues with the grants, and the disparate treatment of this organization compared to other grantees. The court found the organization would suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction, including the loss of First Amendment rights and the imminent shutdown of critical victim services. The court enjoined DOJ from enforcing the grant terminations or reallocating the funds, but did not require reinstatement of grants that had already expired by their terms, nor did it bar DOJ from terminating the grants for valid, nonretaliatory reasons in the future.\n\nAs of July 2025, the case remains administratively closed pending further status updates, with the preliminary injunction in effect. No trial has taken place, no settlement has been reached, and no appeals have been docketed. The only reported opinion is the May 14, 2025 memorandum opinion granting the preliminary injunction (2025 WL [not provided]). The court has retained jurisdiction to enforce its order. The underlying facts establish that DOJ’s stated reason for terminating the grants was likely pretextual, and the actual motivation was the organization’s protected advocacy and litigation activity.",
    "46279": "This case is a certified nationwide class action challenging the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) policy and practice of removing noncitizens with final orders of removal to third countries—countries not previously designated during immigration proceedings—without first providing them with meaningful notice or a real opportunity to seek protection from removal to those countries based on fear of persecution or torture. The lawsuit was filed on March 23, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.\n\n**Parties:**  \nThe plaintiffs are a group of noncitizens subject to final removal orders, all of whom had been ordered removed to a particular country (often their country of origin) and, in some cases, granted protection from removal to that country due to risk of persecution or torture. Plaintiffs act on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals—those who, on or after February 18, 2025, have been or will be removed to a country not previously designated for removal and not identified in writing in prior proceedings. The defendants are the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, the U.S. Attorney General, and the Superintendent of Plymouth County Correctional Facility. Plaintiffs are represented by private immigration and civil rights counsel, including the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, and Human Rights First.\n\n**Legal Foundation:**  \nPlaintiffs bring claims under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), specifically 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA) (implementing the Convention Against Torture), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. They allege that DHS’s policy or practice of deporting class members to third countries without advance written notice or a meaningful opportunity to apply for protection violates statutory, regulatory, and constitutional guarantees against removal to countries where they would face persecution or torture. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including setting aside DHS’s policy and requiring notice and an opportunity to be heard before any removal to a third country.\n\n**Factual Basis:**  \nPlaintiffs allege that, starting in early 2025, DHS implemented a directive to review noncitizens with final removal orders for possible re-detention and removal to third countries, including countries that had not been designated during prior removal proceedings. Under DHS’s policy, if the United States has received “diplomatic assurances” from a third country that it will not persecute or torture removed individuals, DHS may remove a person there without further process. In cases without such assurances, DHS provides only minimal notice (sometimes as little as 6-24 hours), does not affirmatively inquire about fear of removal, and, if a person raises a fear, conducts a summary screening within 24 hours. Plaintiffs and class members have been removed to countries such as Mexico, El Salvador, and South Sudan under this policy—sometimes without any notice, or with notice only as removal is occurring, and without opportunity to present a fear-based claim to an immigration judge.\n\n**Proceedings and Rulings:**  \nEarly in the case, the court granted a temporary restraining order and, after further proceedings, certified the class and granted a preliminary injunction. The court found that DHS’s policy likely violates the INA, CAT, and due process, and ordered DHS to provide written notice (in a language the noncitizen understands, and to counsel if any) and a meaningful opportunity to raise a fear-based claim for protection before any removal to a third country. If a “reasonable fear” is found, DHS must move to reopen proceedings for an immigration judge to hear the claim; if not, the person must be given fifteen days to seek reopening. The court further clarified that “meaningful opportunity” required at least ten days’ advance notice.\n\nDHS sought to remove class members to third countries (including Libya and South Sudan), sometimes without complying with the court’s order. Plaintiffs moved for emergency relief to halt these removals. The court found that DHS had violated the preliminary injunction by removing class members to South Sudan with less than 24 hours’ notice and no meaningful opportunity to be heard, and ordered additional remedial measures.\n\n**Appellate Proceedings:**  \nDHS appealed the preliminary injunction to the First Circuit, which denied a stay pending appeal. DHS then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court, which stayed the preliminary injunction pending appeal and any petition for certiorari. As a result, the preliminary relief is not currently in effect, but the district court’s remedial order regarding the South Sudan removals remains in force for those individuals.\n\n**Policy Documents and Further Developments:**  \nDuring the litigation, DHS issued policy memoranda confirming its process for third-country removals, which allow removal based on diplomatic assurances or minimal notice and do not require affirmative inquiry into fear or a robust opportunity to seek protection. Plaintiffs’ ongoing summary judgment motion seeks a declaratory judgment that this policy violates statutory and constitutional requirements.\n\n**Judge Information:**  \nThe case is presided over by Judge Brian E. Murphy.\n\n**Related Cases:**  \nThe court and parties referenced related litigation regarding third-country removals and withholding protections, including recent Supreme Court and First Circuit decisions on related jurisdictional and statutory issues.\n\n**Status:**  \nThe class action remains pending. The preliminary injunction is stayed pending appellate review, but the district court continues to supervise compliance with its remedial orders and discovery regarding alleged violations. Plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion and other procedural matters are currently before the court, with further proceedings stayed pending appellate resolution of the preliminary injunction.",
    "46186": "On February 28, 2025, a group of individual noncitizens, U.S. sponsors, and a nonprofit organization filed a class action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts challenging actions by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and related agencies under the Trump administration. The case centers on the federal government’s abrupt termination and suspension of several humanitarian parole programs that had previously allowed noncitizens from Ukraine, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Afghanistan, and certain other countries to enter or remain in the United States for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).\n\nThe plaintiffs include individuals who entered the U.S. under these parole programs (such as Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, Central Americans escaping persecution, and Afghans evacuated after U.S. withdrawal), U.S. citizens who served as sponsors for such parolees or sought family reunification, and the Haitian Bridge Alliance, a nonprofit providing support to Haitian migrants. The class action was brought with the assistance of private counsel and nonprofit legal organizations.\n\nThe complaint alleges that, immediately upon assuming office on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued executive orders directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to terminate all “categorical parole programs,” specifically referencing the programs for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (“CHNV”). Acting Secretary Benjamine Huffman and other DHS officials then issued memoranda and directives pausing, terminating, or refusing to adjudicate applications for parole, re-parole, or other immigration benefits (such as asylum, Temporary Protected Status, and adjustment of status) for individuals who entered the U.S. through several parole programs, including Uniting for Ukraine (U4U), Operation Allies Welcome (OAW) for Afghans, Family Reunification Parole (FRP), Military Parole in Place (MPIP), and Central American Minors (CAM).\n\nOn March 25, 2025, DHS published a Federal Register notice formally terminating the CHNV parole processes and ordering that, as of April 24, 2025, all outstanding grants of parole and related work authorization for CHNV parolees would be ended unless the Secretary provided individualized relief. The stated justification included a shift in administration policy and concerns about vetting and fraud, but the notice applied categorically to all affected parolees. DHS also suspended the adjudication of all pending immigration benefit applications for parolees from these programs, citing security vetting reviews.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and in excess of statutory authority; that they violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; and that they failed to comply with required agency procedures for notice of termination. The suit sought declaratory and injunctive relief restoring the status quo, resuming parole and benefit adjudications, and prohibiting the mass termination of parole or work authorization without individual review.\n\nJudge Indira Talwani presides over the case. The court certified a class encompassing all individuals who received parole through the affected programs and had pending applications for re-parole or other immigration benefits, as well as U.S.-based supporters with pending sponsorship applications. On April 14, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction and class-wide stay preventing DHS from implementing its mass truncation of CHNV parole and related work authorization for existing parolees, pending further order. The court also stayed the indefinite suspension of re-parole and benefit adjudications for class members under the other parole programs.\n\nThe government appealed to the First Circuit, which denied the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal. The U.S. Supreme Court then granted the government’s application for a stay, allowing DHS to proceed with the mass termination of CHNV parolees’ status and work authorization while the appeal and any petition for certiorari are pending.\n\nDefendants have since filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction due to the discretionary nature of parole decisions and challenging the plaintiffs’ standing. The government asserts that the actions taken were within its statutory discretion and do not violate the APA or the Constitution.\n\nThe case remains pending, with the central issues now including whether DHS’s categorical termination of parole and suspension of benefit adjudications—without individualized review—is lawful or violates federal statutes and constitutional protections. No trial has been held, and there have been no reported opinions apart from the preliminary injunction and class certification orders. Appeals and further proceedings are ongoing.",
    "46180": "On February 25, 2025, three organizations representing educators and sociologists—the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), American Federation of Teachers–Maryland (AFT-MD), and the American Sociological Association (ASA)—filed suit in the District of Maryland, later joined by Eugene School District 4J from Oregon. Plaintiffs were represented by private public interest counsel. The defendants were the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) and senior DOE officials sued in their official capacities.\n\nThe case arose after DOE issued a “Dear Colleague Letter” (the Letter) on February 14, 2025, which purported to clarify educational institutions’ obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Equal Protection Clause in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (SFFA). The Letter declared that a wide range of activities—such as classroom teaching about systemic and structural racism, support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, and race-conscious admissions or support programs—were newly interpreted as potentially unlawful discrimination. It warned that DOE would begin enforcement based on this interpretation, including the possible loss of federal funding for noncompliance. The Letter was accompanied by FAQs and a new “End DEI” reporting portal soliciting complaints about DEI-related activities.\n\nIn April 2025, DOE took a further step by requiring every state and local education agency (SEA and LEA) to sign a Certification affirming compliance with this new interpretation of Title VI and SFFA as a condition of receiving federal funds, threatening funding termination, breach of contract, and False Claims Act (FCA) liability for “illegal DEI” practices. The Certification was sent out on April 3, 2025, with a short compliance deadline.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that both the Letter and the Certification Requirement imposed vague, overbroad, and viewpoint-discriminatory new requirements on educational institutions and teachers—chilling lawful speech and association, disrupting curriculum, and placing federal funding at risk. They argued these agency actions violated the First Amendment (free speech and association), the Fifth Amendment (due process vagueness), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for being arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and the Constitution, in excess of statutory authority, and issued without required notice-and-comment rulemaking. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including vacatur of both the Letter and the Certification.\n\nJudge Stephanie A. Gallagher presided. After initially granting a preliminary stay of the Letter (April 24, 2025), the court allowed the case to continue on summary judgment following amendment of the complaint to include Certification-related claims. Other related cases were pending in the Districts of New Hampshire and Columbia, which also issued preliminary injunctions against the Letter and Certification.\n\nOn August 14, 2025, the court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs on all claims except one (denying only a facial overbreadth challenge to the Certification), and for the government on that single count. The court found that both the Letter and the Certification were final agency actions and legislative rules that had been issued without notice-and-comment, in violation of the APA. The court held that DOE failed to consider the facts, law, reliance interests, or the Paperwork Reduction Act in promulgating the Certification. Both actions were found to be arbitrary and capricious, not in accordance with law, in excess of statutory authority (including the Department of Education Organization Act’s bar on federal control of curriculum), and contrary to constitutional rights—particularly the First Amendment (for content and viewpoint-based restrictions on classroom speech) and the Fifth Amendment (for vagueness).\n\nThe court VACATED both the Dear Colleague Letter and the Certification Requirement nationwide under the APA, restoring the legal status quo and precluding DOE from enforcing the challenged interpretations. No further injunctive or declaratory relief was ordered, as vacatur was held to provide complete relief. No administrative record was filed; no trial occurred. The court’s ruling follows multiple reported opinions and is final as of August 14, 2025.",
    "46119": "This case arises from the actions of the Department of Government Efficiency (“DOGE”), a newly established federal entity created by President Trump on January 20, 2025, and led in practice by Elon Musk. DOGE’s stated purpose is to implement the President’s agenda of government efficiency, but the plaintiffs allege that its activities have gone far beyond this, resulting in the effective dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (“USAID”). USAID, an independent executive agency created by Congress, is responsible for civilian foreign aid and development programs.\n\nThe case was initially filed on February 13, 2025, by a group of current and former USAID employees and contractors (who have proceeded anonymously due to safety and reputational concerns), supported by private and public interest counsel. The plaintiffs are individuals who, as of January 20, 2025, worked for USAID in various capacities, including civil service, Foreign Service, Foreign Service Limited, and as personal services contractors (PSCs). They seek to represent a class comprising all similarly situated USAID personnel employed or contracted during the relevant period.\n\nThe core legal claims are that: (1) Elon Musk, as de facto head of DOGE, exercised significant governmental authority over USAID without proper appointment under the Appointments Clause of Article II of the U.S. Constitution; and (2) the collective actions of DOGE and associated federal officials violated the Constitution’s separation of powers by dismantling a congressionally created agency without statutory authority or congressional consent. The complaint details that between January and March 2025, DOGE personnel—acting at Musk’s direction—gained unrestricted access to USAID’s systems, placed senior officials on administrative leave, ordered or initiated mass contract and grant terminations, physically closed USAID’s headquarters, erased digital infrastructure, and began large-scale reductions in force, often without warning, due process, or legal authority. The complaint further alleges that these actions caused plaintiffs and class members loss of employment or contract status, loss of access to work systems, disclosure of sensitive personal and professional data, reputational harm, and emotional distress.\n\nThe government, represented by the Department of Justice, moved to dismiss the action, arguing that claims by employees must be resolved through the Civil Service Reform Act and those by contractors through the Contract Disputes Act, and challenging the plaintiffs’ standing. The government also contends that the alleged harms are not traceable to Musk or DOGE, as lawful agency officials ultimately approved the challenged actions. The government further asserts that Musk was merely an advisor, not an “officer” under the Appointments Clause, and that any alleged overreach is, at most, a statutory rather than constitutional violation.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Theodore D. Chuang. On March 18, 2025, the district court issued a preliminary injunction, finding plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits of both their Appointments Clause and separation of powers claims, and halting further actions by DOGE and Musk to dismantle USAID. The government appealed, and the Fourth Circuit stayed the injunction pending appeal, highlighting the lack of proper defendants in the original complaint. Plaintiffs then amended the complaint to add USAID, the State Department, President Trump, and key agency officials as defendants, and clarified the status of each named plaintiff as employee or PSC.\n\nThe plaintiffs have moved for class certification for all persons employed by USAID—including PSCs—since January 20, 2025, seeking only declaratory and injunctive relief. They seek (1) a declaration that Musk’s and DOGE’s activities at USAID violate the Appointments Clause; (2) a declaration that the dismantling of USAID violates separation of powers principles; (3) an order setting aside all actions taken to unlawfully reorganize or eliminate USAID; and (4) an injunction barring further such actions absent congressional authorization. The government’s motion to dismiss and the class certification motion are currently pending before the district court. The Fourth Circuit has held the appeal in abeyance pending resolution of the motion to dismiss or other appealable orders.\n\nThe factual basis for the case includes detailed allegations of DOGE and Musk’s direct involvement in mass employment actions, contract and grant terminations, system shutdowns, and public statements disparaging USAID and its staff, all allegedly outside statutory and constitutional bounds. The complaint also alleges that these actions have severely disrupted USAID’s statutory missions and caused ongoing harm to the plaintiffs, the class, and the public interest. No trial has occurred, and the case is at the motion stage, with discovery contested and not yet underway. There are related cases pending in other courts, including actions by unions and PSC associations raising similar issues. No decree, settlement, or final judgment has been entered as of the date of this summary.",
    "46099": "On February 10, 2025, several nonprofit organizations that receive federal foreign assistance—including the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, Journalism Development Network, and the Center for Victims of Torture—filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of State, USAID, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the President, and senior agency officials. These organizations challenged a series of Executive Branch actions, beginning with President Trump’s Executive Order No. 14169 (issued January 20, 2025), which directed an immediate, government-wide “pause” on foreign aid obligations and disbursements for review of alignment with “America First” foreign policy. Agency heads, including the Secretary of State and USAID, implemented the order by issuing blanket stop-work orders and suspending or terminating thousands of existing foreign assistance grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements.\n\nPlaintiffs were represented by private counsel from Public Citizen Litigation Group. They alleged that the funding freeze and subsequent mass terminations of foreign assistance awards exceeded the President’s constitutional authority, violated the Take Care Clause, violated the separation of powers, and violated various federal statutes, including the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Impoundment Control Act, the Anti-Deficiency Act, and provisions of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore the flow of funds, prohibit “unlawful impoundment” of appropriated funds, and reinstate terminated awards.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Amir H. Ali. On February 13, 2025, Judge Ali granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) in part, enjoining agency defendants (but not the President) from enforcing the blanket funding freeze and suspending payments or issuing new terminations for preexisting awards. The court subsequently enforced compliance with the TRO despite continuing noncompliance by defendants, and denied motions by the government to stay the orders pending appeal.\n\nAfter expedited briefing and hearings, on March 10, 2025, the district court issued a preliminary injunction. The court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the blanket suspension of foreign aid was arbitrary and capricious under the APA and, separately, that the Executive’s impoundment of appropriated foreign aid funds—without following statutory procedures for rescission or deferral—violated the separation of powers. The injunction required defendants to lift the freeze, reinstate payments for work completed before February 13, 2025, and “make available for obligation the full amount of funds that Congress appropriated for foreign assistance programs.” The court found that continued impoundment threatened the existence of the plaintiff organizations and caused severe humanitarian harm worldwide.\n\nDefendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which expedited briefing. On August 13, 2025, a divided panel of the D.C. Circuit (Judge Henderson writing, Judge Pan dissenting) vacated the preliminary injunction as it related to the obligation of appropriated funds. The Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to enforce the Impoundment Control Act or appropriations statutes. The court reasoned that claims challenging impoundment by the Executive must proceed through the statutory mechanism Congress created: the Comptroller General may bring an enforcement suit, but private grantees may not. The court further held that the plaintiffs could not reframe their statutory claims as constitutional separation-of-powers claims given the Supreme Court’s decision in Dalton v. Specter, and that ultra vires review was unavailable in this context. The panel recognized that plaintiffs had standing, but determined the absence of a cause of action was fatal to their requested relief.\n\nThus, the D.C. Circuit vacated the injunctive relief requiring the Executive to obligate the full amount of appropriated foreign aid funds, remanding for further proceedings. As of the most recent filings, the district court’s permanent resolution of the case—including the disposition of plaintiffs’ amended claims and motions to enforce the injunction—remains pending, with further proceedings likely to be shaped by the appellate decision.",
    "46093": "This case concerns the Trump Administration’s actions to suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) and defund its resettlement infrastructure, challenged by a group of refugees, U.S.-based family members, and national and local resettlement organizations. The lawsuit was filed on February 10, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The plaintiffs include individual refugees abroad who were in the final stages of resettlement, U.S. citizens seeking to reunite with family members through the follow-to-join (FTJ) program, refugees recently arrived in the country, and three nonprofit resettlement agencies (HIAS, Inc., Church World Service, Inc., and Lutheran Community Services Northwest). The defendants are the President of the United States (Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity), and the Secretaries of State, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services, all sued in their official capacities. Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel and attorneys from the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) and Perkins Coie LLP.\n\nShortly after taking office for a second term, President Trump issued Executive Order 14163 (“Refugee Ban EO”) on January 20, 2025, suspending all refugee admissions under USRAP and all decisions on pending refugee applications indefinitely, subject to periodic review but with no firm timeline for resuming admissions. The stated justifications concerned national security, assimilation, and the impact of migration on U.S. communities, but the EO did not cite evidence that USRAP admissions caused these issues.\n\nFederal agencies immediately implemented the EO by halting refugee processing, canceling scheduled travel (even for refugees with imminent departures), and freezing all new USRAP admissions. The Department of State also suspended all funding for USRAP-related cooperative agreements to national and local resettlement agencies, instructing them to stop work, cancel obligations, and lay off staff. This funding suspension included support for overseas case processing, initial resettlement services, and post-arrival assistance for recent refugees and Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders. On February 26, 2025, after the district court’s first preliminary injunction, the government escalated by terminating all R&P (reception and placement) and most processing-related cooperative agreements with resettlement partners, thereby threatening the collapse of the USRAP infrastructure.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that these actions violated the Refugee Act of 1980, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Accardi doctrine (requiring agencies to follow their own rules), the U.S. Constitution (Fifth Amendment due process and separation of powers), and exceeded the President’s statutory authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f). They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to bar enforcement of the EO, halt the funding suspensions and terminations, and require restoration of USRAP operations and benefits.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Jamal N. Whitehead. On February 25, 2025, after expedited briefing, the court granted a preliminary injunction, finding plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits, that the President’s actions unlawfully nullified Congress’s statutory refugee program, and that the agencies’ implementation and funding suspensions were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law under the APA. The court ordered nationwide relief, enjoining enforcement of the EO, the USRAP suspension, and funding blocks. The government’s motion to stay the injunction was denied.\n\nThe government appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which stayed the preliminary injunction in most respects but kept it in place for a narrow group: those refugees who, as of January 20, 2025, had (1) an approved refugee application authorizing conditional admission, (2) clearance from USCIS for travel, and (3) arranged and confirmable travel plans. The Ninth Circuit later clarified that only those with a “strong reliance interest” comparable to the lead plaintiff (who had sold all belongings in preparation for travel that was then canceled) were protected, and that eligibility for relief would be determined case-by-case.\n\nThe government subsequently refused to process or admit many of these refugees, arguing that new executive orders (notably a June 4, 2025, travel ban) barred entry of refugees from certain countries, despite those orders containing carveouts for refugees. Plaintiffs sought further court intervention, and the district court issued a detailed compliance framework and appointed a magistrate judge to oversee case-by-case determinations of reliance interests, but rescinded the framework after the Ninth Circuit required a narrower, individualized approach.\n\nMeanwhile, the government moved to dismiss the case, arguing that APA review was barred or that the claims were really contract disputes over funding, and thus belonged in the Court of Federal Claims. The court denied the motion, holding that the claims were statutory and constitutional, not contractual, and that the APA provided a cause of action.\n\nOn July 30, 2025, the court certified three subclasses: (1) refugees/family members in the USRAP pipeline, (2) recently resettled refugees/SIVs within 90 days post-resettlement, and (3) FTJ petitioners. The named individual plaintiffs were appointed as subclass representatives, and IRAP and Perkins Coie as class counsel.\n\nThroughout, the factual record described severe, compounding harm to refugees stuck abroad or separated from family, to recent arrivals denied benefits, and to resettlement agencies forced into mass layoffs and existential threats to their operations.\n\nAs of the latest filings, the case remains pending in the district court, with class certification completed and the government’s motion to dismiss denied. Implementation of the injunction, as narrowed by the Ninth Circuit, is ongoing and subject to further judicial supervision and possible special master review. Appellate proceedings and further district court status conferences continue as the parties dispute the scope of relief and compliance.",
    "46065": "On February 7, 2025, the States of Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota, later joined by Colorado, along with three physician plaintiffs affiliated with Washington State’s medical institutions, filed a civil action in the Western District of Washington. They challenged the constitutionality of two executive orders issued by President Donald J. Trump in early 2025: Executive Order 14,187 (“Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation”) and Executive Order 14,168 (“Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”). The lawsuits were brought against numerous federal agencies and officials, including the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice, Defense, Education, and others, all represented by federal government counsel.\n\nThe plaintiff States operate or oversee public medical institutions and public health programs that provide gender-affirming care to transgender and gender-diverse youth and receive substantial federal research and education grants. The physician plaintiffs are pediatricians and endocrinologists who provide gender-affirming care to adolescents and are also affiliated with institutions receiving federal funds. Plaintiffs are represented by their respective state attorneys general and, in Washington, by private and assistant attorneys general.\n\nThe suit was filed as a non-class action, with the States asserting parens patriae, sovereign, and proprietary interests, and the physician plaintiffs asserting individual and third-party interests on behalf of their patients. The legal team is comprised of state attorneys general offices and, for the physicians, assistant attorneys general.\n\nThe main legal claims are that the executive orders violate the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers by usurping Congress’s exclusive authority to appropriate funds and set grant conditions, the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee by facially discriminating against transgender and gender-diverse people and restricting medical care based on sex and gender identity, the Tenth Amendment by intruding on state regulation of medical practice, and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause by being impermissibly vague. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including a prohibition on defendants from enforcing or implementing the challenged executive orders in the plaintiff States.\n\nThe factual basis for the case centers on the January 2025 executive orders, which directed federal agencies to immediately cut off federal research and education grants to medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to individuals under 19, and to otherwise bar federal funds from any entity that “promotes gender ideology.” The orders also directed prioritization of criminal enforcement under 18 U.S.C. § 116 (female genital mutilation) against providers of gender-affirming care, despite the statutory inapplicability and lack of medical evidence supporting such prosecutions. The plaintiff States and their medical institutions receive hundreds of millions of dollars annually in federal funding, and enforcement of the orders threatened the loss of these funds or forced the cessation of gender-affirming care.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Lauren King. Plaintiffs promptly filed an emergency motion for a TRO. On February 14, 2025, Judge King granted the TRO, enjoining the defendants from enforcing Section 4 of Executive Order 14,187 (the defunding provision) and Section 8(a) (the criminal enforcement directive) within the plaintiff States. The court subsequently issued a memorandum opinion detailing its reasoning, finding that the orders likely violated the separation of powers and equal protection and would cause irreparable harm by endangering the health and well-being of transgender youth and disrupting vital medical research and care.\n\nDefendants opposed the TRO and later the preliminary injunction, raising arguments about justiciability, interpretation of the orders, executive authority, and the nature of the medical evidence supporting gender-affirming care, but did not submit their own evidence or expert testimony.\n\nOn February 28, 2025, after briefing and oral argument, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court enjoined the implementation or enforcement of Section 4 of Executive Order 14,187 and Sections 3(e) and 3(g) of Executive Order 14,168 within the plaintiff States, barring the government from conditioning or withholding federal funding on the grounds of providing gender-affirming care. The court found that the orders violated the separation of powers by unilaterally attaching new conditions to congressionally appropriated grants, and violated the Fifth Amendment by facially discriminating against transgender persons and failing heightened scrutiny. The court declined to enjoin Section 8(a) of Executive Order 14,187 because plaintiffs had not shown a credible threat of prosecution under the female genital mutilation statute.\n\nFollowing the injunction, the court addressed issues of compliance, including a motion for contempt after the National Institutes of Health terminated a grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital. The court denied the contempt motion but granted expedited discovery into the reasons for the grant’s termination, later ordering defendants to correct their interpretation of the injunction’s scope regarding “gender-affirming care.” Defendants subsequently reinstated the grant.\n\nThe court set a schedule for initial disclosures and a joint status report, but later granted defendants’ motion to stay proceedings (except for preliminary injunction enforcement and related matters) pending appeal to the Ninth Circuit. The preliminary injunction remains in effect during the appeal.\n\nNo trial has occurred, and there is no class certification, settlement, or court-appointed monitor. There are related cases in other districts, notably parallel litigation in the District of Maryland resulting in a nationwide injunction, and in the District of Rhode Island. The court’s orders have been accompanied by detailed factual findings regarding the nature and efficacy of gender-affirming care, the evidence of harm to transgender youth, and the lack of congressional authorization for the executive actions challenged.",
    "46028": "This case was filed on February 4, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs include several transgender adolescents and young adults under nineteen, their parents, PFLAG, Inc. (a national nonprofit supporting LGBTQ+ families), and GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ+ Equality (a national nonprofit representing LGBTQ+ health professionals). The suit is brought by individual plaintiffs and not as a class action. Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel, including attorneys from the ACLU, Lambda Legal, and Jenner & Block.\n\nThe defendants are the President of the United States (in his official capacity), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its subagencies, key officials of HHS, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and its director. Defendants are represented by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nPlaintiffs challenge two executive orders issued by President Trump in January 2025: Executive Order 14,168 (“Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”) and Executive Order 14,187 (“Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation”). The first order directs federal agencies to ensure that federal funds are not used to promote “gender ideology,” while the second instructs agencies to take immediate steps to end federal research and education funding to institutions that provide gender affirming medical care to people under nineteen.\n\nThe factual basis for the case is that following these executive orders, hospitals and medical institutions across the United States abruptly stopped providing gender affirming medical care (including puberty blockers and hormone therapy) to transgender people under nineteen. Hospitals cited the risk of losing all federal funding—not just for gender affirming care but across their programs—as the reason for these shutdowns. Multiple federal agencies, including HRSA and CDC, issued notices to grantees terminating or threatening to terminate federal funding in line with the executive orders. The result was the cancellation of medical appointments and cessation of care for transgender plaintiffs and other PFLAG members. Plaintiffs and their families allege severe and immediate harm, including risks to mental and physical health, due to the sudden loss of medically necessary treatment.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the executive orders are unconstitutional and unlawful. They assert causes of action under the separation of powers (arguing the executive orders exceed presidential authority and violate the Appropriations, Spending, and Presentment Clauses), and under federal nondiscrimination statutes—specifically, Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. § 18116) and Section 1908 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. § 300w-7), which prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded health programs. Plaintiffs also allege violations of the Equal Protection and Due Process components of the Fifth Amendment and raise a First Amendment claim. The remedies sought include declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement of the challenged executive orders, as well as attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nThe case is assigned to Judge Brendan Abell Hurson. There are no consolidated or related cases noted in this record, though similar orders and litigation have proceeded in other courts.\n\nAfter the complaint was filed, Plaintiffs sought emergency relief. On February 13, 2025, following a hearing, Judge Hurson granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining federal agencies from implementing or enforcing the challenged provisions of the executive orders as they relate to withholding federal funding from institutions providing gender affirming medical care to transgender patients under nineteen. Judge Hurson found Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the orders violated the separation of powers and federal nondiscrimination statutes, and that Plaintiffs faced irreparable harm due to the loss of medical care.\n\nOn March 4, 2025, the Court issued a detailed memorandum opinion and granted a preliminary injunction extending the TRO, again enjoining HHS, its subagencies, NSF, and their officials from conditioning, withholding, or terminating federal funding based on the provision of gender affirming medical care to people under nineteen. The order required notice to all relevant federal employees and grantees and directed Defendants not to take any steps to implement or reinstate the challenged directives under any name. The Court rejected Defendants’ arguments that the orders were lawful expressions of executive power, finding that the President lacked authority to impose new funding conditions not authorized by Congress, and further determined the orders were likely to violate statutory and constitutional prohibitions against sex discrimination. On March 21, 2025, Defendants noticed an interlocutory appeal to the Fourth Circuit.\n\nSubsequently, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to enforce the preliminary injunction, alleging that HHS subagencies had violated the injunction by issuing new notices threatening future funding restrictions. The Court denied the motion without prejudice, finding that, as of that time, the agencies’ communications did not constitute a clear and unequivocal violation of the injunction because they were only advisory and did not actually withhold or condition funding.\n\nAs of the most recent filings, the preliminary injunction remains in effect, and further district court proceedings are stayed pending resolution of the interlocutory appeal. No trial has been held, and there has been no settlement or consent decree. No court-appointed monitor has been assigned, and there are no ongoing monitoring reports in the record. The case remains pending on appeal.",
    "46306": "This case concerns the federal government’s abrupt termination of funding for direct legal representation of unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings. On March 26, 2025, a coalition of nonprofit legal services providers—who had been funded by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through a contract administered by the Department of the Interior (DOI)—filed suit in the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs are organizations from across the United States that provide legal representation to unaccompanied children in removal proceedings or in seeking immigration relief. The government defendants are HHS, ORR, and DOI.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by a mix of private attorneys and nonprofit legal organizations, including the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, and Justice Action Center. The case does not involve a class action; each plaintiff is a nonprofit entity that provides legal services to unaccompanied children.\n\nThe underlying facts stem from Congress’s mandate under the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), which requires HHS to “ensure, to the greatest extent practicable,” that all unaccompanied children have counsel in legal proceedings. Since 2012, Congress has appropriated funding to support this mandate, and in 2024, ORR promulgated the “Foundational Rule” (45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4)), which directs ORR to fund legal service providers for direct representation of unaccompanied children, subject to appropriations and the impracticability of securing pro bono counsel.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, without advance notice, DOI sent a “Notice of Partial Termination for the Government’s Convenience” to Acacia Center for Justice, the prime contractor administering the program, effectively terminating all funding for direct legal representation services for unaccompanied children. The contract line items that funded direct representation, friend-of-court services, Immigrant Justice Corps fellows, and related training were all halted, leaving only “know your rights” presentations and consultations. Acacia and its network of subcontractors, including all plaintiffs, were instructed to stop work immediately on the terminated items. The government did not provide any alternative plan for ensuring representation or offer guidance for ongoing cases.\n\nAs a result, the plaintiffs alleged that thousands of unaccompanied children—many with imminent court hearings—faced loss of counsel, risking deportation or loss of legal relief for which they might qualify. Plaintiffs also faced imminent layoffs, program disruptions, and the potential inability to meet ethical duties to current clients. They sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to require the government to continue funding representation, arguing the termination violated the TVPRA, the Foundational Rule, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The legal claims were based explicitly on the APA (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)), the TVPRA (8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5)), and the Foundational Rule.\n\nJudge Araceli Martinez-Olguin presided over the case. On April 1, 2025, the court granted a TRO, enjoining the government from withdrawing services or funds supporting direct legal representation for unaccompanied children. The court found that the plaintiffs had standing, that the TVPRA and Foundational Rule likely imposed enforceable obligations, and that the sudden termination caused irreparable harm. The government’s arguments that the court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, or that the issue was committed to agency discretion, were rejected. The court later extended the TRO to allow for briefing on the government’s motion to recuse the judge, which was ultimately denied.\n\nThe government appealed the TRO, but the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding the TRO was not appealable as a preliminary injunction. The government’s petition for rehearing en banc was also denied.\n\nOn April 29, 2025, the district court issued a preliminary injunction, again enjoining the government from withdrawing funding for direct legal representation for unaccompanied children. The court reaffirmed that the TVPRA and Foundational Rule required the government to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that unaccompanied children receive counsel, and that appropriations for these services remained available. The court found that the government’s termination, without ensuring representation through other means, likely violated the APA as contrary to law, in violation of its own regulations (under the Accardi doctrine), and as arbitrary and capricious agency action. The preliminary injunction was issued nationwide, as the only way to provide effective relief and maintain consistency in immigration policy.\n\nHHS, ORR, and DOI moved for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal, but the district court denied the motion. The government filed an emergency motion for a stay in the Ninth Circuit. On May 14, 2025, a Ninth Circuit panel (Judges W. Fletcher, Callahan, and Koh) denied the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal, holding that the government had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable injury. The panel found that the APA claims were not precluded by the Tucker Act (as the legal services organizations were not in privity with the federal government and their claims were statutory, not contractual) and that the APA’s “committed to agency discretion” exception did not apply because the TVPRA and Foundational Rule imposed meaningful standards for judicial review.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the government maintained that the decision to terminate funding was a lawful exercise of agency discretion, that the court lacked jurisdiction under the APA and Tucker Act, and that any order to pay money under the contract would violate sovereign immunity. The court and appellate panels disagreed, finding the statutory and regulatory framework imposed enforceable duties and that withholding all funding for direct representation, with no plan to secure such representation otherwise, was unlawful.\n\nAt the time of the latest filings, the preliminary injunction remained in effect, requiring the government to maintain funding for direct legal representation for unaccompanied children nationwide, pending final judgment or further appellate action. No trial has been held or scheduled, and the case remains pending on the merits. There are no consolidated cases or appointed monitors. The litigation is ongoing, with regular status reports required regarding compliance with the injunction.",
    "46201": "On March 6, 2025, eight states—California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Wisconsin—filed suit in the District of Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Education and senior officials, seeking to challenge the Department’s abrupt termination of federal grants previously awarded under two Congressionally mandated teacher support programs: the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) and Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) programs. The states, represented by their Attorneys General, brought the case through public counsel. The lawsuit was not a class action but was brought by these state governments as individual plaintiffs.\n\nThe underlying dispute arose after a series of executive orders in January 2025 directed federal agencies to end funding for so-called \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI) initiatives. In response, the Department of Education issued an internal directive on February 5, 2025, instructing staff to review and potentially terminate grants inconsistent with newly identified departmental priorities, particularly those related to DEI. Within days, the Department sent form termination letters to nearly all recipients of TQP and SEED grants, affecting over $250 million in awarded and obligated funds for teacher recruitment, training, and support across the plaintiff states. The termination letters cited 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) as authority, asserting that the grants no longer effectuated Department priorities, but failed to specify which rationale applied to each grant or provide individualized factual findings or prior notice.\n\nThe plaintiff states alleged that the Department’s actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), specifically as arbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law, because the Department failed to provide a reasoned explanation, did not consider reliance interests or individualized circumstances, relied on priorities not promulgated through required notice-and-comment procedures, and contradicted Congressional intent as reflected in the governing statutes. The states sought a declaratory judgment, vacatur of the terminations, and a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to restore the status quo and prevent irreparable disruption to public education systems.\n\nJudge Myong J. Joun granted the TRO on March 10, 2025, temporarily enjoining the Department from enforcing the terminations and restoring access to grant funds for all affected recipients in the plaintiff states. The court found a likelihood of success on the merits of the APA claims, irreparable harm to the states and their educational institutions, and that the balance of equities and public interest favored injunctive relief. The government immediately appealed to the First Circuit and sought a stay, which was denied at both the district and appellate levels. However, the Supreme Court then granted an emergency application for a stay on April 4, 2025, and construed the TRO as an appealable preliminary injunction. The Supreme Court's per curiam opinion found the states' claims to be, in essence, contract actions for money damages, and thus likely within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, not the district court, and expressed doubt that the APA provided a waiver of sovereign immunity for the relief sought in this context. The Supreme Court also found that the risk of irretrievable payments justified a stay pending appeal.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's intervention, the plaintiff states withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. The First Circuit dismissed the government’s appeal as moot. In the district court, the states filed an amended complaint on June 2, 2025, reiterating their APA, statutory, constitutional, and ultra vires claims, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to vacate the terminations and prevent similar future actions. The Department then filed a renewed motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims, again arguing lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under the APA and the Tucker Act.\n\nNo trial has been held, and there has been no class certification, settlement, or court-enforced decree. The litigation remains ongoing, with all parties awaiting a ruling on the government’s jurisdictional challenge to the amended complaint.\n\nThe case is captioned State of California et al. v. U.S. Department of Education et al., Case No. 1:25-cv-10548, in the District of Massachusetts. The presiding judge on current motions is District Judge Angel Kelley, following the recusal of Judge Joun. The core factual basis centers on the mass termination of Congressionally authorized teacher grant programs, the resulting disruption to state educational systems, and the legal limits on federal agency discretion to withhold or rescind previously awarded federal funds.",
    "46057": "On February 6, 2025, seven individual transgender service members, an aspiring service member, and a Washington-based civil rights organization filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, challenging the constitutionality of Executive Order No. 14183 and its implementing Department of Defense (DoD) policy (the “2025 Military Ban”). The plaintiffs are decorated, currently serving officers and enlisted personnel in the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as an individual seeking to enlist and an organizational plaintiff with transgender military members. The defendants are the United States, senior federal officials and entities responsible for military policy, and several military department leaders. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel, Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., Perkins Coie LLP, and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.\n\nThe 2025 Military Ban, issued by President Trump on January 27, 2025, and implemented by DoD Secretary Peter Hegseth, prohibits transgender people—defined as those with a current or historical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, or those who have attempted or completed gender transition—from serving in the U.S. military. The policy mandates separation of current transgender service members, rescinds prior inclusive policies, and enforces strict adherence to standards associated with birth sex (including pronouns, uniforms, facilities, and fitness requirements), regardless of gender identity. Waivers are available only under highly restrictive conditions and require proof of 36 months’ stability, no attempt to transition, and a compelling government interest in retention. There is no general exemption for those currently serving or who transitioned under prior policies.\n\nPlaintiffs challenge the Ban under the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection and Due Process components, the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause, and on equitable estoppel grounds. They allege that the Ban facially and intentionally discriminates based on transgender status and sex, penalizes and chills constitutionally protected speech and gender expression, and retroactively punishes service members who relied on earlier policies allowing open service. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement of the Ban and related guidance.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, following briefing, declarations, and a hearing, Judge Benjamin H. Settle granted a nationwide preliminary injunction. The court found that the Ban constituted a de facto blanket prohibition on transgender service, was not the product of meaningful military deliberation, and was unsupported by evidence of any adverse impact on readiness, cohesion, or cost. The court applied heightened scrutiny, found the government’s proffered rationales lacking, and concluded the Ban would cause irreparable harm to plaintiffs by ending military careers and denying aspiring members the opportunity to serve. The injunction restored the status quo ante—the 2021 “Austin Policy”—which permits open service by transgender individuals under consistent standards.\n\nThe government appealed to the Ninth Circuit, seeking a stay of the injunction, and also applied to the Supreme Court for a stay. Both the district court and the Ninth Circuit denied the government’s requests for a stay pending appeal, finding no showing of irreparable harm to the government. On May 6, 2025, the Supreme Court granted the government’s application for a stay, permitting enforcement of the Ban pending disposition of the appeal and any petition for certiorari.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the government has not pointed to evidence of harm caused by transgender service members under prior inclusive policies, and several former military officials testified that open service had no negative impacts. The case is related to parallel litigation in other districts (notably Talbott v. Trump), and the Ban represents a departure from prior policies under the Obama and Biden administrations and from an earlier, more limited ban under President Trump’s first term. The case remains pending in the district court, with proceedings stayed while the appellate process unfolds.\n\n**Judge:**  \nJudge Benjamin H. Settle is the presiding judge.\n\n**Type of Counsel:**  \nPlaintiffs are represented by private counsel (Perkins Coie LLP), Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., and Human Rights Campaign Foundation.\n\n**Cause of Action and Statutory/Constitutional Basis:**  \nPlaintiffs bring claims under the Fifth Amendment (Equal Protection and Due Process), the First Amendment (Free Speech), and equitable estoppel. No specific statutory cause of action is cited beyond the constitutional claims and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1346, and 1361 (federal question and agency action).\n\n**Remedy Sought:**  \nDeclaratory judgment and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting implementation and enforcement of the 2025 Military Ban and related guidance.\n\n**Related Cases:**  \nThe case is related to Talbott v. Trump (D.D.C.), Ireland v. Hegseth (D.N.J.), and historically to Karnoski v. Trump (W.D. Wash.).\n\n**Important Filings and Rulings:**  \n- Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction (granted March 27, 2025).\n- District court nationwide preliminary injunction (March 27, 2025).\n- Denial of government’s motions for a stay by the district court and Ninth Circuit.\n- Supreme Court grant of stay (May 6, 2025), permitting enforcement of the Ban pending appeal.\n\n**Factual Basis:**  \nThe Ban reverses nearly a decade of policy permitting open service by transgender individuals, a policy adopted after study and implemented without evidence of adverse effects. Plaintiffs are decorated and experienced service members who have served openly without incident, as corroborated by multiple former military leaders. The Ban is alleged to be motivated by animus and is unsupported by evidence of harm to military interests.\n\n**Current Status:**  \nThe March 27, 2025 preliminary injunction is stayed by Supreme Court order, and enforcement of the Ban is permitted pending appeal and further proceedings. The case remains active in the district court and Ninth Circuit.",
    "45984": "On January 28, 2025, a group of transgender service members and individuals seeking to join the U.S. military challenged a new executive order issued by President Donald J. Trump on January 27, 2025, that banned transgender people from serving in the military. The executive order, accompanied by additional implementation memoranda from the Department of Defense (DoD), reversed existing policies that had allowed transgender individuals to serve openly, provided they met military standards. The order stated that transgender status is incompatible with “high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity,” and directed the DoD to update its medical and retention standards to bar transgender people from enlistment and continued service. The order also required all service members to be treated according to their birth sex with respect to pronouns, grooming, housing, and access to facilities, and cancelled all transition-related medical care.\n\nThe plaintiffs are current and prospective transgender service members from multiple military branches, many with long and decorated careers. They are represented by private counsel, including civil rights and LGBTQ legal organizations. The complaint alleges that the ban and related policies violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, as well as procedural due process, and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the ban.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Ana C. Reyes in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Plaintiffs promptly moved for a preliminary injunction. The DoD, following the executive order, issued implementing guidance that required the identification and administrative separation of transgender service members, and barred accession of transgender applicants. The DoD guidance included a purported waiver process, but this process was found to be effectively unavailable to transgender individuals.\n\nThe court conducted an evidentiary hearing and accepted extensive factual declarations from both sides. Plaintiffs presented evidence, including from former senior military and civilian defense officials, that transgender service members had served openly under the prior policy without incident or impairment to military readiness, and that the new ban was causing immediate and irreparable harm, including removal from active duty, cancellation of medical care, and stigmatization. Defendants argued that the policy was justified by concerns about readiness, deployability, unit cohesion, and cost, but did not produce contemporaneous evidence of actual problems caused by transgender service members under the prior policy.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, Judge Reyes granted a preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their equal protection claim and that the executive order and DoD guidance were likely motivated by impermissible animus toward transgender people, rather than by evidence-based military judgment. The court found that the policies facially discriminated based on sex and transgender status, and failed even rational basis review, let alone the heightened scrutiny required. The court ordered the DoD to maintain the status quo ante—continuing the policies in place prior to the Trump executive order—and to refrain from implementing the ban or any related guidance pending further order.\n\nDefendants moved to dissolve or stay the injunction, arguing that new DoD guidance clarified that only individuals with a current diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria (as defined by the DSM-5) would be excluded, not all transgender individuals. The court denied the motion, finding that the revised guidance continued to target transgender people as a group and that the policy was not a legitimate medical regulation but an exclusion of a protected class. The court stayed its injunction briefly to allow defendants to seek appellate review.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the D.C. Circuit issued an administrative stay of the preliminary injunction to allow time for further briefing and consideration of the government’s motion for stay pending appeal.\n\nNo trial has occurred. The preliminary injunction is under appellate review. The case is notable for its comprehensive factual record, the involvement of decorated service members as plaintiffs, and the court’s finding that the challenged policy is likely unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee.",
    "45964": "On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 14160, which directed federal agencies not to recognize U.S. citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who were either unlawfully present or lawfully present only on a temporary basis, unless at least one parent was a citizen or lawful permanent resident. The States of Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon filed suit the next day in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, challenging the Executive Order as unconstitutional and in violation of federal law. They were later joined by a group of noncitizen pregnant women and, after consolidation, by a putative class.\n\nThe States alleged that the Executive Order violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause, which guarantees citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” and also violated Section 1401 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which closely tracks the constitutional language. The States, represented by their respective Attorneys General, claimed that the Order would directly harm them by causing the loss of federal funds tied to programs such as Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and foster care, and by imposing immediate and significant administrative burdens to rework eligibility systems for these programs. They also alleged irreparable harm to the rights and welfare of their residents, including children who would be rendered stateless, ineligible for public benefits, or at risk of family separation and deportation.\n\nThe States sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order barring federal agencies from implementing or enforcing the Executive Order. The district court, presided over by Judge John C. Coughenour, granted a temporary restraining order and, after briefing and argument, entered a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement of the Order nationwide. The district court found that the States had standing due to direct economic and operational harms and concluded that the Order likely violated both the Constitution and the INA.\n\nThe Federal Government appealed, arguing that the States lacked standing, that the Order was lawful, and that the injunction was improperly broad. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court, holding that the States had standing based on the imminent, concrete loss of federal funds and unrecoverable administrative costs, all caused by the Order’s denial of citizenship to thousands of newborns each month. The Ninth Circuit further held that the Order contradicted the plain text of the Fourteenth Amendment and Supreme Court precedent, which historically and consistently recognized automatic birthright citizenship for nearly all children born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parents’ immigration status, with only narrow exceptions for the children of diplomats, invading armies, or tribal Indians (the latter since superseded by statute).\n\nDuring the appeal, the Supreme Court reviewed the scope of the injunction, holding that “universal” (nationwide) injunctions are generally improper unless necessary to afford complete relief to the parties. The Supreme Court remanded for determination whether a universal injunction was needed to provide the States full relief. The Ninth Circuit found that, due to interstate movement of affected children and the federal structure of benefits programs, only a universal injunction could prevent the States from suffering the irreparable harms identified.\n\nThe court dismissed the Individual Plaintiffs’ claims as moot or as encompassed by a certified nationwide class action in another federal court (in New Hampshire), thus limiting the case to the State Plaintiffs. No trial was held; the case was decided on motions and legal briefing. There was no appointment of a special monitor. The case produced reported opinions at both the district and circuit levels, and the Supreme Court’s order on the scope of injunctions.\n\nIn summary, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction, holding that President Trump’s Executive Order attempting to restrict birthright citizenship was unconstitutional and invalid. The court enjoined the federal government from implementing or enforcing the Order nationwide, as necessary to give the States complete relief, and dismissed the individual claims as duplicative of ongoing class litigation.",
    "45965": "This case began on January 21, 2025, when two immigrant rights organizations—CASA, Inc. and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project—and several individual plaintiffs, all pregnant women without permanent immigration status, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The suit challenges Executive Order 14,160, issued by President Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, which directs federal agencies to stop recognizing birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to noncitizen parents, where the mother is either unlawfully present or only temporarily present and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. The complaint was later amended to proceed as a class action on behalf of all affected children and their parents.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by counsel from CASA, Inc., the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law. Their claims are brought under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), specifically 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a), arguing that the Executive Order unlawfully denies citizenship guaranteed by the Constitution and statute. The suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief preventing enforcement of the Executive Order against the class, as well as a declaration of the children’s U.S. citizenship.\n\nThe lead judge is Deborah L. Boardman. The defendants are President Trump and the heads of several federal agencies responsible for issuing citizenship documentation and administering immigration and benefit programs, all sued in their official capacities.\n\nInitially, the district court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the Executive Order. The government appealed. The Supreme Court, in Trump v. CASA, Inc., 145 S. Ct. 2540 (2025) (Justice Barrett), held that federal courts lack authority to issue universal injunctions except to provide complete relief to the parties or certified class members. The Supreme Court stayed the broad preliminary injunction but allowed plaintiffs to seek class-wide relief under Rule 23.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s decision, the plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint and moved for class certification and a classwide preliminary injunction. The district court certified a nationwide class of children born (or to be born) in the United States after February 19, 2025, whose mothers are either unlawfully present or temporarily present and whose fathers are neither U.S. citizens nor lawful permanent residents. The named class representatives are parents acting as next friends to affected children, some of whom have already given birth. The court appointed counsel from ICAP and ASAP as class counsel.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, the court granted a classwide preliminary injunction, enjoining the enforcement of the Executive Order as to the entire certified class. The court found the class met all requirements of Rule 23, including numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy. It held that the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed on their claims, that the class would face irreparable harm if the Executive Order took effect, and that the balance of equities and the public interest strongly favored an injunction. The injunction prohibits federal agencies from refusing to recognize the citizenship of class members or from denying documentation or benefits on the basis of the Executive Order, pending a final decision on the merits. The court dissolved its earlier individual-based injunction, finding the classwide injunction provided complete relief.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on the Executive Order’s departure from longstanding constitutional and statutory guarantees of birthright citizenship, which the plaintiffs allege would cause widespread harm and uncertainty to children born on U.S. soil and their families. The court found that the government would not be harmed by an injunction that preserves the status quo of birthright citizenship, and that the Executive Order is likely unconstitutional under binding precedent such as United States v. Wong Kim Ark.\n\nNo settlements, monitors, or consent decrees are present in the record, and no trial has occurred. The case is ongoing, with the classwide injunction in place and subject to future appellate review.",
    "VR-LA-0120": "On May 19, 2020, several Louisiana voters, a civic engagement organization, and the League of Women Voters Louisiana filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana against the Governor, Secretary of State, and Attorney General of Louisiana. The plaintiffs challenged multiple provisions of Louisiana’s absentee voting laws as applied to the elections scheduled for July, August, November, and December 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The case was later consolidated with a similar action brought by the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice, the Louisiana State Conference of the NAACP, and individual voters.\n\nPlaintiffs, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and other legal organizations, alleged that Louisiana’s excuse requirement for absentee voting, the witness requirement for absentee ballots, and the lack of a “cure” process for absentee ballots violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. They asserted that these provisions forced voters—especially those at heightened risk from COVID-19, those living with vulnerable individuals, and Black voters who disproportionately faced health and socioeconomic burdens—to choose between their health and their right to vote. Plaintiffs also argued that these restrictions unduly burdened the right to vote and amounted to unconstitutional conditions by making the right to vote contingent on risking bodily integrity.\n\nIn addition to the individual voters' claims, the organizational plaintiffs asserted that their resources and efforts to promote civic participation were diverted to combat the burdens imposed by the challenged provisions, further supporting their standing. The legal claims sought injunctive and declaratory relief, including an order to enjoin the excuse and witness requirements for absentee voting for all 2020 elections, to require a process for voters to cure ballot deficiencies, and to extend the early voting period.\n\nDefendants, including the Governor, Secretary of State, and Attorney General (the latter also intervening on behalf of the State), moved to dismiss, primarily on jurisdictional grounds. The State argued that plaintiffs lacked Article III standing because any injury was speculative and not traceable to state action, but rather to the external impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The State also raised the Purcell doctrine, urging the court not to order changes to election procedures close to an election, and asserted that the case presented a non-justiciable political question.\n\nOn June 22, 2020, the district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of standing, concluding that the plaintiffs' alleged injuries were too speculative and not sufficiently concrete or imminent to confer Article III jurisdiction. The court did not reach the merits or the defendants' additional arguments under Rules 12(b)(6) or 12(b)(7). The original judgment dismissed the case with prejudice, but on the plaintiffs’ motion, the court amended the judgment on June 30, 2020, to clarify that dismissal was without prejudice, allowing for the possibility that the plaintiffs could refile if circumstances changed.\n\nNo trial was held, and there was no substantive ruling on the constitutionality of the challenged laws. No injunctive or declaratory relief was granted. The court’s ruling was limited to the threshold jurisdictional issue. There is no indication in the record of any appeal from this judgment.",
    "VR-SC-0078": "This case, filed April 22, 2020, in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina (Columbia Division), concerns the impact of South Carolina’s absentee voting laws on the right to vote during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs—consisting of individual voters at high risk for COVID-19 complications, a nonprofit organization (The Family Unit, Inc.), and later the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP—challenged two absentee voting requirements: (1) the Excuse Requirement, which limits eligibility for absentee voting to specific statutory categories (S.C. Code Ann. § 7-15-320), and (2) the Witness Requirement, which mandates that an absentee ballot envelope be signed by a third-party witness (S.C. Code Ann. § 7-15-220).\n\nThe defendants are members and the Executive Director of the South Carolina State Election Commission, sued in their official capacities, and the Governor of South Carolina. The South Carolina Republican Party, as well as legislative leaders (the Speaker of the House and President of the Senate), intervened in the case. Plaintiffs were represented by the ACLU and NAACP Legal Defense Fund, among others; the defendants by private counsel and the State Attorney General.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that, amid the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health orders, these requirements forced voters—particularly those who are elderly, have disabilities, or are Black—into an untenable choice between their health and their right to vote, violating the First and Fourteenth Amendments, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, including an order permitting all voters to cast absentee ballots and eliminating the witness requirement for the duration of the pandemic.\n\nShortly after the suit was filed, the South Carolina legislature enacted a temporary change (S.C. Act 133, signed May 13, 2020), allowing all voters to cast absentee ballots in the June 2020 primary and runoff elections due to the state of emergency. This mooted the challenge to the Excuse Requirement for the June elections, but not for later elections, including the November general election. The Witness Requirement, however, remained in force.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, Judge J. Michelle Childs issued a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the Witness Requirement for the June 2020 primary and runoff elections, finding that, under pandemic conditions, it likely imposed a severe burden on the right to vote that outweighed the state’s interests. The court ordered election officials to inform voters of the suspension of the witness rule for those elections. The court declined to enjoin the Excuse Requirement for elections beyond June 2020 at that time due to legislative action and procedural circumstances.\n\nAfter the June primaries, the temporary legislative expansion of absentee eligibility expired. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking permanent injunctive relief against both requirements for the November 2020 election and beyond, citing ongoing COVID-19 risks. The court consolidated related cases and permitted additional parties, including the legislative leaders, to intervene.\n\nThe state and intervenors moved for summary judgment, arguing plaintiffs lacked standing, that the requirements were reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and justified by state interests in election integrity and fraud prevention, and that no evidence showed a disparate impact on Black voters or voters with disabilities. They also cited legislative authority over election law under the South Carolina Constitution.\n\nDiscovery revealed that, during the June 2020 primaries, most voters continued to vote in person, and no COVID-19 outbreaks were traced to polling places. Plaintiffs’ depositions showed that those at high risk often could obtain a witness signature (e.g., from a housekeeper or family member), and organizational plaintiffs had difficulty identifying specific members unable to vote absentee due to the requirements.\n\nAs the federal case neared trial in September 2020, the court stayed proceedings after granting a similar preliminary injunction against the Witness Requirement in a related case (Middleton v. Andino), covering the November 2020 general election. The stay order held all motions and the trial in abeyance, pending further developments in the pandemic and legislative action. The court instructed plaintiffs to move to lift the stay if the situation changed before future statewide elections.\n\nThroughout the case, the court was presided over by Judge J. Michelle Childs. The parties were represented by private and nonprofit counsel, with participation by the United States (as amicus), the State Attorney General, and the Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. (as amicus). The case was not a class action. No court-appointed monitor was involved.

    "JC-MD-0017": "On April 21, 2020, a group of pretrial and post-conviction detainees, including Keith Seth, David Smith, Mario Burch, and individuals proceeding pseudonymously as John Does 1–5, filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against Mary Lou McDonough, Director of the Prince George’s County Department of Corrections, in her official capacity. The plaintiffs were represented by Civil Rights Corps and WilmerHale attorneys. They brought the suit on behalf of all individuals detained at the Prince George’s County Jail, including a subclass of those medically vulnerable to COVID-19 due to age or underlying health conditions.\n\nThe case arose during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Plaintiffs alleged that the Jail was experiencing an uncontrolled outbreak and had failed to follow CDC and public health guidance to prevent and treat COVID-19 among detainees. They claimed detainees did not have adequate access to soap, cleaning supplies, or information about COVID-19, and that those with symptoms or medically vulnerable status received inadequate or delayed medical care. Plaintiffs also challenged the Jail’s policy of detaining COVID-positive individuals who were otherwise legally entitled to release, and alleged that the Jail was subjecting all detainees to indefinite, near-solitary lockdown conditions without procedural protections or adequate mental health care.\n\nThe legal claims were brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments (for both conditions of confinement and overdetention), and under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 for habeas relief for the medically vulnerable subclass. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief requiring the Jail to implement CDC-recommended procedures to safeguard detainees’ health, as well as immediate release or transfer to home detention for members of the medically vulnerable subclass.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Paula Xinis. Plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction. The Court held expedited proceedings, appointing an independent infectious disease expert (Dr. Carlos Franco-Paredes) under Federal Rule of Evidence 706 to inspect the jail and report on its COVID-19 response.\n\nOn May 21, 2020, after reviewing declarations, expert reports, and the parties’ submissions, the Court found that the Jail had experienced a significant outbreak, had only limited testing, lacked a systematic plan for isolating and treating COVID-19-positive or medically vulnerable detainees, and that many detainees faced delayed or inadequate medical responses. The Court concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims regarding jail conditions, and that the risk of serious illness or death constituted irreparable harm. The Court issued a TRO requiring the Jail to file comprehensive written plans addressing the identification and protection of high-risk detainees, staff training, testing protocols, and continued provision of hygiene and social distancing measures, among other requirements. The Court denied immediate classwide release or transfer, holding that such relief would require further proceedings and was subject to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) limitations.\n\nThe Jail filed written plans as ordered. Plaintiffs and Defendant continued to dispute whether the Jail’s practices and plans satisfied constitutional standards, particularly with respect to ongoing lockdown conditions and procedural protections for detainees. The TRO was later permitted to expire without conversion to a preliminary injunction, and the Court denied further preliminary relief.\n\nThe case proceeded in discovery, with the Court hearing additional motions to dismiss by the Defendant, who argued that the claims were moot for released plaintiffs, that plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and that the amended complaint failed to state claims for relief. Plaintiffs opposed, maintaining that class claims remained viable and that the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement did not apply due to the unavailability of meaningful grievance procedures.\n\nSeparately, the parties engaged in settlement discussions with Magistrate Judge Timothy J.

    "IM-FL-0029": "On April 13, 2020, a group of civil immigration detainees held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at three South Florida facilities—the Krome Service Processing Center, Broward Transitional Center, and Glades County Detention Center—filed a class action in the Southern District of Florida. The lawsuit was pursued by legal services organizations and private counsel. The detainees, representing themselves and others similarly situated, sought emergency injunctive and declaratory relief, asserting that the conditions of their confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic placed them at imminent risk of serious illness or death.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that ICE’s practices at these facilities did not comply with CDC guidelines, ICE’s own Pandemic Response Requirements, or applicable detention standards. They claimed that social distancing was impossible, hygiene and cleaning supplies were inadequate, and cohorting and transfer practices heightened rather than mitigated the risk of COVID-19 transmission. The plaintiffs asserted that these failures amounted to violations of their Fifth Amendment due process rights and, by analogy, Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment, and also brought related claims under the Accardi doctrine for failure to follow government regulations.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Marcia G. Cooke, with Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman handling pretrial matters. Plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction. After an emergency hearing, the court issued a TRO and later a preliminary injunction. The court found, based on the evidence and witness testimony, that ICE had failed to implement adequate COVID-19 safety measures and showed deliberate indifference to the detainees’ safety. The orders required ICE to comply with CDC and its own guidelines, provide sufficient masks and hygiene supplies, educate detainees on COVID-19, limit transfers to those with negative COVID-19 tests, and maintain population levels consistent with public health guidance (generally not exceeding 75% of capacity).\n\nThe case was certified as a class action under Rule 23(b)(2), with the class defined as all current and future civil immigration detainees held at the three South Florida facilities. The court retained jurisdiction over transferred class members and appointed a special master to monitor compliance. The special master conducted facility inspections and reported that, while ICE had made some improvements, social distancing and other core preventive measures remained insufficient given the structure and operation of the facilities.\n\nThroughout the litigation, the court issued numerous orders enforcing the preliminary injunction, compelling ICE to comply with COVID-19 protocols, and ordering regular reporting. The parties engaged in extensive factual discovery, including depositions and expert reports.\n\nOn June 28, 2021, the parties reached a court-enforced class settlement. Under the agreement, ICE would maintain COVID-19 safety protocols at the three facilities, including full compliance with ICE and CDC guidelines, provision of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines at no cost to detainees, regular testing and isolation practices, unrestricted access to hygiene supplies, adequate social distancing where feasible, education on COVID-19, and continued population controls. The agreement also required ICE to log and report cleaning and supply distribution, ensure mask distribution, and limit transfers to those testing negative for COVID-19. The settlement allowed class members to pursue individual habeas claims for release, provided for court enforcement of the agreement, and required regular reporting for a minimum of six months or until all detainees had access to vaccination.\n\nThe court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, and the case resolved without a trial or monetary damages. The settlement marked the end of the class-wide litigation concerning COVID-19 safety in ICE detention in South Florida during the pandemic."
