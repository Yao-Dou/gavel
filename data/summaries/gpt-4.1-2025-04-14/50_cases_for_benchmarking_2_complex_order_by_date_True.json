    "46290": "This case was filed on March 5, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas by the Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council, a recognized student organization at Texas A&M University. The Council, represented by private counsel from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), brought suit against the members of the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents, the Chancellor, and the President of Texas A&M University, all in their official capacities.\n\nThe dispute arose after the Texas A&M Board of Regents held a special meeting on February 28, 2025, and adopted a resolution prohibiting “drag show events” on university campuses, explicitly targeting Draggieland, an annual student-organized and student-funded drag performance that had been scheduled for March 27, 2025, at the Rudder Theatre. The Board’s resolution cited its opposition to “gender ideology” and referenced a federal executive order and state government directives. Following this resolution, university officials canceled Draggieland and notified the Council that the event could not proceed on campus. The Queer Empowerment Council had already reserved the venue, sold tickets, and invested resources in preparing for the performance, which had previously been held successfully on campus for several years.\n\nThe Council alleged that this ban constituted viewpoint and content discrimination in violation of the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause, as well as an impermissible prior restraint on protected expressive conduct. The Council also raised a claim under the Texas Open Meetings Act, asserting that the Board failed to provide adequate public notice for the meeting at which the drag show ban was adopted. The Council sought a temporary restraining order, a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent enforcement of the ban, a declaratory judgment affirming its rights, and an order voiding the Board’s actions at the February 28 meeting.\n\nThe case was assigned to Senior Judge Lee H. Rosenthal. After expedited briefing and a hearing on March 18, 2025, the court granted the Council’s motion for a preliminary injunction on March 24, 2025. Judge Rosenthal found that Draggieland constitutes protected speech and expressive conduct under the First Amendment, that the Rudder Theatre functions as a designated public forum, and that the Board’s resolution was a viewpoint-based restriction and an unconstitutional prior restraint. The court ordered the defendants not to enforce the drag show ban and required that Draggieland be permitted to proceed as scheduled on March 27, 2025. The court further held that the Council was not required to post a bond for the injunction.\n\nThe defendants filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on March 28, 2025, and moved to stay the injunction pending appeal. As of the latest docket entries, the case remains stayed pending appellate proceedings.\n\nNo trial has been held, and there are no settlements or monitors appointed in this action. The only reported opinion to date is the district court’s memorandum and opinion at 2025 WL [number not provided], granting the preliminary injunction. The factual basis for the case centers on Texas A&M’s abrupt cancellation of a student drag performance based on the administration’s disapproval of its perceived message, despite longstanding university policies supporting student expressive activities in campus venues.",
    "46324": "On March 31, 2025, a nonprofit financial intermediary for community development credit unions filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EPA Administrator and Acting Deputy Administrator in their official capacities, and Citibank, N.A. The nonprofit is represented by private counsel. The case arises from the administration of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), a nearly $27 billion program created by Congress through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 to support clean energy, energy efficiency, and pollution reduction through competitive grants.\n\nThe nonprofit received a $1.87 billion grant under the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) program, one of the three GGRF initiatives. Its grant agreement, memorialized on August 8, 2024, and modified December 19, 2024, authorized it to distribute funds to credit unions nationwide to finance clean energy projects, primarily in low- and moderate-income communities. Under the program structure, Citibank was appointed as a financial agent to hold and disburse grant funds at the nonprofit’s direction, subject to federal oversight.\n\nAfter the nonprofit began implementing its grant and selected 108 credit unions for subawards, the EPA Administrator announced in February 2025 a freeze and intended clawback of all GGRF funds, citing concerns about program integrity and alignment with agency priorities. Citibank, acting on discussions and directives from government officials, subsequently refused to release the grant funds. On March 11, 2025, EPA issued a notice purporting to terminate all GGRF grants, including the nonprofit’s, referencing regulatory authority but providing only general allegations of fraud, waste, abuse, and lack of oversight, without citing specific misconduct by the nonprofit or affording the nonprofit an opportunity to contest the termination.\n\nThe nonprofit brings statutory and constitutional claims against the EPA and its officials, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Inflation Reduction Act, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, the Anti-Deficiency Act, and EPA’s own regulations. It asserts that the EPA's freeze and termination exceeded statutory authority, failed to comply with required procedures, were arbitrary and capricious, and violated the separation of powers, the Spending Clause, the Appropriations Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The nonprofit also alleges that Citibank breached its contractual duties under the Account Control Agreement by refusing to honor lawful disbursement instructions, and asserts claims for conversion and replevin.\n\nThe nonprofit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders invalidating the EPA’s termination, requiring EPA and Citibank to restore and release the grant funds, and barring further interference with the nonprofit’s access to its funds except as permitted by law. It also requests court orders requiring Citibank to comply with its contractual obligations regarding disbursement.\n\nShortly after filing, the nonprofit moved for a preliminary injunction and, when funds appeared to be removed from its Citibank account, for an emergency temporary restraining order. The case was assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan and consolidated with related litigation (Case No. 25-cv-698) involving other GGRF grantees. As of April 16, 2025, the motion for preliminary injunction in this case was denied as moot in light of the preliminary injunction order in the lead consolidated case, with further proceedings to be governed under that lead case.\n\nNo trial has occurred, and no final decree or settlement has been entered as of the most recent docket entry. The factual basis of the case centers on the nonprofit’s reliance on its federal grant, the EPA’s subsequent suspension and attempted revocation of that grant, and the resulting inability of the nonprofit and its subrecipients to access congressionally appropriated clean energy funds.",
    "46391": "This case was filed on April 11, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by a group of international students and recent graduates, all in lawful F-1 visa status and residing or working in the district. The plaintiffs include current students and individuals employed under post-graduate Optional Practical Training (OPT). They are represented by private counsel from Van Der Hout LLP.\n\nThe defendants are the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Acting Field Office Director of ICE in San Francisco, and the President of the United States, all sued in their official capacities.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that, beginning in early April 2025, ICE abruptly and unlawfully terminated their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records, marking them as failing to maintain status due to criminal records checks or visa revocations. Plaintiffs assert that these terminations occurred without legal justification, proper notice, or opportunity to respond, and that none of them had committed any action or sustained any conviction that would render them ineligible for F-1 status or deportable. The complaint states that similar SEVIS terminations have affected hundreds of students nationwide, often accompanied by Department of State visa revocations.\n\nThe suit is brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–06, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02. Plaintiffs assert that the SEVIS terminations were (1) unauthorized by statute or regulation, (2) arbitrary and capricious, (3) issued without required procedures, and (4) in violation of their Fifth Amendment procedural due process rights. The statutory context cited includes 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(F)(i), 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.2(f), 214.1(d)-(g), and related regulations governing F-1 status. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order vacating the SEVIS terminations, restoring their status, and preventing enforcement actions such as arrest, detention, or deportation based on the challenged terminations.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Noël Wise, who granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 17, 2025, enjoining the government for 14 days from arresting, detaining, transferring, or otherwise imposing legal consequences on the plaintiffs related to the SEVIS terminations or potential visa revocations. The order also required confidentiality for plaintiffs' identities. The TRO was later extended for an additional 14 days after a hearing on April 25, 2025, before Judge Jeffrey S. White, to whom the case was reassigned and who presides over related cases involving similar SEVIS terminations.\n\nThe court found that the plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their APA and due process claims, as well as a likelihood of irreparable harm, including loss of educational and employment opportunities and risk of detention or deportation. The court noted that the government’s actions appeared inconsistent with applicable regulations, which only permit SEVIS termination in limited circumstances not present here.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, Judge White granted a preliminary injunction, continuing to prohibit the government from taking enforcement action against the plaintiffs based on the disputed SEVIS terminations or related visa revocations, pending further proceedings. The case is set for further case management and remains pending. No settlement, final decree, or trial has occurred, and there is no indication of a court-appointed monitor. The defendants have appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nThe factual basis of the case revolves around the government’s abrupt SEVIS terminations for international students and OPT participants based on alleged criminal records or visa revocations, despite the absence of disqualifying conduct or convictions, and the lack of required notice or process to the affected individuals. The court has consolidated related cases and required the government to explain its policies and procedures regarding SEVIS terminations.\n\n**Citations to reported opinions:**  \n- Temporary Restraining Order: See 2025 WL 1114694 (referenced in the order)\n- Similar factual findings and relief in related cases: 2025 WL 1118626\n\n**Judge:**  \nJudge Jeffrey S. White (currently presiding; Judge Noël Wise issued initial TRO)\n\n**Consolidated or Related Cases:**  \nRelated to Doe v. Trump et al., 25-cv-03140-JSW, and other cases involving similar SEVIS terminations\n\n**Remedy Sought:**  \nDeclaratory and injunctive relief, specifically restoration of SEVIS records and F-1 status, and prohibition of enforcement actions based on the challenged terminations\n\n**Current Status:**  \nPreliminary injunction in effect; case pending with further proceedings scheduled; defendants have appealed.",
    "46509": "This action was filed on April 29, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), its Board of Directors, and three individual board members (each acting in their official capacity), against the President of the United States, the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel, the White House Presidential Personnel Office and its Director, and the United States Office of Management and Budget and its Director. Plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from Saul Ewing LLP. The dispute did not involve a class action.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ suit arose after an April 28, 2025, email from the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel, purporting to terminate three CPB board members effective immediately on behalf of the President. The CPB is a nonprofit corporation established by Congress under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (47 U.S.C. § 396), with explicit statutory protections intended to insulate it from government interference, including provisions specifying that CPB is not a federal agency, its board members are not federal officers or employees, and that no government actor may exercise direction or control over it.\n\nPlaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the President lacked statutory or constitutional authority to remove CPB board members, and asserting violations of the Public Broadcasting Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and multiple constitutional provisions, including the Separation of Powers, Presentment, Appropriations, and Take Care Clauses. They requested a declaration that the purported terminations were void and an order prohibiting further interference with the CPB’s governance.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss. Plaintiffs promptly moved for a temporary restraining order, which was treated as a motion for a preliminary injunction. The court held hearings and received briefing through May 2025.\n\nIn a memorandum opinion and order dated June 8, 2025 (2025 WL [not provided]), Judge Moss denied the request for preliminary injunctive relief. The court found that the plaintiffs had not established a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm. The court concluded that, under District of Columbia nonprofit law—applicable to CPB unless inconsistent with the federal statute—the President, as the appointing authority, was permitted to remove board members unless the CPB’s bylaws or articles of incorporation provided otherwise. At the time of the removals, no such protective provisions existed, although the CPB subsequently amended its bylaws to require a two-thirds board vote for removal. The court further found that the statutory and bylaw framework allowed the CPB to protect its own independence and continue functioning, including through the use of a designated body if the board fell below a quorum.\n\nThe court did not resolve the ultimate legality of the removals or the plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory relief, leaving those questions for further proceedings. As of the latest docket entries, no trial had occurred, no final judgment had been issued, and no appeal had been filed. There were no consolidated or related cases formally joined, though the complaint referenced similar litigation involving the United States Institute of Peace. No settlement, monitor, or decree was reported.\n\nThe factual basis centered on the President’s attempt to remove CPB board members without statutory authority, the statutory structure of CPB as independent of executive control, and the potential harm to CPB’s operations and independence if such removals were effective. The case remained pending as of the most recent filings.",
    "46590": "This case was filed on April 7, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The parties are a group of coal miners, represented as a class, led by an individual miner who developed black lung disease, against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary in their official capacities. The miners are represented by private counsel, including attorneys from Mountain State Justice, Inc., Appalachian Mountain Advocates, and Petsonk PLLC.\n\nThe case arises from HHS’s decision, effectuated on April 1, 2025, to terminate most employees of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s (NIOSH) Respiratory Health Division in Morgantown, West Virginia. This division had operated the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) and the “Part 90” job transfer program, which provide federally mandated medical screening for coal miners and the right to transfer to low-dust jobs if early signs of black lung disease (coal workers’ pneumoconiosis) are detected. The plaintiffs alleged that this closure made it impossible for miners to access statutorily guaranteed health screenings and transfer rights, thereby exposing them to ongoing hazardous dust and risk of disease progression.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought their claims as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, on behalf of all coal miners nationwide eligible for Part 90 protections. They asserted causes of action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706), the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, and statutory provisions of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act and the Mine Safety and Health Act (notably 30 U.S.C. § 843). Specifically, they alleged that HHS’s actions unlawfully withheld and unreasonably delayed agency action, were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and deprived miners of due process. The relief sought included declaratory and injunctive relief to restore the affected programs, class certification, and attorneys’ fees.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Irene C. Berger. The plaintiffs promptly moved for a preliminary injunction to restore the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division and its programs. The Court held a hearing on May 7, 2025, receiving testimony from miners, epidemiologists, and program coordinators, who described the essential, specialized work performed by CWHSP and the harm caused by its shutdown. The evidence showed that, without NIOSH, miners could not obtain the Part 90 letter necessary to enforce their workplace rights and that no other agency could provide comparable services.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, Judge Berger granted the preliminary injunction, finding a strong likelihood that the plaintiffs would succeed on the merits of their APA and due process claims. The Court concluded that the closure of the CWHSP was a final agency action that violated statutory mandates and caused irreparable harm to miners by denying them life-saving health protections. The injunction ordered HHS to rescind the reductions in force, fully restore the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division and its programs, and ensure no gap in services mandated by Congress. HHS was directed to certify compliance within 20 days. The order set the security required for the injunction at zero, due to the public interest and the likelihood of plaintiffs’ success. As of the latest docket entries, the case remains ongoing, with discovery and other proceedings scheduled, and no final judgment, settlement, or appeals reported. No court-appointed monitor was designated, and there are no reported opinions aside from the preliminary injunction order (2025 WL citation not assigned in the record). The factual basis for the case centers on the health risks faced by coal miners, the statutory framework protecting them, and the immediate harm resulting from the federal program’s closure.",
    "46605": "This case was filed on May 17, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The action was brought by a Venezuelan national currently detained at a federal immigration facility in California, who also sought to represent a class of similarly situated noncitizens. The plaintiffs are individuals in federal immigration detention in the Central District of California, all subject or potentially subject to a March 2025 Presidential Proclamation—Proclamation No. 10903, entitled “Protecting the American People Against Invasion.” The defendants are federal government officials and agencies, including the President of the United States, the Attorney General, the Secretaries of Homeland Security, Defense, and State, and various immigration enforcement officials, all sued in their official capacities.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by private counsel. The case is not a class action in the traditional sense but was certified as a class for purposes of preliminary injunctive relief, specifically covering all noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California subject to the March 2025 Proclamation, with certain exclusions.\n\nThe primary cause of action is a petition for writ of habeas corpus, combined with requests for declaratory and injunctive relief. The core claims challenge the lawfulness of the Presidential Proclamation issued under the Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. §§ 21 et seq.), which authorizes the immediate removal of certain Venezuelan nationals alleged to be associated with the Tren de Aragua organization. Plaintiffs allege constitutional violations, including due process violations under the Fifth Amendment, and seek to prevent removal without adequate notice and an opportunity to challenge removal.\n\nUpon filing, the plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and class certification. On May 19, 2025, Judge John W. Holcomb granted, in part, both applications. The court certified a class for the limited purpose of adjudicating what notice is due before removal under the Proclamation and issued a TRO enjoining the government from removing or transferring the named plaintiff or any class member pursuant to the Proclamation, pending further order. The court also ordered briefing and set a hearing on whether to convert the TRO into a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn June 2, 2025, the court issued an amended order granting, in part, preliminary injunctive relief. The court found that, while it could not review the President’s factual determinations under the Alien Enemies Act, it could and did order that due process requires adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard before removal. The preliminary injunction barred the government from removing or transferring any class member under the Proclamation without further order, and required the posting of a nominal $1 bond. The order clarified that it did not prevent the government from releasing detainees or removing them under other lawful processes, such as removal orders issued under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\n\nOn June 20, 2025, the court denied the named plaintiff’s ex parte application for immediate habeas or mandamus relief seeking release after an immigration judge granted his asylum application. The court found that, because the government had appealed the asylum decision, the plaintiff’s detention pending resolution of that appeal was authorized by 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A), and thus habeas relief was not warranted at that time.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the court cited and followed recent higher court opinions addressing the same or similar executive actions under the Alien Enemies Act, including Supreme Court decisions clarifying the necessity of notice and due process before removal.\n\nThe case remains pending, with the government required to file periodic status reports regarding the status of the removal and asylum appeal. No final trial or judgment has occurred, and there is no reported opinion or appellate outcome yet for this specific case, though related litigation in other districts and at the Supreme Court has played a significant role in shaping the court’s rulings. There is no court-appointed monitor and no settlement has been reached. The court’s preliminary injunction remains in effect, preserving the status quo while the underlying legal questions about notice and process under the Proclamation are litigated.",
    "46635": "This case was filed on May 22, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by the Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office. The plaintiff is represented by private counsel from the Democracy Forward Foundation and Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP. The defendants are the person designated by the President as acting Librarian of Congress, an individual designated as acting Register of Copyrights, the Director and Deputy Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, the Executive Office of the President, and the President of the United States, all sued in their official capacities.\n\nThe dispute arose after President Trump, on May 8, 2025, removed the Librarian of Congress, and, two days later, purported to remove the Register of Copyrights and to replace both positions with presidential appointees—actions the plaintiff contends were unauthorized. The plaintiff argues that only the Librarian of Congress, not the President, possesses statutory authority to appoint (and therefore remove) the Register of Copyrights, under 17 U.S.C. § 701(a). The plaintiff further contends that the President lacks authority, under the Appointments Clause and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, to appoint an acting Librarian of Congress or to fill Copyright Office leadership positions, as the Library of Congress is not an executive agency.\n\nThe plaintiff brought claims for ultra vires action in violation of statutory and constitutional authority, and for violation of the Appointments Clause and the separation of powers, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent removal from office and to bar the defendants from interfering with her position. The remedies sought include preliminary and permanent injunctions restoring the plaintiff to her office, declarations on the limits of presidential appointment authority, and other appropriate relief.\n\nJudge Timothy J. Kelly presided over the proceedings. The plaintiff first sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and, after it was denied for lack of irreparable harm, moved for a preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction was also denied on July 30, 2025 (see 2025 WL 4218003), with the court ruling that the plaintiff had not demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm from her temporary removal, as required for such extraordinary relief in government personnel cases. The court found that any harm suffered could be remedied if she prevailed on the merits and noted that neither the existence of the Copyright Office nor her position was threatened in a way that could not be reversed.\n\nFollowing the denial of the preliminary injunction, the plaintiff appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 31, 2025. An emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal was filed and denied on August 20, 2025, for the same reasons as the prior rulings: the plaintiff failed to establish a risk of irreparable harm absent interim relief. As of the latest proceedings, briefing on cross-motions for summary judgment has been scheduled, and the case remains pending in district court while the appeal proceeds.\n\nThe factual basis for the case centers on the President’s removal of the Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights, the subsequent attempt to install presidential appointees into those roles without congressional or statutory authorization, and the resulting dispute over the separation of powers and statutory interpretation concerning the governance of the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office. No trial has occurred, and there are no reported settlements, decrees, or court-appointed monitors. The case has not been consolidated with any other cases.",
    "45143": "This case was filed on April 20, 2023, in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming by two parents, one of whom is also a public school teacher, against the Sweetwater County School District No. 1 Board of Trustees and four district officials, including the superintendent, assistant superintendent, director of student services, and a high school principal. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from Bailey Stock Harmon Cottam Lopez LLP and the Child & Parental Rights Campaign.\n\nThe plaintiffs are parents of a minor child, A.S., a student at Black Butte High School, as well as four other children in district schools. The mother, Ashley Willey, is also employed as a district teacher. The lawsuit is not a class action; it is brought by these individual plaintiffs.\n\nThe action arises from the school district’s implementation of a policy under which school staff, including the parent-teacher plaintiff, would use a student’s preferred name and pronouns at school if requested, even if this differed from the student’s legal name and sex, without informing the parents unless the student consented. The plaintiffs allege that, during the 2021-2022 school year, staff began treating their daughter as a boy at her request, using a male name and pronouns, while intentionally withholding this information from the plaintiffs, despite their daughter’s mental health history and ongoing treatment for trauma, ADHD, PTSD, and symptoms of gender dysphoria. The plaintiffs only discovered this practice by chance. The policy also required staff to use the student's legal name and pronouns when communicating with parents if the student did not want their parents informed, and threatened professional discipline for staff who did not comply.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert that this policy violates their fundamental parental rights to direct their children’s upbringing and mental health treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, their rights to free exercise of religion and free speech under the First Amendment, and state law requiring parental consent for mental health treatment. The mother further claims the policy forces her to violate her religious beliefs and compels her speech as a teacher. The main cause of action is brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as nominal and compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Scott W. Skavdahl. No related or consolidated cases are noted.\n\nKey filings include a motion for preliminary injunction by the plaintiffs and a motion to dismiss by the defendants. On June 30, 2023, Judge Skavdahl granted in part and denied in part the motion for preliminary injunction. The court enjoined the district from precluding employees from responding truthfully to a parent’s inquiry about a minor student’s requested name or pronoun, and from requiring employees to lie about such requests, except where there is a reasonable concern of physical abuse or harm. The motion was denied as to other aspects of the policy.\n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied as moot after plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 20, 2023. Defendants again moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On December 18, 2023, the court granted in part and denied in part this motion: the plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief under the first and second claims (parental rights and free exercise) were dismissed, but the plaintiffs were permitted to proceed on nominal and compensatory damages theories for those claims. The court also dismissed the free speech claim but allowed the mother’s claim for violation of her free exercise rights as a district employee to proceed.\n\nThe factual basis centers on the district’s policy to honor a student’s request to use alternate names and pronouns and to withhold this information from parents absent the student’s consent, even for students with known mental health challenges and ongoing treatment. The plaintiffs allege that this policy interfered with their ability to direct their child’s care, created psychological harm, and conflicted with their religious beliefs and rights as parents and as an employee.\n\nAs of the latest entries, the case proceeded through discovery and dispositive motions, and on April 28, 2025, the court granted summary judgment for the defendants on all remaining claims, dismissed the case, and entered final judgment. Plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal to the Tenth Circuit. No settlement, decree, or court-appointed monitor is noted in the record. The court did not retain jurisdiction to enforce any settlement, as none was reached. There is no record of a trial; the case was resolved on summary judgment. \n\nAll significant judicial decisions in the case are unreported orders, including the preliminary injunction order (6/30/23), order on motion to dismiss (12/18/23), and summary judgment order (4/28/25).",
    "PH-IL-0002": "This case was filed on May 10, 2016, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. The action was brought by a group of current and former residents of public housing developments managed by the Alexander County Housing Authority (“the housing authority”). The plaintiffs were primarily African-American residents and families living in the McBride and Elmwood housing developments in Cairo, Illinois, along with some residents of other developments. The suit was filed as a class action on behalf of all similarly situated residents, including subclasses for race discrimination, familial status discrimination, and breach of lease.\n\nThe plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from Hughes Socol Piers Resnick & Dym, Ltd., and attorneys from the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law. The defendants included the housing authority and several of its former executive directors.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the housing authority engaged in a longstanding pattern and practice of intentional racial segregation, discrimination based on familial status, and failure to maintain housing in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition. Specifically, the plaintiffs asserted that the housing authority segregated developments by race, maintained majority-African-American developments (McBride and Elmwood) in substandard and uninhabitable conditions, and excluded families with children from certain predominantly white or senior developments. The complaint described pervasive pest infestations, structural disrepair, and chronic safety concerns in McBride and Elmwood, in contrast to better-maintained, predominantly white or senior developments such as Connell Smith. It also alleged that the housing authority did not properly calculate or abate rent when required by federal law and lease terms.\n\nThe legal claims were brought under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3604), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d), the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and for breach of lease and related state law tort claims. The statutory and constitutional bases included the Fair Housing Act’s prohibitions against discrimination and segregation based on race and familial status, requirements to affirmatively further fair housing, and protections under Title VI and state civil rights law. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to end discriminatory practices and require remedial action, as well as monetary relief for damages, rent abatement, and attorneys’ fees.\n\nThe case was presided over by Chief Judge Michael J. Reagan, with Magistrate Judge Reona J. Daly handling pretrial matters. The case proceeded through several amended complaints and involved extensive discovery, class action allegations, and multiple settlement conferences. Two defendants (Joanne Pink and Thomas Upchurch) were dismissed early in the litigation.\n\nNo reported judicial opinions were issued. There were no consolidated or related cases noted. The parties did not proceed to trial. After protracted pretrial activity, the parties reached a settlement in mid-2017. On July 27, 2017, the principal parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice, with each party bearing its own costs and attorneys’ fees. This dismissal was approved by the court on September 12, 2017. The claims of a few plaintiffs who did not participate in the settlement or failed to prosecute their claims were dismissed for want of prosecution.\n\nNo court-enforced settlement terms or consent decrees were entered; the substance of any private settlement is not detailed in the record.

    "16518": "On April 14, 2022, the United States Department of Justice (“the United States”) filed a lawsuit against the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (“the Department”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, seeking to address unconstitutional conditions at the Broad River Road Complex (BRRC), the state's long-term facility for youth committed to the juvenile justice system. The United States was represented by the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, while the Department was represented by private counsel.\n\nThe case arose from a multi-year federal investigation, initiated in 2017 under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (34 U.S.C. § 12601), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The investigation found reasonable cause to believe that the Department engaged in a pattern or practice of conduct at BRRC that violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Specifically, the government documented that the Department failed to keep children reasonably safe from youth-on-youth violence and excessive force by staff, used prolonged isolation for punitive purposes, and inadequately supervised and investigated incidents of harm.\n\nThe factual foundation included high rates of assaults and injuries among youth, frequent and prolonged use of isolation—even for minor misbehavior—dangerous and disproportionate use of force by staff (including physical abuse and restraint), and systemic failures in staff training, supervision, staffing levels, physical security measures, and incident investigations. Youth in isolation were often denied meaningful education and programming, sometimes leading to self-harm and deteriorating mental health. Investigations into abuse were often delayed, incomplete, or hampered by insufficient video coverage and documentation.\n\nThe United States sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 34 U.S.C. § 12601, requesting an order to prohibit the Department from continuing these practices and to require lawful conditions of confinement.\n\nShortly after the complaint was filed, the parties entered into a comprehensive, court-enforceable settlement agreement dated April 13, 2022, resolving all claims without further litigation. The agreement was jointly submitted to the court along with a motion for conditional dismissal, and Judge Mary Geiger Lewis granted the motion on April 20, 2022, dismissing the case without prejudice and retaining jurisdiction for enforcement.\n\nKey terms of the settlement require the Department to: conduct a staffing study and adjust staffing patterns; enhance physical security and video surveillance; provide structured rehabilitative programming; establish and implement a positive behavior management system; sharply limit the use of force and isolation to situations involving serious and immediate danger; ensure prompt medical evaluation after uses of force; revise and enforce investigation policies for all incidents involving harm or improper isolation; ensure vulnerable youth are appropriately housed and not isolated for protective custody or suicide watch; and maintain robust quality assurance and data review systems. The agreement also mandates regular staff training and creates a monitoring structure, including the appointment of a subject matter expert to provide technical assistance, assess compliance, and issue public reports every six months.\n\nThe settlement is to remain in effect for up to five years, with earlier termination possible if the Department demonstrates one year of substantial compliance with all material terms. The court retains jurisdiction to enforce the agreement, and the United States may reinstate the case if the Department materially breaches any provision. The agreement is binding on all successors and staff at the Department of Juvenile Justice.\n\nThis case reflects a federal intervention to remedy systemic constitutional violations affecting the safety and wellbeing of youth in state juvenile custody, resulting in detailed, court-enforceable reforms and ongoing federal oversight.",
    "46815": "This case arises from the prosecution of an individual, a longtime Maryland resident originally from El Salvador, who is charged in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The indictment was filed on May 21, 2025. The accused is charged with one count of conspiracy to unlawfully transport undocumented individuals for financial gain and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented individuals for financial gain, both in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A) and (B). The charges stem from a November 30, 2022 incident, in which the accused was stopped by the Tennessee Highway Patrol while driving a vehicle allegedly containing multiple undocumented individuals.\n\nThe prosecution is brought by the United States Attorney’s Office, represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys and Department of Homeland Security personnel. The accused is represented by private counsel and federal public defenders. The case is not a class action; it involves an individual defendant.\n\nThe legal foundation for the charges is statutory: 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a). The government sought pretrial detention under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., arguing that the case involved a minor victim, a serious risk of flight, and a risk of obstruction of justice.\n\nAfter the accused was returned to the United States from El Salvador following court orders in related civil litigation (see Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 2025 WL 1024654, and subsequent Supreme Court proceedings), he was arrested on June 6, 2025, in Nashville. An initial appearance was held the same day, and the accused was appointed counsel.\n\nJudge Barbara D. Holmes presided over the detention proceedings. The government filed a motion for pretrial detention, which was subject to extensive briefing and evidentiary hearings. The government contended that the charged offenses involved a minor victim, based in part on allegations that a minor was present during the November 2022 transport and on witness statements about the accused’s transportation of minors as part of a broader smuggling operation. The defense challenged the reliability and sufficiency of this evidence, arguing that it was based on hearsay and uncorroborated claims from cooperating witnesses with incentives to cooperate.\n\nOn June 22, 2025, Judge Holmes denied the government’s motion for pretrial detention, finding that the government failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the statutory bases for a detention hearing were met. Specifically, she concluded that the evidence was insufficiently reliable to prove the presence of a minor victim, that there was not a serious risk of flight in light of an active ICE detainer, and that there was no serious risk of obstruction or witness intimidation. Judge Holmes further found that, even if a detention hearing were warranted, there were release conditions available to reasonably assure both the safety of the community and the accused’s appearance. She ordered a hearing to set conditions of release.\n\nThe government appealed the release order to District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr., filing a Motion for Revocation of Release Order. After additional briefing and a further evidentiary hearing on July 16, 2025, Judge Crenshaw issued a memorandum opinion on July 23, 2025, denying the government’s motion and affirming the release order. Judge Crenshaw adopted a broader interpretation of the statutory phrase “involves a minor victim” but nonetheless found that the government failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that no release conditions could mitigate risk to the community or risk of nonappearance. He noted the accused’s lack of criminal history, strong family and community ties in Maryland, and lack of evidence of violence or obstruction. Judge Crenshaw remanded the case to the magistrate judge for entry of a release order with conditions.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the accused has been represented by federal public defenders and private counsel. The government has been represented by the United States Attorney’s Office. The accused remains subject to an ICE detainer, and proceedings in the criminal case have been coordinated with related civil litigation concerning the accused’s removal and return to the United States.\n\nNo trial has occurred as of August 2025. The case is set for jury trial beginning January 27, 2026. There have been no reported opinions beyond the district court’s memorandum opinions (see 2025 WL 1024654 and others as cited in the record); there is no class action or consent decree, and no settlement or court-appointed monitor is involved.\n\nThe factual basis for the prosecution centers on the November 2022 traffic stop, witness testimony concerning the accused’s alleged involvement in a broader human smuggling conspiracy, and documentary evidence from law enforcement. The core dispute in the pretrial proceedings has concerned the sufficiency and reliability of the government’s evidence regarding the presence of minor victims and the accused’s risk profile under the Bail Reform Act. The accused has remained in custody pending the outcome of pretrial detention proceedings but is scheduled for release under conditions set by the court.",
    "46755": "This case was filed on July 1, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland by a coalition consisting of three city governments (the City of Columbus, Ohio; the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland; and the City of Chicago, Illinois), a national association of small businesses (Main Street Alliance), and a national coalition of physicians (Doctors for America). The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from the Democracy Forward Foundation. They sued the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Secretary of HHS (Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the CMS Administrator (Mehmet Oz) in their official capacities.\n\nThe case arises from a final federal rule, the \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Marketplace Integrity and Affordability\" (the 2025 Rule), published at 90 Fed. Reg. 27,074, and set to take effect on August 25, 2025. The plaintiffs allege that the rule undermines the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by imposing new eligibility restrictions, increasing consumer costs, and reducing access to subsidized health insurance on the ACA Exchanges. They argue that the rule will cause at least 1.8 million Americans to lose coverage in 2026, increase premiums, and impose higher uncompensated care costs on cities and providers.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenge several provisions of the rule, including: (1) a new $5 monthly surcharge for automatic re-enrollees in zero-premium plans until they confirm eligibility; (2) changes allowing insurers to deny new coverage to individuals with past-due premiums, which the plaintiffs argue violates the ACA’s guaranteed-issue requirements; (3) reinstatement of a \"failure to reconcile\" policy that cuts off advance premium tax credits (APTCs) for enrollees who have not resolved tax filing discrepancies; (4) increased documentation and verification requirements for special enrollment periods and income eligibility; (5) expansion of the range of permissible actuarial value variation for Exchange plans, reducing the generosity of coverage; and (6) elimination of the policy allowing self-attestation of income when IRS data is unavailable. The plaintiffs assert these provisions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and also conflict with provisions of the ACA.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Brendan Abell Hurson. The plaintiffs sought a stay of the rule’s effective date or a preliminary injunction under 5 U.S.C. § 705, arguing that immediate implementation would cause irreparable harm to cities’ budgets, small business owners, and health care providers by increasing the uninsured population and uncompensated care.\n\nAfter extensive briefing and a hearing, Judge Hurson issued a memorandum opinion and order on August 22 and August 25, 2025, granting the motion in part and denying it in part. The court found that the plaintiffs had standing and demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits for seven specific challenged provisions. The court stayed the effective dates of these provisions nationwide, pending a final ruling on the merits:\n\n- The $5 surcharge for automatic re-enrollees (45 C.F.R. § 155.335(a)(3), (n); § 155.330(j))\n- The revocation of guaranteed-issue for individuals with past-due premiums (45 C.F.R. § 147.104(i))\n- The “failure to reconcile” policy for APTC eligibility (45 C.F.R. § 155.305(f)(4), (iii))\n- Mandatory eligibility verification for special enrollment periods (45 C.F.R. § 155.420(g))\n- Income verification when an applicant’s attested income differs from trusted data sources (45 C.F.R. § 155.320(c)(3)(iii), § 155.320(c)(3)(vi)(C)(2))\n- Revisions to actuarial value calculations (45 C.F.R. §§ 156.140(c), 156.200(b)(3), 156.400)\n- Elimination of self-attestation of income when IRS data is unavailable (45 C.F.R. § 155.320(c)(5))\n\nThe court declined to stay provisions relating to changes in the premium adjustment percentage methodology and the elimination of the 60-day extension for resolving income inconsistencies.\n\nThe case remains pending, and the stayed provisions will not take effect until a final decision is issued on the merits. No trial has occurred, and there are no reported appeals as of the latest docket entries. The court’s order is enforceable nationwide as a stay under the APA, not as a preliminary injunction, and no injunction bond was required. The factual basis for the case centers on the anticipated reduction in health insurance coverage and increased uncompensated care resulting from the challenged rule’s implementation.",
    "46576": "On April 10, 2025, sixteen states, the District of Columbia, and the Governor of Pennsylvania filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the U.S. Department of Education and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. The states, represented by their respective Attorneys General and using public-sector counsel, challenged the Department of Education’s abrupt March 28, 2025, decision to rescind previously granted extensions for the liquidation of unspent federal COVID-19 education relief funds. These funds, appropriated under statutes such as the American Rescue Plan Act and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, were intended to support K-12 schools in addressing the long-term academic and operational effects of the pandemic.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that, despite prior approval of their requests to extend the period for using these funds (extensions that would have allowed spending through March 2026), the Department suddenly and without warning revoked all such extensions, declaring the liquidation window closed as of March 28, 2025. Plaintiffs argued that this reversal was arbitrary and capricious, violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and was contrary to law because it disregarded reliance interests, provided inadequate explanation for the change, and exceeded the Department’s statutory authority. The suit sought declaratory and injunctive relief to vacate the rescission letter, reinstate the extensions, and prevent further modifications without adequate notice.\n\nJudge Edgardo Ramos presided over the case. On May 6 and June 3, 2025, the district court issued preliminary injunctions prohibiting the Department from enforcing the rescission or terminating the extensions without sufficient notice and ordering the Department to process payment requests under the previous (extended) schedules. The orders required the Department to notify staff of the injunctions and to report on the status of payment requests.\n\nThe Department of Education appealed and sought an emergency stay of the injunctions, arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act (which vests contract claims against the federal government in the Court of Federal Claims), and that the Department’s actions were within its regulatory discretion. The Second Circuit, in a June 20, 2025 order, denied the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal. The court held that the district court likely had jurisdiction under the APA because the case pertained to the agency’s exercise of regulatory authority over liquidation deadlines, not to enforcement of a contract obligation. The appellate panel found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in showing the Department’s reversal was arbitrary and capricious under the APA, since the agency failed to provide a reasoned explanation or adequately address the states’ reliance interests. The court also found the Department had not demonstrated irreparable harm that would justify a stay, as improperly disbursed funds could be recovered if necessary, while the states faced immediate disruption to educational programs.\n\nNo trial has been held, and the case remains pending in the district court following the appellate denial of a stay. There are no reported opinions with Westlaw or other legal citations as of the current record. No settlement or consent decree has been entered, and there is no court-appointed monitor. The litigation centers on the ongoing availability and use of federal pandemic-related education funds and the administrative procedures governing their disbursement.\n\nThe factual basis for the case is the states’ reliance on federal approval to extend the use of COVID-19 relief funds for ongoing educational programs and projects, and the immediate harm caused when the Department of Education, citing the formal end of the pandemic, rescinded those approvals without individualized assessment or adequate notice. The case is proceeding as a coordinated action on behalf of state governments and education systems.",
    "46637": "On May 27, 2025, several nonprofit public radio organizations—including a national public radio network and three local Colorado-based member stations—filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the legality of Executive Order 14290, issued by the President on May 1, 2025. The case is before Judge Randolph D. Moss. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that Executive Order 14290 unlawfully directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and federal agencies to terminate all direct and indirect federal funding to National Public Radio (NPR), the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and affiliated local stations. The Executive Order was issued after public statements from the President and his administration criticizing NPR and PBS for purportedly “biased” content and expressing a desire to defund them. The order instructs the CPB to withhold grants from NPR and PBS, prohibits local stations from using federal funds to acquire their programming, and directs other agencies—including the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Department of the Treasury—to identify and stop any direct or indirect funding to those entities.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert that these actions violate multiple statutes, including the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. That Act establishes CPB as a private nonprofit entity, expressly insulating it and its grantees from federal direction, supervision, or control, and sets forth specific criteria for federal funding to public broadcasters. The plaintiffs allege that the Executive Order contravenes Congress’s statutory design by imposing viewpoint-based funding restrictions and interfering with independent editorial and associational decisions of public broadcasters. They also assert that the order violates the Spending Clause and separation of powers by overriding Congress’s explicit appropriations and statutory mandates.\n\nConstitutionally, the plaintiffs allege that the Executive Order violates the First Amendment by imposing viewpoint discrimination, retaliating against protected speech and journalistic activity, and infringing on freedom of expressive association among NPR and its member stations. They further allege a violation of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, contending that the order deprives them of statutory entitlements to funding without requisite notice or process and is impermissibly vague in its standards for what constitutes “biased” coverage.\n\nThe factual basis for the case centers on the President’s explicit statements and accompanying official documents that the Executive Order was motivated by disagreement with the editorial content and viewpoints expressed by NPR and PBS. The administration also attempted to remove CPB board members and asserted authority to control CPB, prompting related litigation over board appointments.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek a declaration that the Executive Order and any agency actions implementing it are unlawful and unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunction preventing enforcement. The CPB, named as a defendant solely for purposes of complete relief, has not opposed the plaintiffs’ motion. No trial has taken place, and the case is proceeding on cross-motions for summary judgment. There are no reported opinions or decrees as of the latest docket entries, and no settlement or court-appointed monitor is in place.\n\nThis case is related to other litigation involving the attempted removal of CPB board members, but it is not consolidated with those cases. The outcome will determine whether the Executive Branch may direct the funding decisions of the CPB and public broadcasters in a manner inconsistent with congressional statutes and constitutional protections for free speech and association.",
    "46340": "The case was filed on April 3, 2025, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by several major federal employee unions—including the American Federation of Government Employees, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United, the Service Employees International Union, the National Association of Government Employees, and the National Federation of Federal Employees. These unions, represented by private counsel, brought suit on behalf of their organizations and their members, who are federal civil servants across a range of agencies and departments.\n\nThe defendants are the President of the United States (Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity), the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and its Acting Director, and numerous federal departments and agencies, along with the heads of those entities in their official capacities.\n\nThe unions challenged a March 27, 2025, executive order issued by President Trump, entitled “Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs.” This order, invoking 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), excluded over forty federal agencies and subdivisions—including entire Cabinet-level departments such as State, Defense, Treasury, Veterans Affairs, and Justice—from statutory collective bargaining rights provided under Chapter 71 of Title 5. The order’s stated basis was national security, but the complaint alleged the exclusions were unprecedented in scope, exceeded the President’s statutory authority, and were issued in retaliation for protected union activity, including opposition to administration policies and litigation challenging executive actions.\n\nThe unions asserted multiple causes of action: (1) retaliation and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment, (2) ultra vires action exceeding authority under the CSRA, (3) procedural due process violations under the Fifth Amendment, (4) abrogation of contractual property rights in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and (5) equal protection violations under the Fifth Amendment. The specific constitutional and statutory bases cited included the First and Fifth Amendments and 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1). The remedy sought was declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the executive order and associated agency actions, along with attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nAfter filing, the unions moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The case was assigned to Judge James Donato. On June 24, 2025, Judge Donato granted a preliminary injunction (2025 WL 1755442), enjoining enforcement of the exclusion order against the plaintiff unions and their members pending further litigation. The court found that the unions raised serious questions on the merits of their First Amendment retaliation claim, and demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm to union operations and members’ collective bargaining rights. The injunction required the unions to post a collective $60,000 bond and preserved the status quo until trial.\n\nThe government promptly appealed and sought a stay of the preliminary injunction. After the district court denied a stay, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Judges Owens, Bade, and Bress) granted the government’s emergency motion for a stay pending appeal on August 1, 2025. The Ninth Circuit held that the government was likely to succeed on the merits, finding that the President would have issued the executive order even absent the unions’ protected activities, based on national security justifications articulated in the order and accompanying materials. The appellate court also determined that the government would suffer irreparable harm from being enjoined from implementing the order, and that any harm to the unions could be mitigated and, if necessary, remedied after litigation.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, no monitor was appointed, and there were no reported settlements or consent decrees. The case remains active, with further proceedings stayed pending resolution of the appeal.\n\nThe underlying factual context is that, for decades, federal employees in most agencies have had statutory rights to unionize and bargain collectively. The challenged executive order, for the first time, broadly excluded entire agencies and departments from these rights, which the unions allege was motivated both by hostility to their opposition to administration policies and as retaliation for their litigation and advocacy efforts. The administration, in defense, relied on national security as the statutory justification for the exclusions.",
    "46805": "This case was filed on July 21, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The plaintiffs are a coalition of nonprofit domestic violence, sexual assault, and homelessness service organizations from across the United States. These organizations and their members provide direct services and support to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, as well as to individuals and families experiencing homelessness. They receive federal grant funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including through programs administered by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF).\n\nThe defendants are federal officials and agencies, including the Secretary of HHS, the Secretary of HUD, the Acting Assistant Secretary of ACF, and other relevant federal officials, all sued in their official capacities. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel, with support from cooperating attorneys affiliated with the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island, the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, Democracy Forward Foundation, and the National Women’s Law Center.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenge a series of new conditions imposed by HUD and HHS on federal grant recipients, implemented in response to executive orders issued by the Trump Administration in early 2025. These conditions include prohibitions on using grant funds to promote “gender ideology” as defined in a specific executive order, requirements to certify compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws as material for False Claims Act enforcement, prohibitions on using grant funds to promote or fund elective abortions, and requirements to refrain from operating any programs that advance or promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA), or “discriminatory equity ideology.” Plaintiffs allege these conditions are vague, lack statutory basis, conflict with existing law and regulations, and force them to choose between violating their statutory obligations or forfeiting essential federal funding for life-saving services.\n\nThe legal action is grounded in multiple causes of action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), including claims that the agencies exceeded their statutory authority, acted contrary to law and the Constitution (citing the First and Fifth Amendments, the Spending Clause, and the separation of powers), failed to follow required procedures, and imposed conditions that are unconstitutionally vague. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including vacatur of the challenged conditions and prevention of their enforcement.\n\nThe case is being heard by Judge Melissa R. DuBose. No consolidated or related cases are identified in the present record. On July 21, 2025, plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and expedited relief. After a hearing on July 24, 2025, the court granted the TRO on July 28, 2025, enjoining HUD and HHS (through ACF) from enforcing the challenged new conditions on specific grants to the plaintiffs and their members, finding plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm. The TRO was subsequently amended and expanded on August 7 and August 20, 2025, to clarify its application to additional plaintiffs and grant programs. The TROs ordered the agencies to treat any actions taken to impose the challenged conditions as null and void for the duration of the order and required prompt implementation and reporting by the agencies. The TRO remains in effect pending a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, scheduled for September 4, 2025.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the court has deferred ruling on challenges to HHS’s Grants Policy Statement pending further record development. No trial or appeals have occurred to date. There are no monitors or settlement agreements in place, and no reported opinions have been issued as of this filing.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on the plaintiffs’ reliance on federal funding for critical services to vulnerable populations. The new federal conditions, if enforced, would either require the organizations to alter their programs in ways that they allege violate statutory and regulatory obligations—including non-discrimination requirements—or to forgo funding, leading to immediate harm to the populations they serve. Plaintiffs allege the challenged conditions are unlawfully imposed, conflict with statutory mandates to serve underserved and minority populations, and infringe on their constitutional rights. The court’s orders thus far have temporarily preserved the status quo, allowing the plaintiffs continued access to federal funding free of the disputed new conditions while the case proceeds.",
    "46375": "On April 9, 2025, the Southern Education Foundation, Inc. (SEF), a nonprofit organization with a historic mission of advancing equitable education in the southern United States, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case was brought against the United States Department of Education, the Secretary of Education Linda McMahon (in her official capacity), and the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump (in his official capacity). SEF was represented by private counsel.\n\nSEF had operated the Equity Assistance Center for the southern region (EAC-South) under a federal grant authorized by Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000c-2). This program provided technical assistance to public school districts, especially those under federal desegregation orders, to help eliminate the vestiges of segregation. In 2022, following a competitive process, SEF was awarded a five-year, $8.6 million grant to operate EAC-South, covering 12 southern states and the District of Columbia—a region with the vast majority of the nation's remaining open federal school desegregation cases. The EAC-South grant was SEF’s sole funding source for this work.\n\nOn January 20–21, 2025, immediately after President Trump’s inauguration, two executive orders (EO 14151 and EO 14173) were issued directing federal agencies to terminate “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) programs, grants, and related activities. On February 13, 2025, the Department of Education abruptly terminated SEF’s EAC-South grant via a letter and public statements, alleging the grant was inconsistent with new Department priorities and possibly supported DEI initiatives now deemed unlawful. The Department did not provide any specific findings of unlawful discrimination by SEF, nor did it explain how the EAC-South grant violated any law or regulation. SEF was not given prior notice, a factual or legal basis for the termination, or an opportunity for a hearing as required by the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA).\n\nThe loss of the grant forced SEF to immediately cease EAC-South operations, halt services to school districts—including those under active federal desegregation orders—and lay off dedicated staff. SEF alleged this caused immediate and irreparable harm to the organization, the affected school districts, and the students served.\n\nSEF sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to set aside the grant termination, reinstate funding, and enjoin the Department from further unlawful termination actions. The case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman. SEF’s main legal claims included violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, the Appropriations Clause and Impoundment Control Act, and the First Amendment.\n\nSEF moved for a preliminary injunction. After briefing and oral argument, the court found that SEF was likely to succeed on the merits of its APA claims, particularly that the Department’s termination of the grant was arbitrary and capricious. The court held that the Department failed to provide a reasoned explanation or individualized assessment for the termination, instead issuing a boilerplate letter that did not meet statutory requirements. The court also found that SEF faced irreparable harm, as the grant was the sole funding source for EAC-South, and its loss threatened the existence of the program and SEF’s reputation.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, Judge Friedman issued an order granting SEF’s motion for a preliminary injunction. The court ordered the Department of Education and the Secretary of Education to reinstate the EAC-South grant award within five business days, restore funding on the terms in place prior to the termination, and reimburse SEF for allowable expenses incurred since the termination. The order also enjoined the Department from again terminating the grant in the same unlawful manner. The Department of Education and other defendants have since appealed the ruling to the D.C. Circuit.\n\nTo date, there has been no trial or final merits decision, and no settlement or court-appointed monitor. The preliminary injunction remains in effect as the litigation and appeal proceed. The case highlights the intersection of federal education policy, administrative law, and civil rights enforcement in the context of shifting executive branch priorities.",
    "46284": "On March 24, 2025, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by a lawful permanent resident and Columbia University student, challenging federal government efforts to detain and deport her. The plaintiff, a 21-year-old who has lived in the U.S. since childhood, participated in campus protests relating to Israel’s military actions in Gaza and university disciplinary responses to those protests. Following her arrest at a March 5, 2025 campus demonstration—where she was issued a desk appearance ticket for obstruction of governmental administration—federal authorities initiated actions to detain and remove her from the country.\n\nThe government’s actions included an administrative arrest warrant for the plaintiff, an attempted visit to her parents’ home by Department of Homeland Security agents, and search warrants executed at Columbia residences, including her dormitory. These steps occurred within days of her arrest at the protest. The plaintiff asserted that these enforcement efforts were undertaken in retaliation for her protected speech and association, as part of a broader federal policy targeting noncitizen students perceived as supporting Palestinian rights or critical of U.S. and Israeli policies.\n\nThe case names the President, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Acting Field Office Director of the New York ICE Office, all in their official capacities, as defendants. The plaintiff is represented by private counsel and multiple legal advocacy organizations, including Main Street Legal Services (CLEAR Project), Human Rights First, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, and others.\n\nThe complaint alleges violations of the First Amendment (retaliation, viewpoint discrimination, prior restraint), the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause (substantive and procedural), the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the non-delegation doctrine. Statutory claims are based on the government’s invocation of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(4)(C) and 1182(a)(3)(C), which permit removal of noncitizens whose presence or activities are determined by the Secretary of State to have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences, with exceptions for protected speech unless a “compelling foreign policy interest” is personally determined and reported to Congress. The plaintiff contends that the government did not comply with these statutory safeguards and that any such determination in her case was based solely on her lawful, protected expressive activity.\n\nThe relief sought included a declaratory judgment, injunctions prohibiting arrest, detention, transfer, or removal based on the alleged retaliatory policy, and vacatur of the government’s determination as applied to the plaintiff.\n\nJudge Naomi Reice Buchwald presided over the case. On March 25, 2025, the court granted a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) prohibiting the government from detaining or transferring the plaintiff pending further proceedings, and required advance notice if any new basis for detention was asserted. On June 5, 2025, following briefing and oral argument, Judge Buchwald granted a preliminary injunction continuing to enjoin the government from arresting, detaining, or transferring the plaintiff pending further order. The court also required 72 hours’ advance notice to the court and counsel if the government sought to detain her for any reason other than her removal under the cited statutory provisions, to ensure the plaintiff could contest any potential pretext for First Amendment retaliation. The government’s motion to dismiss was denied in significant part. No trial has occurred to date. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal of the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but did not seek to expedite the appeal or stay the injunction.\n\nThe factual basis for the case rests on the federal government’s announced and publicized policy, following executive orders and high-level statements, to prioritize immigration enforcement—including deportation—against noncitizen students and faculty involved in protests or advocacy relating to Palestinian rights. The plaintiff contends that these enforcement efforts, as applied to her and similarly situated individuals, are motivated by viewpoint discrimination and retaliation for protected speech, in violation of constitutional and statutory protections. The case references several other noncitizen students at Columbia and elsewhere who faced similar enforcement actions under the same government policy, as well as related legal challenges brought by those individuals. No consent decree, settlement, or court-appointed monitor is referenced in the documents. The preliminary injunction remains in effect pending further proceedings and appeal.",
    "46735": "On June 20, 2025, the Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools, a New Mexico public school district, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico against the U.S. Secretary of Education (Linda McMahon, in her official capacity), the U.S. Department of Education, and the President of the United States (Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity). The School District was represented by private counsel.\n\nThis case arose after the School District, which had been awarded a $6 million federal grant for school-based mental health services under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (Pub. L. 117–159, 2022), received notice from the Department of Education on April 29, 2025, that its grant would not be continued beyond the current budget period. The grant program had been established in response to the Uvalde school shooting and was designed to expand access to mental health supports in schools nationwide.\n\nThe Department’s notice of non-continuation was issued following a series of executive orders from President Trump and agency directives aimed at eliminating funding for programs perceived as promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”). The Department issued a “Dear Colleague Letter” (DCL) and launched an “End DEI” complaint portal, stating that schools continuing certain equity-related programs risked loss of federal funds. The Department cited concerns that such programs violated federal civil rights laws or conflicted with the Department’s new policy priorities.\n\nThe School District alleged that the Department’s actions were taken without statutory authority, were arbitrary and capricious, and unlawfully terminated congressionally mandated grants. The School District asserted multiple causes of action: (1) that the termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), (2) infringed the School District's and employees' rights under the First and Fifth Amendments, (3) violated the Spending Clause of Article I of the Constitution, and (4) constituted ultra vires conduct exceeding the Department’s statutory authority. The School District sought declaratory and injunctive relief to set aside the DCL and portal, reinstate the grant funding, prohibit further terminations, and prevent enforcement of the new federal directives. No monetary damages were sought.\n\nJudge William P. Johnson presided over the case. The School District filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, arguing that the grant’s loss would cause irreparable harm to its students and staff by eliminating mental health services, wellness rooms, and crisis supports, and by reversing behavioral improvements attributed to the program’s funding.\n\nThe Court held a hearing on July 16, 2025. On July 18, 2025, Judge Johnson denied the School District’s motion and dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. The Court found that, although the School District framed its claims as constitutional and APA violations, the essence of the dispute was contractual: it sought to compel the United States to pay out grant funds under an existing award. Based on recent Supreme Court and appellate precedent, the Court concluded that such claims for enforcement of federal grant agreements fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, not the federal district courts. The Court further found that the School District had not established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm justifying preliminary injunctive relief.\n\nNo trial or reported opinions on the merits were issued. The case was not consolidated with others but referenced related litigation and Supreme Court stays in similar grant termination disputes. The School District did not request reconsideration under the Department’s administrative procedures before filing suit. No settlement, decree, or court-appointed monitor was involved.\n\nThe underlying factual basis established that termination of the grant would result in the loss of mental health providers, closure of wellness rooms, and discontinuation of support services for students and staff, with documented reductions in bullying, behavioral incidents, and suspensions during the grant period. The Court recognized the importance of these services but held that legal remedies must be sought in the Court of Federal Claims.\n\n**Key Information:**\n- **Filing Date:** June 20, 2025\n- **Parties:** The local public school district (Board of Education for the Silver Consolidated Schools) sued the U.S. Department of Education, the Secretary of Education, and the President, each in their official capacity.\n- **Type of Counsel:** Private counsel\n- **Cause of Action:** Declaratory and injunctive relief under the APA, Constitution (First and Fifth Amendments, Spending Clause), and federal statutes governing grants\n- **Remedy Sought:** Declaratory judgment, injunctive relief reinstating/disbursing grant funding, and prohibiting enforcement of new federal policies\n- **Judge:** William P. Johnson\n- **Related Cases:** Not consolidated, but referenced related district and appellate cases and recent Supreme Court opinions\n- **Important Filings:** Motion for TRO/preliminary injunction (denied); motion to dismiss (granted sua sponte for lack of jurisdiction)\n- **Court Rulings:** Preliminary injunction denied; case dismissed without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction (see 25-cv-586-WJ-GBW, Doc. 27)\n- **Appeals:** None indicated as of the last filing\n- **Factual Basis:** Termination of a multi-year federal grant for school-based mental health services, with evidence of significant impact on student well-being and school climate\n\nNo decree, settlement, or monitoring was ordered. The Court’s dismissal directs that any contract-based claim for continuation or payment under the grant must be filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.",
    "46342": "This case was filed on April 4, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by two nonprofit organizations: the Association for Education Finance and Policy, Inc. (AEFP), an association of scholars and practitioners in education policy and finance, and the Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP), a nonprofit research and advocacy organization focused on postsecondary education. Both organizations rely on data and research produced by federal education research programs to inform their work. The defendant parties are the U.S. Department of Education and its Secretary, sued in her official capacity.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by private counsel from the Public Citizen Litigation Group. The claims are brought individually on behalf of the organizations, not as a class action.\n\nThe case arises from a series of actions taken by the Department of Education beginning in February 2025, which terminated or suspended numerous research, data collection, and dissemination activities of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) and its subcomponents. IES had been created by the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (ESRA) to serve as the Department’s primary research and statistics arm, carrying out congressionally mandated studies and providing public access to education data.\n\nThe challenged actions included the termination of contracts needed to conduct major longitudinal studies—such as the 2020/25 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:20/25), the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 2022 (HS&B:22), and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten:2024 (ECLS-K:2024)—as well as the elimination of IES’s peer review program for new grant funding and the halting of the processing of applications for access to restricted-use data. The plaintiffs allege that these studies and programs are essential for producing and disseminating national education statistics and research, and that the Department’s actions made it impossible for IES to fulfill its statutory functions.\n\nThe statutory and legal foundations for the plaintiffs’ claims are the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706, and various provisions of ESRA and other federal statutes requiring the Department to carry out specific research and data dissemination activities. The plaintiffs allege that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious and, in some cases, contrary to law, as they failed to consider relevant statutory mandates, stakeholder reliance, and the consequences of halting ongoing projects. The Second Amended Complaint also includes a claim by IHEP for unreasonable delay under the APA, based on the Department's failure to process IHEP’s requests for disclosure risk review necessary to publish research using restricted-use data.\n\nThe remedies sought include declaratory and injunctive relief to set aside the terminations, require resumption of the affected studies and programs, order the resumption of processing of restricted-use data applications, and compel timely processing of IHEP’s disclosure risk review submissions. No monetary damages are sought.\n\nJudge Trevor N. McFadden presides over the case. Early in the litigation, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to halt the Department’s actions and restore IES’s programs. On June 3, 2025, the court denied the preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs’ initial broad, programmatic challenge sought relief beyond what the APA allows, as it attempted to address the wholesale “dismantling” of IES rather than challenge discrete, final agency actions. The court emphasized that the APA does not provide for judicial management of agency-wide statutory compliance.\n\nSince then, the plaintiffs have twice amended their complaint to focus their claims on specific, final agency terminations of particular studies and programs and to clarify their organizational interests. As of the latest amendment (July 16, 2025), the case challenges six discrete terminations as arbitrary and capricious or contrary to law, and alleges an unreasonable delay in processing disclosure risk reviews. The case has not proceeded to trial or resulted in any reported opinions beyond the preliminary injunction decision (see 2025 WL [not provided]; Memorandum Opinion, June 3, 2025), and no settlements or decrees have been entered. There is one related case, National Academy of Education v. Department of Education, No. 25-cv-1266, which was referenced in the court’s opinion but was not consolidated.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on the Department’s mass termination of contracts and staff associated with IES research programs, which plaintiffs allege has prevented the completion and dissemination of congressionally mandated education research, to the detriment of organizations and researchers who depend on these resources for their work. No court-appointed monitor or special master has been involved, and there are no reported compliance or enforcement disputes over settlement terms, as no settlement has been reached. Appeals have not been noted in the record as of July 2025.",
    "46322": "This case arises from a challenge to Executive Order 14,248, issued by President Donald J. Trump on March 25, 2025, entitled “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections.” The lawsuit was filed on March 31, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The main plaintiffs are national nonprofit organizations with civic engagement missions, including the League of United Latin American Citizens, Secure Families Initiative, Arizona Students’ Association, League of Women Voters entities, the Hispanic Federation, NAACP, OCA Asian Pacific American Advocates, and Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote, as well as national Democratic Party organizations and congressional leaders. The defendants include the Executive Office of the President, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and its Commissioners, the Department of Justice and Attorney General, the Department of Defense and Secretary of Defense, the Federal Voting Assistance Program, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of the Interior, the Small Business Administration, and other federal officials, all sued in their official capacities.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by private counsel, including the Campaign Legal Center, State Democracy Defenders Fund, and other legal organizations. The case is not a class action but involves several organizations asserting both organizational and associational standing on behalf of their members and constituents.\n\nThe suit challenges key provisions of Executive Order 14,248, alleging that it unlawfully directs changes to federal election administration outside the President’s constitutional or statutory authority. The main provisions at issue are: (1) Section 2(a), which directs the EAC to amend the federal mail voter registration form (“Federal Form”) to require documentary proof of citizenship; (2) Section 2(d), which directs federal voter registration agencies to “assess” citizenship before providing voter registration forms to recipients of public assistance; (3) Section 2(b), which directs agencies to share federal immigration and citizenship databases with states to identify “unqualified” voters; and (4) Sections 7(a) and 7(b), which direct the Attorney General to enforce federal “Election Day” statutes against states that count mail-in ballots received after Election Day and direct the EAC to condition federal election funding on state compliance with a uniform ballot receipt deadline.\n\nPlaintiffs assert causes of action under the separation of powers doctrine, the Elections Clause and other constitutional provisions, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Privacy Act. They allege that neither the Constitution nor any statute grants the President the power to dictate the content of the Federal Form or to impose new eligibility or procedural requirements on voter registration agencies, and that Congress has expressly assigned these responsibilities to independent, bipartisan entities. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent implementation of the Executive Order’s contested provisions, arguing that the order would unlawfully restrict access to voter registration, particularly for populations who lack ready access to documentary proof of citizenship, and would harm their organizational missions and members’ voting rights.\n\nChief Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly presides over the case. The matter was consolidated with related cases brought by other organizations and the Democratic Party. States have also filed related actions in other districts.\n\nOn April 24, 2025, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunction. The court held that plaintiffs were substantially likely to prevail on the merits of their challenges to Sections 2(a) and 2(d) of the Executive Order. The court found that the President lacks constitutional or statutory authority to direct the EAC to require documentary proof of citizenship on the Federal Form, as the Constitution vests such regulatory power in the States and Congress, and Congress has delegated authority over the Federal Form only to the EAC through a bipartisan, consultative process. The court also held that Section 2(d), directing federal agencies to “assess citizenship” before providing voter registration forms to public assistance recipients, conflicted with the National Voter Registration Act’s requirements.\n\nThe court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the EAC, its Commissioners, and Executive Director from taking any action to implement Section 2(a), including any modification of the Federal Form to require documentary proof of citizenship. The court also enjoined the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of the Interior, the Small Business Administration, and their agency heads from implementing Section 2(d), including any action to deny the Federal Form based on a citizenship assessment. No injunction bond was required.\n\nThe court denied preliminary injunctive relief against Sections 2(b), 7(a), and 7(b), finding those challenges premature, unripe, or appropriately brought by states rather than the organizational plaintiffs. The court’s order is preliminary and does not reach the ultimate merits of these claims.\n\nNo trial has taken place, and no final judgment or reported opinion beyond the preliminary injunction has been issued. The case remains pending, with answers filed and further proceedings scheduled. There are no monitors or consent decrees, and no settlement or settlement enforcement issues have arisen to date.\n\nThe factual basis underlying the case is the issuance of Executive Order 14,248, which plaintiffs allege would unilaterally alter long-standing procedures for federal voter registration, restrict access to the ballot, and bypass the statutory framework established by Congress for election administration, particularly in ways that would burden voters without ready access to documentary proof of citizenship and the organizations that assist them. The court’s preliminary ruling preserves the status quo pending further litigation.",
    "46510": "On April 28, 2025, several statewide non-profit organizations representing Head Start agencies in Washington, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, as well as parent-led organizations from Oregon and Oakland, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington challenging recent federal actions affecting the Head Start program. The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Washington and cooperating private counsel. The case is before Judge Ricardo S. Martinez.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including its Secretary and officials in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and the Office of Head Start (OHS), have unlawfully sought to dismantle the Head Start program in violation of statutory mandates and constitutional principles. The Head Start program, established by Congress in 1965, provides early childhood education, health, nutrition, and family services to low-income children and is structured to serve the diverse needs of local communities, including children of color, children with disabilities, dual language learners, and children experiencing homelessness or in foster care.\n\nAccording to the complaint, since January 2025, the federal government has taken a series of steps to reduce or eliminate Head Start, in line with a policy agenda identified in \"Project 2025.\" These actions included: issuing executive orders banning diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) initiatives in federally funded programs; freezing federal funds to Head Start grantees; and implementing new grant conditions prohibiting any activities that \"advance or promote\" DEIA or related concepts. The federal government also abruptly closed half of the regional OHS offices and laid off 60% of OHS staff, leaving 23 states without dedicated regional support. The plaintiffs allege that these actions have led to confusion, delays in funding, loss of technical assistance, and at least one program suspension, resulting in layoffs and the loss of services to hundreds of children.\n\nThe case is brought under multiple legal theories. The plaintiffs assert that the government’s actions violate the separation of powers and the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution by disregarding congressional appropriations and mandates requiring the continued operation of Head Start at existing capacity. They allege that the DEIA ban and related grant conditions are unconstitutionally vague under the Fifth Amendment and suppress protected speech in violation of the First Amendment, as they force agencies to abandon or censor core aspects of their programs without clear guidance. Plaintiffs also claim violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing that the actions are arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and imposed without lawful procedure. Additionally, the plaintiffs raise claims under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, contending that the ban on \"inclusion\" and \"accessibility\" initiatives discriminates against children with disabilities.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders vacating the DEIA ban and related grant conditions, reinstating OHS regional staffing, preventing further funding freezes or program closures, and requiring the government to maintain the Head Start program at congressionally mandated levels. They also request that the court enjoin enforcement of the challenged executive orders and grant conditions, and retain jurisdiction to monitor compliance.\n\nOn May 16, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the DEIA ban, prevent further staffing and office reductions, and require continued funding and support for Head Start agencies. The government has opposed the motion. As of August 2025, the court has held oral argument on the preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order motions, taken the matter under advisement, and scheduled further proceedings, with the requested relief remaining pending. No trial has occurred, and there is no indication of any settlement or court-appointed monitor as of the latest filings. No appeals have been taken.\n\nThe underlying factual basis of the case is that Head Start agencies and the families they serve are experiencing significant and ongoing harm, including the loss of early childhood education and related services, as a result of the federal government’s actions. Plaintiffs allege that the abrupt changes to funding, staffing, and program requirements threaten the continued operation of Head Start nationwide and undermine the program’s ability to serve its mandated populations.",
    "46734": "On May 29, 2025, Roman Catholic bishops and priests from the Archdiocese of Seattle, the Diocese of Yakima, and the Diocese of Spokane filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington challenging a new Washington state law, Senate Bill 5375. The plaintiffs are the leading Roman Catholic bishops in Washington and several priests who regularly hear confessions and are responsible for overseeing the administration of the sacrament of confession in their respective dioceses. The defendants are the Governor and Attorney General of Washington, as well as the elected prosecuting attorneys for all counties in the state, all named in their official capacities.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by private counsel, including attorneys from WilmerHale, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, and First Liberty Institute.\n\nSenate Bill 5375, signed into law on May 2, 2025, and set to take effect July 27, 2025, amends Washington’s child abuse reporting statute. It requires all “members of the clergy,” including Catholic priests, to report suspected child abuse or neglect to law enforcement or state authorities, even if the information is obtained solely through a privileged communication, such as confession. The law specifically removes clergy from the protection of the state’s privilege for confidential religious communications, which previously exempted information learned during confession from mandatory reporting. At the same time, the legislature amended the law to provide certain secular professionals, such as attorneys employed by colleges and universities, an exemption from mandatory reporting where their information is obtained in the course of legal representation, except in cases of imminent harm.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that, under Catholic doctrine, the “seal of confession” is inviolable: priests are absolutely forbidden from disclosing anything heard in confession, under penalty of automatic excommunication. Plaintiffs assert that SB 5375 puts them in an impossible position—forced to choose between violating their religious obligations (and incurring excommunication) and violating state law (and risking criminal prosecution and civil liability). Plaintiffs also allege that the law targets clergy for disfavored treatment, since other categories of mandatory reporters retain statutory privileges or are not subject to mandatory reporting in similar circumstances.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Their legal claims are based on the Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the church autonomy doctrine, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as Article I, Section 11 of the Washington Constitution. They seek a declaration that Senate Bill 5375 is unconstitutional as applied to the sacrament of confession, and a permanent injunction against enforcement of the law in this context.\n\nOn June 5, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of SB 5375 as applied to information learned during Catholic confession. The United States, represented by the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, intervened as of right, asserting that SB 5375 violates the Equal Protection Clause by infringing on the fundamental right to free exercise of religion and by discriminating based on religion, particularly in light of the simultaneous exemption for attorneys in higher education.\n\nJudge David G. Estudillo presided over the case. On July 18, 2025, the Court issued an order granting plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. The Court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits of their Free Exercise claim, holding that SB 5375 was not neutral or generally applicable because it singled out clergy for less favorable treatment compared to similarly situated secular professionals. The Court concluded that the law was not narrowly tailored, especially since contemporaneous legislative action had broadened privileges for attorneys. The preliminary injunction bars enforcement of SB 5375 as to the sacrament of confession against the named plaintiffs and all Catholic priests in Washington under their administration, pending final resolution of the case. The Court did not reach the plaintiffs’ church autonomy or Establishment Clause claims at this stage.\n\nNo trial has yet occurred, and the case remains pending. The Court’s order is a reported opinion. (See 07/18/2025 Order on Motion for Preliminary Injunction.) Appeals and long-term remedies remain to be determined. The United States’ intervention and motion for its own preliminary injunction were mooted by the Court’s grant of the plaintiffs’ requested relief. No settlement or monitor has been appointed. The factual basis for the case centers on the conflict between the state’s expanded mandatory reporting obligations and the Catholic doctrine of absolute confidentiality in confession.",
    "46678": "On June 9, 2025, the Governor of California and the State of California, represented by the California Attorney General’s Office, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and the U.S. Department of Defense. The dispute arose after federal immigration enforcement actions by ICE in Los Angeles on June 6, 2025, led to significant public protests. While some individuals engaged in violence or property damage, most protest activity was peaceful. Local and state law enforcement—including the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, and California Highway Patrol—responded to incidents and made hundreds of arrests. ICE continued its enforcement operations throughout this period, and federal law enforcement (including U.S. Marshals and other agents) provided additional support.\n\nOn June 7, 2025, President Trump issued a memorandum invoking 10 U.S.C. § 12406, ordering at least 2,000 members of the California National Guard into federal service for 60 days to protect federal personnel and property. The President directed the Secretary of Defense to coordinate with governors and the National Guard Bureau in identifying and ordering the Guard into federal service. Secretary of Defense Hegseth subsequently issued memoranda on June 7 and June 9 federalizing a total of 4,000 California National Guard members, with command transferred from the Governor to U.S. Northern Command. At no point did the federal government seek or obtain Governor Newsom’s consent, nor did it directly notify or coordinate with him prior to issuing the orders. Instead, the orders were transmitted to the California Adjutant General and then forwarded to the Governor. The President and federal officials also deployed approximately 700 Marines to Los Angeles.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that the President’s orders exceeded his statutory authority because none of the predicates for federalization under § 12406 existed: there was no invasion, rebellion, or inability to execute federal law with regular forces. Plaintiffs also contended the orders were not lawfully issued “through the governor” as required by the statute, did not allow for the Governor’s input or consultation, and that the deployment of federalized forces for domestic law enforcement violated the Posse Comitatus Act and the Tenth Amendment. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent further federalization and to return control of the California National Guard to the Governor.\n\nJudge Charles R. Breyer presided over the case. Plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) shortly after filing the complaint. After adversarial briefing and a hearing, the district court granted the TRO on June 12, 2025, finding that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their ultra vires and Tenth Amendment claims. The court concluded that the statutory conditions for federalization were unmet and that the procedural requirement that orders be issued “through the governor” was not satisfied. The TRO enjoined Defendants from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles and directed the return of control to the Governor. The court found that continued federal deployment risked escalating tensions and deprived the state of critical resources for emergency response.\n\nDefendants immediately appealed and sought a stay in the Ninth Circuit. On June 19, 2025, a panel of the Ninth Circuit (Judges Bennett, Miller, and Sung) granted the stay pending appeal. The appellate court held that, while the President’s invocation of § 12406 is subject to judicial review, such review is highly deferential under longstanding precedent. Affording that deference, the court found it likely that the President acted within his statutory authority under § 12406(3) (inability of regular forces to execute the laws), and that transmitting the orders through the Adjutant General satisfied the procedural requirement. The Ninth Circuit also determined that, even if there were a procedural error, it would not justify the full scope of injunctive relief ordered by the district court. The court further concluded that the balance of harms and the public interest weighed in favor of the federal government, given the federal interest in protecting its personnel and property.\n\nAs of the most recent filings, no trial has occurred and no final judgment has been entered. The case remains active, with further proceedings, including a preliminary injunction hearing, ongoing in the district court. No external monitor or special master has been appointed, and there is no court-enforced settlement. The litigation focuses on statutory and constitutional constraints on federal authority to deploy state National Guard units without state consent, and the permissible role of military forces in domestic law enforcement.",
    "46287": "On March 25, 2025, two labor organizations representing higher education faculty—the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT)—filed suit in the Southern District of New York against several federal agencies and officials, including the U.S. Departments of Justice, Education, Health and Human Services, and related agency heads. The suit arose after the federal government, under the Trump administration, terminated approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts previously awarded to Columbia University. The government cited a new executive priority to combat antisemitism in higher education as the basis for reviewing and withdrawing federal funding from Columbia, alleging Columbia had failed to sufficiently address antisemitism and harassment of Jewish students on its campus.\n\nThe government’s actions included the summary termination of major research and training grants—primarily from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Education—and threatened to withhold additional federal funds, valued at over $5 billion, unless Columbia implemented a series of reforms. These demanded reforms ranged from changes to disciplinary procedures and admissions, to the restructuring of specific academic departments, and were set out as “preconditions” for continued negotiations regarding federal funding.\n\nAAUP and AFT, represented by private and public-interest counsel, including the Protect Democracy Project and Altshuler Berzon LLP, brought an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Their claims alleged violations of the First Amendment (freedom of speech and academic freedom), the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Spending Clause and Tenth Amendment, the principle of separation of powers, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs contended the government’s actions were unlawful both substantively and procedurally—arguing especially that the funding terminations were in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and that the government failed to follow the statutory and regulatory process required for terminating federal funding on allegations of civil rights violations.\n\nPlaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction requiring the immediate restoration of the terminated grants and prohibiting further terminations or conditions on federal funds absent full compliance with Title VI procedures. They claimed the government’s conduct caused irreparable harm to their members’ research, academic freedom, speech, employment, and professional relationships, and led to self-censorship and disruption in ongoing academic projects.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil. After extensive briefing—including numerous declarations from affected faculty, amicus curiae briefs, and government opposition—the court denied the preliminary injunction and dismissed the case for lack of standing. In her June 16, 2025 opinion and order, Judge Vyskocil found that neither the AAUP nor the AFT, nor their individual members, had standing to seek restoration of grants or contracts that were not awarded to them, but to non-party Columbia University. The court held that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any cognizable injury-in-fact traceable to the government’s actions, as the funding decisions and institutional reforms were either not directly targeted at the plaintiffs or were within Columbia’s discretion to address. The court also noted that plaintiffs’ claims, at their core, sought to enforce or restore contractual obligations between the federal government and Columbia, and thus would properly belong in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, not in district court under the APA.\n\nThe court further emphasized that, according to the record, Columbia University itself had not joined the lawsuit and was actively negotiating with the government regarding the restoration of funds, and that Columbia’s own internal actions were not shown to be directly caused by the defendants. The court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to direct the Executive Branch to reinstate funding to a non-party, and that the plaintiffs’ alleged harms, including chilling effects on speech, were too speculative or insufficiently traceable to government action. The case was dismissed without prejudice, and the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction was denied.\n\n**Judge:** Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil\n\n**Filing Date:** March 25, 2025\n\n**Parties:** The plaintiffs were labor unions representing faculty and staff; the defendants were multiple federal agencies and officials in their official capacities. The affected university, Columbia University, was not a party.\n\n**Type of Counsel:** Private and public-interest counsel (Protect Democracy Project, Altshuler Berzon LLP)\n\n**Cause of Action:** First Amendment (freedom of speech, academic freedom), Fifth Amendment (due process), separation of powers, Spending Clause/Tenth Amendment, Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n**Statutory/Constitutional Basis:** First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Tenth Amendment, Spending Clause, Title VI, and APA.\n\n**Remedy Sought:** Declaratory and injunctive relief (restoration of funding, prohibition of further termination or imposition of conditions on funding), as well as nominal and compensatory damages.\n\n**Important Filings:** Motion for preliminary injunction; opposition and supporting declarations; amicus briefs.\n\n**Court Rulings:** Preliminary injunction denied; case dismissed for lack of standing.\n\n**Factual Basis of Case:** Federal agencies terminated and threatened to withhold federal research and programmatic funding to Columbia University over alleged failure to address antisemitism, with conditions set for restoring funding. Plaintiffs alleged this caused harm to faculty and academic freedom, but the court found no direct legal injury to the plaintiffs or their members.\n\n**Trial/Appeals:** No trial occurred.

    "46580": "This case was filed on May 7, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington by a coalition of sixteen states—Washington, Colorado, California, Arizona, Delaware, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin—and the District of Columbia. These states, represented by their respective state attorneys general and legal staff, are suing the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), the Secretary of Transportation in his official capacity, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and the Acting Administrator of the FHWA in her official capacity. The plaintiff states are represented by public attorneys (state attorneys general and their staff). This is not a class action; the states are suing in their own right to protect sovereign and proprietary interests.\n\nThe case arises from the defendants’ actions in February 2025, following a January 2025 executive order by President Trump titled \"Unleashing American Energy.\" The executive order directed federal agencies to pause disbursement of funds appropriated by Congress in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. The IIJA, enacted in 2021, established the NEVI program to provide $5 billion in formula funds to states from 2022 through 2026 to strategically deploy EV charging infrastructure across the nation. The statute required the Secretary of Transportation to distribute these funds to states strictly according to a formula and to make them available upon each state’s submission and approval of an annual deployment plan.\n\nAfter the change in administration in January 2025, DOT and FHWA, following the presidential directive, rescinded the existing NEVI program guidance and retroactively revoked all prior approvals of state NEVI deployment plans. They notified states on February 6, 2025, that no new obligations of NEVI funds would be permitted until new guidance was issued and new state plans were submitted and approved. As a result, states lost access to approximately $2.74 billion in already-apportioned NEVI funds for fiscal years 2022–2025, with about $1 billion in immediate impact to the plaintiff states. This action halted or delayed numerous state EV infrastructure projects, disrupted contracts, and caused states to divert resources, delay construction, and, in many instances, lose project partners or incur added costs.\n\nThe plaintiff states filed suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Their claims are primarily based on the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging that the agency actions exceeded statutory authority, were arbitrary and capricious, and were not in accordance with law or required procedure. They also allege violations of the constitutional separation of powers and the Take Care Clause, arguing that the executive branch usurped congressional spending authority by refusing to distribute funds as mandated by statute. The complaint seeks to restore the prior approvals of state NEVI plans, to enjoin DOT and FHWA from withholding NEVI funds except according to the procedures and grounds set out in the IIJA, and to prevent further implementation of the executive order that directed the funding freeze.\n\nThe case is assigned to Judge Tana Lin. On May 7, 2025, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. Several public interest organizations—including Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, and others—moved to intervene as party plaintiffs, citing interests aligned with promoting EV adoption and clean transportation; their motion was later granted.\n\nOn June 24, 2025, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. The court found that DOT and FHWA’s actions—rescinding NEVI guidance and revoking all prior state EV infrastructure plans, thereby freezing congressionally appropriated funds—exceeded their statutory authority, failed to follow required procedures, and were arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The court also found a likely violation of the constitutional separation of powers, holding that the executive branch improperly withheld funds in defiance of clear congressional direction. The court enjoined DOT and FHWA from suspending or revoking the previously approved NEVI deployment plans of the plaintiff states (except for the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont, which did not provide evidence of irreparable harm), and from withholding or withdrawing NEVI funds for reasons not set forth in the IIJA or without following statutory procedures. The injunction was stayed for seven days to permit defendants to seek appellate review, but as of July 2, 2025, no such appeal was filed and the injunction went into effect.\n\nNo reported opinions or appeals are indicated as of the most recent docket entries. No settlement or consent decree has been entered, and no court-appointed monitor has been assigned. The case is ongoing, with the parties proceeding to dispositive motions and further litigation on the merits. The factual basis of the case centers on the executive branch’s refusal to distribute congressionally mandated formula funds for EV infrastructure, resulting in halted or delayed projects and significant disruption to state environmental, public health, and transportation initiatives.",
    "46259": "This case, filed on March 13, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, was brought by a group of students at Columbia University and Barnard College, all proceeding under pseudonyms, against Columbia University, its trustees, certain university officials, and various federal government officials, including the Chair of the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce and several executive branch officials.\n\nThe central dispute arose after a series of congressional investigations and federal agency actions directed at Columbia University in response to campus protests and allegations of antisemitism. On February 13, 2025, the House Committee sent a letter to Columbia University demanding the production of all student disciplinary records related to eleven specified protest incidents. The Committee indicated that Columbia’s failure to comply could jeopardize billions of dollars in federal funding. In parallel, federal agencies including the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and General Services Administration announced reviews and threatened to withhold or actually suspended federal contracts and grants to Columbia, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, pending changes to the university’s disciplinary and academic policies.\n\nThe student plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and associated legal defense funds, allege that these government actions—particularly the pressure to disclose student records and to institute punitive disciplinary measures—constitute unlawful government coercion intended to chill protected speech and association critical of Israel and supportive of Palestinian rights. They assert that such “jawboning” by Congress and the Executive Branch, and Columbia’s compliance with these demands, violate their rights under the First Amendment, both directly and by turning the university into a state actor. Plaintiffs also allege breach of contract by Columbia, arguing the university failed to uphold its commitments to free expression and student privacy. The suit further alleges violations of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and, as to the government agencies, violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and Title VI procedural requirements related to federal funding decisions.\n\nThe students seek declaratory and injunctive relief to bar Columbia from disclosing further student records to Congress or federal agencies, to prohibit Congress and federal agencies from compelling such disclosures or conditioning funding on viewpoint-based suppression, and to enjoin Columbia from instituting punitive disciplinary or academic changes under government pressure. They also seek damages for any records already disclosed and for the harm suffered through doxxing, harassment, and reputational injury following prior record disclosures. No trial has taken place, and there have been no reported opinions or substantive rulings on the merits.\n\nEarly in the case, Judge Arun Subramanian denied the plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order, finding that plaintiffs had not demonstrated standing or irreparable harm for certain claims and that the Speech or Debate Clause of the U.S. Constitution barred injunctive relief against Congressional defendants. The court also ordered Columbia to provide advance notice before any further disclosure of student records to Congress. Subsequent disputes arose regarding what disclosures triggered this notice requirement, but the court maintained its prior order.\n\nThe case has generated substantial motion practice, including several motions to dismiss by the Congressional defendants, Columbia University, and federal agencies, each raising jurisdictional defenses (including Speech or Debate Clause immunity and sovereign immunity), as well as arguments on the merits regarding state action and the plausibility of plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs have amended their complaint to address evolving facts, including additional federal agency actions and policy changes at Columbia, such as the centralization of disciplinary authority, enhanced policing, mask bans at protests, and the adoption of a broader definition of antisemitism.\n\nJudge Subramanian has granted protective orders preserving the anonymity of the plaintiffs and restricting disclosure of personally identifying information. As of the most recent filings, the case remains in the motion-to-dismiss stage, with briefing ongoing and no final adjudication or settlement reported. There have been no trials, decrees, or court-enforced settlements to date. There are no consolidated or directly related cases identified in the record. The plaintiffs’ claims rest primarily on the First Amendment (including associational and free speech rights), procedural due process, the enforcement of student-university contracts, FERPA, and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on the federal government’s and Congress’s efforts to investigate and respond to alleged antisemitism at Columbia University, including high-profile congressional hearings, threatened and actual funding cuts, public demands for student records, and subsequent university disciplinary actions that plaintiffs allege were prompted by government coercion and aimed at suppressing protected campus activism regarding Palestine and Israel. Plaintiffs allege concrete harms from doxxing, threats, reputational injury, and the chilling of speech, and seek comprehensive relief to prevent further such harms.",
    "46557": "On May 5, 2025, nineteen states and the District of Columbia filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its senior officials, including Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. The states, represented by their attorneys general and legal staff, sought to halt sweeping reductions in force and organizational changes at HHS announced on March 27, 2025. This case is not a class action.\n\nAccording to the complaint and supporting declarations, HHS, following directives from Secretary Kennedy and pursuant to Executive Order 14210, issued termination notices to 10,000 employees and restructured multiple sub-agencies, consolidating 28 divisions into 15 and closing half of its regional offices. The changes were implemented rapidly, with many employees placed on administrative leave effective April 1, 2025, and formal terminations to follow in June and July 2025. The plaintiffs alleged these actions were carried out without adequate consideration of statutory mandates, severely disrupting federally funded public health, safety, and social services relied upon by the states.\n\nThe states, represented by public sector and state attorneys, asserted causes of action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Appropriations Clause, and the constitutional separation of powers. They argued that HHS’s actions were arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and exceeded statutory and constitutional authority. The statutory basis for many claims included the APA (5 U.S.C. §§ 706, 705), as well as statutes governing specific HHS programs such as the Public Health Service Act, Occupational Safety and Health Act, and others. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief to enjoin the terminations and restructuring, and to prevent further implementation of the March 27 directive as it affected key HHS sub-agencies and programs.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Melissa R. DuBose. On July 1, 2025, after expedited briefing and a hearing, Judge DuBose granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that the states had standing, that the challenged HHS actions constituted final agency action subject to APA review, and that the plaintiffs established a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims that the mass terminations and restructuring were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The court further found irreparable harm to the states due to the loss of critical federal services, data, and technical assistance.\n\nThe preliminary injunction enjoined HHS from implementing the March 27, 2025 directive with respect to the following: (1) the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Tobacco Products (CTP); (2) the Office of Head Start and its regional office staff; (3) several Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) components, including the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention (NCHHSTP), the Division of Reproductive Health (DRH), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Office on Smoking and Health (OSH), the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), and the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD); and (4) the Division of Data and Technical Analysis within the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), which is responsible for updating the federal poverty guidelines. The injunction prohibits further execution or issuance of RIF notices, or placement of additional employees on administrative leave in these units, and applies to the fullest extent authorized by law.\n\nThe court required the states to post a nominal bond of $100. Subsequent orders denied HHS’s motions to vacate or stay the preliminary injunction, clarifying that the injunction was limited to the specified sub-agencies and programs.\n\nThe factual basis for the case included evidence that the mass terminations and reorganizations disrupted or halted critical state and local services dependent on HHS, including laboratory testing for infectious diseases, maternal and child health surveillance, occupational safety research, tobacco control enforcement, Head Start program support, and the calculation of federal poverty guidelines. The court found that these disruptions were already causing and would continue to cause irreparable harm to the plaintiff states and their residents.\n\nThe case remains pending, with the federal government having appealed the preliminary injunction to the First Circuit. No final judgment or permanent relief has yet been entered. The court has not yet ruled on the merits beyond the preliminary injunction stage, and no trial has been held. There is no court-appointed monitor or special master. The court’s jurisdiction to enforce the preliminary injunction remains in effect.",
    "46511": "This case was filed on April 29, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland by twenty-four states, the District of Columbia, and two state governors in their official capacities. The states, acting through their attorneys general or authorized officials, challenged actions taken by the Corporation for National and Community Service (operating as AmeriCorps) and its interim agency head, Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi. The plaintiffs are all state governments or chief executives; this is not a class action. The states were represented by their respective attorneys general and public sector counsel.\n\nThe plaintiffs sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the United States Constitution. Their causes of action included claims that the defendants acted contrary to law, failed to observe required procedures, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, violated the separation of powers, and exceeded their statutory authority. The statutory and constitutional bases for the suit included requirements in the APA, various federal appropriations acts, and the Constitution’s separation of powers and Take Care Clause.\n\nThe factual basis of the case concerns actions by AmeriCorps in spring 2025, following directives from the Trump Administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and related executive orders. Beginning in April 2025, AmeriCorps placed the vast majority of its staff (approximately 85%) on administrative leave and initiated large-scale reductions in force. On April 15, 2025, AmeriCorps ordered all members of its National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC)—a full-time, residential volunteer program—to leave their assignments and prepared to terminate their service. On April 25, 2025, AmeriCorps terminated more than 1,000 grants funding state and local service programs nationwide, ordered an immediate halt to all program activities, and directed the exit of roughly 30,000 AmeriCorps and VISTA volunteers. These actions abruptly ended funding and support for a wide range of public service initiatives in areas such as disaster relief, education, public health, and veterans’ services, impacting every plaintiff state.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged these actions violated statutory requirements by failing to engage in public notice-and-comment rulemaking before making “significant changes to program requirements, service delivery or policy,” as mandated by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 and the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2025. Plaintiffs also claimed that the terminations were arbitrary, lacked required notice and hearing, and usurped Congress’s power of the purse in violation of the Constitution. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including reversal of the program closures and restoration of affected grants and service members.\n\nJudge Deborah L. Boardman presided over the case. On June 5, 2025, after briefing and a hearing, Judge Boardman issued a memorandum opinion and order granting in part the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that AmeriCorps’s mass termination of grants and volunteer service, and the removal of NCCC members, constituted “significant changes to service delivery” that, by statute, required advance notice-and-comment rulemaking, which had not occurred. The court held these actions likely violated the APA and caused irreparable harm to the plaintiff states and their residents by disrupting critical public service programs and depriving communities of vital services and support.\n\nThe order enjoined AmeriCorps and its leadership from enforcing the April 25, 2025 terminations and the April 15, 2025 removal of NCCC members in the plaintiff states. It required AmeriCorps to restore affected grants, reinstate AmeriCorps and VISTA members (if willing and able), and comply with notice-and-comment requirements before making future significant changes in service delivery that would harm the plaintiff states. The injunction did not bar AmeriCorps from terminating individual grants or members for cause or for violations of grant terms. The court denied relief regarding the reduction in force and administrative leave decisions affecting AmeriCorps staff, finding plaintiffs lacked standing on that issue. The court required plaintiffs to post a nominal bond and denied defendants’ request for a stay.\n\nOn July 10, 2025, following an intervening Supreme Court decision clarifying the limits of universal injunctions, the court modified the scope of the preliminary injunction to make clear it applied only to agency actions harming the plaintiff states, not to non-parties. The preliminary injunction remains in effect unless modified by further court order.\n\nNo trial has been held, and no reported appellate opinions have yet been issued in this case. No class certification, settlement, or court-appointed monitor is involved. The factual context centers on the abrupt termination of a federally funded national service infrastructure, and the legal dispute focuses on the procedural and constitutional limits of executive branch actions in dismantling such programs without adhering to statutory requirements.",
    "46350": "On April 7, 2025, the American Library Association, a nonprofit organization representing libraries and their users, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, a national labor union representing library workers, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. They challenged recent actions by the federal government taken in response to Executive Order 14238, issued by President Donald Trump, which directed the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and certain other agencies to reduce operations to the minimum required by law and to eliminate non-statutory functions. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel from the Democracy Forward Foundation and Gair Gallo Eberhard LLP.\n\nThe plaintiffs sued federal officials and agencies, including the President (in his official capacity), the Acting Director of IMLS, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The case was not a class action. Plaintiffs alleged that after the Executive Order was issued on March 14, 2025, IMLS staff were placed on administrative leave, the majority were later terminated, the statutorily created Board was disbanded, and IMLS began terminating federal grants to libraries and related organizations nationwide, including to the plaintiffs themselves. The American Library Association specifically alleged that its grants were terminated and that it and its members faced loss of program funding, inability to process reimbursements, and loss of access to critical federal library data and services.\n\nThe cause of action relied on claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Take Care Clause and Separation of Powers doctrine of the U.S. Constitution, and other federal statutes related to appropriations and agency authority. Plaintiffs asserted that only Congress could dismantle a federal agency established by statute, and that the President and executive officials lacked the authority to unilaterally eliminate IMLS or withhold or terminate congressionally mandated funding and functions. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the shutdown, restore staff and grants, and compel continued agency operation in accordance with statutory mandates.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Richard J. Leon. Plaintiffs promptly moved for a preliminary injunction to prohibit further reduction of IMLS operations and to reinstate terminated employees and grants. They also sought a temporary restraining order as the agency’s mass layoffs and grant terminations were imminent.\n\nDefendants opposed, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek broad relief, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over claims relating to terminated federal grants (which must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act), and that employment grievances must proceed through administrative channels under the Civil Service Reform Act. Defendants further argued that the actions taken were committed to agency discretion and did not violate statutory or constitutional requirements.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, the court issued a temporary restraining order, but further proceedings were stayed due to ongoing appellate litigation in a related case (Widakuswara v. Lake) addressing similar legal issues regarding agency shutdowns and grant terminations. After supplemental briefing and subsequent appellate guidance, Judge Leon issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order on June 6, 2025, denying the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court held that the plaintiffs had not established a likelihood of success on the merits, primarily because most of their claims regarding grant terminations were, under recent Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent, required to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims as contract claims under the Tucker Act, not as APA or constitutional claims in district court. The court also noted that claims regarding federal personnel actions were subject to exclusive administrative review under the Civil Service Reform Act and were not properly before the district court.\n\nNo trial was held, and there were no reported opinions or appeals as of the latest filings. The court ordered the parties to propose next steps, and the case is proceeding to dispositive motions, with the administrative record to be developed and summary judgment briefing scheduled.\n\nThe core factual basis of the case is the federal government’s move, via executive order, to drastically reduce or dismantle the IMLS, terminate staff and grants, and the resulting financial, operational, and informational harms to libraries, library staff, and related organizations across the country.\n\nNo decrees, settlements, or court-enforced agreements were entered. There was no appointment of a monitor, and no disputes over settlement enforcement or monitoring. No class was certified, and no consolidated or related cases were joined in this proceeding, though the court considered related appellate decisions addressing parallel questions.",
    "46746": "This case concerns the construction and operation of a large immigration detention facility, known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (the “TNT Site”) in Collier County, Florida. The TNT Site is owned by Miami-Dade County but lies almost entirely within Collier County and within or adjacent to the Big Cypress National Preserve, a protected and environmentally sensitive area of the Everglades ecosystem.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on June 27, 2025, by Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and the Center for Biological Diversity, both not-for-profit environmental organizations with members who use and enjoy the Everglades and Big Cypress National Preserve. These organizations are represented by private counsel from Earthjustice, Coffey Burlington, and in-house counsel from the Center for Biological Diversity. The case is not a class action.\n\nThe defendants are Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Todd Lyons, Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; Kevin Guthrie, in his official capacity as Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management; and Miami-Dade County. Federal defendants are represented by the U.S. Department of Justice; the State is represented by the Florida Attorney General and private counsel; and Miami-Dade County has its own counsel.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the State of Florida, in coordination with federal agencies, constructed a mass immigration detention and deportation facility capable of holding up to 5,000 noncitizens at the TNT Site. The site is within a unique wetland ecosystem, home to several endangered and threatened species, including the Florida panther and Florida bonneted bat. Plaintiffs claim that the federal and state defendants failed to conduct any environmental review, assessment, or impact statement as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq., prior to construction and operation of the facility. The complaint also alleges related violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., and Florida land-use and environmental law, as well as violations of Miami-Dade County’s land-use code.\n\nThe legal foundation of the case is plaintiffs’ claim that the federal defendants’ actions constitute a “major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” under NEPA, thereby requiring an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or Environmental Assessment (EA) before proceeding. Plaintiffs argue that the project is federally controlled and funded, referencing federal statements and agreements that the facility would be fully reimbursed and operated in cooperation with federal immigration authorities under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g) (“287(g) agreements”). Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief halting further construction and operation of the facility until compliance with NEPA and related laws.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams in the Southern District of Florida. Early proceedings included expedited motions for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, as well as challenges to venue and jurisdiction by the defendants. The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida was granted intervention as a plaintiff due to its proximity and cultural ties to the area.\n\nThe court held a multi-day evidentiary hearing in August 2025. Plaintiffs presented testimony from members, scientists, and tribal representatives describing environmental impacts, the lack of public process, and procedural harms. Defendants argued that the project was state-led, that federal involvement was limited to standard immigration enforcement, and that no federal funds had yet been disbursed.\n\nOn August 21, 2025, Judge Williams issued an Omnibus Order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. The court found that venue was proper in the Southern District of Florida and concluded that the construction and operation of the detention facility, under the circumstances presented, was a major federal action under NEPA due to federal funding commitments and operational control under 287(g) agreements. The court determined that no NEPA environmental review had been performed and that plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm to their environmental and procedural interests.\n\nThe court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the State and Federal Defendants from expanding the facility, installing additional infrastructure, or bringing in new detainees not already present at the time of the order. The order further required the removal of certain lighting, fencing, and utilities within sixty days, allowing existing detainees to be transferred or removed through attrition. Plaintiffs were required to post a $100 bond. The court did not address or order relief on the state or county law claims at this stage.\n\nBoth the State of Florida and the federal defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Eleventh Circuit (No. 25-12873), and moved for a stay pending appeal, which was denied in the district court and remains pending in the appellate court. The federal and state defendants continue to contest venue, the applicability of NEPA, the existence of a major federal action, and the availability of injunctive relief under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the APA.\n\nNo final trial has occurred, and no permanent relief has been ordered. The court’s preliminary injunction remains in effect pending further proceedings or appellate review. There have been no consolidated or related cases in the district court, although other cases involving detainee conditions at the TNT Site have been referenced in the record. There is no court-appointed monitor or special master. No settlement has been reached. The factual basis of the case centers on the rapid construction and operation of a large immigration detention center in a sensitive environmental area without environmental review, and the resulting alleged environmental, procedural, and recreational harms to plaintiffs and their members.",
    "46388": "This case arises from the federal government's actions under the Trump administration in 2025 to investigate and ultimately terminate billions of dollars in federal research funding to Harvard University, based on allegations that Harvard failed to adequately address antisemitism and other forms of discrimination on its campus. The case was filed on April 11, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts by three plaintiffs: the American Association of University Professors–Harvard Faculty Chapter (a nonprofit faculty association at Harvard), the American Association of University Professors (a national academic freedom and labor organization), and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), which represents Harvard graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel.\n\nThe defendants are multiple federal agencies and their officials acting in their official capacities, including the United States Department of Justice, Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, General Services Administration, Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Department of Agriculture, and Department of Housing and Urban Development, as well as leaders of those agencies.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ claims are not a class action, but are brought by these three organizational plaintiffs on behalf of their members at Harvard who are faculty and academic workers directly affected by the challenged actions.\n\nThe dispute centers on a series of government actions beginning in early 2025. In March 2025, following public statements and executive orders from President Trump and other officials pledging to combat antisemitism and eliminate “DEI” (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiatives in higher education, the administration announced a formal federal review of Harvard’s federal funding. On April 3 and April 11, 2025, Harvard received letters from a multi-agency federal “Task Force,” led by the Department of Justice and including the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services, demanding that Harvard implement broad reforms as a condition for maintaining access to federal funds. These demands included shutting down DEI programs, overhauling admissions and hiring to eliminate certain preferences, centralizing and changing disciplinary procedures, imposing a campus “mask ban,” subjecting Harvard to ongoing federal audits, and increasing “viewpoint diversity” as defined by the administration. The letters did not point to specific findings of discrimination, cite any formal investigation results, or follow the procedural requirements set forth in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, after Harvard responded rejecting the federal demands as unlawful and unconstitutional, the federal government announced the immediate freeze of approximately $2.2 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard. In the following weeks, multiple agencies—including NIH, DOE, DOD, NSF, HUD, USDA, and NASA—sent letters to Harvard formally terminating existing grant awards, citing Harvard’s alleged failure to comply with civil rights laws and, in some cases, invoking changes in “agency priorities.” On May 5, 2025, the Secretary of Education notified Harvard that it would no longer be considered for any future federal grants. The government’s actions were widely publicized and accompanied by public statements from the President and administration officials criticizing Harvard’s leadership, campus policies, and academic climate.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert that these actions were taken without following any of the statutory or regulatory procedures required under Title VI, including notice, investigation, findings of noncompliance, voluntary compliance efforts, a right to a hearing, congressional notification, and tailoring of funding actions to specific programs. The plaintiffs allege violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for failure to follow required procedure and for arbitrary and capricious agency action, as well as violations of the First Amendment for unlawful coercion, retaliation, and viewpoint discrimination targeting academic freedom and protected speech. Additional counts allege violations of separation of powers, the Spending Clause, and due process.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief barring the government from terminating, withholding, or conditioning federal funds to Harvard outside the procedures and limitations of law, prohibiting retaliation or coercion targeting protected speech, and requiring the government to set aside the challenged actions. They also request attorneys’ fees.\n\nNo judge is yet identified in the filings. The docket does not reflect any substantive rulings, reported opinions, settlement, or trial to date. No related or consolidated cases are indicated. The case is pending on cross-motions for summary judgment, with oral argument scheduled for July 21, 2025.\n\nThe underlying facts show that Harvard and its academic workers, particularly those whose research and employment depend on federal grants, have experienced significant disruption, delays, loss of funding, and a climate of fear and self-censorship as a result of the government’s actions. The case is brought by the faculty and academic staff associations, as well as the graduate student and postdoctoral union, on behalf of their members directly affected by the termination and threatened loss of federal funding, and by changes to campus policies and academic freedom. The relief sought is prospective and equitable; no damages are requested.",

The suit followed OJP’s abrupt, simultaneous termination of more than 370 multi-year grants and cooperative agreements, totaling over $820 million in funding for public safety, violence prevention, victim services, and related initiatives. These terminations occurred without prior notice and were justified in identical form letters stating that the awards “no longer effectuate[] the program goals or agency priorities.” The terminations required grantees to cease work immediately, allowed reimbursement only through the date of termination, and offered only a post-hoc administrative appeal.\n\nThe terminated grants supported a wide range of community programs: violence interruption, youth and gang prevention, victim services (including for Deaf and disabled individuals), anti-hate response and healing for AAPI communities, hospital-based interventions, and technical assistance for law enforcement and prosecutors. As a result of the terminations, plaintiffs and their partners reported immediate service disruptions, layoffs of specialized staff, lost support for victims and high-risk populations, reputational harm, and—in some cases—potential threats to community safety.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that OJP’s actions violated multiple legal and constitutional requirements. The complaint raised claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for arbitrary and capricious action and for acting contrary to law and regulation; asserted violations of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause (procedural due process and void-for-vagueness); alleged violations of the separation of powers, the Spending and Appropriations Clauses, and the Take Care Clause; and sought ultra vires relief. The plaintiffs requested class certification, a preliminary and permanent injunction to restore grant funding, declaratory relief invalidating the terminations, and other related remedies.\n\nAfter briefing and oral argument, Judge Mehta denied the preliminary injunction, dismissed the case, and denied the class certification motion as moot. The court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the APA claims, finding that—under the Supreme Court’s recent summary order in Department of Education v. California and D.C. Circuit precedent—claims seeking to reinstate terminated federal grants are, at their essence, contractual and thus fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. The court further held that the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims failed on the merits, concluding that the plaintiffs did not have a protected property interest in continued grant funding, and that the record did not show a violation of congressional appropriations requirements since DOJ intended to re-obligate the funds. The court also found no basis for ultra vires relief.\n\nIn its opinion, the court repeatedly noted the arbitrariness and harmful impacts of OJP’s actions, characterizing the terminations as “unquestionably arbitrary,” “shameful,” and “indiscriminate,” but held it was powerless to grant relief due to jurisdictional and legal constraints.\n\nAfter final judgment was entered on July 7, 2025, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal. The court denied the request for affirmative injunctive relief but, by agreement of the parties, issued a limited injunction prohibiting DOJ from re-obligating or diminishing the funds from the five named plaintiffs’ terminated grants until October 1, 2025, to preserve the status quo pending appellate review. The order did not require a bond.\n\nThe case is currently on appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (Case No. 25-5248). No trial was held, and there are no reported appellate decisions at this time. There are no reported related or consolidated cases in the district court record. Amicus briefs were filed by multiple states and local governments in support of plaintiffs during the preliminary injunction phase.",
    "46387": "This case arose from an executive order issued by President Donald J. Trump on April 9, 2025, targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey LLP. The order was part of a broader campaign of executive actions against law firms that had represented clients or advanced causes perceived as hostile to the President’s interests. Susman Godfrey is a prominent trial firm with offices in several major U.S. cities and a national practice, including a significant portion of its work before federal courts and agencies.\n\nThe executive order directed multiple federal agencies and their leaders to take adverse actions against Susman Godfrey, including: suspending all security clearances held by its personnel; terminating or reviewing government contracts involving Susman Godfrey or its clients; compelling government contractors to disclose any business with the firm; limiting Susman Godfrey’s access to federal buildings and federal officials; and creating a presumption against federal hiring of Susman Godfrey employees. The order’s stated rationale was that Susman Godfrey had engaged in activities “detrimental to critical American interests,” referencing the firm’s litigation concerning the 2020 presidential election, its support for certain advocacy groups, and its diversity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nSusman Godfrey, represented by private counsel, challenged the order in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on April 11, 2025. The firm alleged that the order constituted unlawful retaliation and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment, infringed its rights to petition and association, violated its clients’ right to counsel, and deprived it of protected liberty and property interests without due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The suit also alleged the order violated the constitutional separation of powers and was ultra vires, lacking any statutory or constitutional basis.\n\nThe named defendants included the United States, the Executive Office of the President, numerous federal agencies and departments, and high-ranking officials in their official capacities. No class action was involved; Susman Godfrey was the sole plaintiff.\n\nShortly after filing, Susman Godfrey moved for a temporary restraining order, which was granted on April 15, 2025, by Judge Loren L. AliKhan. The court found that the executive order likely violated the First and Fifth Amendments and temporarily enjoined its enforcement. The TRO was extended by agreement of the parties pending a final judgment.\n\nThe parties submitted cross-motions for summary judgment, and the case drew extensive attention from the legal community, with numerous amicus briefs filed by law firms, bar associations, former judges, and advocacy organizations.\n\nAfter full briefing and a hearing, the court granted summary judgment for Susman Godfrey and denied the government’s renewed motion to dismiss. In a detailed opinion and order issued on June 27, 2025, the court declared the executive order unconstitutional and permanently enjoined its enforcement in all respects. The court found that the order violated the First Amendment by retaliating against Susman Godfrey for protected speech and advocacy, discriminating based on viewpoint, infringing the rights to petition and association, and chilling the firm’s speech and client relationships. The court further found violations of due process, including deprivation of liberty and property interests without any procedural protections, unconstitutional vagueness, and interference with the right to counsel. The court also found that the order exceeded the President’s constitutional and statutory authority and impermissibly intruded on the separation of powers by seeking to punish and exclude lawyers from federal practice and contracting based on their legal work.\n\nNo trial was held, and the case was resolved on summary judgment. There were no consolidated or related cases directly joined to this action, although the court noted parallel litigation involving other law firms subjected to similar orders. No court-appointed monitor was required, and no settlement negotiations occurred; the case resulted in a court order rather than a consent decree or settlement.\n\nThe permanent injunction prohibits all federal agencies and officials from enforcing or relying on the executive order in any way, requires them to rescind any guidance or actions taken under the order, and mandates notification to all relevant personnel. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the injunction.\n\nNo appeal had been resolved as of the issuance of the final order, but the government noticed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit on August 22, 2025.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centered on Susman Godfrey’s legal advocacy in high-profile matters, including representation of Dominion Voting Systems and state officials in litigation related to the 2020 election, as well as the firm’s pro bono and diversity initiatives. The suit documented the President’s public statements expressing intent to retaliate against law firms representing political opponents and detailed the chilling effect and reputational, economic, and constitutional harms imposed by the executive order. The remedies sought and granted were declaratory and permanent injunctive relief; no monetary damages were at issue.",
    "46245": "This case concerns the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), a congressionally-created independent nonprofit corporation established in 1984 to promote research, education, and training on peaceful conflict resolution. USIP is governed by a fifteen-member Board of Directors, comprised of twelve directors appointed by the President with Senate confirmation and three ex officio members: the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the President of the National Defense University. USIP’s president is appointed by the Board and manages day-to-day operations. By law, USIP’s appointed directors may only be removed by the President under limited, enumerated circumstances set out in 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f).\n\nOn February 19, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order directing that USIP’s non-statutory functions be eliminated and that its statutory functions and personnel be reduced to the minimum required by law. On March 14, 2025, following this order, the President removed all twelve appointed directors of USIP’s Board via email, without invoking any of the statutory criteria set by 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f). The three remaining ex officio Board members then purported to remove USIP’s Acting President, Ambassador George Moose, and installed Kenneth Jackson (and later Nate Cavanaugh) as acting president. Under this new leadership, USIP’s headquarters building, constructed partly with private funds, was transferred to the General Services Administration (GSA) without compensation, and nearly all USIP staff were terminated. USIP’s programs and activities were halted, and its assets—including those held in a separate endowment—were transferred to the government.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, USIP and five of its removed directors filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, represented by private counsel (Zuckerman Spaeder LLP and Picard Kentz & Rowe LLP). Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that the President’s removals violated the express limitations in the USIP Act, and that subsequent actions taken by the new leadership—including the transfer of property and termination of staff—were ultra vires and void. They requested reinstatement of the removed directors and president, restoration of USIP’s property and assets, and an injunction preventing further control or interference by the defendants.\n\nAfter expedited proceedings, Judge Beryl A. Howell granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on May 19, 2025. The court held that USIP, while a government entity for constitutional purposes, does not exercise executive power and is not part of the Executive Branch. Therefore, the President’s constitutional removal authority did not override the statutory protections in 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f), which remained enforceable. The court further held that, even if USIP were within the Executive Branch, the statutory removal protections were constitutional under Humphrey’s Executor v. United States and its progeny, as USIP is a multimember, nonpartisan board with de minimis executive power. The court declared the President’s removal of the directors unlawful, declared all actions taken by the illegitimately installed presidents void (including the property transfers and staff terminations), restored the removed directors and Moose to their positions, and enjoined the defendants from further interference with USIP’s operations or assets.\n\nDefendants appealed and sought a stay of the district court’s judgment. The district court denied a stay, but a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted a stay pending appeal on June 27, 2025, finding that the government was likely to succeed on the merits and that the President’s inability to control USIP’s board posed irreparable harm. The panel reasoned that USIP exercises “substantial executive power,” particularly in foreign affairs, and thus fell outside the Humphrey’s Executor exception to at-will presidential removal. Plaintiffs’ petition for en banc rehearing and an emergency administrative stay was denied on July 24, 2025.\n\nThe case remains on appeal. No trial was held; all substantive rulings were on summary judgment. The court-ordered relief is currently stayed pending appellate review. No independent monitor was appointed. No settlement was reached. The case did not involve a class action but was brought by USIP and its lawfully appointed directors. The underlying factual dispute centers on whether the President’s attempt to dismantle USIP and remove its directors was lawful under the governing statute and the Constitution.",
    "46274": "This consolidated litigation concerns the federal government’s termination and freeze of billions of dollars in clean energy grant funding under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), a program created by Congress in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. The principal plaintiffs are nonprofit financial institutions—including Climate United Fund, Coalition for Green Capital, and Power Forward Communities, along with nonprofit “green banks” from various states (such as California, Illinois, Maine, and Minnesota)—that were awarded large grants by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2024 through the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) competition, a major GGRF grant program. The plaintiffs’ grants, totaling approximately $14 billion, were intended to fund clean energy, affordable housing, and related infrastructure projects nationwide, particularly in low-income and disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe plaintiffs received their grant awards, completed rigorous application and vetting processes, and entered into grant agreements with the EPA in mid-2024. The grant agreements required the funds to be held at Citibank, N.A., pursuant to a Financial Agency Agreement (FAA) between Citibank and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and Account Control Agreements (ACAs) between Citibank, EPA, and each grantee. These agreements gave EPA oversight and a security interest but required Citibank to disburse funds to the grantees on their request unless EPA issued a formal Notice of Exclusive Control based on specific grounds outlined in the grant agreements and related regulations.\n\nIn early 2025, following a change in federal administration, EPA’s new leadership publicly criticized the GGRF program. Beginning in mid-February 2025, Citibank stopped honoring plaintiffs’ disbursement requests, citing directives from federal authorities but providing no clear legal justification. The freeze followed actions by the FBI, Treasury, and EPA, including a non-binding FBI “freeze recommendation,” and Treasury instructions to Citibank to pause disbursements. The plaintiffs were not given notice or opportunity to respond before their accounts were frozen.\n\nOn March 8, 2025, Climate United Fund filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Other grantees and subgrantees, including state green banks, filed similar cases, which were consolidated. Plaintiffs sued EPA, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin (in his official capacity), and Citibank, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to restore access to their grant funds and to enjoin further interference. They alleged that EPA’s actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Appropriations Clause, the Inflation Reduction Act, and federal grant regulations, as well as claiming breach of contract and related claims against Citibank for refusing to disburse funds in violation of the ACAs.\n\nShortly after suit was filed, EPA issued formal Notices of Termination purporting to cancel all NCIF grant agreements, citing vague concerns about program integrity, oversight, and alignment with agency priorities but offering no specific factual findings of grantee misconduct or regulatory noncompliance. EPA stated its intent to reobligate funds to other recipients but did so after the statutory deadline for GGRF grant obligations had passed.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order, and later, a preliminary injunction. The cases were presided over by Judge Tanya S. Chutkan. After hearings, the court granted a temporary restraining order enjoining EPA and Citibank from implementing the terminations or transferring the funds, preserving the status quo pending further proceedings.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiffs. The court found that plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on their claims that EPA’s termination and interference with grant funds violated the APA and federal regulations, including the requirement of a reasoned explanation and compliance with specific procedures for grant termination. The court held that EPA could not retroactively terminate grant agreements without adhering to regulatory and contractual procedures, and that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm—including threatened insolvency and irreparable loss of programs and reputation—without access to the funds. The court enjoined EPA and Citibank from effectuating the terminations, interfering with the accounts, or denying access to funds except as permitted by the ACAs, grant agreements, and law. The court waived any bond requirement for the injunction.\n\nEPA and Citibank appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and the district court stayed further proceedings on the complaints pending resolution of the appeal.\n\nThe proceedings remain ongoing. No trial has occurred, and the case has not been resolved on the merits. No monitor or special master has been appointed. There are no reported opinions besides the court’s memorandum opinions and orders on the preliminary injunction and related relief. No settlement or consent decree has been entered. There are no allegations or findings of grantee fraud, waste, or abuse in the record. The principal factual dispute concerns the government’s authority to freeze or terminate the grants after they were awarded and whether the government’s actions complied with the law, regulations, and the Constitution.",
    "46142": "This case challenges three executive orders issued by President Donald J. Trump in January 2025 that target diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) initiatives and restrict federal funding for organizations that engage in certain DEIA-related activities or support transgender rights. The lawsuit was filed on February 19, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by two non-profit organizations, the National Urban League and the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, both of which are long-standing recipients of federal grants and contracts. The plaintiffs are represented by private counsel, including attorneys from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Lambda Legal, and Covington & Burling LLP.\n\nThe defendants are the President, multiple federal agencies (including the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Justice, and the Environmental Protection Agency), their respective secretaries or directors in their official capacities, and several sub-agencies responsible for enforcing or implementing federal funding and contract requirements.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenge Executive Order No. 14151 (“Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs and Preferencing”), Executive Order No. 14168 (“Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”), and Executive Order No. 14173 (“Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity”). These orders direct federal agencies to terminate “equity-related” grants and contracts, prohibit the use of federal funds to “promote gender ideology,” and require federal contractors and grantees to certify that they do not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate federal anti-discrimination laws. The orders use undefined or vague terms and are accompanied by agency memoranda and public statements clarifying that all forms of DEIA activities and support for transgender people are disfavored and subject to termination of federal funding.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that the executive orders and their implementation violate the First Amendment by engaging in viewpoint and content discrimination, chilling protected speech, and imposing unconstitutional conditions on the receipt of federal funds. They also claim the orders are unconstitutionally vague under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, both on their face and as applied, because they fail to provide clear notice of what conduct is prohibited and invite arbitrary enforcement. Additional claims assert that the orders violate equal protection guarantees under the Fifth Amendment by intentionally discriminating against people of color, women, LGBTQ individuals, and specifically transgender people, and that the orders are ultra vires executive actions that usurp congressional authority over appropriations and contradict statutory requirements for federal grant programs.\n\nPlaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the challenged provisions, including a permanent injunction prohibiting agencies from terminating contracts or grants or conditioning federal funds on compliance with the executive orders. The case was assigned to Judge Timothy J. Kelly.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to bar enforcement of the challenged provisions. During litigation, the plaintiffs presented evidence that the orders had caused the suspension and termination of hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal grant funds, as well as substantial confusion, self-censorship, and disruption of mission-driven programs serving marginalized communities. The government opposed the motion, and an organization named Do No Harm sought to intervene as a defendant, but was denied intervention at this stage.\n\nThe court denied the preliminary injunction on May 2, 2025. In a detailed memorandum opinion, Judge Kelly found that the plaintiffs had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits. The court held that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge several intra-governmental provisions that did not directly regulate or harm them, and that their facial constitutional claims did not meet the high bar for invalidating executive orders that restrict federal funding for certain activities. The court emphasized that the government is not required to subsidize speech or activities and that the orders, on their face, do not prohibit protected speech outside the scope of federally funded programs. The judge also determined that the plaintiffs had not shown the provisions were impermissibly vague or amounted to viewpoint discrimination in their primary sweep, and that as-applied challenges to specific agency enforcement actions were not before the court.\n\nSeveral related cases in other jurisdictions have resulted in different preliminary outcomes, including injunctions against enforcement of similar or identical executive order provisions, but those were not binding on this court.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended and supplemental complaint on June 30, 2025, updating their allegations and claims in light of additional agency actions and evolving enforcement of the executive orders. The litigation remains pending, with the court’s denial of preliminary injunctive relief standing as the most significant reported ruling to date. No trial has occurred, and no appeals have yet been noted in the docket.",
    "46110": "This case was filed on February 12, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by several federal employee unions, including the National Treasury Employees Union, National Federation of Federal Employees, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. These unions, represented by private counsel, act as exclusive bargaining representatives for hundreds of thousands of federal employees across dozens of federal agencies.\n\nThe unions challenge a series of Executive Branch actions implemented in the early weeks of President Trump’s second administration. On February 11, 2025, the President issued Executive Order No. 14210, directing federal agencies to prepare for large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), with an emphasis on eliminating positions considered “nonessential” during government shutdowns, as well as those involved in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and other functions not mandated by law. Concurrently, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) instructed agencies to identify and justify retention of probationary employees—those with less than one year (competitive service) or two years (excepted service) of federal service—leading to mass terminations of such employees across multiple agencies. Additionally, OPM launched a government-wide “deferred resignation program,” giving employees the option to resign with continued pay and benefits through September 30, 2025, and warning that major workforce downsizing was imminent. By the time of the emergency motion, terminations and resignations were already underway, with tens of thousands of employees affected.\n\nThe unions allege these actions collectively violate constitutional separation of powers principles by usurping Congress’s authority to create, fund, and shape executive agencies, and by undermining congressional statutes, including the Civil Service Reform Act’s reduction-in-force procedures (5 U.S.C. § 3502 and related regulations). They further allege that agencies are conducting RIFs for purposes not permitted by statute or regulation and without required procedural safeguards, such as proper notice, competitive area definitions, and retention prioritization criteria.\n\nThe unions seek declaratory and injunctive relief to halt implementation of the Executive Order’s RIF provisions, OPM’s mass termination directive for probationary employees, and further iterations of the deferred resignation program. They also seek a declaration that these actions are unlawful and an order enjoining violations of the statutory and regulatory RIF requirements.\n\nJudge Christopher R. Cooper presides over the case. Early in the litigation, the unions filed for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. On February 20, 2025, Judge Cooper denied this relief, holding that the court likely lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) requires such labor-management disputes to be brought first before the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), with judicial review available in the courts of appeals. The court also noted that the plaintiffs had not sufficiently established standing for broad organizational relief and that their claims were not likely to escape statutory channeling under the Supreme Court’s Thunder Basin framework.\n\nNo trial has been held, and no reported opinions beyond the denial of emergency relief have issued to date. There are no consolidated or related cases noted in the record, though similar cases were referenced in other districts. The case did not reach the stage of decree, settlement, or monitoring. The unions subsequently filed amended and then second amended complaints, updating facts and defendants, and the government has moved to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. As of the most recent filings, the litigation remains ongoing, with briefing on the government’s renewed motion to dismiss scheduled.\n\nThe factual basis of the case centers on the Executive Branch’s rapid efforts to downsize the federal workforce through mass firings, RIFs, and incentivized resignations, which the unions claim threaten the statutory missions of federal agencies and the rights and interests of union-represented employees. The unions assert these measures will cause financial harm, loss of bargaining power, and diminished representation for their members. The government maintains that these claims should be resolved through the administrative process set out by Congress for federal labor disputes.",
    "46098": "On February 11, 2025, a coalition of U.S. humanitarian nonprofits, international development firms, small business associations, and professional societies filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the federal government’s abrupt freeze and termination of foreign assistance funding. The plaintiffs, all longstanding implementing partners of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) or the Department of State, alleged that a series of executive and agency actions beginning on January 20, 2025, unlawfully halted the obligation and disbursement of billions of dollars in congressionally appropriated foreign aid for ongoing projects around the world. These actions followed an executive order by President Donald J. Trump directing an immediate pause on all U.S. foreign aid disbursements and a comprehensive policy review, with subsequent memoranda from the Secretary of State and other agency officials implementing the freeze and instructing mass terminations or suspensions of awards.\n\nThe plaintiffs included both individual entities—such as USAID contractors, grantees, and membership organizations representing small businesses and global health groups—and associations, but this was not a class action. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel.\n\nThe case was brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the Anti-Deficiency Act, various appropriations statutes, and constitutional separation-of-powers principles, including the Appropriations Clause and the Take Care Clause. The plaintiffs alleged that the executive branch exceeded its statutory and constitutional authority by refusing to spend funds that Congress had directed be used for specific foreign assistance purposes, and by terminating or suspending contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements en masse for policy reasons, without individualized review or adherence to required procedures.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, specifically: (1) to enjoin the executive branch from withholding or impounding appropriated foreign assistance funds, (2) to require the government to make available for obligation the full amount of funds Congress appropriated for foreign aid in fiscal year 2024, and (3) to prohibit the government from enforcing mass terminations or suspensions of existing contracts and grants that were not based on individualized, lawful determinations.\n\nJudge Amir H. Ali presided over the case. On February 13, 2025, the district court issued a temporary restraining order barring the government from enforcing the blanket foreign aid freeze and related directives as to awards in existence as of January 19, 2025. The court subsequently granted in part a preliminary injunction, finding the plaintiffs likely to succeed on their argument that the government’s wholesale refusal to spend appropriated funds for foreign assistance, without following the rescission, deferral, or reporting requirements set by the Impoundment Control Act and relevant appropriations laws, violated both statutory mandates and the constitutional separation of powers. The court enjoined the government from unlawfully impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and ordered it to make available for obligation the full amount appropriated in the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The court also required the government to process payments for completed work and prohibited giving effect to blanket terminations or suspensions issued during the freeze period.\n\nThe government appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit consolidated the appeals and expedited review. In an August 13, 2025 decision, the D.C. Circuit vacated the portion of the preliminary injunction relating to the obligation of appropriated foreign aid funds, holding that the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to challenge executive impoundment in this context. The appellate court concluded that neither the APA nor a freestanding constitutional claim provided a basis for private parties to enforce the Impoundment Control Act or appropriations statutes against the executive branch; instead, enforcement of impoundment provisions was left to the Comptroller General as specified in the statute. The court also found that the plaintiffs’ ultra vires and APA claims were precluded by the statutory scheme and did not meet the high standard required for nonstatutory review. The D.C. Circuit recognized the plaintiffs’ Article III standing but found they were not likely to succeed on the merits.\n\nFollowing the appellate decision, litigation continued in the district court on related claims, including the plaintiffs’ challenge to the lawfulness of award terminations and the government’s compliance with the preliminary injunction order. The government moved to dismiss the amended complaints, arguing that the core claims were contract disputes within the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act and that the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action under either the APA or the Constitution.\n\nThe factual context underlying the case centered on the unprecedented, executive-ordered suspension of virtually all U.S. foreign assistance activities worldwide, the mass termination or suspension of thousands of existing contracts and grants, and the resulting widespread disruption to humanitarian, development, and health programs. Plaintiffs documented layoffs, shuttered offices, and interruption of essential services to vulnerable populations. The courts’ decisions engaged with the legal limits of executive discretion over appropriated funds, the statutory and constitutional boundaries of the power of the purse, and the narrow scope of private enforcement under federal appropriations and impoundment statutes.\n\nNo class certification, related consolidated cases, or court-appointed monitors were identified. The litigation remains ongoing following the D.C. Circuit’s ruling and the government’s renewed motion to dismiss in the district court, with further proceedings pending on the scope of available relief and unresolved contract claims.",
    "46090": "On February 9, 2025, a group of plaintiffs, including the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), the CFPB Employee Association (both representing CFPB employees), and nonprofit organizations that rely on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s services (the National Consumer Law Center, the NAACP, and the Virginia Poverty Law Center), filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit challenged a series of actions by the new administration, led by Acting CFPB Director Russell Vought, aimed at dismantling and effectively shutting down the CFPB. The plaintiffs were represented by private and public interest counsel, including Gupta Wessler LLP, Public Citizen Litigation Group, and NTEU’s legal department.\n\nThe case arose after, in early February 2025, the President removed the existing CFPB Director and installed Russell Vought as Acting Director. Over the course of several days, Vought and his advisors issued directives that, according to the evidence, halted nearly all CFPB activities, placed most employees on administrative leave, terminated contracts (including those essential for CFPB’s statutory functions), and initiated a plan to implement a reduction in force (RIF) affecting more than 80% of the agency’s workforce. Internal and public communications, including a “stop work” order, made no exception for the performance of statutorily mandated duties. The President and his allies publicly described the CFPB as being “shut down” or eliminated.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that these actions amounted to an unlawful executive attempt to abolish an agency that Congress had created by statute to fulfill mandatory consumer protection functions. The legal claims were brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the separation of powers principles of the Constitution, and the Take Care Clause, with plaintiffs seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the dismantling of the CFPB and to require the restoration of its operations and workforce.\n\nJudge Amy Berman Jackson presided over the case. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that the defendants were engaged in a concerted, expedited effort to close the agency in violation of both statutory and constitutional limits. The court concluded that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims, that irreparable harm would occur in the absence of relief, and that an injunction served the public interest, given the CFPB’s unique federal regulatory role. On March 28, 2025, the court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the termination or RIF of CFPB employees (except for cause), requiring the reinstatement of those already terminated, rescinding contract terminations, and mandating the maintenance of the CFPB’s statutorily required functions and data.\n\nDefendants appealed, and the D.C. Circuit partially stayed and later reinstated the preliminary injunction pending appeal. While the appeal was pending, the CFPB attempted a mass RIF, which was suspended by further court order.\n\nOn August 15, 2025, the D.C. Circuit (Judges Pillard, Katsas, and Rao) issued its opinion. The court vacated the preliminary injunction. It held that: (1) claims by the organizations representing CFPB employees were subject to the exclusive review scheme of the Civil Service Reform Act and not properly before the district court; (2) the other plaintiffs (including the NAACP) had standing, but their claims were not viable under the APA or equity. The court reasoned that the plaintiffs had not challenged a discrete, final agency action as required by the APA; instead, they were challenging an inferred, abstract “decision” to shut down the agency based on a collection of disparate actions, rather than a formal, binding order or rule. The court further held that an implied equitable cause of action under the Constitution was not available because the plaintiffs’ claims, at root, alleged only statutory violations, not a direct constitutional violation as required by Supreme Court precedent. The court concluded that neither the APA nor equity permitted judicial review of the agency shutdown as presented, and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.\n\nThere were no consolidated or related cases affecting this ruling. No monitor was appointed. The appellate ruling did not address or order the substantive restoration of the CFPB’s functions, but instead focused on the proper scope and availability of judicial review. The case did not proceed to trial, was not resolved by settlement, and the preliminary injunctive relief expired following the appellate decision.",
    "PN-NY-0014": "On March 28, 2012, a group of Black and Latino New York City residents, along with advocacy organizations, filed a class action in the Southern District of New York against the City of New York, the Police Commissioner, and several named and unnamed NYPD officers. The plaintiffs challenged the New York City Police Department’s (NYPD) practices under \"Operation Clean Halls\"—later formalized as the Trespass Affidavit Program (TAP)—which authorized police officers to patrol inside and around thousands of private residential apartment buildings throughout New York City, particularly in the Bronx.\n\nThe case alleged that the NYPD systematically conducted suspicionless stops, questioning, searches, citations, and arrests of residents and their invited guests in TAP buildings, often without individualized suspicion or probable cause, and that such practices disproportionately affected Black and Latino residents. Plaintiffs described frequent stops by officers in lobbies, stairwells, courtyards, and sidewalks, sometimes resulting in full searches or arrests for trespassing in their own buildings. This, they contended, infringed upon their rights to privacy, association, housing, and equal protection.\n\nPlaintiffs brought their claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, asserting violations of the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, the First Amendment’s protections for association and assembly, the Fair Housing Act, corresponding provisions of the New York Constitution, and state common law. Relief sought included declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the challenged practices, as well as class-wide remedies and damages for named plaintiffs.\n\nThe plaintiffs were represented by private and public interest counsel, including the New York Civil Liberties Union, Bronx Defenders, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, and Shearman & Sterling LLP.\n\nThe case was certified as a class action under Rule 23(b)(2), with the class defined as all individuals who have been or are at risk of being stopped, frisked, arrested, searched, or issued a summons inside or in the vicinity of TAP buildings without legal justification by NYPD officers on suspicion of trespassing.\n\nA substantial factual record was developed, including a seven-day evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction motion, at which evidence was presented of widespread suspicionless stops, the impact on residents’ daily lives, and the disparate effects on communities of color. Plaintiffs presented expert analysis of NYPD data, testimony from individual class members, and evidence of the NYPD's policies and training.\n\nOn January 8, 2013, Judge Shira Scheindlin issued an opinion granting a preliminary injunction, finding a clear likelihood that the NYPD's practices under Operation Clean Halls violated the Fourth Amendment and the Fair Housing Act, and caused irreparable harm to the plaintiffs and class members. The court ordered the NYPD to cease suspicionless stops for trespass outside TAP buildings in the Bronx and directed reforms to policies, training, supervision, and auditing. The court later certified the class and issued further remedial orders, including the appointment of an independent monitor, Peter L. Zimroth, to oversee implementation of reforms. The Hon. Ariel E. Belen was appointed as facilitator for a joint remedial process to solicit input from affected communities and stakeholders.\n\nThe City initially appealed, and several police unions sought to intervene, but the Second Circuit ultimately denied the unions’ intervention and, following the election of a new mayor, the City withdrew its appeals and entered into settlement negotiations. In July 2017, after extensive negotiations, the parties entered a comprehensive Stipulation of Settlement and Order. The settlement, approved by Judge Analisa Torres, required the NYPD to implement significant reforms, including:\n\n- Revising the Patrol Guide and administrative policies to clarify the legal standards for stops, questioning, frisks, searches, and arrests in and around TAP buildings.\n- Specifying that mere presence in or around a TAP building is not grounds for a stop or arrest; requiring individualized suspicion.\n- Mandating improved documentation for stops (including a new stop report form) and trespass arrests (with a new Trespass Crimes Fact Sheet).\n- Implementing new training for all officers on the legal standards for stops, racial profiling, and TAP administration, with input from plaintiffs and the monitor.\n- Establishing procedures for ongoing auditing, supervision, and discipline related to stops and trespass enforcement.\n- Prohibiting racial profiling and requiring that enforcement actions not be motivated, even in part, by race, color, ethnicity, or national origin.\n- Creating a process for community engagement in the development of further reforms.\n- Providing monetary damages to named plaintiffs and agreeing to pay plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nThe settlement provides for court-enforced monitoring, with regular reporting by the independent monitor and continued court jurisdiction until the NYPD demonstrates substantial compliance with all material aspects of the reforms for a sustained period. The court retains authority to resolve disputes over compliance and enforce the settlement terms.\n\nThe factual basis for the case included evidence that NYPD officers frequently stopped, questioned, searched, or arrested individuals in or near TAP buildings without legal justification, often based solely on their presence, and that these practices had a disparate impact on Black and Latino residents. The settlement aims to prevent suspicionless stops, ensure lawful policing, and restore trust between the NYPD and the communities it serves.\n\nAs of the last reports, the NYPD has implemented revised policies, training, and auditing measures, with ongoing oversight by the monitor. The court retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement and ensure long-term compliance.",
    "PB-CT-0007": "On November 9, 2010, several same-sex couples and one widower, all legally married under the laws of Connecticut, Vermont, or New Hampshire, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut challenging Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 1 U.S.C. § 7. Section 3 defined “marriage” for all federal purposes as a union between one man and one woman and “spouse” as a husband or wife of the opposite sex. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that Section 3 of DOMA violated the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee by denying recognition and benefits to same-sex married couples that are afforded to opposite-sex married couples under federal law.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ claims involved denial of a variety of federal benefits and obligations, including: the ability to file joint federal income tax returns; eligibility for spousal health insurance under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; access to Family and Medical Leave Act spousal leave; Social Security survivor benefits; the right to claim spousal benefits under private and state pension plans governed by federal law; and tax status in connection with state retirement and Medicare insurance programs. The specific factual allegations included concrete denials of benefits, increased tax burdens, and adverse financial consequences suffered solely because their marriages were not recognized by the federal government due to DOMA.\n\nThe defendants were various federal agencies and officials responsible for the administration of those federal programs. The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) of the U.S. House of Representatives intervened to defend the constitutionality of DOMA after the Department of Justice declined to do so in February 2011, although the DOJ continued to enforce the law pending judicial resolution.\n\nAfter discovery, both sides moved for dispositive relief. On July 31, 2012, Judge Vanessa L. Bryant issued a memorandum of decision granting summary judgment for the plaintiffs and denying both BLAG’s and the federal government’s motions to dismiss. Judge Bryant held that Section 3 of DOMA violated the equal protection principles incorporated in the Fifth Amendment. Although the court concluded that classifications based on sexual orientation warranted heightened scrutiny, it found Section 3 unconstitutional even under the more deferential rational basis review, holding that no conceivable rational basis supported DOMA’s exclusion of same-sex couples from federal recognition.\n\nThe court ordered that DOMA’s definition could not be applied to deny federal recognition and benefits to the plaintiffs’ marriages. Judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs on August 2, 2012.\n\nBoth the federal government and BLAG filed notices of appeal to the Second Circuit. In addition, the plaintiffs and the government each petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari before judgment, highlighting the national importance of the constitutional question and the broad impact of DOMA on federal benefits for same-sex married couples. The Supreme Court ultimately considered the constitutionality of DOMA Section 3 in United States v. Windsor, which resolved the same issue.\n\nThroughout the litigation, the plaintiffs were represented by Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), private counsel, and law firm co-counsel. BLAG, representing the House of Representatives, was represented by Bancroft PLLC and the House Office of General Counsel. The federal defendants were represented by the Department of Justice. The case did not proceed to trial; all decisions were rendered on summary judgment. There were no class action allegations; the plaintiffs proceeded as individuals. No court-appointed monitor or special master was involved. There were no related or consolidated cases in the District of Connecticut, but the case was referenced in connection with other DOMA challenges nationwide.\n\nIn summary, Pedersen v. Office of Personnel Management challenged the constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA as applied to lawfully married same-sex couples, resulting in a district court judgment that the statute violated equal protection and could not be enforced to deny federal recognition or benefits to same-sex marriages recognized under state law. The case was appealed and became part of the national litigation culminating in the Supreme Court’s decision invalidating DOMA Section 3.",
    "PC-AL-0034": "On May 28, 2015, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against the State of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) alleging ongoing constitutional violations at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women. The case was brought following a DOJ investigation, conducted under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, which uncovered pervasive and longstanding staff-on-inmate sexual abuse and harassment at Tutwiler. The DOJ found that women prisoners at Tutwiler endured rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and lived in a sexualized, threatening environment, with staff routinely engaging in and allowing sexual misconduct. The DOJ concluded that the State displayed deliberate indifference to these conditions, violating the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe DOJ's investigation revealed that ADOC and Tutwiler officials had been aware of these problems for many years but failed to take effective action. Systemic deficiencies included inadequate policies, lack of staff training and supervision, absence of a grievance system, poor investigatory practices, retaliation against inmates who reported abuse, and dangerously low staffing levels. Prisoners were often compelled to submit to sexual advances to obtain basic necessities or to avoid punishment. The environment fostered underreporting of abuse and created significant barriers to inmate safety.\n\nOn the same day the complaint was filed, the parties submitted a joint motion for approval of a settlement agreement, which was entered as a consent decree by Judge Myron H. Thompson of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama on June 18, 2015. The consent decree was court-enforced and required the State to implement a broad range of remedial measures. These included compliance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), development and implementation of gender-responsive policies, establishment of confidential reporting and grievance mechanisms, adequate staffing (with a focus on recruiting female officers), staff training on PREA and gender-responsive practices, and ongoing monitoring and data collection to track progress and compliance.\n\nThe decree also established regular external monitoring. An independent monitor was appointed by joint agreement of the parties, and the court retained jurisdiction for enforcement. The monitor (initially Jennie Lancaster, later Kathleen Dennehy) conducted regular site visits, reviewed documents, interviewed staff and inmates, and issued detailed compliance reports assessing ADOC and Tutwiler’s adherence to the decree. These reports tracked progress, identified strengths, and outlined ongoing challenges, particularly relating to staffing shortages, physical plant limitations, and the need for sustained cultural change.\n\nRemedial steps were phased, with deadlines for policy development, training, and implementation. The settlement addressed not only sexual abuse and harassment but also broader issues of staff accountability, data management, classification and discipline systems, access to medical and mental health care, and accommodations for vulnerable populations including LGBTI inmates and those with limited English proficiency.\n\nThroughout the period of the consent decree, the court monitored compliance through regular status reports and hearings. The monitor’s reports documented significant improvements at Tutwiler, including new policies, enhanced training, creation of confidential reporting avenues, addition of cameras, and the launch of gender-responsive programming. However, challenges remained, particularly regarding persistent staffing shortages, facility overcrowding, and full implementation of gender-responsive classification and disciplinary systems.\n\nThe settlement agreement was court-enforced, with the court retaining jurisdiction for ongoing enforcement and dispute resolution. The State’s compliance was subject to review by the monitor and the court, and the case would remain open until the State demonstrated sustained, substantial compliance with all terms of the consent decree. The case is notable for its comprehensive approach to remedying systemic violations of women prisoners’ constitutional rights in a state prison setting, the collaborative resolution process, and the detailed, ongoing compliance monitoring framework.",
    "ED-MI-0001": "On November 8, 2006, several civil rights organizations, labor unions, students, and prospective students (“the plaintiffs”) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan challenging the constitutionality of Michigan’s Proposal 2, a voter-enacted amendment to the state constitution (now Mich. Const. art. I, § 26). Proposal 2, approved by 58% of Michigan voters, prohibited public colleges and universities, as well as other public bodies, from granting “preferential treatment” or discriminating on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public education, employment, or contracting. The plaintiffs, represented by private and nonprofit counsel (including Scheff & Washington, P.C., the ACLU, and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund), named as defendants the Governor of Michigan (in her official capacity), the governing boards of the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Wayne State University, and other public educational institutions.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that Proposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by restructuring the political process in a way that imposed special burdens on racial and gender minorities seeking race- or gender-conscious admissions policies. They also argued that Proposal 2 was preempted by federal civil rights statutes and violated First Amendment rights of the universities. The core factual basis for the claims was that, before Proposal 2, Michigan’s public universities could consider race as one factor in admissions, as upheld by the Supreme Court in Grutter v. Bollinger (2003). Proposal 2, however, removed the ability of university boards to adopt such policies, requiring any change to be made only through a statewide constitutional amendment, a process substantially more onerous than the ordinary political process available for other admissions criteria.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge David M. Lawson. Early in the proceedings, the University defendants filed cross-claims and sought guidance on how to comply with the new amendment. The Michigan Attorney General intervened as a defendant to defend the constitutionality of Proposal 2. Additional parties and amici, including advocacy groups opposed to affirmative action and prospective students, attempted to intervene or participate.\n\nIn March 2008, after extensive briefing and discovery, Judge Lawson granted summary judgment for the defendants, holding that Proposal 2 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, and dismissed all claims. The court concluded that the law did not impose an unconstitutional political restructuring under Hunter v. Erickson and Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, reasoning that the amendment did not burden the right to “equal treatment” but rather restricted what the court characterized as “preferential treatment.”\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed. In July 2011, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the district court, holding that Proposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause by restructuring the political process in a way that placed special burdens on minorities seeking to advocate for race-conscious admissions policies, thereby contravening Supreme Court precedent. The Sixth Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed the panel’s decision in November 2012, ordering summary judgment for the plaintiffs.\n\nThe Michigan Attorney General petitioned for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Sixth Circuit stayed issuance of its mandate pending Supreme Court review. On April 22, 2014, the Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, 572 U.S. 291 (2014). The plurality opinion (Justice Kennedy) held that there was no authority in the U.S. Constitution or Supreme Court precedent for the federal courts to set aside a law that committed to voters the decision whether racial preferences may be considered in governmental decisions, including school admissions. The Court distinguished earlier political-process equal protection cases, finding that Michigan’s amendment was not enacted to inflict specific injury on a racial minority and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court’s judgment reinstated Michigan’s constitutional ban on race-based preferences in public university admissions.\n\n**Key Information Checklist:**\n- **Filing Date:** November 8, 2006\n- **Parties:** Plaintiffs: civil rights organizations, labor unions, students, prospective students; Defendants: Michigan Governor (official capacity), University of Michigan Regents, Michigan State University Board of Trustees, Wayne State University Board of Governors, other public educational institutions.\n- **Type of Plaintiffs:** Organizational and individual (not a class action per se; motions for class certification denied as moot)\n- **Type of Counsel:** Private and nonprofit (Scheff & Washington, ACLU, NAACP Legal Defense Fund)\n- **Cause of Action:** 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Equal Protection Clause (Fourteenth Amendment); other federal statutes\n- **Statutory/Constitutional Basis:** Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause; Title VI and Title IX of the Civil Rights Act; First Amendment\n- **Remedy Sought:** Declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of Proposal 2\n- **Judge:** District Judge David M.

    "DR-CA-0033": "On August 22, 2005, Maurizio Antoninetti, a wheelchair user, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and related California statutes arising from his experiences at two newly constructed Chipotle restaurants in San Diego and Encinitas, California. Antoninetti, represented by private counsel, claimed that architectural barriers—including a 45-inch-high wall separating the customer line from the food preparation area—prevented individuals in wheelchairs from viewing the food on display and the preparation process, thereby denying them the “Chipotle experience” and full and equal enjoyment of the restaurant’s goods and services as required by the ADA.\n\nDuring discovery and at trial, it was established that, although Chipotle had an unwritten policy to accommodate customers with disabilities, such as offering to show food samples or describing ingredients, Antoninetti and other wheelchair users could not independently see the food or watch the preparation as standing customers could. In February 2007, after the lawsuit was filed and during the course of litigation, Chipotle adopted a written “Customers with Disabilities Policy,” formalizing its accommodation practices.\n\nAfter a bench trial before Judge Napoleon A. Jones, Jr., the district court found that Chipotle’s pre-litigation unwritten policy did not provide equivalent facilitation under the ADA, but that its written policy did comply with the Act. The court awarded Antoninetti $5,000 in statutory damages under the California Disabled Persons Act (CDPA) for five “bona fide” visits to the restaurants as a customer, denied damages for three “litigation-related” visits, and denied injunctive relief. The court also awarded Antoninetti a reduced amount of attorneys’ fees, reflecting what it characterized as his limited success.\n\nAntoninetti appealed, and Chipotle cross-appealed. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed in part, holding that Chipotle’s written policy did not provide “equivalent facilitation” as mandated by ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) § 7.2(2)(iii), because it did not afford substantially equivalent access to the food preparation area as enjoyed by non-disabled customers. The appellate court held that the ADA required wheelchair users to have an experience comparable to that of other customers and that mere staff assistance or alternative methods were insufficient if the physical design itself remained inaccessible. The Ninth Circuit remanded with instructions to enter judgment for Antoninetti on the ADA claims, to craft appropriate injunctive relief to remedy the architectural barrier, and to reconsider the damages and attorney’s fee awards in light of Antoninetti’s greater success.\n\nOn remand, the district court entered judgment for Antoninetti, but declined to award injunctive relief because Antoninetti had died and his estate lacked standing for prospective relief. The court reaffirmed the $5,000 damages award for five customer visits, denied damages for the litigation-related visits, and ultimately awarded more than $545,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs to Antoninetti’s counsel, reflecting the protracted and complex nature of the litigation, the significance of the ADA violation, and the public benefit achieved by the ruling.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, Chipotle was represented by private counsel, and Antoninetti by Amy B. Vandeveld and others. The case was presided over at the district court by Judge Napoleon A. Jones, Jr., and then Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz on remand; on appeal, the principal opinion was authored by Judge Daniel M. Friedman of the Ninth Circuit. The litigation resulted in a published Ninth Circuit opinion (643 F.3d 1165), which clarified the responsibilities of public accommodations under the ADA for newly constructed facilities, emphasizing that written or unwritten policies are not a substitute for physical accessibility. The court’s orders and judgments also resolved issues regarding prevailing party status, fee awards, and the appropriate calculation of damages under California law. The case is now closed, with a final amended judgment entered in favor of Antoninetti’s estate and against Chipotle for both damages and attorneys’ fees and costs.",
    "CJ-FL-0009": "On June 28, 2019, a group of individuals with prior felony convictions, along with several civil rights organizations, filed federal lawsuits in the Northern District of Florida against the State of Florida, the Secretary of State, the Governor, and several county Supervisors of Elections. The plaintiffs challenged Florida’s implementation of Amendment 4, a 2018 constitutional amendment that restored voting rights to individuals with felony convictions (excluding those convicted of murder or felony sexual offenses) upon “completion of all terms of sentence including parole or probation.” The lawsuits were filed as class actions, with the plaintiffs represented by counsel from the American Civil Liberties Union, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Campaign Legal Center, Southern Poverty Law Center, and private attorneys.\n\nAfter Amendment 4 was passed, the Florida Legislature enacted Senate Bill 7066 (SB 7066), defining “all terms of sentence” to include full payment of all court-ordered fines, fees, costs, and restitution—collectively known as legal financial obligations (LFOs)—even if they had been converted to civil liens. The plaintiffs alleged that conditioning restoration of voting rights on payment of LFOs violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Twenty-Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on poll taxes. They also challenged the administration of the law as unconstitutionally vague and sought relief under the National Voter Registration Act.\n\nJudge Robert L. Hinkle presided over the consolidated cases. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief allowing otherwise eligible citizens to vote without regard to unpaid LFOs or, at a minimum, if they were genuinely unable to pay. Early in the litigation, the district court issued a preliminary injunction, later affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit (Jones v. Governor of Florida, 950 F.3d 795), holding that Florida could not deny the right to vote to individuals genuinely unable to pay their LFOs.\n\nAfter an eight-day bench trial, Judge Hinkle issued a May 2020 order finding that the overwhelming majority of affected felons were indigent, that Florida’s system for determining and collecting LFOs was administratively unworkable, and that many individuals could not determine the amounts owed. The court held that the pay-to-vote system violated the Fourteenth Amendment as applied to those unable to pay, the Due Process Clause (due to lack of notice and procedures), and the Twenty-Fourth Amendment with respect to fees and costs constituting taxes. The court certified both a class and subclass and issued a permanent injunction requiring the State to implement an advisory opinion process for individuals uncertain about their LFO status, and to allow voting for those unable to pay or whose LFOs could not be determined.\n\nOn appeal, the Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed the district court. The appellate court held that the requirement to pay outstanding LFOs before regaining voting rights did not violate the Constitution, applying rational basis review and concluding that the system was rationally related to Florida’s interests in punishment and rehabilitation. The court rejected heightened scrutiny under Griffin and Bearden, held that the Twenty-Fourth Amendment was not violated because the fees and costs were not “taxes” under its definition, and found no denial of due process or unconstitutional vagueness in the procedures. The court vacated the injunction, thus upholding Florida’s LFO payment requirement for voting rights restoration. The Supreme Court denied an application to vacate the stay, leaving the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in place.\n\nThe litigation arose from a context in which over a million Floridians with past felony convictions stood to regain voting rights, but the inclusion of LFO payment as a prerequisite was found by the district court to exclude the vast majority due to indigency and administrative barriers. The case involved significant filings: multiple complaints, class certification, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and appeals. A class was certified for those otherwise eligible to vote but for unpaid LFOs, and a subclass for those unable to pay. No settlement or monitor was involved. The case concluded with the Eleventh Circuit’s September 2020 opinion reversing the district court and vacating the injunction, effectively reinstating Florida’s pay-to-vote system for individuals with past felony convictions.",
    "CW-CA-0005": "On July 18, 2002, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of children in California’s foster care system, or at imminent risk of foster care placement, who have a mental illness or condition necessitating individualized mental health services. The case was brought against the directors of the California Department of Health Services and the Department of Social Services, as well as Los Angeles County and related officials, by a group of children represented by their next friends. Plaintiffs were represented by a coalition of private counsel, legal services organizations, and public interest groups, including the ACLU, Western Center on Law and Poverty, and Protection & Advocacy, Inc.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the State and County failed to provide legally mandated mental health, behavioral support, and case management services to children in foster care or at risk of entering it. The complaint asserted violations of the Medicaid Act’s Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions (42 U.S.C. § 1396a et seq.), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Due Process Clauses of the United States and California Constitutions, and California Government Code § 11135. The requested remedies included declaratory and injunctive relief to require the provision of necessary services.\n\nOn June 18, 2003, the court certified a statewide class defined as children in California who (a) are in foster care or at imminent risk of foster care placement, (b) have a documented or documentable mental illness or condition, and (c) need individualized mental health services in the home or a home-like setting. A subclass comprised children with more intensive needs, such as those placed in or at risk of group homes, psychiatric hospitals, or multiple failed placements.\n\nThe Los Angeles County defendants entered into a court-approved settlement (the \"County Settlement\") in July 2003, which required systemic reforms overseen by an advisory panel and subject to ongoing court jurisdiction. The statewide claims against the State defendants continued, with the district court issuing a preliminary injunction in 2006 requiring California to provide intensive, community-based mental health services—such as wraparound services and therapeutic foster care—as medically necessary, under the Medicaid EPSDT mandate. The Ninth Circuit reversed the preliminary injunction in 2007, holding that while the State must provide all EPSDT-mandated component services, it was not required to provide them as a bundled \"program\" unless necessary for effective delivery.\n\nAfter extensive negotiations facilitated by a Special Master, the parties reached a class-wide settlement in 2011. The settlement agreement, preliminarily approved in September 2011 and finally approved on December 5, 2011, required California to:\n\n- Develop and implement a \"Core Practice Model\" for the delivery of coordinated, comprehensive mental health services to class members.\n- Ensure the availability of Intensive Care Coordination (ICC), Intensive Home-Based Services (IHBS), and Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC) for children with intensive needs, statewide, as medically necessary under Medi-Cal.\n- Amend the Medi-Cal State Plan and provider documentation to cover the necessary services.\n- Establish shared management and quality oversight structures between the state agencies responsible for health and child welfare.\n- Monitor compliance through a Special Master, an Advisory Panel, regular reports, data collection, and outcome evaluation.\n\nThe settlement was court-enforced, with jurisdiction set for 36 months, during which the Special Master and Advisory Panel regularly reported to the court on implementation. The court retained authority to enforce the agreement, resolve disputes, and award attorney’s fees (ultimately approved at $3.75 million).\n\nWith the expiration of court jurisdiction in December 2014, the parties agreed to maintain communication and continue implementation and monitoring. Subsequent reports by the Advisory Panel have documented ongoing progress and challenges, including improvements in staffing, team-based planning, and service delivery, but also persistent difficulties in consistently providing timely, intensive, individualized mental health services, ensuring placement stability, and achieving high-quality practice across the system.\n\nAs of the latest reports, the Advisory Panel has commended progress in some areas but has noted that many class members still do not receive the level of mental health services required under the settlement and federal law. The panel has continued to make recommendations for further improvements in service responsiveness and data collection. Court oversight has formally ended, but the parties, state agencies, and counties continue to be guided by the terms of the settlement and ongoing monitoring by the Advisory Panel.",
    "PC-VA-0022": "On December 19, 2014, a Virginia prison inmate filed a civil rights action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, challenging the Virginia Department of Corrections’ (VDOC) policies and practices regarding long-term solitary confinement, specifically at Red Onion State Prison. The case was brought by an individual prisoner, proceeding pro se, against the VDOC and a range of supervisory officials and prison staff, including the VDOC Director and Red Onion’s wardens and managers. The inmate was later represented by pro bono counsel on appeal. The defendants were represented by the Office of the Attorney General of Virginia. The claims were not brought as a class action.\n\nThe plaintiff alleged that, following a 2009 incident involving a non-fatal stabbing of a guard, he was placed in solitary confinement—known as administrative segregation—where he remained for over eight years, with expectations of continued segregation for the remainder of his sentence, ending in 2040. He challenged VDOC’s administrative classification and review procedures under Operating Procedure (OP) 830.A, which governs the “Step-Down Program” for prisoners in segregation.\n\nThe plaintiff, classified as “Intensive Management” (IM) rather than “Special Management” (SM), argued that IM prisoners are permanently ineligible for the Step-Down Program that allows for return to the general population, regardless of their current behavior or risk. He claimed this resulted in indefinite, harsh solitary confinement without meaningful opportunity for release, in violation of his rights under the Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual punishment) and the Fourteenth Amendment (procedural due process). He sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nThe action was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The constitutional bases of the claims were the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment and the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of procedural due process.\n\nThe matter was assigned to Judge James P. Jones, with pretrial matters handled by Magistrate Judge Robert S. Ballou. No related or consolidated cases were noted in the record.\n\nKey filings included motions to dismiss (under Rule 12(b)(6)), which were denied, and motions for summary judgment filed by the defendants, which the court ordered prior to the close of discovery. The plaintiff’s requests for class certification and appointment of counsel were denied. Discovery disputes arose regarding interrogatories, but the court granted the defendants’ request to delay responses until after the motion to dismiss was resolved.\n\nOn September 28, 2016, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants and dismissed the VDOC as a defendant. The court found that, although the plaintiff’s segregation was lengthy and restrictive, VDOC’s policy provided for periodic review and the opportunity for improved conditions based on behavior—thus, it did not implicate a protected liberty interest or amount to cruel and unusual punishment. The court ruled that the Step-Down Program offered a pathway to less restrictive conditions, and that the plaintiff had not demonstrated the deprivation of a basic human need, or deliberate indifference by prison officials.\n\nThe plaintiff, now represented by pro bono counsel, appealed to the Fourth Circuit (No. 16-7358), arguing that summary judgment was premature and that genuine disputes of material fact existed as to both his procedural due process and Eighth Amendment claims. Amici briefs from correctional and mental health experts supported the plaintiff, emphasizing the psychological and physical harms of prolonged solitary confinement and the lack of meaningful review under VDOC’s system.\n\nOn November 22, 2017, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment in an unpublished per curiam opinion. The appellate court adopted the district court’s reasoning, holding that there was no reversible error in the grant of summary judgment to the defendants.\n\n**Judge Information:**  \n- District Judge: James P.

    "CJ-MD-0001": "On January 19, 2006, a death-sentenced Maryland prisoner filed suit in federal district court seeking to enjoin his execution by lethal injection under the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services’ existing protocols. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel and legal services organizations, challenged the state’s lethal injection procedures under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the Department’s practices violated his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by creating a substantial risk of unnecessary pain and suffering. The plaintiff did not contest the fact of his death sentence or the constitutionality of lethal injection per se, but argued that the State’s specific practices—such as the three-drug cocktail, lack of qualified personnel, and inadequate procedural safeguards—posed an unconstitutional risk of a torturous execution. He sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting execution using the existing protocol, as well as other equitable relief.\n\nThe federal district court case named as defendants the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, the Commissioner of the Division of Correction, the wardens of the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center and the Metropolitan Transition Center, and unknown individuals involved in executions. The State was represented by the Maryland Attorney General’s office.\n\nThe plaintiff’s claims relied on 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as the cause of action, and were grounded in the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment. He alleged that the protocol’s use of sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride, together with inadequate staff training and execution procedures, risked that prisoners would remain conscious and suffer excruciating pain during execution. He further argued that the protocol was not adopted in compliance with Maryland’s Administrative Procedure Act, and that its practices were inconsistent with Maryland law governing executions. The plaintiff sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, and attorneys’ fees.\n\nAfter expedited proceedings—including a hearing on requests for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction—Judge Benson Everett Legg denied the request for preliminary relief, finding that the plaintiff had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits or a substantial risk of unconstitutional pain. The court noted that the protocol, if properly administered, would result in a swift and humane death, and that the plaintiff had not demonstrated a compelling constitutional deficiency in the protocol as applied. The court also found that the plaintiff had sufficiently exhausted administrative remedies or that further exhaustion would be futile given the timing of the execution.\n\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Fourth Circuit, which denied his emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal. The appeal was later dismissed at the plaintiff’s request after the Maryland Court of Appeals stayed the execution to resolve related state law challenges.\n\nIn parallel, the plaintiff and advocacy organizations pursued state court litigation challenging the protocol under state law and the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act. In December 2006, the Maryland Court of Appeals held that the lethal injection protocol constituted a regulation under state law and was therefore invalid until properly adopted in accordance with the state Administrative Procedure Act. The court enjoined executions under the old protocol until compliance, but rejected the plaintiff’s other constitutional and statutory challenges.\n\nAs a result of the Court of Appeals’ ruling, Maryland executions were suspended. The parties in the federal suit agreed to stay the case during ongoing legislative and administrative developments. Status reports were filed for several years, reflecting that Maryland had not adopted a new, valid execution protocol. In 2012, the parties requested and the court ordered the case administratively closed, with leave to reopen for good cause.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, no trial was held, and the federal court did not issue any decree or substantive order requiring the State to change its execution protocol. The case was ultimately mooted by the state court’s action and legislative developments. The litigation’s main effect was to contribute to the judicial review and administrative suspension of Maryland’s prior lethal injection protocol, and to place executions on hold until a valid protocol could be adopted—a development that never occurred before Maryland abolished the death penalty in 2013.\n\n**Checklist Items:**  \n- **Filing Date:** January 19, 2006 (federal court)\n- **Parties:** The plaintiff was a Maryland death-sentenced prisoner; defendants were the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, the Commissioner of Correction, two wardens, and unknown execution team members (all sued in their official capacities).\n- **Individual Plaintiffs:** The case involved an individual plaintiff, not a class.\n- **Type of Counsel:** Plaintiff was represented by private counsel and legal services.\n- **Cause of Action:** 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n- **Statutory/Constitutional Basis:** Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution\n- **Remedy Sought:** Declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees\n- **Judge:** Chief Judge Benson Everett Legg (District of Maryland)\n- **Consolidated/Related Cases:** Related state court challenge (Evans v. State, 396 Md. 256 (2006)); no federal consolidation\n- **Important Filings:** Motions for TRO and preliminary injunction, motion to dismiss, motions to stay, status reports\n- **Court Rulings:** Preliminary injunction denied; motion to dismiss denied after exhaustion; case stayed and administratively closed\n- **All Reported Opinions:** 412 F. Supp. 2d 519 (D. Md. 2006); 396 Md. 256 (2006)\n- **Trials:** No trial was held; evidentiary hearings on preliminary relief\n- **Appeals:** Fourth Circuit appeal dismissed\n- **Decrees:** No decree issued by federal court; state court enjoined executions under the old protocol\n- **Settlements:** No settlement; court-ordered stay and administrative closure\n- **Monitoring:** Not applicable after closure\n- **Factual Basis:** The challenge was based on the risk of pain and suffering from the administration of lethal injection under Maryland’s three-drug protocol and on the lack of medical safeguards and trained staff, as well as the protocol’s lack of compliance with state administrative law.\n- **Duration:** Case filed January 2006; administratively closed August 2012; Maryland death penalty repealed 2013.",
    "CW-DC-0001": "This case, filed on June 20, 1989, is a class action civil rights lawsuit brought on behalf of children in the legal or physical custody of the District of Columbia’s child welfare system, as well as children at risk of abuse or neglect known to the District’s Department of Human Services. The case was initiated by individual children, through their next friends, on behalf of a class estimated at thousands of children subject to or at risk of foster care placement. The primary defendants were the Mayor of the District of Columbia and senior officials responsible for the child welfare system, all sued in their official capacities.\n\nPlaintiffs, represented by private counsel from Children’s Rights and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), alleged systematic failures by the District's child welfare agencies in providing required services and protections. The claims were based on 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of federal statutes (notably the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act), District of Columbia statutes (including the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act of 1977 and the Youth Residential Facilities Licensure Act of 1986), and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy ongoing violations, including failures to investigate reports of abuse/neglect, provide services to avoid family separation, ensure timely and appropriate foster and adoptive placements, develop written case plans, and provide adequate oversight.\n\nFollowing a bench trial in early 1991, Judge Thomas F. Hogan found the District in widespread violation of federal and local law, as well as the Constitution for children in its custody, and issued a detailed memorandum opinion. The court found that the child welfare system was plagued by excessive staff shortages, high caseloads, failure to investigate reports of abuse and neglect in a timely manner, failure to provide preventive and reunification services, inappropriate and unstable placements for children, lack of timely permanency planning, and systemic management deficiencies. The court held the District liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and ordered comprehensive injunctive relief.\n\nA remedial order was entered with the agreement of the parties in August 1991, and the court certified the case as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2). The consent judgment established specific requirements for the District's child welfare system, including timelines and standards for investigations, services, placements, permanency planning, and reviews. The court appointed the Center for the Study of Social Policy as monitor to oversee compliance and report to the court.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the District was found repeatedly to be in noncompliance with the consent judgment and subsequent implementation plans. After persistent failures, the court imposed a limited receivership in 1994, followed by a full receivership in 1995. The court-appointed receiver and monitor exercised broad authority to implement reforms. Various progress reports, implementation plans, and corrective action plans were developed, tracking the District's compliance and management of the system.\n\nThe case underwent several appeals, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upholding the District's obligation to comply with the local law-based remedial orders and confirming the district court's authority to enforce consent decrees. The court clarified that even in the absence of ongoing federal law violations, the consent decree could be enforced on the basis of local statute.\n\nAfter years of court oversight, the receivership ended in 2001 and was replaced by a probationary period, then by a series of court-approved implementation plans (2003, 2007, 2010), which set out detailed outcome measures, performance benchmarks, and monitoring requirements covering all aspects of child protection and foster care. The court retained jurisdiction, and the monitor continued to file regular reports on the District's progress, with further consent orders specifying corrective actions, sanctions for noncompliance, and attorneys’ fee settlements.\n\nDespite significant progress, the District was found in contempt in 2010 for failing to comply with certain requirements. The court imposed compensatory remedies and required further detailed implementation and exit plans. In 2019, after mediation and negotiation, the parties jointly submitted an Exit and Sustainability Plan, approved by the court, which replaced the prior Implementation and Exit Plan. The Exit and Sustainability Plan removed from court monitoring those standards that the District had met and maintained, and established a process and commitments for the District to achieve the remaining outcomes, with continued monitoring and public reporting. The plan provides for eventual termination of court supervision upon demonstration of sustained compliance.\n\nThroughout the case, the court has periodically awarded attorneys’ fees and costs to plaintiffs’ counsel by consent, and the monitor has played a central role in tracking compliance, reporting data, and facilitating improvements in the District’s child welfare system. As of the last filings, the case remains under court jurisdiction, with the Exit and Sustainability Plan guiding the final steps toward full compliance and exit from court oversight."
