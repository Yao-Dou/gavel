    "summary/long": "This case challenges the carcinogenic chloroprene emissions from Denka Performance Elastomer, LLC’s (Denka’s) neoprene manufacturing facility at the Pontchartrain Works Site in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, as being unacceptably high under EPA regulations. Denka's facility produced neoprene, a synthetic rubber, emitting chloroprene—a chemical classified by the EPA in 2010 as likely carcinogenic to humans. Air monitoring near the facility reportedly detected chloroprene concentrations up to 14 times the EPA's recommended levels, posing a risk to the majority-Black population surrounding the facility.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the United States government filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Plaintiff sued Denka Performance Elastomer LLC, the owner and operator of a neoprene manufacturing facility, and DuPont Specialty Products, the owner of the land on which the neoprene manufacturing facility was located and leased to Defendant Denka. Plaintiff sued Defendant Denka under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7603, alleging that Defendant Denka's chloroprene emissions from its neoprene manufacturing facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, posed an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health across communities in St. John the Baptist Parish. ​Plaintiff sued Defendant DuPont under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, as Defendant Denka may need permission or cooperation from Defendant DuPont to take the necessary actions to abate the imminent and substantial endangerment posed by its current chloroprene emissions.\n\nPlaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring that Defendant Denka immediately reduce its chloroprene emissions to levels that no longer cause or contribute to unacceptably high cancer risks within the communities surrounding the facility. Plaintiff also sought an injunctive relief ordering Defendant DuPont to authorize and not impede construction and necessary measures for Defendant Denka to comply with the court’s order.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Eldon E. Fallon and Magistrate Judge Michael North. The case was later reassigned to Judge Carl J Barbier.\n\nOn March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting the court to order Defendant Denka to implement significant pollution controls to reduce chloroprene emissions promptly. The motion emphasized the urgency of protecting the health of the local community. ​\n\nIn response, Defendant Denka filed a counterclaim against the Plaintiff. Defendant Denka argued that the Plaintiff’s issuance and application of its 2010 rule, which set the acceptable limits of chloroprene, was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with the law” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), because the rule makers failed to consider and ignored the best available scientific data, as well as new scientific models, despite concerns raised by qualified peer reviewers. Defendants sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief enjoining Plaintiff from using the 2010 rule until it reconsidered the rule in light of the new evidence.\n\nOn May 2, 2023, Defendant DuPont filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Defendant DuPont argued that it was not involved in any of the alleged harmful activity, nor had Plaintiff identified any actual or immediate current harm that would occur if Defendant DuPont were not included as a Party in this action. The court denied this motion.\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Defendant Denka's counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, Plaintiff argued that Defendant Denka's challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) actions were time-barred and that certain EPA decisions were committed to agency discretion, thus not subject to judicial review. This motion was deemed deficient, and Plaintiff filed this motion again on May 8. It was deemed deficient again. On May 9, Plaintiff filed a third motion to dismiss with the same reasoning as the first. On August 30, 2023, the court granted this motion.\n\nOn October 25, 2023, Defendant Denka filed an amended counterclaim. It was deemed deficient, and Defendant Denka refiled on November 3, 2023. This new counterclaim added new additional allegations and facts about how Plaintiff had disregarded substantial scientific evidence that adopting the 2010 standard as a bright-line rule was not necessary to protect human health or the environment. Shortly after, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the amended counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe following month, Defendant Denka filed a motion for summary judgment on December 29. In its motion, Defendant emphasized that its chloroprene emissions posed a cancer risk of 5-in-10,000 to a person who breathed in these emissions all day, every day for 70 years. Defendant argued that this risk did not amount to an “imminent and substantial endangerment” warranting the chloroprene emission limitations imposed by the 2010 rule.\n\nThe same day, Defendant DuPont filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court denied the motion in July 2024, as Defendant offered no new grounds to warrant its dismissal from the case beyond those already denied by the Defendant’s motion to dismiss.\n\nOn May 16, 2024, the EPA published a new rule titled “New Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I & II Polymers and Resins Industry” (89 Fed. Reg. 42932). This rule updated and amended existing standards to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants, including chloroprene emissions, from manufacturing facilities. Specifically, the new rule imposed stricter emission standards on facilities that produce or use chloroprene, requiring the application of advanced control technologies to minimize emissions.\n\nThe same day, Defendant Denka filed a petition for review of the new rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that this new rule was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law (docket no. 24-01135).\n\nOn May 31, the Parties attended a status conference to discuss how the new rule would affect the ongoing litigation, and Defendant Denka proposed to hold the case in abeyance until October 15, to determine whether the new rule would render the current litigation moot. The Parties filed status reports throughout the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, on June 11, several nonprofits (including the Concerned Citizens of St. John, Rise St. James Louisiana, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, Air Alliance Houston, California Communities Against Toxics, Environmental Defense Fund, Environment Integrity Project, and Sierra Club) filed a motion to intervene in the petition for review of the new EPA rule. This action was granted the following day.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the petition for review was consolidated with another petition for review (docket no. 24-1228). The following week, the court consolidated more cases (24-1249, 24-1250, 24-1251, 24-1252) with 24-1135.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case. Plaintiff argued that until Defendant Denka complied with the new rule, thousands of Parish residents would continue to be exposed to high levels of chloroprene emissions, exposing them to a higher risk of cancer. Plaintiff further sought a status hearing and to reset the case for trial.\n\nThe court granted in part the motion to reopen the case. The Parties attended a status conference on November 21 to discuss the future of the case.\n\nOn January 10, 2025 granted the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and dismissed the counterclaim with prejudice.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case. The Trump administration stated that this decision aligned with efforts to dismantle \"radical Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs\" and ensure unbiased law enforcement (Justice Dept. says ending Louisiana petrochemical case helps ‘dismantle radical DEI programs’ [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apnews.com/article/trump-louisiana-cancer-denka-chloroprene-epa-lawsuit-89b1f870816f65370eeb75ff269e9c0e&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1743371953208062&usg=AOvVaw347nD5ij_RdIBBz8L0b3GS]). The case was officially dismissed on March 10.\n\nThis case is now closed.",

    "summary/long": "This is a challenge to the second Trump administration's purported firing of Hampton Dellinger, the head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), communicated through a one-sentence email that made no attempt to comply with the for-cause removal requirement. (To see the Clearinghouse's collection of civil-service-related legal challenges to actions by the second Trump administration, click here [../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&special_collection=38759&issue_presidential_gubernatorial_authority=38822&ordering=-summary_approved_date].)\n\nOn February 10, 2025, Dellinger filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald J. Trump, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, the Acting Special Counsel of the OSC, the Chief Operating Officer of the OSC, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Plaintiff was represented by Hecker Fink LLP. Dellinger was appointed by President Joe Biden to a five-year term leading OSC, confirmed by the Senate in March 2024. Under federal statute, he could only be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. On the night of February 7, 2025, Defendants purported to fire Plaintiff from his position in a one-sentence email that made no attempt to comply with the for-cause removal requirement. Plaintiff alleged Defendants' actions violated the Separation of Powers, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Declaratory Judgment Act. Plaintiff requested declaratory judgments, injunctive relief, and all wages and benefits owed to him.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who held a hearing on February 10, 2025. After that hearing, she ordered briefing by the following day, and issued an administrative stay requiring that Dellinger continue to be the Special Counsel through midnight on February 13, 2025, with access to the \"resources or materials of that office.\" The government immediately appealed and sought an emergency stay of the district court order; the appeal was docketed as 25-5025. In its briefing, the government told the Court of Appeals that the President named Doug Collins (the Secretary of Veterans Affairs) as Acting Special Counsel on February 10, 2025. It argued that the district court’s order was \"thus irreparably harming the President by preventing him from installing his preferred designee as the acting head of an Executive Branch agency headed by a single individual.\" The Court of Appeals denied the stay, and dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction on February 12, 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, in the district court, Judge Jackson issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on February 12, 2025. She noted that the government had not complied with the administrative stay and renewed the order that Dellinger be restored to his Special Counsel role until the court ruled on the request for a preliminary injunction. A hearing was set for February 26, 2025. Defendants again moved for a stay while they appealed; the district court, on February 13, 2025, again rejected the stay, noting its view that the order was non-appealable. On Saturday, February 15, 2025, the Court of Appeals denied a stay and agreed with the district court that the TRO was non-appealable. It issued a full opinion on the matter. Judge Katsas dissented, taking the position that the TRO was appealable and incorrect. The government had requested an expedited ruling from the Court of Appeals so that the Acting Solicitor General “has the opportunity to seek expeditious review from the Supreme Court if this Court denies relief.”\n\nThe next day, February 16, 2025, the government asked the Supreme Court of the United States to vacate the district court order or to issue an administrative stay. On February 21, the Court declined to do so, instead holding the application \"in abeyance\" until February 26, the day the TRO was set to expire. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson noted on the record that they would deny a stay. Justice Gorsuch (joined by Justice Alito) dissented, explaining his view that an equitable order could not direct the appointment or removal of an executive official.\n\nDuring this time, on February 21, 2025, the government filed a motion for summary judgment in the district court. Dellinger filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on February 24.\n\nOn February 26, 2025, in the district court, Judge Jackson extended the TRO through Saturday, March 1, 2025. Then, on March 1, Judge Jackson found for Dellinger, granting summary judgment in his favor and entering a permanent injunction. She wrote:\n\nIn short, the question presented in this case is whether it is an unconstitutional intrusion on the President’s Article II powers to say that he may remove the Special Counsel for reasons related to his performance, but he cannot do it on a whim or out of personal animus.  It is an extremely narrow question with little or no precedential value given the sui generis nature of the Office of Special Counsel, and the fact that there is no longer any other agency with a single head, protected by similar restrictions, in the executive branch.\n\nThe Court finds that the statute is not unconstitutional.  And it finds that the elimination of the restrictions on plaintiff’s removal would be fatal to the defining and essential feature of the Office of Special Counsel as it was conceived by Congress and signed into law by the President:  its independence.  The Court concludes that they must stand.\n\nThe government immediately filed an appeal and sought a stay pending appeal on March 1, 2025. District Judge Jackson denied the motion to stay on March 3, 2025, but on March 5, the Court of Appeals granted a stay pending full briefing (to be completed mid-April). Their opinion was filed on March 10. However, on March 12, the appellate court ordered that the briefing schedule be suspended.\n\nAccording to press reports [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/hampton-dellinger-firing.html] and a letter filed with the Court of Appeals, Dellinger gave up his lawsuit the day after their decision (on March 6, 2025). The defendants responded, asserting that the appeal is \"not moot\" and will become moot \"only if and when the permanent injunction from which it arises is dissolved and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\" Dellinger filed his motion to dismiss the case as moot, with all parties to bear their own costs, on March 7. The motion included, \"Counsel for Dellinger has conferred with counsel for defendants and is authorized to state that defendants oppose this motion.\"\n\nOn March 27, 2025, the Court of Appeals responded with an order (1) granting Dellinger's March 7 motion to dismiss the appeal as moot, (2) granting the request to vacate the district court’s March 1, 2025 memorandum opinion and order, (3) remanding the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case with prejudice, and (4) denying the request to vacate the appellate court’s March 5, 2025 order and March 10, 2025 opinion included in the reply.\n\nA few days later, on March 31, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\nThe case is closed.",

    "summary/long": "This case is about citizens of South Carolina challenging the constitutionality of election district apportionment, redistricting, and gerrymandering in their state. On October 12, 2021, the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP and a private plaintiff, represented by the ACLU and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. The defendants in the case were South Carolina's Governor, state legislators, and the members of the South Carolina State Election Commission. The complaint alleged that the state's then-current congressional and legislative redistricting maps and the state's handling of their redistricting process violated the Constitution. First, the plaintiffs alleged that population shifts had caused the state's congressional and legislative redistricting plans to become malapportioned in violation of the one person, one vote constitutional principle under Article I, Section 2 and the 14th Amendment, which would  infringe on the plaintiffs' 1st and 14th Amendment rights to participate equally in the political process. Second, the plaintiffs asserted that the legislature’s decision to delay the commencement of their redistricting process until early 2022 was violating the plaintiffs' Freedom of Association because the uncertainty over new district boundaries would hurt candidates' ability to effectively run for office and restrict voters’ ability to choose candidates. They also asserted the state's shortened time period for redistricting effectively would preclude sufficient time for public input or judicial review sufficiently in advance of the elections. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that South Carolina's current congressional and legislative plans were unconstitutional; an injunction preventing the defendants from using the old plans in any future elections; an order establishing a schedule by which the State—or the court if they fail—must enact new, lawful congressional and legislative redistricting plans; and an order staying the primary candidate filing and qualification deadlines pending the implementation of lawful new districts.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge J. Michelle Childs, but the plaintiffs requested a three-judge panel under 28 U.S.C. §2284 on October 15, 2021, which the court granted on December 9. The court noted that numerous three-judge courts have adjudicated challenges to district lines and been affirmed by the Supreme Court. 2021 WL 5853172. On December 16, the Chief Judge for the Fourth Circuit appointed Circuit Judge Toby J. Heytens and District Judge Richard M. Gergel to preside with Judge Childs. The defendants moved to disqualify Judge Gergel on January 6, and he declined to recuse himself on January 10. 2022 WL 2374229. The defendants moved for reconsideration of his recusal on January 18, which he denied on January 19. 2022 WL 2374225. On April 5, 2022, Judge Childs withdrew from the case after being nominated for the D.C. Circuit. District Judge Margaret B. Seymour was assigned to replace Judge Childs on the three-judge panel, but she announced her retirement from the bench a short while later. On July 21, 2022, District Judge Mary Geiger Lewis was assigned to the case.\n\nOn November 4, 2021, the House defendants moved the court to stay the case because they argued it was not ripe because new lines had yet to be drawn but would be drawn before the preliminary filing deadlines for the 2022 election cycle. They urged the court to stay the case against them until the legislature actually fails to reapportion in a timely manner. The Senate defendants filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to stay the case on November 9, 2021. Their arguments were similar to the House defendants’, but they requested a dismissal due to lack of ripeness rather than merely a stay. Also on November 9, the Governor moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the plaintiffs’ freedom of association claims did not survive the Supreme Court’s decision in Rucho v. Common Cause.\n\nThe court granted the motion to stay and denied the Senate defendants’ motion to dismiss on November 12, 2021, but it declined to rule on the Governor’s motion, noting in a footnote that the motion went to the merits of the claim rather than jurisdiction. Supporting its decision to stay the case, the court noted that the threat that the Legislature won’t complete redistricting before January was too speculative. It also noted that, if redistricting still had not been completed before the Legislature’s Regular Session (beginning  January 11), the threat of vote dilution would be more imminent. In that light, the proceedings were stayed until January 18, 2021. 572 F.Supp.3d 215.\n\nOn December 10, 2021, the Governor signed a new state legislature district map into law.\n\nOn December 23, 2021, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to add two claims challenging the redistricted maps as unconstitutional. Their first new claim argued the map was a racial gerrymander in violation of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Second, they contended the new districts were drawn with a racially discriminatory intent against Black voters in violation of the 14th and 15th Amendments. The plaintiffs added a new request for relief, asking that the court declare the new districts unconstitutional, impose a temporary and permanent injunction barring the defendants from using the plan in any future elections, and order new redistricting plans in the event the defendants failed to adopt new plans by February 15, 2022.\n\nThe House defendants and the Governor filed separate motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim on January 6, 2022, with the Governor filing a motion for summary judgment on February 1, arguing that he had legislative immunity from suit for signing a bill into law, and that the general authority of a state’s chief executive is  insufficient to make a governor a defendant in a case challenging the constitutionality of a law.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved to compel the House Defendants to disclose documents and testimony on February 2, 2022, after the defendants issued a blanket objection to the plaintiffs’ discovery requests by asserting “legislative privilege.” The court granted the motion in part and denied it in part on February 10, 2022, holding that legislative privilege is qualified and depends on the balance of interests. Given the importance of drawing fair election districts, which will exist for a decade, the court granted a large quantity of discovery to the plaintiffs, including depositions of all legislators, staff, and consultants involved in the creation of the maps, and numerous categories of documents related to their creation. 584 F.Supp.3d 152. Many of the motions over the rest of the following year of litigation concern the defendants claiming privilege and moving to quash discovery requests with the plaintiffs in turn filing motions to compel discovery, with the court balancing the respective interests in its rulings.\n\nAlso on February 10, the court gave leave to the plaintiffs to file a second amended complaint, 2022 WL 408427, which they filed that same day. At that point, the plaintiffs removed the Governor as a defendant, mooting his previous motions. Prior to February 10, the South Carolina Legislature passed redistricted maps for the state’s U.S. Congressional districts, and the second amended complaint adds two counts challenging those maps as  racial gerrymanders and alleging they were drawn with discriminatory intent.\n\nThe House defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on February 14, 2022, arguing that, because the individual plaintiff was not challenging the house district map and the NAACP didn’t identify any members who lived in the challenged districts, the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their complaint against the House defendants. They also argued that the plaintiffs failed to plausibly plead racial gerrymandering. They also moved to stay the order compelling discovery until the jurisdictional issue was resolved.\n\nOn the same day, February 14, the court denied the House defendants’ motions, holding that the NAACP plausibly alleged it has 13,000 members who reside in every county of South Carolina, which is enough to show it has standing in the pleading stage. 2022 WL 453533.\n\nOn February 15, 2022, in a hearing before Judge Gergel, the plaintiffs and House defendants requested a two week stay to allow for settlement negotiations, which was granted in the hearing.\n\nWhile settlement negotiations occurred, the Election defendants filed their answer and a motion to dismiss on February 24, 2022, arguing that the plaintiffs fail to plausibly claim the new map results in adverse effects on an identifiable group and was enacted because of that effect, not merely in spite of it.\n\nOn April 13, 2022, the court ordered the NAACP to provide the House defendants with the names and addresses of members who reside in each challenged House district. The disclosure was subject to an “attorneys’ eyes only” protective order.\n\nThe plaintiffs and House defendants reached a settlement agreement prior to April 22, 2022, but the court denied their motions for approval of the settlement on April 25, holding that the House defendants alone did not have the requisite authority to settle the claims. 2022 WL 2375812.\n\nOn May 5, 2022, the plaintiffs and House defendants reached an effective settlement agreement in which the parties agreed that the House defendants would take steps to enact agreed upon districting maps. The agreement contemplates that the State Senate and Governor will complete the legislative process to enact the maps, but doesn’t bind them to do so. In exchange, the plaintiffs agreed to drop counts one and two from their complaint, with the ability to reallege the claims if the maps were not enacted.\n\nThe plaintiffs amended their complaint a third time on May 6, 2022 to remove counts one and two as agreed in the settlement. They maintained their challenge to the congressional district maps as racial gerrymandering and intentional discrimination.\n\nIn response, the Senate and House defendants filed separate motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim on May 20, 2022. They challenged the plaintiffs’ standing to challenge the district maps and asserted that they had not alleged enough facts to plausibly support their claims. The court denied these motions on June 28, 2022, holding that the private plaintiff had standing to challenge the district he lived in and the NAACP had associational standing because it had members in the challenged districts. The court further held that discriminatory intent and improper use of race in drawing district lines can be proved by circumstantial evidence, and the plaintiffs alleged sufficient circumstantial evidence to survive a motion to dismiss. 2022 WL 2334410.\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Senate and House defendants moved to strike plaintiffs’ supplemental disclosures as improper and to exclude some of their witnesses as untimely, arguing that the timing of the filings violated Federal Rule 26. The court denied the motion to strike on September 2, 2022, choosing instead to extend the discovery deadline to allow the defendants to respond and conduct their own discovery for the new disclosures. 2022 WL 4009058.\n\nThe Senate and House defendants moved for summary judgment on August 19, arguing that their maps were drawn as a partisan gerrymander to disenfranchise democratic party voters rather than based on race.\n\nOn September 2, 2022 the plaintiffs and defendants filed a substantial number of motions in limine to exclude expert testimony and exclude certain evidence or arguments. In two opinions filed on September 15, the court denied all of the motions because the purpose of evidentiary gatekeeping is to keep unreliable evidence from the jury. Since the forthcoming trial was to be a bench trial, the judges found “there is less need for the gatekeeper to keep the gate when the gatekeeper is keeping the gate only for herself or himself.” 2022 WL 4276713.\n\nThe court also denied the defendants’ summary judgment motion on September 15, 2022. It held that, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs, issues of material fact remained as to whether the defendants engaged in intentional discrimination against Black South Carolinians or used race as a proxy for partisan goals. 2022 WL 4295187.\n\nOn October 6, 2022, the three-judge panel held a bench trial. The trial lasted until October 14, with closing arguments held on November 29, 2022. The panel issued a ruling on January 6, 2023, declaring that District 1 was a racial gerrymander and constituted intentional discrimination against the plaintiffs. The court held that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden for Districts 2 and 5. The order enjoined elections in District 1 until further order of the court and gave the South Carolina General Assembly until March 31, 2023 to present the court with a remedial map for consideration. 649 F.Supp.3d 177.\n\nThe panel based its District 1 ruling primarily on the fact that the district’s constituency changed significantly while its black voter population remained constant, which required the removal of 30,000 black residents. The standard for finding a racial gerrymander is whether race “predominated” in the drawing of a district’s boundaries (which is also the standard for discriminatory intent in reapportioning districts). The panel found that race predominated in the drawing of District 1, relying on testimony from the redistricting map’s designer as well as statistical modeling provided by expert witnesses. The map’s designer was directed to keep two of the district’s counties whole, which forced him to substantially redraw the boundaries to achieve the plan’s overall political gerrymandering goals. The court based its inference of racial predominance on the upheaval in the district’s population with the percentage of black voters remaining constant, the makeup of specific communities that were split, and models showing that the state’s ostensible partisanship goals could have been achieved without “exiling” black voters from the district. 649 F.Supp.3d 177.\n\nThe panel’s determination that District 2 was not a racial gerrymander rested on the fact that its disputed features were consistent with its shape before the present redistricting plan and the intent was consistent with incumbent protection—a permissible redistricting concern. For District 5, the panel determined that the change in black voters from the previous plan to the present plan was too small to carry an inference of racial gerrymandering. 649 F.Supp.3d 177.\n\nOn January 27, 2023, the defendants notified the court that they were appealing its ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court—which exercises direct appellate review over decisions of District Courts sitting in three-judge panels—and they moved to stay the order pending the Court’s review. On February 4, 2023, the court denied the defendants’ motion because they did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits. The court did, however, extend the South Carolina legislature’s deadline to submit a new district map until 30 days after the Supreme Court resolved defendants’ appeal.\n\nOn February 17, 2023, the defendants submitted their appeal to the Supreme Court. They argued that the District Court panel failed to apply the presumption of good faith, that it erred in disregarding the alternative-map requirement, used race impermissibly in its decision, misconstrued the predominance standard, and clearly erred in finding racial predominance in South Carolina’s mapmaking. The State of Alabama and the National Republican Redistricting Trust filed amicus briefs on March 29, 2023.\n\nThe Supreme Court noted probable jurisdiction on May 15, 2023, and the case proceeded into the merits briefing stage. 143 S.Ct. 2456. On July 14, 2023, a number of parties submitted amicus briefs, including the United States (in support of neither party); Judicial Watch, Inc.; the governor of South Carolina; all six of South Carolina’s Republican congresspeople in the House of Representatives; the State of Alabama; the National Republican Redistricting Trust; and the Fair Lines America Foundation. Another tranche of amicus briefs were filed on August 18, 2023. The amici included: the Constitutional Accountability Center, political science professors, historians, the Lawyers Committee For Civil Rights Under Law, the League of Women Voters of South Carolina, Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos and Jowei Chen, and Congressman James Clyburn. The Court granted the Solicitor General of the United States leave to participate in oral arguments on September 26, 2023, and oral arguments were held on October 11, 2023.\n\nOn March 7, 2024 the defendants filed a motion for a partial stay of the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina’s January 6, 2023 order for the 2024 Election Cycle. Defendants noted that they were awaiting the Supreme Court’s decision on their appeal, but that election deadlines for 2024 election candidates were imminent, including in District. Defendants argued that the only appropriate course of actions was for the district court to grant a partial stay and allow the 2024 elections to proceed in District 1, regardless of the district court’s view of the merits of Defendant’s appeal to the Supreme Court. The NAACP opposed defendants’ motion for partial stay of the court’s January 6, 2023 order.\n\nOn March 20, 2024, the defendants filed an application for stay of the district court panel’s injunction for the 2024 elections with the United States Supreme Court. Again, the NAACP opposed the motion. However, on March 28, 2024, the District Court modified its injunction to “preserve the status quo on appeal.” The District Court added language to note that the Court enjoined the conducting of an election in District 1 after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan was approved by the Court. As the District Court modified the injunction, the Supreme Court never ruled on the motion to stay.\n\nOn May 23, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its opinion on the matter, reversing in part and remanding in part. The opinion for the majority was written by Justice Alito and joined by Justices Roberts, Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. The Court ruled that the district court’s finding that race predominated in the design of South Carolina’s first congressional district was clearly erroneous, so its racial-gerrymandering and vote-dilution holdings were reversed. The vote-diluting claim was additionally remanded to the district court.\n\nIn the opinion, Justice Alito reasoned that the plaintiffs provided no direct evidence, and only weak circumstantial evidence, of a racial gerrymander. Further, the four experts, who the plaintiffs provided, and on whose testimony the district court relied, were flawed because they ignored certain traditional districting criteria in their analysis. Additionally, Alito states that the plaintiffs failed to provide an alternate districting map that would show how the State could have achieved its political objectives while producing greater racial balance. In light of these three issues, Alito stated that the district court’s finding that race predominated the redistricting map was clearly erroneous.\n\nJustice Thomas joined the majority but wrote a concurring opinion, arguing that the Court’s review of the expert reports exceeds the proper scope of clear-error review.\n\nJustice Kagan wrote a dissenting opinion and was joined by Justices Sotomayor and Jackson. Justice Kagan argued that rather than giving the district court’s view of the evidence “significant deference” as is required by the clear error standard of review, the majority inverted the clear-error standard by using the presumption that the South Carolina legislature acted in good faith and by making any “possibility” that favored the defendants as dispositive.\n\nOn June 28. 2024, following the Supreme Court’s remand of the plaintiff’s voter-dilution claim to the district court for further proceedings, the district court issued an order requesting the parties submit memorandums addressing whether the legislature acted with dilutive intent and whether the enacted map had a dilutive effect.\n\nOn July 26, 2024, prior to either party submitting the requested memorandum, the plaintiffs filed a joint stipulation for voluntary dismissal with prejudice. Subsequently, on August 1, 2024, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice and ordered the Clerk of the Court to close the case.\n\nThe case is now closed.",

    "summary/long": "On August 2, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho to protect what it alleged were rights of patients to access emergency abortion care guaranteed by federal law. The suit challenged Idaho Code § 18-622, which was set to go into effect on Aug. 25 and to impose a near-total ban on abortion. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that § 18-622 conflicted with, and was preempted by, the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd, in situations where an abortion is necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition, and an order permanently enjoining the Idaho law to the extent it conflicted with EMTALA. Idaho passed § 18-622 after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization [../../../../case/43153/].\n\nAccording to the DOJ complaint, EMTALA requires hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency. When a physician reasonably determines that the necessary stabilizing treatment is an abortion, state law cannot prohibit the provision of that care. The federal statute defines necessary stabilizing treatment to include all treatment needed to ensure that a patient will not have her health placed in serious jeopardy, have her bodily functions seriously impaired, or suffer serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nIdaho's § 18-622 authorized prosecutors to prosecute a physician merely by showing that an abortion has been performed, without regard to the circumstances. A physician who provides an abortion in Idaho could ultimately avoid criminal liability by establishing as an affirmative defense that “the abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.” But the state law provided no defense for an abortion necessary to protect the health of the pregnant patient.\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Barry Lynn Winmill. On August 8, 2022 the DOJ moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of Idaho Code § 18-622 as applied to EMTALA-mandated care. That same day the Idaho State Legislature moved to intervene as defendants. Judge Winmill granted in part and denied in part the Legislature’s motion. Judge Winmill found that the Legislature could not intervene as a matter of right, since it did not show it sought to voice a different perspective than Idaho, or that Idaho would not adequately represent the Legislature's interests. However, Judge Winmill allowed the Legislature to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing the DOJ’s motion for preliminary injunction. The Legislature's participation was limited to presenting evidence and argument aimed at showing the alleged holes in the factual foundation of the DOJ’s motion. 342 F.R.D. 144.\n\nOn August 17, 2022 Judge Winmill denied the Legislature’s request for an evidentiary hearing. Judge Winmill found the declarations on file provided a sufficient basis to make an informed decision and the bulk of the alleged factual dispute was actually a legal dispute: the meaning of Idaho Code § 18-622 and its overlap with EMTALA. 2022 WL 3442500.\n\nOn August 24, 2022 Judge Winmill granted the DOJ’s preliminary injunction. Judge Winmill found it was not possible for healthcare workers to simultaneously comply with their obligations under EMTALA and Idaho Code § 18-622. The state law therefore had to yield to federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Even if it was possible to comply with both laws, Idaho Code § 18-622 stood as a clear obstacle to what Congress was attempting to accomplish with EMTALA. Idaho Code § 18-622 would deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations while EMTALA intended to ensure emergency care for patients in Medicare-funded hospitals.\n\nThe injunction restrained Idaho from enforcing Idaho Code § 18-622 as applied to medical care required by EMTALA. Idaho was prohibited from initiating any criminal prosecution against, attempting to suspend or revoke the professional license of, or seeking to impose any other form of liability on, any medical provider or hospital based on their performance of conduct that is defined as an “abortion” under Idaho Code § 18-604(1), but that is necessary to avoid (i) “placing the health of” a pregnant patient “in serious jeopardy”; (ii) a “serious impairment to bodily functions” of the pregnant patient; or (iii) a “serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part” of the pregnant patient. The preliminary injunction was effective immediately through the date on which judgment would be entered on the case. 623 F.Supp.3d 1096.\n\nIn September 2022, the Legislature and Idaho moved for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. The court subsequently stayed issuance of a decision until the resolution of this motion. In the interim, on October 4, 2022, the Legislature renewed its motion to intervene. On February 3, 2023, the court denied the Legislature's motion, holding that the Legislature and the State's interests overlapped fully such that the State would adequately represent the Legislature's interests. 2023 WL 1767387. On March 2, the Legislature appealed to the Ninth Circuit (23-35153).\n\nWhile the Legislature's appeal was pending, the lower court denied the State's motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction on May 4, 2023.  The court considered the Idaho Supreme Court's January 2023 upholding of § 18-622 under the Idaho Constitution in Planned Parenthood Great Northwest v. State of [../../../../case/43579/] Idaho [../../../../case/43579/] [../../../../case/43579/], but concluded that the Planned Parenthood decision did not negate the fundamental principles underpinning this court's preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction in this case did not rest on whether the abortion ban was consistent with the Idaho Constitution, but rather whether it conflicted with EMTALA. 2023 WL 3284977.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Idaho appealed the initial order on motion for preliminary injunction and the order on motion for reconsideration to the Ninth Circuit (23-35440). On July 3, the Legislature also appealed the order on motion for reconsideration (23-35450). That same day, the Legislature also moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On September 28, the Ninth Circuit granted that motion, staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal. It explained that the Idaho law likely did not conflict with EMTALA, that the preliminary injunction directly harmed Idaho's sovereignty, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favored Idaho's right to enforce its legitimately enacted laws during the pendency of the appeal. 83 F.4th 1130. Separately, the Ninth Circuit also consolidated 23-35440 and 23-35450.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, the United States filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc of the stay pending appeal. On October 10, per a vote of the majority of nonrecused active judges, the Ninth Circuit ordered the matter be reheard en banc and vacated the stay. 82 F.4th 1296. On November 13, the Ninth Circuit denied the motion to stay, and therefore allowed the district court's injunction to remain in effect while the appeal was pending.  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 30135. While the appeals were pending, many states and municipalities submitted amicus briefs to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, both the Legislature (23-726) and Idaho (23-727) separately applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the district court's preliminary injunction. On January 3, the Idaho Acting Solicitor General notified the Supreme Court of the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in Texas v. [../../../../case/43404/] Becerra [../../../../case/43404/] [../../../../case/43404/], which upheld a permanent injunction of federal guidance which had advised that EMTALA required abortions to be provided in emergency situations, even in jurisdictions with abortion bans. Two days later, the Supreme Court granted the application for stay, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petition. In response, the Ninth Circuit stayed its proceedings regarding its consideration of the preliminary injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in April 2024. On June 27, 2024, however, the Court issued a per curiam opinion, dismissing the case as improvidently granted and vacating the January 5 stay. The preliminary injunction was thus reinstated, and hospitals were able to perform emergency abortions in the state while the litigation continued in the lower courts.\n\nJustice Kagan concurred, joined by Justice Sotomayor (and joined in part by Justice Jackson), stating that “Idaho’s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute,” and that dismissing the case would allow the regular course of litigation in the lower courts. Justice Barrett also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, because the “shape of the [case]” had “substantially shifted” since the Court granted cert, and because the parties’ positions had continued to evolve. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that the stay should have been lifted but asserting that the Court was wrong to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, and even suggesting that the Court used this procedural move to avoid an issue it did not wish to decide. Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Gorsuch, stating that the Court’s “about-face is baffling,” because nothing “legally relevant” had occurred to change the circumstances of the case since the Court granted cert. Justice Alito offered an interpretation of EMTALA in his dissent, asserting that it did not require covered hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho state law, but instead required hospitals to protect an “unborn child” from harm.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered replacement briefing, and it held an en banc oral argument on December 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, after President Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, the Trump Administration switched sides on the issue, and dropped the lawsuit.  On March 5, 2025, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, applicable to all of the DOJ’s claims. The case was thereby dismissed and the injunction dissolved. On March 13, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeals pursuant to the parties’ stipulated agreement.\n\nThe case is closed.",

    "summary/long": "On July 6, 2016, indigent Virginia residents brought this putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia after suffering indefinite suspension of their driver's licenses pursuant to Virginia Code § 46.2-395 for failure to pay court costs and fines that they could not afford. The plaintiffs sued the Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by private attorneys, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief and class certification. They claimed that the Commonwealth's scheme of suspending licenses to coerce payment of money owed to the courts unfairly punished people for being poor, and that suspending their licenses was a violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The case was assigned to Judge Norman K. Moon.\n\nOn November 4, 2016, Magistrate Judge Joel C. Hoppe granted the NAACP's motion for leave to file an amicus brief. On November 20, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a statement of interest urging the court to conclude that the plaintiffs had set forth a plausible claim for relief that the alleged driver's license suspension practices used by the defendant violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The DOJ argued that suspension of a person's driver's license in response to the failure to pay court debt without providing a person with adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard constituted a deprivation of a protected interest without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, the DOJ argued that suspending the driver's licenses of those who failed to pay fines without inquiring into whether the failure to pay was willful or instead the result of an inability to pay may result in penalizing indigent individuals solely because of their poverty, in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOn October 3, 2016, the defendant moved to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim. On March 13, 2017, Judge Moon dismissed the case without prejudice, concluding that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. He found that \"Congress and the Constitution have not granted federal district courts the authority to hear appeals from state courts.\" Since this case involved suspension orders issued by Virginia state courts, Judge Moon concluded that the plaintiffs were required to seek relief from state appellate courts and ultimately the United States Supreme Court. Furthermore, a federal court could only hear a case if it could grant some sort of remedy to the plaintiffs. In this case, because state courts, rather than the Commissioner, had suspended the licenses, a court order against the Commissioner would not provide such a remedy and so the court held the plaintiffs had no standing. Finally, Judge Moon found that the suit was barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity, which prevents federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over suits brought by citizens against non-consenting state defendants. The court found that the Ex parte Young exception, which permits such suits where the sued official has a \"special relation\" with the challenged statute or action, did not apply in this case. 2017 WL 963234.\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On May 23, 2018, the Fourth Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remanded the case back to the district court with instructions to allow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. Circuit Judge Henry F. Floyd wrote the majority opinion, in which Circuit Judge Allyson K. Duncan joined. The Circuit Court found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs' appeal because the district court's dismissal without prejudice was not a final order and because the plaintiffs might still be able to cure the deficiencies identified by the district court by amending their complaint. Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory wrote a dissenting opinion because he would have found that the district court's dismissal was an appealable final order. 734 Fed.Appx. 858.\n\nOn remand to the district court, on June 22, 2018, Judge Moon granted leave to the plaintiffs to amend or clarify their complaint. On September 11, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint and a motion for preliminary injunction. They asked the court to enjoin the Commissioner from enforcing the statutes against the plaintiffs and future suspended class members without notice and determination of ability to pay, to remove any current suspensions of the plaintiffs' driver's licenses imposed under the statute, and to enjoin the Commissioner from charging a fee to reinstate the plaintiffs' licenses if there were no other restrictions on their licenses. On December 21, 2018, Judge Moon granted the plaintiffs' motion for the preliminary injunction, finding it likely that the plaintiffs would succeed in establishing that the Virginia statute violated procedural due process and that the remaining factors relevant to the issuance of a preliminary injunction weighed in favor of the plaintiffs. 355 F. Supp. 3d 514.\n\nOn April 23, 2019, the defendant moved to dismiss the case as moot, or in the alternative sought a stay of the proceedings, arguing that a budget amendment by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam that reinstated driver’s licenses that had been revoked for failure to pay any fines ended any harm against the plaintiffs. Both the defendant and plaintiffs then moved for summary judgement on June 3, 2019.\n\nOn June 28, 2019, Judge Moon issued an order granting the motion to stay and denying the defendant’s motion to dismiss. The court found that the budget amendment only halted enforcement of the law, and thus there was a reasonable expectation the plaintiffs would again be subjected to the same harm. But the court also granted the motion to stay the proceedings pending the 2020 session of Virginia’s General Assembly, citing the possibility that the Virginia General Assembly would repeal the law. The stay was ordered through April 17, 2020, and then extended until May 15, 2020.\n\nOn May 7, 2020, the parties submitted a joint stipulation of dismissal after the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation eliminating the contested Virginia Code § 46.2-395 and requiring the DMV Commissioner to reinstate, without payment of fees, driver's licenses suspended under the law.  The parties agreed that the legislative action mooted the case, but disputed whether the plaintiffs should be awarded attorneys' fees. The court adopted the stipulation of dismissal the same day and dismissed the case as moot, while retaining jurisdiction to decide the issue of attorneys' fees. Judge Moon requested that each party brief the remaining question of attorneys' fees.\n\nOn December 9, 2020, Magistrate Judge Hoppe held a hearing on the motion for attorneys' fees. On February 16, he issued a report concluding that a plaintiff who won a preliminary injunction but whose case was later dismissed as moot was not a prevailing party for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and therefore not entitled to attorneys' fees, and recommended that the court deny the plaintiffs' motion. On June 4, 2021, the court delivered an opinion adopting the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and denying the request for attorneys' fees.\n\nOn July 2, 2021, the plaintiffs appealed the district court's decision to deny attorneys' fees. The following year, on June 27, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the lower court's ruling, agreeing that winning a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party. 37 F.4th 977. The plaintiffs petitioned for a rehearing en banc before the entire Fourth Circuit, which was granted on August 9, 2022.\n\nOn August 7, 2023, the Fourth Circuit vacated the district court’s denial of attorneys' fees and remanded back to the district court for further proceedings. The Fourth Circuit held that its previous bright line rule was too stringent, and preliminary injunctions can sometimes constitute “enduring, merits-based relief that satisfies all the requisites of the prevailing party standard,” making the plaintiffs in this case eligible for a fee award. 77 F.4th 200.\n\nOn August 30, 2023, the district court referred the plaintiffs' petition for attorneys' fees and litigation expenses to U.S. Magistrate Judge Joel C. Hoppe. About a month later, the court stayed briefing on the issue of attorney’s fees and litigation expenses while waiting to see if the defendant would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOn December 23, 2023, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. On March 27, 2024, Magistrate Judge Hoppe entered an oral order staying the case and on April 22, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.144 S.Ct. 1390. The case was argued on October 8, 2024, and Chief Justice Roberts issued the Court’s majority opinion on February 25, 2025. Justices Thomas, Alito, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett joined the opinion. Justice Jackson, joined by Justice Sotomayor, dissented.\n\nChief Justice Roberts reversed the Fourth Circuit’s en banc opinion and held that the plaintiffs did not qualify as “prevailing parties” and, thus, were not eligible for attorney’s fees under § 1988(b). 2025 WL 594737. For purposes of § 1998(b), the court reasoned that a party “prevails” when the court grants relief that constitutes a “material alteration” of a legal relationship. Based on precedent, the court held that this alteration of the legal relationship must be (1) judicially sanctioned, and (2) enduring. Here, only a preliminary injunction was issued and no court conclusively resolved the plaintiffs’ claims on the merits. Thus, the legal relationship between the parties was not materially altered and, therefore, the plaintiffs did not qualify under § 1988(b).\n\nThis case is now closed.",

    "summary/long": "On March 5, 2019, plaintiffs—immigrant youth under the age of 21 who applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile status (“SIJ”)—filed a class action lawsuit in the Western District of Washington on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated to challenge the Trump Administration’s policy of refusing to adjudicate their SIJ petitions in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”). The complaint was filed on behalf of the following proposed class:\n\n“All individuals who have been issued predicate SIJS orders by Washington state courts after turning eighteen years old but prior to turning twenty-one years old, and have submitted or will submit SIJS petitions to USCIS prior to turning twenty-one years old.”\n\nFiled against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), and their respective directors, the complaint alleged that USCIS began denying SIJ applications unless petitioners could show that a state court had the power to return the youth to the custody of their parents. This resulted in USCIS denying petitions to applicants after turning 18 but before the age of 21.  USCIS also delayed the adjudications of numerous applications. These actions, the complaint claimed, were in violation of the INA’s text. Plaintiffs, thus, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin this unlawful agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). Plaintiffs also alleged, under the APA, that the agency action was arbitrary and capricious; that the new policy was promulgated without notice-and-comment rulemaking; and that action could not be unreasonably delayed beyond the 180 day statutory deadline. Due to the defendant’s duty to adjudicate applications without unreasonable delay, the plaintiffs further sought a writ of mandamus to compel a federal official or agency to adjudicate SIJ applications. The plaintiffs were represented by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The case was assigned to Judge Robert S. Lasnik.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class and a motion for a preliminary injunction that same day. The State of Washington filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs on March 25, 2019. On July 17, 2019, the court certified the class. 2019 WL 3219418. The court also granted the motion for preliminary injunction. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate outstanding SIJ petitions and to readjudicate cases that were denied on grounds that state courts did not have jurisdiction to “reunify” an immigrant with their parents. 387 F.Supp.3d 1208.\n\nFollowing the court’s preliminary injunction order, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment on August 7, 2019. Subsequently on August 22, the defendants also requested that certain portions of the preliminary injunction be stayed. However, on August 23, the court denied the motion for reconsideration, citing that the defendants offered no new facts or legal authority that would justify reconsideration. 2019 WL 3996850.\n\nGiven the court’s unwillingness to reconsider the order, the defendants then appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit (No. 19-35884) on October 22, 2019. However, on February 28, 2020, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal, which was then granted on March 4, 2020.\n\nBack in district court, the plaintiffs then filed a motion for summary judgment on May 1, 2020, which included a request for permanent injunctive relief. The court granted summary judgment on October 5, finding that the reunification requirement was arbitrary and capricious and that the delays in adjudication were plainly unlawful as Congress unambiguously intended the adjudication to be expeditious, providing a clear and mandatory deadline of 180 days. The court also entered a permanent injunction, specifically with regard to adjudication timelines. The court ordered the defendants to adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application was filed by the petitioner. The injunction, though, permitted SIJ petitioners to “toll” the deadline to respond to a request for evidence. 492 F.Supp.3d 1169.\n\nA month later, the defendants appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit as well (20-36052). Following motions to extend the time to file their briefings, the defendants filed their opening brief on July 20, 2021, to which the plaintiffs responded on September 20. Oral arguments were then scheduled for March 9, 2022. Prior to this, though, the defendants submitted a letter to the court to notify that USCIS anticipated a final rule implicating Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) petitions would be issued in the near future, potentially before oral arguments. Following oral arguments on March 9, the court requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez,142 S. Ct. 2057 (2022), which held that injunctive relief was precluded for certain provisions of the INA.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit entered judgment on November 3, 2022, affirming in part and vacating in part the district court’s opinion. The Ninth Circuit determined that the district court had jurisdiction to enter a permanent injunction, despite the Supreme Court’s ruling in Aleman Gonzalez, noting that the provision of the INA implicated in this case was not one that precluded injunctive relief. However, the court did find that the district court abused its discretion when permitting each and every SIJ petitioner to “toll” indefinitely Congress’s timeline for adjudicating SIJ petitions. According to the Ninth Circuit panel, the tolling provisions of the injunction were not narrowly tailored to remedy the harm and did not contemplate USCIS’s relevant regulations. As such, this portion of the injunction was vacated. 52 F.4th 821.\n\nFollowing the Ninth Circuit’s official mandate on February 10, 2023, the parties were ordered to submit a joint status report prior to July, proposing amendments to the permanent injunction consistent with the Ninth Circuit's order. Following the parties’ submission of the joint status report, a hearing was held on September 21, 2023.\n\nAn amended permanent injunction was then entered by the district court on September 22, and stated as follows:\n\n“Defendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application is filed by the petitioner… This timeline is inclusive of any requests for additional evidence or notices of intent to deny that USCIS may issue to a petitioner. USCIS must provide SIJ petitioners with sufficient time prior to the expiration of the 180 days to respond to the request/notice in an effort to complete final adjudication of the SIJ petition in a timely manner. USCIS may not use the issuance of a request for information or notice of intent to deny for the sole purpose of avoiding the statutory deadline for adjudication of an SIJ petition.”\n\nPlaintiffs then filed a motion for attorney’s fees and costs on December 14, 2023. Briefing deadlines on the matter were extended on multiple occasions as settlement negotiations on the matter continued. On May 22, 2024, the court preliminarily approved the settlement agreement and scheduled a final approval hearing on the matter for September. On September 5, 2024, the final settlement agreement was approved, whereby the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs $400,000.\n\nThe case is now considered closed.",

    "summary/long": "This case is about the First Amendment rights of public officials. On August 4, 2022, the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, promulgated Executive Order 22-176, suspending a State Attorney after he signed on to statements in support of transgender rights and abortion rights. The Executive Order (EO) claimed the State Attorney was \"incompetent\" to hold his office and had demonstrated a \"neglect of duty\" while in office. However, Governor DeSantis stated to the press that the suspension was due to statements the State Attorney had made about gender-affirming care and abortion.\n\nFollowing his suspension, the State Attorney filed this lawsuit against Governor DeSantis on August 17, 2022, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the suspension violated his First Amendment right to free speech and the Florida Constitution's limitations on gubernatorial suspensions of state officers. Various parties filed amicus briefs in this case, including a group of former prosecutors, attorneys general, judges, US attorneys, and other officials (for the plaintiff); two groups of legal scholars (for the plaintiff); and the Florida Sheriff's Association (for the defendant).\n\nOn the same day he filed the lawsuit, the plaintiff also moved for a preliminary injunction requiring the Governor to reinstate the plaintiff as a State Attorney. The Governor subsequently moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the plaintiff's speech was the speech of a government officials pursuant to his duties; under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), an official's supervisor can discipline them for official speech without violating the First Amendment.\n\nOn September 29, 2022, the court denied the Governor's motion to dismiss the First Amendment claim, holding that Garcetti did not apply because 1) the plaintiff was elected, and 2) the speech at issue was not official. However, the court dismissed the plaintiff's state law claim as barred by sovereign immunity. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction, finding that restoring the plaintiff to his State Attorney position could cause disruption in the government, and that the success of plaintiff's claim would hinge on the facts of the case. Finally, the court held that it should not abstain from hearing the case under either Pullman or Younger. 631 F.Supp.3d 1188.\n\nThe Governor filed a motion for interlocutory judgment under Section 1292(b), requesting that the district court certify the First Amendment issue so it could be immediately appealed. On October 4, 2022, the court denied the Governor's motion for certification as a matter of discretion. 2022 WL 19395252.\n\nThe court held a bench trial from November 29 to December 1, 2022. On January 20, 2023, Judge Hinkle entered a judgment on the merits. The court found that the Governor violated the First Amendment by suspending the plaintiff for speech on matters of public concern and for his association with the Democratic Party. However, the plaintiff was not entitled to be reinstated, as the court found that the Governor would have suspended the plaintiff anyway due to unprotected activities, including the plaintiff's statement opposing abortion prosecutions, the policy reforms the plaintiff enacted, and the political benefit that the Governor would get from suspending him. The Court also held that the suspension violated the Florida Constitution because it was not based on neglect of duty or incompetence. However, Florida's sovereign immunity prevented any relief on this basis. Therefore, the court dismissed the case. 653 F.Supp.3d 1118.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, the plaintiff appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals (docket no. 23-10459). The motion to expedite the appeal was granted on March 3, and the Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments for May 2, 2023. In his pleading, the plaintiff argued that the district court had erred in holding that sovereign immunity barred it from ordering reinstatement, and that the court had misapplied the legal framework for First Amendment retaliation claims.\n\nOn January 11, 2024, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court's decision and remanded the case. The Eleventh Circuit held that two factors in the Governor's suspension decision—the abortion statement and the political benefit to the Governor—were protected by the First Amendment, though the district court had considered them unprotected. Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit remanded the case so that the district court could analyze whether the Governor would have made the same suspension decision if none of the protected factors were present. 90 F.4th 1115.\n\nThe Governor subsequently petitioned for rehearing en banc. While the Eleventh Circuit considered whether to grant the petition, the plaintiff's term of office as State Attorney concluded. On January 1, 2025, the Eleventh Circuit vacated its previous opinion, holding that the case was now moot because the court could not provide the plaintiff meaningful relief. The Court rejected the plaintiff's argument that the case fell into an exception for cases \"capable of repetition yet evading review\" because the plaintiff had not shown a likelihood that he would subsequently run for and win another public office that the governor would suspend him from. 125 F.4th 1361.\n\nThe case was subsequently dismissed, and is now closed.",

    "summary/long": "After a two-year investigation initiated in December 2016 under CRIPA and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a Notice on December 19, 2018 concluding that the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority (“HRRJ”) failed to provide constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care to incarcerated peoples and placed people with serious mental illness in restrictive housing for prolonged periods of time. The DOJ also concluded that HRRJ’s housing practices discriminate against incarcerated people with mental health disabilities in violation of the ADA.\n\nIn the Notice, the DOJ set forth factual findings about the conditions at HRRJ that violated incarcerated peoples’ constitutional rights. Principally, the DOJ found that medical and mental health care at HRRJ was constitutionally inadequate. In all stages of medical and mental health care (including patient intake, chronic care and emergency care, treatment and therapy, continuity of care, and security and care for suicidal persons), the quality of care and access to care was found to be severely deficient, subjecting patients to a serious risk of harm due to delays and lack of care. The DOJ also found a lack of oversight and accountability and a deliberate indifference by HRRJ officials in identifying and mitigating risks. Furthermore, HRRJ utilized prolonged restrictive housing which disparately affects incarcerated people with mental illnesses, thereby denying them access to activities and programming that they would otherwise be eligible for, and putting them at risk for serious harm. Officials at HRRJ knew of these substantial shortcomings and the associated risks and failed to take appropriate action.\n\nOn August 5, 2020, the DOJ filed this lawsuit against HRRJ in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia based on the findings in the December 2018 report and HRRJ’s subsequent failure to take sufficient remedial steps. The DOJ alleges that HRRJ’s policies and practices violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of people incarcerated in the facility. As a result, the DOJ asked Judge Rebecca Beach Smith to declare that HRRJ’s practices violated the constitutional rights of incarcerated persons and violated the ADA, and to enjoin HRRJ to take immediate action to amend its policies and practices to ensure lawful conditions of confinement.\n\nBy the time that the complaint was filed, the parties had already negotiated a settlement. On the same day as the complaint was filed, the parties filed a joint settlement motion. In the settlement agreement, HRRJ agreed to implement a comprehensive list of reforms including appropriate screening and assessment for medical and mental health needs by qualified professionals, adequate treatment planning for medical and mental health concerns, suicide prevention practices, specialized mental health housing units, oversight of restrictive housing placement, increased medical and mental health staff, increased training for staff, increased collaboration between mental health staff and jail leadership, and a Quality Assurance program to identify and correct deficiencies with the medical and mental health care system to be overseen by a Quality Assurance Committee providing monthly reports to the monitor and the DOJ.\n\nThe settlement agreement noted that HRRJ would designate an Agreement Coordinator to coordinate compliance with the agreement. HRRJ agreed to create annual Implementation Plans to describe how it will fulfill its obligations under the agreement, including deadlines within the first year by which HRRJ must draft or revise policies and procedures, complete a staffing plan, develop and deliver training to HRRJ staff, develop and implement a Quality Improvement Committee, and develop and implement monthly quality assurance mechanisms to report on data relevant to prevent to prevent or minimize harm to incarcerated persons.\n\nA key provision of the settlement agreement was the mandatory appointment of an independent third-party monitor, to oversee HRRJ’s compliance with the agreement. The monitor was agreed to be retained for a period of three years and provide biannual status reports to the DOJ, HRRJ and the court. The monitor would also undertake compliance reviews, on-site inspections and issue monitor reports every six months to assess compliance and HRRJ’s progress on the various reform efforts. The reports will also be filed with the court. In the event of noncompliance with the agreement, the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement at the request of the DOJ.\n\nOn August 31, 2020, the court approved the settlement agreement and subsequently, on September 10, 2020, the court approved the appointment of James Conrad Welch to be the third-party monitor. The settlement agreement was effective as of August 31, 2020.\n\nBy the terms of the agreement, HRRJ was to implement all provisions of the agreement within four years and the agreement would terminate in five years, so long as HRRJ attained substantial compliance with the agreement and maintained that compliance for at least one year. HRRJ had the burden to prove that it has achieved and maintained substantial compliance with the agreement and has been operating in accordance with the requirements of the ADA and the U.S. Constitution continuously for one year. After the closure of the facility on April 1, 2024, and the filing of the final monitor’s report on June 4, 2024, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the agreement on July 31, 2024. The court dismissed the agreement on the same day, and the case is now closed.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged Trump’s Executive Orders 14151 and 14173, which cut government funding for “equity-related” programs. On March 17, 2025, Erie County, New York, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Corporation for National and Community Service (commonly known as AmeriCorps) and its interim agency head. The case was assigned to Judge James Emanuel Boasberg. Erie County sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that AmeriCorps’ actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe dispute arose after Erie County applied for and was awarded a three-year Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) grant from AmeriCorps in October 2023. The grant, which supports volunteer services such as the Meals on Wheels program, was approved in January 2024. However, after the issuance of Executive Order 14151 on January 20, 2025—titled “Ending Radical Government DEI Programs and Preferencing”—AmeriCorps began reviewing grant recipients for compliance with the order’s mandate to eliminate “equity-related” programs. The following day, President Trump issued Executive Order 14173, requiring federal grant recipients to certify that they did not operate programs promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) that violated federal antidiscrimination laws. AmeriCorps subsequently demanded that Erie County either amend its grant application, certify its compliance with all administration executive orders, or relinquish the award.\n\nIn February 2025, Erie County received multiple communications from AmeriCorps stating that noncompliance with the executive orders could result in grant termination. In response, the county pointed to a temporary injunction against Executive Order 14151 issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. See National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education v. Trump [../../../../case/46024/]. AmeriCorps initially paused enforcement but continued to impose additional conditions on grant applications.\n\nIn its complaint, Erie County claimed that AmeriCorps’ enforcement of the executive orders was arbitrary, capricious, and exceeded its lawful authority under the Administrative Procedure Act. The county also alleged that the vague and undefined requirements of the orders violated the Spending Clause by coercing local governments into compliance with federal conditions that lacked a clear legal basis. Erie County argued that AmeriCorps’ demands were unlawful, as its regulations had long required applicants to promote community diversity in their programs. The county refused to certify that its RSVP program did not promote DEI, noting that it had operated in full compliance with AmeriCorps regulations. The lawsuit sought a court order enjoining AmeriCorps from imposing additional grant requirements beyond those established by law and from enforcing Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 against the county.\n\nOn March 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. They asked the Court to require the \"Defendants to determine Plaintiff is in compliance with all relevant grant requirements for existing RSVP grants, and to disburse immediately any funds to which it is entitled, without Plaintiff needing to certify that “RSVP of Erie County, 24SR260017 complies with all administration Executive Orders and does not include any activities that promote DEI activities,” or make any other substantially similar certification referencing compliance with executive orders and promotion of DEI activities.\" The defendants filed their motion in opposition to the preliminary injunction on April 4, 2025, arguing the \"Plaintiff ha[d] not demonstrated that it is at imminent risk of irreparable harm, that it is likely to succeed on the merits, or that the balance of the equities is in its favor.\"\n\nOn April 14, plaintiffs filed a voluntary motion to dismiss the case without prejudice, which the judge granted. They decided to do so after the defendants changed their certification requirement.  According to the Erie County website, AmeriCorps withdrew its requirement that the county must certify compliance with Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 or certify that its grants did not \"include any activities that promote DEI activities” (See Erie County Dismisses Lawsuit against Americorps [https://www4.erie.gov/exec/press/erie-county-dismisses-lawsuit-against-americorps-after-agency-agrees-erie-county-can-conduct]). AmeriCorps agreed to issue a grant to Plaintiff using the pre-Trump administration certification.\n\nThis case is closed.",

    "summary/long": "This is a case about healthcare and isolation practices at Wisconsin prisons. On October 26, 2023, inmates at Wisconsin prisons brought a class action suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Wisconsin, against the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and certain named prison officials in their official capacities. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. In their complaint, Plaintiffs’ allegations included that: (1) As a result of defendants’ longstanding practices, there were severe delays in the provision of or complete denial of medical services when inmates seek or clearly require medical, dental, and/or mental health/psychological services. (2) Defendants implemented an unexplained seven-month lockdown at the Waupun Correctional Institution, during which medical delays continued or were exacerbated. (3) Defendants failed to provide minimally adequate living conditions to inmates in the lockdown period. (4) Defendants maintained a policy of isolating prisoners and providing inadequate environmental stimuli or nutrition in isolation, creating a substantial risk of physical and psychiatric harm. Plaintiffs alleged these practices and policies fall short of minimum constitutional guarantees, violating inmates’ Eighth Amendment rights.\n\nOn November 20, 2023, Magistrate Judge William E. Duffin issued a screening order dismissing plaintiffs’ demand for compensatory and punitive damages from defendants, while preserving plaintiffs’ plea of injunctive relief. The court reasoned that a suit against the state against state officials in their official capacity (as opposed to in their personal capacity), like a suit against an arm of the state such as the Department of Corrections, constitutes a suit against the state itself. As the state is immune from actions for damages under the Eleventh Amendment, the court dismissed plaintiffs’ demands for compensatory and punitive damages. Plaintiffs were allowed to continue to pursue injunctive relief.\n\nPlaintiffs thereafter filed an amended complaint on November 21, 2023, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Department of Corrections and named officials, in their individual as well as official capacities. On March 22, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, arguing that the practices at the Wisconsin prison demonstrated a deliberate indifference to plaintiffs’ well-being and civil rights.\n\nDefendants subsequently filed a motion for partial summary judgment, alleging that plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before they filed their complaint.\n\nOn March 28, 2024, plaintiffs filed a class certification motion, seeking to certify all previous, current, and future inmates in Wisconsin correctional facilities subject to their health practices (medical, mental health, and dental care), or subject to isolation.\n\nOn May 23, 2024, Judge Duffin issued a decision and order granting defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment. Recognizing that federal law requires plaintiffs situated like the plaintiffs here must exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit, the court found that only two complaints relating to dental and eye care made by two of the named plaintiffs exhausted all administrative remedies. The court found all other plaintiffs failed to exhaust their claims prior to filing suit. As such, the court dismissed the plaintiffs’ mental health and isolation-related claims, and the relevant named plaintiffs whose interest in the case related only to those claims.\n\nOn June 4, 2024, Judge Duffin further issued a decision and order denying plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction and for class certification. With respect to the motion for preliminary injunction, the court determined that after defendants’ summary judgment motion had been granted, only two named plaintiffs remained, each with a single discrete claim, and the plaintiffs’ motion did not address those specific claims and therefore was not entitled to a preliminary injunction. With respect to the motion to certify the suit as a class action, the court found class certification improper as plaintiffs did not specify a specific policy at issue nor specify a time period during which the policies at issue were in place.\n\nFollowing the court’s ruling, on August 6, 2024, plaintiffs moved and stipulated to dismiss the case without prejudice. As of that date, the case was dismissed without prejudice to all parties.",

    "summary/long": "Involuntarily unhoused residents of the City of San Rafael, California, filed this lawsuit pro se on August 11, 2023, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, requested a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to stop the City of San Rafael from enforcing ordinances that the plaintiffs alleged criminalized homelessness by making “camping” on public property a criminal offense. The plaintiffs were ten unhoused individuals and Camp Integrity, an unincorporated association of people and property where the unhoused individual plaintiffs lived. They sued the City of San Rafael and its Chief of Police under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plaintiffs alleged that the City’s ordinance violated their rights under the First, Eighth, Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs argued that the ordinances criminalized survival activities, including eating and possessing public belongings in public spaces, and unconstitutionally targeted unhoused individuals while permitting identical conduct by people who had housing. They further argued that the ordinances criminalized homelessness by banning sleeping on public property while the City of San Rafael failed to provide enough alternative shelter for the City’s homeless population. The case was assigned to Judge Edward M. Chen.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, Judge Trina Thompson held a hearing on the plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order. The following day, she granted the motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the city from enforcing the ordinance until a hearing on the preliminary injunction could be held. The court determined that the plaintiffs sufficiently showed that they were likely to suffer irreparable injury if the ordinance went into effect, that the plaintiffs would endure serious hardships under the ordinance, that temporary relief would serve the public interest, and that there were “serious questions” on the merits of the case. On September 6, 2023, the court held a non-evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction and the defendant officials of the City of San Rafael were served. The court extended the temporary restraining order on September 7, 2023.\n\nThe court held a settlement conference with the parties on September 20, 2023. The plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on September 26, 2023, adding as plaintiffs two additional individuals and the San Rafael Homeless Union. The court held a hearing for the motion on the preliminary injunction on October 2 and 3 and granted in part and denied in part the preliminary injunction on October 19. The court permitted the City to enforce the ordinance but required the City to: allow 400 square feet campsites housing up to four people that were 100 feet apart; provide assistance to campers who needed to move to a designated space; provide replacements to plaintiffs who did not have tents or bedding that could fit within the compliant space; designate the permissible campsites that complied with the ordinance as modified by the preliminary injunction on street level maps; establish a registration process so campers could find permitted campsites; and not evict or prosecute any plaintiff who submitted a request for a reasonable accommodation based on disability unless they were provided with due process. There was also a mens rea requirement for violating camping regulations. The preliminary injunction applied only to residents of the encampment who had standing under this lawsuit as named plaintiffs or as members of the San Rafael Homeless Union.\n\nOn October 26, 2023, one of the named plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the defendants from disrupting his campsite and arresting him for using a pallet under his tent as a foundation. The City opposed the plaintiff’s motion. On November 1, 2023, the court held a status conference and a hearing on the temporary restraining order, which the court denied the following day.\n\nThe court held additional settlement conferences monthly from November 2023 until May 2024. On May 6, 2024, the City amended the ordinance in response to the Court’s preliminary injunction. The amended ordinance allowed campties of 200 square feet for one person and 400 square feet for four individuals, a 10-foot setback from other campsites, and a mens rea requirement for violating camping regulations. Subsequently, the City filed a motion to dismiss the case, or alternatively, to dissolve the preliminary injunction, on May 10, 2024.\n\nThe City then filed a motion for limited relief from the injunction on June 12, 2024 under F.R.C.P. 60(b), as it sought to relocate ten to eleven individuals camping along Francisco Boulevard West in light of alleged fire risks to their encampment. The same day, the court, considering that notice had already been given that campers had 48 hours to relocate, scheduled a hearing on the motion for June 13, 2024. The court held hearings on June 13 and June 14, 2024, and on June 14, Judge Edward M. Chen issued an order conditionally granting the City’s emergency motion for limited relief from the injunction. The court explained that it was an issue of fact whether any of the individuals whom the City sought to relocate from Francisco Boulevard West were covered by the preliminary injunction in this case, and after weighing the likelihood of irreparable injury, the balance of hardships, and the health and safety risks, the court concluded that moving the individuals from the encampment would be permissible.\n\nThe court held settlement conferences at the beginning and end of July 2024. On August 7, 2024, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss and dissolved the preliminary injunction. The court determined that the plaintiffs had not shown a reasonable expectation that the government would reenact its regulation, that the ordinance as amended on May 6, 2024 did not raise the same issues as the original ordinance, and that because the amended ordinance had given the relief sought, the case was now moot. Therefore, the court no longer had jurisdiction to maintain the preliminary injunction, which was rendered moot as well. As of December 2024, this case is closed.",

    "summary/long": "The plaintiffs, represented by Children's Rights, filed this class action suit against the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (DHS) in February 2008 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma. The complaint alleged violations of the First, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq., the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq., and Oklahoma state law. The complaint alleged that DHS placed children in dangerous and inappropriate placements, including extended stays in emergency shelters; failed to monitor the safety of children in DHS custody due to excessive case worker caseloads; failed to provide mental health and other behavioral services; and failed to provide legal representation. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and a permanent injunction enjoining defendants from subjecting plaintiffs to practices that violate their constitutional rights.\n\nIn April 2008, the defendants moved to dismiss the case and several Oklahoma-based children's agencies filed amici curiae briefs in response. In January 2009, Judge Gregory K. Frizzell granted the motion to dismiss claims under federal common law and the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, but denied the motion with regard to the other claims. D.G. v. Henry, 594 F. Supp. 2d 1273 (N.D. Okl. 2009).\n\nOn May 5, 2009, the court certified the class of the plaintiffs as all children who are or will be in the legal custody of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (1) due to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect; or (2) who are or will be adjudicated deprived due to abuse or neglect. The defendants appealed the ruling to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, but in February 2010, the appellate court upheld the class certification.\n\nThe parties then engaged in extensive and contested discovery. The plaintiffs provided five expert reports and filed numerous motions to compel the defendants to produce various items. The defendants moved for summary judgment and to decertify the class. In November and December 2011, the court denied the motion to decertify and granted the motion for summary judgment only as to claims pertaining to rights of familial association and procedural due process. 2011 WL 6009628. The case proceeded towards a trial scheduled for February 2012.\n\nMeanwhile, the parties engaged in court-supervised settlement conferences. By January 2012, they negotiated an agreement providing for structural reorganization of DHS and appointed experts to oversee the development and implementation of the Compromise Settlement Agreement (CSA). After a series of fairness hearings, the court approved the CSA on February 29, 2012.\n\nThe CSA implementation plans provided that the defendant DHS would restructure its agency; improve screening, investigating, and reporting of abuse; reduce the use of emergency shelters; and reduce workloads and improve training for caseworkers. The parties agreed to designate three individuals as Co-Neutrals to act as arbiters of any dispute arising out of the CSA and to evaluate and render judgments about DHS's ongoing compliance efforts. The implementation of the CSA would take at least five years. Additionally, on March 31, 2013, the Court ordered the defendants to pay attorneys' fees and expenses in the amount of about $6 million. 2013 WL 1343151.\n\nAlthough DHS originally planned to exit from the CSA in December 2016, it was unable to do so for failure to adequately comply with its terms. In their August 2018 report, the Co-Neutrals noted that although DHS had made important advancements over the course of its reform, those advances were not yet fully instituted, particularly with respect to manageable caseloads and an adequate array of placements for children. The report noted that in some areas, most critically safety for children in the care and custody of DHS, the department’s efforts had been inadequate.\n\nIn May 2018, the Co-Neutrals requested that the Court suspend the operations of a particular children's center for failure to comply with the CSA. The Court granted this request and DHS complied by relocating the children from that center.\n\nOn June 5, 2018, the court entered a judgment and terminated the case. However, the case was reopened three years later when the parties moved to modify the settlement on December 13, 2021. This motion noted that unforeseen circumstances, namely the COVID-19 pandemic, seriously impacted the defendant’s good faith efforts to comply with the settlement agreement. As a result, the parties agreed to suspend the previously scheduled biannual good faith determinations by the Co-Neutrals during the pandemic recovery period as to some of the defendant's obligations. The court granted the motion the following day.\n\nOn March 22, 2023, the Co-Neutrals determined that the Department had met the two-year continuous period of good faith requirements mandated by the CSA as to the obligations that had not been delayed by COVID-19. On April 24, 2023, the court issued an order terminating these obligations.\n\nTwo years later, on February 11, 2025, the Co-Neutrals filed a final report indicating the defendants had complied for two years with the remaining CSA obligations. A month later, on March 13, the court terminated the defendant's obligations under the CSA. The case is now closed.",

    "summary/long": "This is a case about Houston police arresting individuals without warrants and detaining them without probable cause. On December 5, 2016, two plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated sued the City of Houston under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Represented by private counsel and the Civil Rights Corps, the plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees. They claimed that the City of Houston regularly arrested individuals without warrants and detained them without probable cause hearings for longer than permitted by the United States Constitution.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Kennth M. Hoyt on December 7, 2016. The City filed a motion to dismiss the initial complaint. One of the named plaintiffs withdrew from the case and on March 1, 2017, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to add three more named plaintiffs. As a result, on March 7, the court denied the City's motion to dismiss on grounds of mootness because the filing of an amended complaint renders a prior complaint void and moots any motion to dismiss.\n\nThe City filed an amended motion to dismiss, which was denied on June 6, 2017. The court found that the defendants had essentially admitted that the facts the plaintiffs pleaded were true.\n\nThe case proceeded to discovery, and the parties engaged in lengthy discovery disputes. On August 30, 2018, the District Court issued an order stating that the City of Houston had intentionally destroyed evidence pertinent to the lawsuit. As a result, the Court held that inferences were appropriate: (1) throughout the class period, the City of Houston had a policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who had not received neutral determinations of probable cause within the constitutionally required period of time; (2) throughout the class period, the City’s policymakers were aware of this policy; and (3) the City acted with deliberate indifference with respect to its unconstitutional policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who hadn’t received probable cause hearings in the appropriate amount of time.\n\nOn December 11, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to certify their class. The first amended complaint detailed a single class of plaintiffs seeking compensatory relief, which applied to all those arrested without warrant and held for more than 48 hours without a prompt judicial determination of probable cause.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on December 13, 2018, which added a fifth named plaintiff. Additionally, this second amended complaint defined two classes seeking compensatory relief. The first subclass included all those arrested and held held by the City of Houston without a warrant or a judicial determination of probably cause for 48 hours or more, and the second subclass included those who were arrested and held between 24 and 48 hours.\n\nIn spring 2019, the District Court issued an order overruling a motion from the City that asked the Court to exclude certain documents that they claimed to be privileged from evidence. The plaintiffs filed a motion to compel the city to produce these documents, which was stayed by Judge Hoyt pending the City’s appeal. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals then vacated the District Court’s order with respect to one document, and denied the City’s claim of privilege in all other respects. Upon remand, the District Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to compel.\n\nIn late June 2019, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On July 3, 2019, Judge Hoyt granted the plaintiffs’ earlier motion for class certification. One week later, the City filed a motion to stay the case pending interlocutory appeal regarding the class certification issue, which was denied by the district court in early August. And, shortly after on August 8, 2020 the Fifth Circuit denied the defendants leave to appeal the grant of class certification.\n\nAt some during the summer of 2019, the parties began going through mediation and started settlement negotiations, and on August 13, 2019, a joint order to stay the case pending the finalization of settlement was granted.\n\nIn July 2020, Houston City Council voted to pass a settlement awarding the plaintiffs $1.17 million in exchange for indemnity. The court granted a joint motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on October 22, 2020.\n\nOn March 18, 2021, the court approved the settlement agreement determining it was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class. The settlement payment was $1.17 million.\n\nOn August 9, 2022, the plaintiffs' attorney filed an unopposed motion for attorneys' fees and costs. On September 7, 2022, the court granted the motion for fees and costs. Attorneys' fees were $93, 241.28 (part of the total $1.17 million settlement).

    "summary/long": "In the aftermath of George Floyd's death in May 2020, nationwide protests erupted, including a significant demonstration in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 31, 2020. During the protest, the Fort Lauderdale Police Department (FLPD) attempted to disperse the crowd through use of tear gas and kinetic impact projectiles, otherwise known as rubber bullets.\n\nThe plaintiff in this case, a participant in the May 2020 demonstration, alleged she was shot in the eye by a direct impound round, causing severe, painful, and permanent physical and emotional injuries. In response to her injuries, she filed a lawsuit against the City of Fort Lauderdale and several FLPD officers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on May 31, 2022. The eight-count complaint alleged violations of her constitutional rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as state law claims for battery and negligence. The plaintiff asserted municipal liability under a Monell “failure to train” theory. The plaintiff sought damages, including punitive damages, prejudgment interest on liquidated damages, costs, and compensatory damages. The matter was assigned to District Judge Rodolfo Armando Ruiz II.\n\nThe plaintiff filed an amended complaint on October 27, 2022, wherein she revised the list of named FLDP defendants and added two additional counts: a claim against the City of Fort Lauderdale for negligent instruction, training, and supervision of its officers and a Fourteenth Amendment Procedural Due Process claim against all defendants, alleging that FLDP officers did not issue a proper dispersal order prior to deploying force. For these additional claims, the plaintiff sought compensatory damages, costs, and injunctive relief.\n\nOn November 2 and November 10, 2022, the defendants filed a pair of motions to dismiss. Judge Ruiz issued an order on June 1, 2023, granting in part the various motions. 2023 WL 3750581. Specifically, he dismissed without prejudice with leave to amend the plaintiff’s Fourteenth Amendment claims, her Fourth Amendment claims, and, with respect to the city only, her First Amendment claim. Judge Ruiz also ordered the defendant to file a Second Amended Complaint in compliance with his order on or before June 23, 2023.\n\nAfter receiving an extension of time, the plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint on July 6, 2023. Among other things, the amended complaint pursued a bifurcated approach wherein the plaintiff alleged separate causes of action against the city and the other defendants, where applicable, and separated First Amendment claims into two claims–one for unlawful restriction on speech and the other for retaliation. The complaint also provided a name for one of the three John Doe officers and included as an additional defendant the city’s police chief.\n\nThe plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint on September 13, 2023, in which she made relatively modest changes to certain of her claims and removed references to one of the named FLPD defendants added in the Second Amended Complaint, substituting back John Doe 1.\n\nThe defendants sought summary judgment in a pair of filings made on December 5, 2023, and January 12, 2024. The plaintiff also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on January 12, 2024.\n\nOn September 4, 2024, Judge Ruiz issued an order granting in part and denying in part the various summary judgment motions. 2024 WL 4039849. Specifically, he granted summary judgment in favor of the individual defendants on all counts, citing both qualified and statutory immunity. With respect to the city, he denied summary judgment on the two First Amendment claims under the plaintiff’s failure-to-train Monell theory and denied summary judgment as to the state-law battery claim, holding that it would be up to a jury to determine whether the city was liable for the plaintiff’s injuries “through its policies, procedures, and officers’ conduct.”\n\nOn October 28, 2024, before the case proceeded to trial, the parties attended mediation and came to a full and final settlement of all claims, pending final consideration and approval by the Fort Lauderdale City Commission. The city commission approved [https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article296526834.html] a $1.975 million settlement at its meeting on December 3, 2024. As part of the settlement, FLPD also agreed to overhaul its internal policies. The court approved the settlement on December 23, 2024.",

    "summary/long": "This case challenged the Trump Administration’s shutdown of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). On February 8, 2025, the Acting Director of the CFPB instructed the agency’s employees to “stand down” from performing any work and notified the Federal Reserve that the CFPB would be requesting $0 for the upcoming quarter. Elon Musk was also involved, posting “CFPB RIP” on social media one day before the announcement. This shutdown occurred within the broader context of the Trump Administration’s efforts to dismantle several federal agencies and shrink others.\n\nOn February 12, 2025, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, along with the Economic Action Maryland Fund, initiated legal action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland by filing a lawsuit against the CFPB and its Acting Director for violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs, represented by the Democracy Forward Foundation, sought a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and declaratory relief, with the goal of preventing the defunding of the CFPB. They argued that the government’s actions were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and exceeded statutory authority. The plaintiffs also contended that they would be irreparably harmed by the Administration’s unlawful action, as they heavily rely on the CFPB. The case was assigned to Judge Matthew J. Maddox on February 14, 2025.\n\nIn their motion for a temporary restraining order (filed on February 12, 2025), the plaintiffs asked the Court to enjoin the Administration from defunding the CFPB. They argued that such actions violated the APA and would cause imminent injury. With the loss of consumer protection benefits and resources provided by the CFPB, the plaintiffs claimed that they would need to divert resources from other essential functions. The next day, a joint motion was filed to convert the request for a temporary restraining order into a motion for a preliminary injunction, along with a proposed briefing schedule. The motion stipulated that the CFPB would refrain from taking any actions to defund the agency until the motion expires on February 28, 2025.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, 22 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. The states argued that the absence of statutorily mandated services provided by the CFPB would harm consumers’ wellbeing as well as states’ own efforts to enforce consumer protection laws.\n\nOn March 14, 2025, the Court denied the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary relief. Judge Maddox stated that because, “Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, their motion for the extraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive relief must be denied.” He further explained:\n\nFor the Court to intervene and entangle itself in the Bureau’s administrative processes before the agency has made any final decision about the disposition of its operating and reserve funds—and without clear indication that an unlawful and injurious decision will be made imminently—would exceed the bounds of the Court’s proper role and jurisdiction. It would be especially improper for the Court to risk exceeding its limited role on a preliminary basis.\n\nOn May 29, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the case. Given the defendants' representation that \"there is no mechanism by which Defendant Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can transfer away money from, or otherwise relinquish control over the money in, the Bureau Fund,\" except for \"internally transferring reserve funds to use for operations,\" the plaintiffs said they wished to dismiss their case. \"If Defendants later transfer Bureau funds in contradiction of their repeated representations about their lawful authorities, abilities, and intent, Plaintiffs will undertake further actions as appropriate.\"\n\nThis case is closed.",

    "summary/long": "On October 15, 2018, individuals without secure housing filed this class-action lawsuit suing the city of Grants Pass, Oregon (the “City”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by the Oregon Law Center, the plaintiffs challenged the City’s enforcement of Grants Pass’s anti-sleeping ordinance, anti-camping ordinance, park exclusion ordinance, and criminal trespass laws stemming from violations of these ordinances as unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S Constitution. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief prohibiting the City from enforcing the ordinances and criminal trespass laws until the class members had the opportunity to obtain shelter. The plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief as well as costs and attorneys’ fees. The plaintiffs’ counsel had contacted the City on September 10, 2018, to demand relief, but the parties were unable to resolve the dispute outside of court.\n\nThe case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Mark D. Clarke. Both parties consented to jurisdiction by a magistrate judge for the entirety of the case. On January 2, 2019, the City amended its ordinance, removing “sleeping” from the definition of camping in an attempt to comply with a previous case, Martin v. Boise, which held that an ordinance punishing people for sleeping outside was unconstitutional when there was nowhere else for them to go. In amending its ordinance, the City meant to clarify that the act of “sleeping” no longer automatically constituted illegal “camping,” permitting those without shelter to sleep or rest in the City’s parks.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 28, 2019, to add information about two additional plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on March 8, 2019, adding an additional individual to the plaintiff’s attorneys.\n\nOn March 13, 2019, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. After a hearing, Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification on August 7, 2019. 2019 WL 3717800. The court defined the class as: \"All involuntarily homeless individuals living in Grants Pass, Oregon, including homeless individuals who sometimes sleep outside city limits to avoid harassment and punishment by Defendant as addressed in this lawsuit.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs then filed their third amended complaint on November 13, 2019 to add an additional challenge to park exclusions under the Due Process Clause. On January 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and requested an oral argument. The defendant responded with a joint motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Magistrate Judge Clarke denied the defendant’s motion for summary judgment, and he granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. Magistrate Judge Clarke granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim because the park exclusions would go into effect immediately and were not stayed for appeal, leaving a person excluded from a park subject to arrest for reentry as soon as they received the exclusion notice. The court concluded that the deficient appeal procedures were unconstitutional and violated the procedural protections of due process. However, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on their equal protection claim because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the ordinances were selectively enforced and motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Likewise, summary judgment was denied on the plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim because they failed to convince the court that they had a liberty interest to sleep or camp in a public place and had not shown that the city engaged in “conscience shocking behavior.” 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nThe court also found that the ordinances violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment because they punished people for sleeping or resting outside with a blanket when they had no other place to go due to the City’s lack of adequate shelter. The ordinances also violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because the plaintiffs were being punished for trying to live, and likely could not afford to pay the fines, resulting in additional fees and punishments that made it even more difficult for them to find housing. 2020 WL 4209227.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Judge Clarke issued an injunction enjoining the enforcement of three city ordinances against the plaintiff class. The City could not enforce the park exclusion ordinance, which allowed police officers to issue an order barring a person from all City park properties if the individual had been issued two or more citations violating regulations relating to city parks, or one citation violating state laws while on city park property. Unless it gave at least a 24-hour warning, the City also could not enforce the camping ordinances, which prohibited setting up or remaining on public property. Finally, the City could not enforce the criminal trespassing ordinance in city parks during nighttime hours.\n\nThat same day, the city of Grants Pass appealed the district court’s grant of partial summary judgment and its permanent injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35752). The Ninth Circuit’s decision on September 28, 2022, affirmed that the city’s “anti-camping” ordinance prohibiting individuals from using bedding supplies violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. The case was remanded with direction to the district court to narrow its injunction to only enjoin enforcement of ordinances against unhoused individuals who take necessary measures to keep themselves warm and safe when there is no shelter available. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment on the procedural due process claim and remanded with instructions to dismiss the claim as moot because the City amended the ordinance so it was no longer unconstitutional. 50 F.4th 787.\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs filed a motion for costs and attorneys’ fees on September 9, 2020. The parties thereafter, by October 5, 2020, reached an agreement for the plaintiffs to receive $300,000 with interest for their costs and attorneys’ fees. 2020 WL 6060925. Three days later, on October 8, the City appealed to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-35881).\n\nThe City filed a petition for en banc review with the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2022.\n\nOn July 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit amended the opinion it issued on September 28, 2022. It amended the order to deny the petition for rehearing en banc, reasoning that Grants Pass provided exceptionally limited protection and was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. The court further stated that future petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc would not be entertained in this case.\n\nIn response to the Ninth Circuit’s denial for a rehearing en banc, the City filed a petition for writ of certiorari on August 22, 2023, requesting the Supreme Court to rule on whether laws regulating camping on public property constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. 2023 WL 5530379.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its decision, ruling 6-3 to reverse and remand. 2024 WL 3208072.  The majority’s decision, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, reasoned that the Eighth Amendment focuses on the “method or kind of punishment” that may be imposed after conviction, and not on whether the government may criminalize particular behavior, and therefore could not support the relief sought. The Court further held that the punishments imposed by Grants Pass under the challenged statute were not cruel and unusual. The majority opinion further rejected the argument that laws against camping criminalized the “status” of homelessness, reasoning that the challenged law applied to anyone who undertook the act of camping, rejecting plaintiffs’ argument “camping, for people without other housing options, was “involuntary” and thus could not be criminalized. The Court therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nIn a concurrence, Justice Thomas noted his opinion that the 1962 case rendering “status crimes” unconstitutional was wrongly decided, and rejected the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause governed civil penalties because they could later become criminal offenses. The dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Sotomayor and joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, urged that the Eighth Amendment prohibits criminalizing the status of homelessness by making it a crime to sleep outside when a person has no other place to sleep. The dissent further noted that the Court had not decided whether the ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines Clause, Due Process, or state law.\n\nOn September 23, 2024, this matter was remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of approving a settlement agreement between the two parties. The parties informed the court that the matter was settled, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.",

    "summary/long": "This case is about enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. On October 7, 2024, the U.S. government brought a lawsuit against the City of Durham, North Carolina, in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. In its complaint, the government alleged the following facts: The Durham Fire Department (“FDF”), which is overseen by the city of Durham, used a multiple-choice and written test, the Comprehensive Examination Battery (“CEB”), to screen entry-level firefighter applications. Applicants who scored less than 70% on the CEB did not advance in the screening process. Plaintiff argued that the CEB disproportionately affected black applicants’ employment prospects, even though the CEB was not meaningfully related to the job or otherwise necessary. There was a measurable difference in CEB outcome based on race: Around 37% of black test-takers failed the test, as opposed to around 11% of white test-takers who failed. Plaintiff also alleged that even for applicants who passed, however, there continued to be race-related discrimination: 32% of black applicants who passed the test and were eligible for an in-person interview did not receive one; only 14% of white applicants similarly positioned did not receive an interview invitation. Plaintiff also asserted that the CEB was not job-related, nor consistent with business necessity – even if the CEB were, however, plaintiff also reasoned that alternative selection procedures could have been used. Plaintiff set forth in its complaint that the city of Durham was in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e (“Title VII”), by engaging in a pattern of employment discrimination against black applicants. Plaintiff sought a court order mandating the following: that Durham no longer use written tests for entry-level firefighter positions if they have disparate racial impact and are not job-related nor otherwise do not meet the requirements of Title VII; provide remedial relief to people who had suffered individual loss as a result of the discrimination alleged in the complaint; and adopt any other non-discriminatory measures to correct the present effects of its discriminatory policies.\n\nOn the same day, the parties filed a joint motion for provisional approval and entry of consent decree. The parties had jointly negotiated a consent decree to resolve the litigation, which would require: (1) Durham replace the challenged CEB exam with new employment screening practices which comply with Title VII; and (2) Durham provide individual relief to eligible black applicants who were excluded from further consideration as entry-level firefighters due to the CEB. With respect to the first requirement, Durham agreed to not administer any written exam for use in selecting entry-level firefighters without the assent of the U.S. government or court approval, and to hire a Test Developer to explore other selection devices that would reduce or eliminate disparate racial impact on applicants. With respect to the second requirement, Durham agreed to pay $980,000 into a settlement fund, which would be used to compensate eligible claimants. A copy of the proposed consent decree is available on the Clearinghouse website. The parties asked the court to provisionally approve that agreement, to schedule a Fairness Hearing, and stay all deadlines in the litigation pending determination on the consent decree.\n\nThe matter was assigned to Judge Thomas D. Schroeder.\n\nOn December 16, 2024, a Motion Hearing was held. While a transcript of that hearing is not available to the Clearinghouse, the court ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing, to address whether Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 585 (2009), applied in this matter. In Ricci, which involved a similar Title VII challenge to a written exam requirement for firefighter applicants, set a high standard that there must be a “strong basis in evidence” that without the race-based remedy, the organization would be liable under Title VII.\n\nThe American Alliance for Equal Rights, a non-profit member organization focused on racial discrimination issues, filed a motion for leave to file an amicus brief in opposition to the proposed consent decree and participate in oral arguments. The American Alliance for Equal Rights argued that this case directly implicates their interests, as the government’s theory of disparate-impact liability would force employers to inject race in employment decision-making processes. The court granted the organization leave to file.\n\nThe American Alliance for Equal Rights did submit its amicus brief on January 15, 2025. In that amicus brief, the organization argued that Durham currently used a race-neutral test. They argued that the consent decree would require the city to implement a race-based test, and urged the court to avoid granting such a remedy as the organization believed that would itself violate Title VII’s bar on intentional discrimination.\n\nOn January 15, 2025, plaintiff submitted the requested brief, on the applicability of Ricci. In that brief, plaintiff argued that (1) Ricci was distinguishable and that the court should be guided by United States v. North Carolina, 80 F.3d 574, 581 (4th Cir. 1999), which set a more lax fair-and-reasonable standard and which is controlling law in the Fourth Circuit, and (2) even if Ricci applied, there was sufficiently strong basis in evidence to support the U.S.’s prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination and the consent decree as it was formulated.\n\nThe court had not yet issued a decision on this matter. The U.S. government changed presidential administrations on January 20, 2025. Following that change in administration, on February 25, 2025, the U.S. government filed notice that it was voluntarily dismissing its claims in this matter. No further update has been made at this time.",

    "summary/long": "In this case challenging the constitutionality of a 1976 federal statute that prohibits the Military Health System from providing coverage for medically necessary surgical treatments for gender dysphoria for dependents of service members, a federal district court judge held that the prohibition violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, a ​transgender woman receiving health insurance through the U.S. military's TRICARE program as a dependent of a former servicemember and her father, a former servicemember, filed the case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine. The plaintiffs sued the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”), its component agency U.S. Defense Health Agency, and TRICARE Health Plan (“Tricare”), the U.S. military’s healthcare program administered through the DoD. ​The Plaintiffs challenged a TRICARE provision that bars coverage of any surgery that “improves physical appearance” without “significantly restor[ing] functions,” including “sex gender changes.” 10 U.S.C. § 1079(a)(11). The plaintiffs contended that this exclusion barred the former service member’s daughter from receiving necessary procedures to treat her diagnosed gender dysphoria. They alleged the Defendants’ enforcement of this provision to deny coverage of medically necessary gender transition surgeries violated the Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\nPlaintiffs, represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) and private counsel, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1079 (a)(11) (“Section 1079”), which mandates the categorical exclusion of all surgical treatments for gender transition in the military’s medical coverage for eligible dependents of service members, violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs also alleged that TRICARE’s refusal to cover surgical treatments for gender transition for eligible dependents of service members, including by the application and enforcement of the exclusion in Section 1079, violated the federal Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794. Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, permanent injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the statutory exclusion, damages, and attorneys’ fees.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on January 27, 2023, in which they added an additional plaintiff, another transgender woman and dependent of a former service member who had been denied healthcare coverage by TRICARE for surgical procedures necessary to treat her gender dysphoria.\n\nOn December 1, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and a stipulation of voluntary dismissal, in which they dismissed with prejudice their Due Process and Rehabilitation Act claims, and withdrew their damage claims. The DoD filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on February 16, 2024, and both parties completed their briefing on the cross-motions for summary judgment by April 5, 2024.\n\nOn November 1, 2024, District Judge Nancy Torresen granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on their as-applied Equal Protection claim, finding that the TRICARE statutory exclusion discriminated based on sex and transgender status. The court relied on well-established precedents which instruct that sex- and gender-based classifications invoke intermediate scrutiny, and on Bostock v. Clayton County [../../../../case/17313], 590 U.S. 644, 669 (2020) to apply intermediate scrutiny to claims of gender-identity discrimination. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the court found that the DoD failed to identify any important governmental objective to justify the exclusion and raised only technical and procedural objections to the plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims; accordingly, the court granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs as to their as-applied Equal Protection claim. However, the court granted partial summary judgment to the DoD as to the plaintiffs' facial Equal Protection claim, finding that the statute could be interpreted in a constitutional manner. The court issued a declaratory judgment stating that the statutory exclusion was unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiffs, and ordered the parties to meet and confer by November 15, 2024 to determine whether injunctive relief was necessary.\n\nFollowing the Court’s order to meet and confer, the parties filed a joint order on November 15, 2024, stating that they have conferred and jointly believed that all remaining issues in the case could be resolved through settlement without the need for further Court intervention, and that no injunctive relief was necessary at the time of the filing. The parties also requested that the Court defer entering a judgment while settlement negotiations were ongoing.\n\nOn December 13, 2024, the House of Representatives filed a Motion to Intervene and stated its intent to appeal the Court’s decision on the cross-motions for summary judgment once the Court entered judgment in this case. Specifically, the House of Representatives noted its intent to appeal the Court’s determination that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause as applied to the plaintiffs and to defend the constitutionality of the statute, claiming that the Department of Justice had failed to substantively defend the statute’s constitutionality and noting that the DOJ appeared unlikely to contest the Court’s decision.\n\nIn a December 16, 2024 Joint Status Report, the parties reiterated their belief that the case should be resolved via a settlement agreement and expressed their mutual opposition to the House of Representatives’ motion to intervene. On December 20, 2024, the parties voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice and without attorneys’ fees or costs to either party. Two days later, the House of Representatives filed a notice in the case, in which it claimed that its pending intervention motion was not moot following the stipulated dismissal of the case. On January 3, 2025, both parties to the case filed responses opposing the House of Representatives’ intervention in the case; on January 8, 2025, the House withdrew its motion to intervene.\n\nGiven that the motion to intervene has been withdrawn and the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal of the case, this case is effectively closed.",

    "summary/long": "On September 19, 2019, five asylum-seeking parents, on their own behalf and on behalf of their minor children, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"). The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, the National Immigrant Justice Center, and the American Immigration Council, sought monetary relief and attorneys fees. The plaintiffs alleged both negligence on part of the United States government and that the government caused intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\") through its child-separation policy. The government separated the asylum-seeking parents from their children, delayed providing parents and children information of each other’s whereabouts and well-being, failed to facilitate adequate communication between the parents and their children while separated, and failed to implement a system to ensure families could be reunited. The government did this deliberately, plaintiffs alleged, to deter other parents with children from seeking asylum in the United States. The case was assigned to Judge Susan Bolton.\n\nOn December 23, 2019, the United States moved to dismiss the suit for lack of jurisdiction, citing sovereign immunity not waived by the FTCA. The district court denied the United States' motion on March 30, 2020, holding (1) the family separation alleged in the suit was a persuasive analogy to private conduct such that plaintiffs had established subject-matter jurisdiction under the FTCA and (2) neither the due care nor the discretionary function exception to the FTCA applied because the United States was not enforcing federal law when it separated plaintiffs and their children. 2020 WL 1698191. The United States moved for leave to appeal the district court's order on May 29, 2020, which was denied by the Judge Bolton on July 6, 2020 because the United States failed to present exceptional circumstances such that interlocutory review would be appropriate. 2020 WL 5232560.\n\nThe United States filed its answer to the complaint on May 13, 2020 and the parties commenced discovery in July 2020. The parties filed numerous joint motions to stay proceedings while they explored a possible settlement. During this time, the 2020 presidential election resulted in a transfer of power from the Trump Administration to the Biden Administration.\n\nProceedings remained stayed until January 27, 2022 when the Court scheduled a status conference. Following the status conference, discovery continued through 2022. In January 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions seeking evidentiary sanctions against the defendants for the production of documents after the close of discovery.\n\nThe United States filed a motion for summary judgment and submitted a statement of facts on March 9, 2023. The defendant denounced the challenged separation of families procedures as the policy decisions made by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice during the former Trump Administration. Nonetheless, the defendant contended that the FTCA does not permit recovery in tort for harms asserted to arise from policy decisions (the so-called discretionary function exception). The plaintiffs also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on March 9 specifically with regard to their IIED and negligence claims.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, the District Court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for sanctions. The Court granted for the admission of the certain documents and handwritten notes if offered by the plaintiffs at trial and precluded the defendants from using them.\n\nOn October 24, 2023, the Court also denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, while granting in part the plaintiffs' motion. The Court denied the defendant's motion because they had not shown that the discretionary function exception barred the plaintiffs’ claims. With regard to the plaintiffs' negligence claim, the Court concluded that the United States owed the plaintiffs a duty of care, but determined that issues of material fact existed as to whether the United States breached its duty. The Court denied the plaintiffs' IIED claim. 2023 WL 7102132.\n\nFollowing a scheduling conference, a bench trial was set for April 23, 2024. However, on April 10, 2024, the parties filed a notice of conditional settlements with regard to all claims. That same day, the court granted the stipulation and vacated the pretrial and trial deadlines it had originally set.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the parties moved for court approval over the settlement agreement, which the court then granted the next day. The plaintiffs received $1,353,000. The portion of the settlement for the minor plaintiffs were placed in a pooled trust.\n\nThe parties then proceeded to file status updates every 60 days with the court with regard to finalization of the settlement. Following resolution, on October 17, 2024, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the case. The court, thus, dismissed the case with prejudice on October 22, 2024.\n\nThe case is considered closed.",

    "summary/long": "On February 10, 2020, fourteen prisoners at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, Mississippi, filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. Press reports [https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/14/us/jay-z-yo-gotti-mississippi-prisons-lawsuit-trnd/index.html] connected this sue to entertainment mogul Jay-Z, who had the month before written an open letter to Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant decrying the conditions at state correctional facilities. The plaintiffs claimed that state officials were aware of and deliberately indifferent to inhumane conditions, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that Parchman’s chronic understaffing and overcrowding, frequent outbreaks of violence, and physical neglect to the facilities violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe plaintiffs sued the Commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Corrections and the Superintendent of the Mississippi Penitentiary under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages. The plaintiffs outlined how Parchman’s frequent outbreaks of violence culminated in eight deaths in the first month of 2020. The understaffing and overcrowding at Parchman led to severe failure to provide adequate living conditions, including exposure to raw sewage and extreme temperatures, denial of urgent medical care, and food and water unfit for human consumption. The case was assigned to District Judge Debra Brown.\n\nOn March 2, 2021, Judge Brown dismissed the plaintiffs’ complaint for failure to provide adequate notice to the defendants of the claims against them. The plaintiffs filed their fifth amended complaint on March 16, 2021, resolving these issues.\n\nThe defendant moved to dismiss the amended complaint less than two weeks later on March 30, 2021, raising qualified immunity and asserting that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim or to allege physical injuries, as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act.\n\nOn November 2, 2021, Judge Brown dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims for compensatory damages to the extent that the claims were based on mental or emotional, rather than physical, injuries.  The court also dismissed the plaintiffs’ allegation under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) that the defendants conspired to deprive plaintiffs of equal protection because the allegations failed to allege that racial animus motivated the conspiracy.  In the same order, however, the court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis of qualified immunity, finding that the plaintiffs pleaded facts that, if proven, would amount to violation of clearly established constitutional rights.\n\nOn December 28, 2021, Judge Brown (who had become chief judge) reassigned the matter to Judge Sharion Aycock.\n\nDiscovery proceeded with several interruptions over the next several years with parties scheduling depositions and filing motions with respect to expert testimony. On March 4, 2022, defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' fifth amended complaint. The motion was granted in part on March 22, dismissing the claims against Marshal Turner, superintendent of Parchman, but preserving all other claims.\n\nOn February 9, 2024, plaintiffs moved to certify their class. On September 23, 2024, Judge Aycock rejected certification of the class on the basis that the plaintiffs failed to establish that the putative class members’ claims each depended upon a common issue such that its resolution would resolve the claims of all members of the class.  The order note that resolving claims challenged by qualified immunity required proof that each Defendant was aware of each specific allegedly unconstitutional condition that each Plaintiff faced and failed to respond as a reasonable officer would have done under the circumstances. The order also noted the length of the class period and the variations in violations raised by different plaintiffs.\n\nOn October 23, 2024, defendants moved to sever the plaintiffs' claims into separate civil actions, capitalizing on the court's opinion denying class certification in arguing that severing the Plaintiffs’ claims into separate actions, or at least holding separate trials, would help the court to avoid prejudice and delay and ensure fairness of proceedings.\n\nOn November 13, 2024, the court held that the appropriate resolution was for each individual plaintiff to file their own lawsuit.  The court ordered the plaintiffs to limit their separate lawsuits to the claims raised in this lawsuit and to tailor each case to each respective plaintiff.  The parties expected to complete remaining discovery in the new cases.\n\nOn January 6, 2025, Justice Aycock dismissed plaintiffs' claims without prejudice. This case is now closed.",
