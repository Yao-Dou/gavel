        "reasoning": "I reviewed the Complaint, Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Defendants’ Opposition, and other case documents for explicit references to the legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims. The Complaint alleges two counts: one under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), specifically citing 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), and the other under the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Complaint and Motion repeatedly refer to the APA as the statutory mechanism for challenging agency action as arbitrary and capricious. The Spending Clause is raised as a substantive right, not a vehicle for suit. The Defendants' Opposition also acknowledges the APA as the asserted vehicle, then contests jurisdiction under APA exceptions and the Tucker Act, but does not identify any other vehicle invoked by Plaintiff. There is no indication of any other statutory or judge-made vehicle (e.g., § 1983, Bivens) in any document. Therefore, the sole relevant vehicle is the APA. Evidence is quoted directly where the APA is invoked as the basis for suit.",

The Complaint asserts two bases: violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and violation of the Spending Clause (U.S. Const., Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 1). The APA is a procedural/statutory vehicle, not a substantive right, so it is excluded per instructions. The only substantive constitutional provision Erie County alleges was violated is the Spending Clause. No other constitutional provisions (e.g., First, Fifth, or Fourteenth Amendments) or statutes (e.g., anti-discrimination statutes) are alleged in the pleadings or motion as having been violated by defendants in this action. Although related litigation is briefly referenced as alleging violations of the First and Fifth Amendments and “separation of powers,” those are not pleaded as bases in this case. The Defendants’ Opposition confirms Plaintiff’s claims are based on the Spending Clause and the APA. There are no other statutory or constitutional sources of rights at issue.",

There is no evidence of a settlement agreement (written or oral) between the parties, nor any listing of substantive terms agreed to as a basis for dismissal. The only change referenced is the defendant's unilateral change in policy, not any negotiated agreement. The dismissal is without prejudice and expressly tied to the defendant's changed policy, not to any mutual contractual settlement. No document contains terms typically found in a settlement agreement (e.g., payment, future conduct, releases, confidentiality, etc.) that are independent of court order.

However, before the court ruled on the motion or any substantive issue, the Plaintiff filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, stating the case was being dismissed without prejudice because Defendant had changed its certification requirements. The court then entered a minute order dismissing the case without prejudice. There is no evidence of any substantive decision or order by the court on the merits or on any motion; the only ruling is the court’s routine dismissal upon plaintiff’s notice.

The plaintiffs' prayers for relief and motions clearly state their requested remedies. The defendants' answer contains only general denials and affirmative defenses but does not itself request any court-ordered relief beyond dismissal and attorneys' fees. No other party seeks separate or additional remedies. Each distinct remedy requested by the plaintiffs is listed as its own entry, quoting exact language from the documents. No defendant counterclaims or requests relief aside from requesting dismissal and attorney fees. The case was ultimately dismissed voluntarily, but that is not a remedy requested from the court; it is procedural.

        "reasoning": "I reviewed all provided documents, including the original and amended complaints, court orders, motions, and stipulations. The task is to extract the duration of all settlement obligations (each as a separate entry), where a 'settlement' is defined as a negotiated agreement between parties that resolves a dispute, as opposed to a formal order or judgment issued by a court. Only settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order or judgment should be included. I carefully searched for any mention of settlements, settlement agreements, or negotiated obligations between the parties that specify a duration. The docket and stipulation of voluntary dismissal indicate that the case was dismissed voluntarily by stipulation of the parties, but there is no indication of a separate settlement agreement containing obligations of any duration. The stipulation simply states dismissal without prejudice, with each side to bear its own costs and fees, and does not include any terms, obligations, or durations. No settlement agreement or settlement obligations (with or without duration) appear anywhere in the pleadings, motions, orders, or stipulation. All other references in the documents relate to claims, orders, class certification, or injunctive relief requested or denied by the court, not to negotiated, non-judicial settlements. Therefore, no settlement obligations with a specified or implied duration were found.",

The case was voluntarily dismissed by stipulation pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), with each side to bear its own costs and fees, and without prejudice. There is no language retaining court jurisdiction to enforce any settlement, and there is no mention of a settlement being entered as an order, judgment, or otherwise presented to the court for enforcement.

The plaintiffs did seek preliminary injunctive relief, class certification, and other remedies, but at no point did the court enter a decree such as a preliminary or permanent injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction. The court denied the motion for preliminary injunction (Decision and Order, 6/4/2024), denied class certification, and ultimately the case was dismissed voluntarily without a decree being entered.

The CSA itself, as approved by the court (Final Order Approving Compromise and Settlement Agreement), is a stipulated judgment enforceable by the court, and it sets forth the duration and termination conditions for the obligations imposed. The obligations were to remain in effect until the Co-Neutrals found, for a continuous period of at least two years, that the Department made good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward each Target Outcome, at which point the obligations would terminate. These terms were later modified during the COVID Recovery Period, bifurcating the performance metrics into 'Non-Impacted' and 'Delayed' measures, with obligations ending for each category after two years of good faith determinations. The final court order dated March 13, 2025, confirms termination of all obligations under the decree. All extracted entries are based on direct court orders or stipulated judgments, and each entry is supported by verbatim evidence from the documents.",

Yarbrough was approved by the court and incorporated into both an 'Order' and 'Judgment' (see Order Approving Settlement, Dkt. 778 and Judgment, Dkt. 779). This was further confirmed by subsequent orders and opinions, including the March 13, 2025 Opinion and Order, which treat the CSA as a court-approved and enforceable agreement. The CSA itself explicitly states that it is subject to court approval and would be entered as a judgment (see, e.g., CSA § 1.5, 2.2, 3.2). All obligations of the settlement were thus incorporated into a court order and judgment, and none are identified in the documents as separate, non-judicial settlement obligations. Accordingly, there are no standalone settlement obligations with a defined duration that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.",

        "reasoning": "I carefully reviewed the Compromise and Settlement Agreement, the Final Order Approving Compromise and Settlement Agreement, the Joint Motion to Modify Settlement Agreement, the Agreement to Amend (Exhibit 1), and all subsequent federal court orders and dockets regarding the D.G. v. Henry (Oklahoma DHS) foster care class action. The documents confirm the settlement was not incorporated into a consent decree or order of continuing injunctive relief, but rather was entered as a settlement agreement between the parties which was approved by the court. Critically, the Final Order Approving Compromise and Settlement Agreement states that the case is dismissed with prejudice, but the court 'shall retain jurisdiction solely for the purposes set forth in the Settlement Agreement.' The Settlement Agreement itself explicitly states 'this Settlement Agreement shall be binding and enforceable against the parties, but it is not, nor shall it be construed to be, a consent decree.' It further provides that the Court shall retain limited jurisdiction to enforce the Co-Neutrals' decisions (arbiters of disputes under the Agreement), and to consider any appeal of the Final Report provided therein. The parties repeatedly amended the Settlement Agreement, but at no point was the settlement incorporated into a court order or judgment providing for continuing court-ordered injunctive relief. Instead, the Agreement is enforced via the court’s retained jurisdiction to enter judgment as to Co-Neutrals’ decisions if necessary. This is not the same as a court retaining jurisdiction to enforce a private settlement agreement in the absence of incorporation or consent decree; here, the court's retention of jurisdiction to enforce the settlement is explicit, limited, and spelled out as part of the dismissal with prejudice. The court also entered later orders and judgments adopting Co-Neutral decisions (e.g., in 2018 for the Laura Dester shelter), but these were done pursuant to the settlement’s terms for dispute resolution and enforcement. This matches the 'Kokkonen retention' model, where the court expressly retains jurisdiction to enforce a private settlement agreement as a condition of dismissal. Therefore, based on the explicit language retaining court jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, but not converting it into a consent decree or incorporating the terms into an order of ongoing injunctive relief, the settlement is court-enforced.",

DHS is required to submit regular (at least monthly) performance data and progress reports to the Co-Neutrals and plaintiffs, measuring progress toward baselines and target outcomes approved by the Co-Neutrals for each performance area.\n\n3. The Co-Neutrals have free access to DHS staff, records, and facilities, and may conduct independent verification and analysis of DHS data and practices.\n\n4. The Co-Neutrals must issue twice-annual public commentaries regarding DHS's progress and, at designated intervals, must determine whether DHS is making 'good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress' toward the targets. The Co-Neutrals' findings are final and enforceable, subject only to a narrow right of appeal to the court on an arbitrary and capricious standard.\n\n5. If DHS fails to achieve positive trending or begins to trend negatively in any performance area, the Co-Neutrals may require DHS to undertake diagnostic and remedial activities in that area.\n\n6. The court retains ongoing jurisdiction to enforce the decree, including entering judgment on Co-Neutral decisions and barring class members from relitigating the released claims. The action is dismissed with prejudice, but the court's jurisdiction continues as expressly set forth for enforcement.\n\n7. The decree is self-executing, and the obligations remain until the Co-Neutrals issue a final report finding that, for at least a two-year continuous period, DHS has made good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward each target outcome. If the Co-Neutrals make such a finding, the decree terminates as to those measures.\n\n8. The decree was amended in 2021 to provide that, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the twice-annual good faith determinations and reporting would be suspended for certain 'Delayed Performance Area Measures' (therapeutic foster care and selected permanency outcomes) for a defined 'COVID Recovery Period,' and would resume and continue until those measures each achieved two years of good faith findings.\n\n9. As of April 24, 2023, the court ordered and declared the decree satisfied and obligations terminated as to the 'twenty-three Non-Impacted Performance Area Measures.'\n\n10. As of March 13, 2025, the court ordered and declared all remaining obligations under the decree satisfied and terminated as to the seven 'Delayed Performance Area Measures.'
