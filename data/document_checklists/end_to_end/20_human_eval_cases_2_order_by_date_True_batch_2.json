The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., was also cited as a source of enforceable rights, specifically regarding review of agency action. The complaint and court orders reference requirements under NEPA and the APA, and also mention, but do not currently assert, the Endangered Species Act and the National Park Service Organic Act as sources of law being violated. However, for the Endangered Species Act and National Park Service Organic Act, the complaint either reserves the right to amend or only references them as background.

In the Omnibus Order, the caption and multiple sections explicitly identify the presiding judge as 'Hon. Katherine M. Williams.' This is also confirmed in the USCA11 appellate documents, which list 'Hon. Katherine M. Williams' as the trial judge. I did not find references to any other district judges presiding over or making substantive rulings in this case; Judge Jose E. Martinez is mentioned only as the originally assigned judge and recused. No magistrate judge issued any orders or was substantively involved in case management. There is no evidence of any other district judge making rulings. Therefore, the only relevant judge for extraction is Judge Katherine M. Williams.",

There is no indication in any document of a class action under Rule 23 or similar procedural device. No document refers to 'classes' of persons or 'class representatives,' and the Complaint and subsequent orders describe the plaintiffs as environmental groups and their members, not as representatives of a class.

There is no mention of a monitor being appointed, no reference to a monitor in any order, and no monitor's name appears anywhere in the provided documents.

To minimize potential secondary or indirect impacts, silt fencing and metal fencing were installed.

The Preliminary Injunction does not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities, which are solely for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site.\n3.  The Preliminary Injunction shall include among those “who are in active concert or participation with” the State or Federal Defendants or their officers, agents, employees, or attorneys, and thus prohibited from conducting the activities specified above, any contractors, subcontractors, or any other individuals or entities authorized to conduct work on the TNT site or provide detainee transportation or detention services. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2)(C) (including “other persons who are in active concert or participation with” the parties or the parties’ officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys among those bound by any injunction).\n4.  No later than sixty (60) days from the date of this order, and once the population attrition allows for safe implementation of this Order,40 the Defendants shall remove 1) the temporary fencing installed by Defendants to allow Tribe members access to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the erection of the detention camp; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed to support this project.\n5.  Finally, Plaintiffs shall post a bond of $100.",

The Complaint only seeks injunctive and declaratory relief and does not reference any prior or contemporaneous settlement agreement. The subsequent orders and appellate pleadings address preliminary injunctions, TROs, discovery, venue, and substantive and procedural matters, but contain no references to any settlement agreement or motions regarding the enforcement of a settlement. There are no indications of a non-court-ordered settlement (e.g., out-of-court agreement or memorandum of understanding) being disputed, enforced, or invoked in the proceedings.

The documents directly address the legal vehicles (statutory or judge-made) used to bring the claims and cite the statutes under which the plaintiffs assert their right to sue or obtain relief for ultra vires conduct. The Complaint and legal briefing consistently identify the legal vehicles: (1) the cause of action for ultra vires conduct against federal officials (a judge-made, equitable vehicle), (2) the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for claims against agency action (5 U.S.C. § 706), and (3) the Tenth Amendment is invoked as a right, but not as a separate vehicle for enforcement. The Complaint and briefings do NOT invoke 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Bivens, or FTCA, nor do they invoke Ex parte Young or Rule 23. The underlying rights (Tenth Amendment, Posse Comitatus Act, etc.) are not included as vehicles. The Complaint and motions both repeatedly cite the ultra vires doctrine and the APA as the legal mechanisms for their claims. These are supported by direct quotations from the documents.",

Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction both set out detailed requests for specific injunctions and orders. Defendants' filings (their Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion and Corrected Opposition) do not contain any express counterclaims or requests for affirmative relief (other than requests for denial of Plaintiffs' motions or requests for time to respond). Therefore, only Plaintiffs seek specific remedies, and I extracted each distinct remedy as its own entry, quoting the relevant portions verbatim from the documents.",

The appellate order (Ninth Circuit June 19, 2025) grants a stay of the TRO, but does not itself impose a new duration or obligation; it simply stays the district court's order pending appeal. No other document presents a court-ordered obligation with a specific duration. The complaint, motions, and opposition papers request relief or describe actions, but only the district court's TRO is a decree with a duration and an obligation.

Affording the President that deference, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority under § 12406(3), which authorizes federalization of the National Guard when 'the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.' Additionally, the Secretary of Defense’s transmittal of the order to the Adjutant General of the California National Guard—who is authorized under California law to 'issue all orders in the name of the Governor,' CAL.

        "reasoning": "I reviewed all provided case documents for explicit references to the legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—i.e., the 'how' of suing, such as specific statutes granting a right of action or judge-made causes of action (e.g., § 2241 habeas, All Writs Act, etc.). Throughout the pleadings, motions, and orders, the Petitioners bring their claims primarily through a habeas corpus vehicle under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, and also invoke the All Writs Act (28 U.S.C. § 1651) for preliminary injunctive relief. The class complaint and habeas petition, as well as the motions and orders, consistently specify § 2241 and the All Writs Act as the legal basis for their claims and emergency relief. The complaint also references the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. § 2201), but only as a basis for declaratory relief, not as a primary vehicle for challenging detention/removal. There is no mention of vehicles such as Bivens, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, or the FTCA. The class action is certified under Rule 23 but procedural rules like Rule 23 are excluded by the instructions. Thus, the extracted vehicles are: 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas corpus) and the All Writs Act (28 U.S.C. § 1651).",

The evidence is clear on the parties, the nature of the appeals, and the courts involved. All extracted items are supported by direct verbatim quotes from the documents.",

There are also no consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions, nor any class action settlements entered as decrees.

No other enforcement vehicles—such as § 1983, Bivens, APA, or FTCA—are pleaded or relied upon. The underlying rights, remedies, and procedural doctrines are mentioned but not as vehicles. Therefore, the only legal vehicle used to bring the claim is the non-statutory ultra vires cause of action (i.e., judge-made ultra vires review of executive action).",

The Complaint and supporting memorandum explain that AFSA is a professional association and certified exclusive representative for approximately 18,000 active duty members of the Foreign Service. The pleadings do not reference claims brought by individual members nor do they list or describe any individual plaintiffs; instead, AFSA is suing on its own behalf as the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit.

The only decrees found are preliminary injunctions issued by the District Court, which are by their nature temporary and in effect only until further order of the Court or until the appeal is resolved. There is no decree with a set duration (e.g., a fixed number of days or years); the only decree obligation is the preliminary injunction, which remains in effect until lifted, modified, or replaced by a final judgment or appellate order. The D.C. Circuit subsequently stayed the preliminary injunction pending appeal, but again, no fixed duration is specified in any decree. All relevant evidence is included below.",

The documents focus on litigation and court-ordered injunctive relief, not on any negotiated settlement agreements or settlement obligations between the parties. There is no evidence of any out-of-court settlement, negotiated agreement, or obligation of a specified duration that resolves the dispute between the parties outside of a court order or judgment.

The documents include the complaint, briefs, orders, opinions, motions, and docket entries. Nowhere do the documents reference a settlement agreement between the parties, nor do they contain any language about the court retaining jurisdiction to enforce a settlement. The case concerns a challenge to an executive order and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief; the court grants and stays preliminary injunctions, but at no point is there mention of a private settlement, court retention of jurisdiction over a settlement, or an agreement between the parties resolved outside of a formal judgment.

The district court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting implementation of this exclusion, but the D.C. Circuit stayed that injunction pending appeal. The only significant terms of any decree are those set forth in the district court's May 14, 2025, preliminary injunction—now stayed. No consent decree or stipulated judgment is present; the only substantive, court-ordered obligations are from the preliminary injunction order. I extracted the operative terms by reviewing the district court's order and opinion, focusing on the relief actually granted and ordered by the court (as opposed to requested relief in the complaint), and confirmed there are no other court-ordered substantive obligations in the case documents.",

There are no motions or requests by any party to enforce or seek contempt regarding a non-court-ordered settlement, nor are there court actions invoking retained jurisdiction over a settlement. All disputes are over statutory rights, not the enforcement of a negotiated settlement agreement.",
