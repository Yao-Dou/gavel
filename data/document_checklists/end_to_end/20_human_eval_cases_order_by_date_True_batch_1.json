        "reasoning": "To identify the legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims, I examined the Complaint, the United States' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, Denka's Answer and Counterclaims, the Amended Counterclaim, and the relevant portions of the Petition for Review and the published EPA Final Rule. The Complaint explicitly states the statutory authority for the government's action and the sections under which relief is sought. Other filings (e.g., summary judgment, motion to dismiss) reference the legal vehicle only as background. The only vehicle for the United States' main claim is Clean Air Act Section 303, 42 U.S.C. § 7603. There are also references in the Complaint to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, and Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a), but these are not vehicles for substantive claims—they are cited as procedural bases for bringing in a landlord party and for securing relief against a non-operating landowner, not for substantive enforcement of environmental rights. No other legal vehicles for the claims are presented in the case documents. I have quoted only the relevant statutory vehicle(s), omitting references to underlying rights, remedies, and procedural rules.",

I also examined the underlying EPA rulemaking documents for references to any such settlement disputes. The only settlements discussed in the documents pertain to the 2017 Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) between Denka and LDEQ (with EPA participation), but this was an administrative order, not a privately negotiated settlement agreement, and became an enforceable order by the state agency. There are no court orders referencing retained jurisdiction over a private settlement, nor are there any motions or proceedings regarding enforcement or contempt of a settlement agreement. The docket also does not reflect any such motions, and the parties do not reference any settlement outside the 2017 AOC.

They include: (1) the ultra vires cause of action (a judge-made vehicle for non-statutory review of executive action in excess of authority), (2) the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202), and (3) the court's equitable powers for injunctive relief against federal officers—as reflected in the Complaint and the court's orders. There is also a request for mandamus, which is a judge-made vehicle for seeking to compel government action. The Administrative Procedure Act is mentioned in a count, but the court grants relief only on the ultra vires claim and does not address the APA.

Because such actions seek simply to halt or prevent a violation of federal law rather than the award of money damages, they do not ask the Court to imply a new cause of action. To the contrary, the ability to sue to enjoin unlawful and unconstitutional actions by federal officers is the creation of courts of equity and reflects a long history of judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to England.

Race predominated over traditional redistricting principles such as maintaining communities of interest, respecting county and municipal boundaries, and having compact districts.\n165.  The use of race as the predominant factor concerning CDs 1, 2 and 5 is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, including compliance with the VRA.\n166.  Thus, S. 865 violates Plaintiffs’ rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.",

The court's April 25, 2022 Order denied approval of the proposed settlement because it did not have the necessary consent from the full legislature and governor as required for a court-enforceable consent decree. Instead, the parties subsequently resolved their dispute through adoption of a revised House map by ordinary legislation and voluntary dismissal of claims. There is no evidence in any court order or stipulation that the federal court retained jurisdiction to enforce the private settlement under Kokkonen or any similar doctrine. The later voluntary dismissal was under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1), which is not itself court enforcement of a settlement. Thus, the settlement is not court-enforced.",

The record contains extensive pretrial litigation, findings of fact and conclusions of law, and orders addressing the merits, as well as a specific settlement agreement between the SC NAACP and House Defendants regarding certain South Carolina House districts. However, the district court expressly analyzed whether it had authority to approve the parties’ proposed settlement of the House claims as a consent decree and denied approval, stating the requirements for a court-ordered consent decree (see Order, Dkt. 236, 4/25/22). It stated: 'The Panel finds that the House Defendants have not established compliance with Lawyer and declines to approve the proposed settlement.' The parties then resolved the House plan via legislative enactment, not a court-ordered consent decree. No other decree or injunction incorporates the terms of a settlement as a binding court order. All other significant court orders are merits rulings (e.g., enjoining CD1, remanding for remedial maps), not settlements or consent decrees. Thus, after careful review, I determined there are no significant terms of any decree incorporating a settlement or stipulation in these case documents.",

        "reasoning": "I reviewed all provided case documents, docket entries, and orders for any disputes about enforcing a settlement (i.e., a negotiated agreement not entered as a court order), such as motions to enforce a settlement, motions for contempt, or requests invoking retained jurisdiction. I excluded any disputes regarding decrees, stipulated judgments, or consent decrees. The relevant sequence occurred in the spring of 2022, when Plaintiffs and House Defendants reached a negotiated settlement regarding state House districts, but the court declined to approve it as a consent decree for lack of proper legislative authority per Supreme Court precedent (Lawyer v. DOJ). The parties then revised their agreement to instead settle the claims by legislation (enactment of maps via the legislative process) and voluntarily dismissed the relevant claims after the law was enacted. There are no motions to enforce, contempt motions, or requests to the court to enforce a settlement as a court order. There was a court order denying a motion to approve/enforce a settlement as a consent decree, but this does not constitute a dispute over enforcement of a non-decree settlement (rather, the parties sought to have the court approve their settlement as a decree, and the court refused). No subsequent enforcement motions or contempt proceedings regarding a non-decree settlement are present. Therefore, there are no actual disputes about enforcing a settlement agreement (not entered as a court order) in these materials.",

      "Cause of Action": {
        "reasoning": "The case documents were reviewed to identify legal vehicles used to bring the claims, such as statutes creating rights of action or judge-made vehicles, excluding underlying rights, remedies, or procedural doctrines. The Complaint repeatedly asserts that the United States is suing Idaho to enjoin Idaho Code § 18-622 as preempted by the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd, citing preemption under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The reasoning is supported by direct textual references to EMTALA as the federal statute at issue and to preemption under the Supremacy Clause as the legal vehicle for the claim. The United States is not suing under a private cause of action but is asserting a cause of action by the federal government to enjoin state law as preempted by federal law—a cause recognized under Shaw v. Delta Air Lines and related preemption doctrine. There is no mention of other statutes (e.g., § 1983, Bivens, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles. All relevant evidence points to EMTALA and the Supremacy Clause preemption as the legal vehicle. Duplicate references to EMTALA are collapsed into a single extracted value.",

The complaint and court orders repeatedly refer to both the Supremacy Clause and EMTALA as sources of substantive rights allegedly violated by Idaho's abortion ban to the extent it limits emergency medical care. There are no other constitutional or statutory provisions or clauses alleged as the basis for substantive rights violations. No evidence suggests invocation of additional rights or statutes such as the Fourteenth Amendment, other constitutional amendments, or other federal statutes. Therefore, the extracted list includes (1) EMTALA, 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd, and (2) the Supremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2).

        "reasoning": "I reviewed all provided case documents, including the complaint, multiple district court memorandum decisions and orders, appellate and Supreme Court opinions, the stipulation of dismissal, and the docket. To answer the prompt, I needed to identify all durations of decree obligations—that is, the time period for which a court-ordered obligation (not a negotiated agreement) was in effect. The key decree in this case was the preliminary injunction issued by the district court, which enjoined Idaho from enforcing its abortion law (Idaho Code § 18-622) to the extent it conflicted with EMTALA. I looked for explicit statements regarding the duration of that decree. The district court order (Document 95) stated the injunction was to remain in effect “through the date on which judgment is entered in this case.” However, subsequent procedural history is important: the preliminary injunction was stayed by the Ninth Circuit (Document 153), and the Supreme Court later vacated its own stay (SCOTUS Opinion). Ultimately, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal (Document 182), which explicitly states, “the Court’s preliminary injunction in this matter (ECF No. 95) is dissolved.” Thus, the decree obligation lasted from the entry of the preliminary injunction (August 24, 2022) until its dissolution upon the filing of the stipulation of dismissal (March 5, 2025), except for the period when the injunction was stayed (September 28, 2023, to June 27, 2024). Since the prompt asks for decree obligations and their durations, I have included the primary preliminary injunction, with its stated duration from the order and its dissolution upon dismissal.",

I searched for post-settlement enforcement disputes such as motions to enforce, motions for contempt, or requests to invoke retained jurisdiction, relating to a negotiated settlement agreement (not a court order or decree). However, the entire case concerns litigation over the validity and enforceability of Idaho's abortion ban under federal law (EMTALA), and the only settlements referenced are voluntary dismissals, not negotiated settlements entered outside of court order. There are no references to any negotiated agreement (settlement) between the parties that would have required enforcement, nor does the stipulation of dismissal or any other filing indicate a dispute over enforcing such a settlement. All disputes are over preliminary injunctions, the merits, or appellate procedure—not enforcement of a non-decree settlement.",
