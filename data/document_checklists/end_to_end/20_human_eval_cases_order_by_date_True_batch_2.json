        "reasoning": "In reviewing the case documents—including the Complaint, Amended Complaint, Statement of Interest of the United States, district court and appellate opinions, and the Supreme Court decision—I looked for the legal vehicles (the 'how' of suing) used by the plaintiffs to bring their claims. The documents repeatedly state that the action was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to challenge the constitutionality of Va. Code § 46.2-395, and the Amended Complaint and Statement of Interest both specify § 1983 as the enforcement vehicle. There is no mention of any other private right of action statute, nor any judge-made vehicle such as Bivens. The documents do not suggest that any other enforcement mechanism was used, nor do they assert any claim under a federal tort statute, the ADA, or other enforcement vehicles. All claims are asserted via § 1983. This is confirmed throughout the pleadings and in the Statement of Interest. Therefore, § 1983 is the only relevant legal vehicle used.",

There are no stipulated judgments, consent decrees, or permanent injunctions with defined temporal scope. The case was later dismissed as moot after the statute was repealed, and the remaining litigation concerned only attorneys' fees.

The case history shows there was no settlement agreement reached or executed by the parties.

The docket, opinions, and pleadings do not reference any settlement agreement or related events. Therefore, there are no settlement-related dates to extract.",

I specifically searched for any mention of settlements or negotiated agreements between the parties that resolve a dispute outside of a court order or judgment, as well as any statement about the duration or terms of settlement obligations. The record demonstrates that the case was dismissed as moot after the Virginia General Assembly repealed the challenged statute. The parties agreed to dismiss the case, but there is no indication of any settlement agreement or negotiated settlement obligations. The only post-dismissal dispute was over attorney's fees, not over the existence or terms of a settlement. All relief or obligations discussed in the documents are the result of court orders (e.g., preliminary injunction) or legislative repeal, not a negotiated settlement between the parties. Therefore, there are no non-court-ordered settlement obligations or durations presented in the case documents.",

The docket shows this case was dismissed as moot after the Virginia legislature repealed the challenged statute, and the parties stipulated to dismissal. The opinions—including the Supreme Court, Fourth Circuit (panel and en banc), and district court opinions—consistently address whether attorney's fees may be awarded when the only judicial relief was a preliminary injunction before a mootness-based dismissal. Nowhere in the opinions, orders, or docket is there any reference to a private settlement agreement (as opposed to legislative repeal), nor any mention of the court expressly retaining jurisdiction to enforce a settlement. The dismissal was based on mootness due to statutory repeal, not a settlement agreement. There is no evidence of a Kokkonen retention or similar court-enforced private settlement.",

The case concerns a challenge to a Virginia statute imposing driver’s license suspensions for unpaid court debt. The record shows a preliminary injunction was entered (granting Plaintiffs relief), but no permanent injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment. The case was later stayed and then became moot when the statute was repealed, and the parties stipulated to dismissal. Thus, the only decree event evidenced in the record is the entry of the preliminary injunction on December 21, 2018. No other decree-related dates (modifications, stays, partial or full terminations, or vacatur of a decree) are identified in the case documents. The later stay and mootness dismissal do not constitute modification or termination of a decree; rather, the preliminary injunction was never dissolved or vacated by a further court order.",

I carefully reviewed the docket for any indication of post-settlement or post-dismissal enforcement disputes and the body of the opinions for any mention of settlement enforcement or disputes about the terms, compliance, or enforcement of a negotiated agreement. The record shows the parties stipulated to dismissal as moot after the statute was repealed, and the only post-dismissal issue was attorney's fees under §1988(b). There are no motions to enforce a settlement, contempt motions, or disputes invoking retained jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing a negotiated settlement—not a decree or court order.

The question is to extract the duration of all decree obligations, specifically court-ordered obligations (not negotiated agreements) and their durations. The most relevant documents are the orders granting injunctive relief and the amended permanent injunction, as these are formal court decrees. The orders repeatedly require defendants (USCIS and others) to adjudicate SIJ petitions based on Washington state court orders within 180 days of the date the application is filed. This 180-day deadline is an obligation imposed by court order (i.e., a decree), reinforced by the permanent injunction and its amendments. There are no other decree obligations with a different duration or time limit specified in these orders. The other court orders, including the class certification and preliminary injunction, do not themselves impose obligations with set durations distinct from the 180-day statutory deadline.

The order discusses approval of the settlement, payment of attorney fees, and that the court retains jurisdiction, but does not state a time-bound obligation or duration for any settlement obligation.

The documents show the case was resolved through a court order (permanent injunction) after litigation and appeals, and only later was a settlement agreement reached and approved by the court. There is no evidence in the record of any disputes about enforcing a settlement agreement (such as motions to enforce the settlement or for contempt, or requests to invoke retained jurisdiction) before or after the final approval of the settlement.

I searched for explicit references to the statutes, frameworks, or judge-made doctrines under which plaintiff Andrew Warren sued Governor DeSantis, focusing on the 'how' of suing (not underlying rights or remedies). The Complaint and subsequent pleadings repeatedly reference 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as the statutory vehicle for the First Amendment claim. The state-law claim for quo warranto (challenging the suspension under the Florida Constitution) was dismissed under Pennhurst and not pursued on appeal, and no other federal vehicles (such as Bivens or FTCA) are referenced or used. The Mount Healthy same-decision framework is discussed as a standard for adjudicating First Amendment retaliation, but it is not a vehicle for bringing a claim. There are no other vehicles (such as Ex parte Young, which is not explicitly invoked here, and is not itself a cause of action) mentioned as the basis to sue. No other statutory or judge-made vehicles for suit are referenced. Thus, the only legal vehicle for the federal claim is 42 U.S.C. § 1983.",

Multiple documents—including the complaint, district court orders, appellate briefs, and Eleventh Circuit opinions—specifically describe the First Amendment as the relevant source of law. The Eleventh Amendment is discussed in the context of remedy and jurisdiction, not as a basis for substantive rights allegedly violated. Other statutes such as 42 U.S.C. § 1983 are mentioned only as vehicles for claims, not as sources of substantive rights. There are no allegations of violations of the Equal Protection Clause, Due Process Clause, or any statutory anti-discrimination or civil rights laws besides the First Amendment.

I also checked the district court docket for subsequent orders and final judgment. The appellate opinion explains that Warren's term of office expired while a petition for rehearing en banc was under consideration, and thus the court found the case was moot and no longer a live controversy. The appellate court vacated its prior opinion and the underlying judgment, dismissed the appeal, and remanded for the district court to dismiss the case as moot.

I carefully searched for any such court-ordered obligations, including in the Executive Order, initial scheduling order, and all subsequent opinions and judgments from both the district and appellate courts. The only formal 'decree' in the sense of a court-issued order that imposes an obligation with a set duration would appear in the court's orders. However, the Executive Order (a gubernatorial action, not a court decree) suspending Andrew Warren contains a duration, but it is not a court decree. All court orders (including the district court's merits order, the Eleventh Circuit's opinions, and related documents) either deny relief, dismiss, or vacate prior orders, and do not impose any obligations of explicit duration.

Nowhere in the record is there mention of an injunction, consent decree, stipulated injunction, or any decree within the meaning of the prompt being entered, modified, stayed, or terminated. The documents discuss motions for preliminary injunction, but no injunction was entered.

Warren appealed to the Eleventh Circuit, which vacated and remanded for further proceedings. However, while the case was pending on rehearing en banc, Warren's term expired, and the Eleventh Circuit determined the case was moot, ordering the district court to dismiss the case as moot. The final district court order, issued on February 16, 2025, states the action is dismissed as moot. The appellate court's decision is clear that the case is now moot due to Warren's term ending, and no further substantive terms of decree or court-ordered relief are present in any order. The only operative, significant term of decree is the dismissal of the action as moot. No injunction, reinstatement, or other substantive relief was ordered.",

The court held that, as a result, it could not grant any meaningful relief, and the case was moot. The opinion explicitly vacated the prior opinion, dismissed the appeal, and remanded for the district court to dismiss the action as moot. The court also addressed why the exceptions to mootness did not apply and rejected plaintiff's arguments for possible relief.

Additionally, individual substantive sections can terminate upon HRRJ’s motion and a court finding of durable compliance for at least one year.

The task is to extract the duration of all settlement obligations (each as a separate entry) for any negotiated agreement between parties that resolves a dispute, as opposed to a formal order or judgment issued by a court, and to only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment. In this case, the 'Agreement to Resolve the Department of Justice's Investigation of Hampton Roads Regional Jail' is a negotiated, non-litigated settlement between the United States and the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority. However, the Agreement was expressly incorporated into a court order (Order Approving and Entering Consent Decree, ECF 5), making it a court-ordered consent decree, not a purely private settlement agreement. All the obligations and their durations—such as the 4-year implementation period and the 5-year termination window—are expressly part of the incorporated court order. There is no evidence in the documents of any other negotiated settlement obligations between the parties that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment. Therefore, there are no extractable settlement obligations matching the criteria.",

The Agreement (styled as a 'Consent Decree' when entered by the court) was jointly submitted by the parties and explicitly approved and incorporated into a formal order by the court (see ECF 5). The Order states that the 'Agreement's terms are hereby incorporated into this Order as if fully set forth herein' and that '[t]he Court retains complete jurisdiction of this matter to enforce this Order and the terms of the incorporated Agreement until the Defendants have fulfilled their obligations therein.' This is not merely a private settlement; it is expressly court-enforced, with the court retaining ongoing jurisdiction for enforcement. This arrangement is not a Kokkonen-style jurisdictional retention for a private agreement, but a full consent decree incorporated into a court order. Therefore, the answer is Yes: the settlement is court-enforced.",

The significant terms of the decree are those found in the Agreement entered by court order (Case 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL Document 2-1), which was expressly approved and incorporated into the court's order (Document 5). The Agreement's substantive obligations are enforceable court orders, and the monitoring reports and court docket reflect ongoing enforcement and compliance. I reviewed the Agreement for all substantive obligations the court ordered HRRJ to implement (as these are the significant terms of the decree), and confirmed the order entered and retained jurisdiction until obligations were fulfilled. The subsequent monitoring reports detail compliance, but do not create new or separate obligations apart from the Agreement. The final monitoring report confirms the closure of HRRJ and the end of the decree's applicability. The Joint Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum confirm the facility's closure and the end of the decree's application. I have extracted the significant, operative terms of the decree as ordered by the court—those that the HRRJ was required to comply with, as found in the Agreement and made part of the court’s order.",

The Agreement is a court-approved settlement, not a stipulated order or consent decree, and sets forth the substantive obligations the Jail agreed to in order to resolve the DOJ's investigation. The order (ECF 5) explicitly incorporates the Agreement's terms but does not itself function as a consent decree that independently restates all requirements as court orders. The Agreement itself is the controlling source of the significant terms of settlement. The monitoring reports document compliance with and implementation of those terms but do not themselves create new substantive obligations. Therefore, I extracted the significant terms of settlement directly from the Agreement (ECF 2-1), ensuring each substantive obligation is presented as a separate entry, quoted exactly, with context as needed. I did not include provisions that are merely enforcement, monitoring, or procedural (e.g., appointment of a monitor, reporting requirements, or those incorporated into the court's order).

I also checked for evidence of party-initiated disputes over compliance or enforcement, including in monitoring reports, responses, and orders. The docket shows only joint motions (such as to dismiss or appoint a monitor), responses to monitoring reports, and routine filings; there are no party-initiated enforcement or contempt motions. The court’s only enforcement-related actions were routine monitoring, not adjudicating any disputed enforcement issues. There are no indications of motions to enforce, for contempt, or requests invoking the court's retained jurisdiction to resolve a compliance dispute. Therefore, there are no relevant disputes about enforcing the settlement agreement within the case record.",
