        "reasoning": "I reviewed the class action complaint, memorandum of law, motion for preliminary injunction, amicus brief, and the court's memorandum opinion, as well as the relevant declarations and evidence. The legal vehicles for the claims are specifically identified in the complaint and related filings. The plaintiffs rely on the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq., and specifically cite 5 U.S.C. §§ 702 and 706 as authorizing judicial review of agency action and relief. The complaint also references the court's jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and its authority to provide declaratory and injunctive relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202, and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but these are not enforcement vehicles for substantive claims—they are for remedies/procedure. No other enforcement statute or judge-made vehicle (e.g., Bivens, § 1983) is invoked, and the claims are not brought under a specific private right of action created by a substantive statute, but rather under the APA as the vehicle for challenging agency action. The constitutional claims are brought directly under the Constitution, not a statutory vehicle. The ultra vires claim is a nonstatutory cause of action recognized in D.C. Circuit and Supreme Court precedent for equitable relief against federal officials. There is no evidence of any other distinct legal vehicle being used.",

The court’s Memorandum Opinion and subsequent Order grant Defendants' motion to dismiss and deny injunctive relief; there is no reference to any settlement, much less court enforcement or retention of jurisdiction.

Because of the loss of grant funding, HRiA and its partners continue to face irreparable reputational harm: the halting of critical programs and hiring, and failure to follow through on promises made to communities has severely damaged HRiA and its partners relationships with their communities, law enforcement, and local mental health agencies.",

The documents repeatedly and clearly identify the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706, as the basis for judicial review of agency action, including both SEVIS terminations and (in the amended complaint) visa revocations. The First Amended Complaint also references the Declaratory Judgment Act, but does not appear to use it as an independent cause of action or vehicle for relief—it is mentioned in passing alongside the APA. There are no references to judge-made vehicles like Bivens, nor to other statutes such as 42 U.S.C. § 1983, FTCA, or similar. Constitutional claims are raised (Fifth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection), but the legal vehicle alleged for enforcing those rights is through the APA (and, for equitable relief, the court's inherent authority, not a stand-alone vehicle). I found multiple verbatim references to the APA both in the original and amended complaints, as well as in the motions and court orders, always specifying 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706 or simply the 'Administrative Procedure Act'. There are no other legal vehicles identified in the documents.",

Plaintiffs Tao, Wu, and Li were already present in the United States when their visas were revoked. Likewise, Section 1201(i) only applies to individual determinations made by the Secretary or the consular official who issued the visas in the first instance.

Throughout, the named plaintiffs are listed as specific individuals, and the pleadings state their names, educational backgrounds, and personal circumstances. There is no indication the lawsuit is filed as a class action, nor are there references to 'class representatives,' 'class certification,' or 'class action' under Rule 23. Although the plaintiffs seek relief that could affect similarly situated students, the actual plaintiffs are individual, named persons. The First Amended Complaint adds additional named individuals as plaintiffs, but does not seek class status. The court documents, including the preliminary injunction order, also refer to the plaintiffs by name and do not certify or refer to a class. Therefore, the plaintiffs are individual plaintiffs, and this should be described as such, with the individual names provided.",

I did not include requests for relief, proposed orders, or party motions unless the court adopted them in a decree. I looked for explicit language in the operative orders specifying how long obligations (such as injunctions) remain in effect. Where the order was a preliminary injunction, the order's own text controls the duration—typically 'pending resolution of these proceedings' or until further order of the court. Temporary restraining orders (TROs) are typically limited by the order itself (e.g., 14 days). I did not include obligations from the Complaint or Amended Complaint, which are requests, not decrees. The most recent and controlling decree is the Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions (May 22, 2025), which sets forth the current obligations and their duration.

However, there is substantial discussion of the mass review of F-1 student records through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database in April 2025, the resulting terminations, and subsequent court review. Additionally, courts reviewed agency actions for compliance with regulations and due process, and ICE later reinstated SEVIS records nationwide. The most significant 'monitoring' activity described is ICE's mass NCIC audit and the subsequent findings and corrective actions (SEVIS reinstatement). The court's findings and orders regarding compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements also constitute a form of compliance review.",

These terminations have affected hundreds if not thousands of students nationwide, regardless of whether they had any adverse immigration or criminal history. University officials were similarly left in the dark, reporting a surge in unexpected SEVIS terminations without any prior warning from DHS or ICE. The scope and speed of this operation have created widespread panic among students, many of whom remain in the United States unaware that their legal status has been silently stripped from them. Immediately after the SEVIS terminations, State revoked most, if not all, still-valid visas of those whose SEVIS status was terminated. Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals who had their visas revoked received notices from the State Department or their University that stated that their visas had been revoked (in the past tense) and warned that remaining in the United States could lead to fines, detention, and/or deportation, among other consequences. Those revocations were later clarified in this and other litigation, inconsistent with those emails, to be effective upon the individual’s departure from the United States.",

        "reasoning": "To extract the legal vehicles used to bring the claims, I reviewed the Complaint, Amended Complaint, Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Amicus Brief, and the Opinion and Order. I specifically searched for explicit statements of legal authority authorizing suit, such as statutes that provide a right of action or judge-made causes of action. I excluded underlying rights (such as constitutional amendments cited as rights), remedies, or procedural doctrines. The primary legal vehicles invoked in the documents are the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), nonstatutory review/ultra vires actions (for actions beyond statutory authority), and the implied constitutional cause of action for separation-of-powers claims. The APA is cited repeatedly as the source of judicial review and as authorizing the claims, particularly 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704, and 706. There is also a claim for nonstatutory review/ultra vires action (against DOGE and certain officials), and a constitutional separation-of-powers claim brought via the court's inherent equitable powers (not via § 1983 or a Bivens action, as this is not against individual officers for damages). The FTCA, § 1983, or Bivens are not invoked. The ICA (Impoundment Control Act) is alleged to be violated, but the Complaint and the Opinion both clarify that the ICA does not create a private right of action and is instead invoked as a source of law for the APA 'contrary to law' claim. No other private right of action statute is used. I did not include Ex parte Young, Rule 23, or other procedural doctrines, which are referenced only in passing for context. I deduplicated the APA, even though it is invoked for multiple legal theories and claims.",

The Amended Complaint and other filings consistently identify these attorneys as 'Attorneys for Plaintiffs.' For the Defendants, the Opinion and Order and docket indicate representation by the United States Attorney's Office, with specific mention of Assistant United States Attorney Sean E. Martin. There is no evidence of pro se representation, public interest nonprofits, or other organization-based legal representation for either side. No evidence indicates the Plaintiffs are pro se or represented by a nonprofit; all references are to private counsel. The Defendants, being federal agencies and officials, are represented by government counsel (U.S. Attorney's Office), as is standard. The Amicus Brief is filed by several states' attorneys general but does not represent a party in the case.",

There is no mention anywhere of a class action, putative class, or class certification. Instead, the evidence repeatedly describes the Plaintiffs as organizational entities bringing suit in their own right and, in the case of the Federation, as an association representing its state and jurisdictional humanities council members. The Opinion and Order, as well as the Amended Complaint, further confirm that the plaintiffs are not individuals but rather organizations. No evidence suggests the case is a class action.",

The Federation alleges that it has suffered injuries-in-fact from, among other conduct, the termination of tens of thousands of dollars in grant money that NEH designated directly to the Federation itself. See Stein Decl. ¶ 15. This previously approved funding would have supported the Federation’s ability to address the Councils’ data evaluation needs, including funding in-person consultation with data and evaluation experts. Id.; cf.

I found no mention of any prior settlement agreement, nor any motions or requests by any party to enforce, interpret, or hold another party in contempt of a standalone, non-court-ordered settlement. The case is about enforcement of statutory and regulatory duties regarding NEH grant funding, not about enforcing a negotiated private settlement. All disputes center on the legality of Defendants' actions under constitutional and statutory authority, not on any previously negotiated agreement between the parties.",

The legal vehicles for bringing the claims are described in the Complaint's jurisdiction and claims sections, as well as in the prayers for relief. The plaintiffs explicitly invoke the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), including 5 U.S.C. § 706, for their primary claims. They also reference 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction), 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2) (actions against the United States), and requests for declaratory/injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202. The Complaint makes clear that the APA is the main statutory enforcement vehicle for challenging federal agency action. There are no Bivens claims or other judge-made vehicles. The Complaint does not rely on 42 U.S.C. § 1983 or the FTCA. The references to constitutional claims (First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Spending Clause, separation of powers) are asserted as direct causes of action for equitable relief against federal officers, but not under a specific statute other than the APA. The evidence is taken directly from the relevant jurisdiction and claims sections and the relief requested.",

Instead, they seek to advance the Administration’s wholly unrelated ideological goals—including to end “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,” deny transgender people’s identities, and cut off access to abortion resources and referrals. Worse yet, the Departments have imposed these requirements in a manner expressly designed to expose grantees to civil and criminal liability under the False Claims Act.",

The available documents include a Complaint, a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), a Temporary Restraining Order and its revisions, and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. All disputes and motions in these documents concern the enforcement or enjoining of new federal grant conditions imposed by HUD and HHS; they do not involve any negotiated settlement agreement between parties. There is no indication in any document of a negotiated settlement not entered as a court order, nor any motion or dispute regarding the enforcement of such a settlement. All disputes are over agency-imposed grant conditions, not over enforcement of a private settlement agreement. Therefore, there are no relevant disputes to extract.",
