These include the statutes or judge-made mechanisms that authorize the cause of action (the 'how' of suing), not the underlying rights, remedies, or procedural rules. Across the Class Action Complaint, Amended Class Action Complaint, Proposed Second Amended Class Action Complaint, Memorandum and Order, Memorandum Opinion and Order, and the docket, I found clear references to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as the federal vehicle for the claims, and references to state law claims under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure (including specific articles, but these are rights/remedies, not enforcement vehicles themselves). No other judge-made vehicles (such as Bivens) or statutory private rights of action were asserted beyond § 1983. The claims for damages and attorneys' fees under § 1988 are not enforcement vehicles, and thus not included. All evidence was quoted verbatim, and I ensured the extracted list is deduplicated and only includes legal vehicles, not rights or remedies.",

City of Houston), but this is merely cited as historical context and is not an order issued in this case. The Orders and Findings on Sanctions, Memorandum Opinions, and Final Approval Order and Judgment were carefully checked for any decree that imposed a court-ordered obligation with a set duration. However, the only decree obligation with a specified duration found in these documents comes from the 1982 Sanders v. City of Houston injunction, as referenced in the pleadings. No new formal decree with an explicit duration is issued in this case; the action resulted in a settlement and class certification, not a new injunctive order.

In the present case (4:16-cv-03577), the documents reflect a settlement resulting in a court order and final judgment, but do not reference any preliminary injunction, consent decree, or stipulated injunction/judgment being entered. The 'Final Approval Order and Judgment' (Dkt. 198) constitutes a decree as it finalizes a class settlement as a court order. No amendments, suspensions, partial terminations, or vacaturs of such a decree are shown. There is no evidence of a stay or vacatur of the final approval order. Thus, the only clear decree-related date is for the entry of the Final Approval Order and Judgment.",

I also checked for any references to a negotiated settlement that was not entered as a court order, and whether enforcement actions were taken by any party after such an agreement. The docket and documents show that the parties reached a class action settlement, which was subsequently approved and entered as a Final Approval Order and Judgment by the court (see Dkt. 198). Following the Final Approval Order and Judgment, there are motions seeking enforcement of that court order (see Dkt. 199, 201, 203), but these are enforcement actions regarding the judgment/order, not a negotiated settlement agreement that was not entered as a court order. There are no motions or filings reflecting a dispute over the enforcement of a settlement agreement that was not entered as a court order; all enforcement efforts relate to the court’s final order and judgment.

The Complaints and Amended Complaints contain detailed 'WHEREFORE' or 'For these reasons' clauses at the end of each count, which enumerate the specific relief sought by the Plaintiff (Latoya Ratlieff). I found no evidence in the pleadings, answers, or motions that the Defendants requested any relief from the court beyond routine requests for dismissal or summary judgment (which are not remedies sought in the pleadings but procedural motions). The Defendant does not file counterclaims or affirmative claims for relief and does not seek damages, fees, or any affirmative order from the court; their filings only seek defense judgments. Accordingly, all requests extracted are from the Plaintiff, and each unique remedy requested is listed as its own entry, including compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorney's fees, costs, interest, injunctive relief, and any other relief the court deems just and proper. The evidence is quoted directly from the various complaints and amended complaints, covering all iterations and all relevant counts.",

This is evidenced by the signature blocks at the end of the complaints and other filings, which list multiple attorney names and contact details under these law firms. The Mediation Report and docket entries confirm continued representation by these same firms up to settlement. For the Defendants, the City of Fort Lauderdale and all individual Defendants are represented by private counsel, specifically the law firms of Jeffery R. Lawley and Scott D. Alexander, as shown in the Mediation Report and answer/affirmative defense filings. There is no indication that any party is self-represented (pro se), and no public interest or government entities other than the City itself are listed as providing counsel.

The Mediation Report states the parties settled all claims, subject to City Commission approval, but does not reference any court order retaining jurisdiction. There is no language in the Mediation Report or other documents indicating the court's explicit retention of jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. The subsequent court orders (Order Administratively Closing Case and Requiring Status Update, and subsequent status report orders) require the parties to file dismissal or settlement documentation but do not mention retention of jurisdiction for enforcement.

I also checked for any court order that would convert a settlement to a court order (e.g., entry of a consent decree). After examining the docket and all filings, I found no such court-ordered decrees or injunctive relief entered in this case. The only settlement mentioned is a private settlement that is subject to city commission approval, and there is no indication it has been entered as a court order (consent decree, stipulated injunction, or judgment). The final judgment as to individual defendants is not a decree (it's a finding for defendants). Thus, there are no decree-related dates presented in these documents.",

        "reasoning": "I reviewed all provided documents for explicit allegations of substantive rights or sources of law allegedly violated, focusing on specific constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provisions, and excluding procedural mechanisms or remedies. The plaintiffs' claims are based entirely on violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) within the Dodd-Frank Act. The core allegations are that the defendants' actions were 'arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law' and 'in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right' under the APA. The particular statutes referenced as having been violated are 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) (APA standards for judicial review) and 12 U.S.C. § 5497(a) (CFPA funding requirement), plus several other mandatory duties imposed on the CFPB by the CFPA and related statutes (e.g., 12 U.S.C. §§ 5493, 5511, 5512, 5534, 5535, 5552, 5581; 12 U.S.C. §§ 2803, 2809). The complaint, motion, and supporting memoranda consistently frame the alleged violations as failures to comply with these statutory requirements, not constitutional provisions. There are no allegations in the pleadings or memoranda of violations of constitutional clauses, other amendments, or other statutory rights such as the ADA or Rehab Act. All cited authorities are statutory, and the only procedural law cited as the vehicle is the APA (claims under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C)), which is not to be listed as a substantive right. Therefore, I extracted each statutory obligation that is alleged to have been violated and the clause-level detail where specified, as required.",

The Complaint and motions requested injunctive relief, but the record shows that the Court denied a preliminary injunction and no final or preliminary decree or order was entered imposing any obligation. The only temporary relief granted was via stipulated temporary restraining orders during the pendency of briefing, and those were not described in the documents as court-ordered decrees with specified durations, nor do the documents provide their text or duration. The case was later voluntarily dismissed without a court-ordered decree. Therefore, based on the definition of 'decree' in the prompt (formal order or judgment issued by a court, not just the parties' agreement or a request), and after reviewing all procedural and substantive documents, I found no court-ordered decree obligations with a specified duration in this matter.",

There is no mention of any negotiated settlement agreement between the parties—nor any settlement obligations, their duration, or terms—outside the context of court orders, judgments, or voluntary dismissal.

There are no references to any settlement, consent decree, court order approving a settlement, or any order or stipulation in which the court expressly retains jurisdiction to enforce a private settlement. The case concluded with a voluntary dismissal by plaintiffs, with no indication of a settlement agreement, let alone court enforcement or retention of jurisdiction.

The complaint and all subsequent filings seek injunctive relief and a declaration regarding the alleged attempts to defund the CFPB. The memorandum and notice of voluntary dismissal confirm that the case was dismissed without prejudice following government representations and court findings that no mechanism existed to transfer away or relinquish control over the CFPB's Bureau Fund. There is no settlement agreement, nor any substantive obligations between the parties that are contractual in nature. No document references, describes, or incorporates any non-court-ordered or non-judicial settlement terms. The voluntary dismissal is based solely on the government's representations in litigation, not on any negotiated, non-ordered agreement.

The Docket corroborates the timing of each procedural event.

The district court's 2020 Judgment included a permanent injunction with specific, time-bound obligations on the City of Grants Pass regarding enforcement of its ordinances. However, the Supreme Court in 2024 reversed and remanded, holding that such enforcement is not prohibited by the Eighth Amendment, thus vacating the decreed injunction.

The documents detail litigation, court-ordered injunctions, and judgments, but I found no evidence of any negotiated settlement agreement or settlement obligations with specified duration that were not incorporated into a court order or judgment. The only possible evidence of settlement is in docket entries 154–157, which reference a 'Stipulated Motion for Order Approving Settlement,' an 'Order: Granting Motion for Order Approving Settlement Agreement,' and a final 'ORDER APPROVING SETTLEMENT.' However, there is no substantive text of any settlement obligation or its duration in the provided case documents or dockets—only references to approval and dismissal with prejudice.

The only relevant settlement-related activity appears in the docket entries 154, 155, and 157, which involve a 'Stipulated Motion for Order Approving Settlement Agreement' and an order approving the settlement. The order (entry 157) vacates previous judgments and dismisses the case with prejudice, but does not contain language explicitly retaining jurisdiction for enforcement of the settlement, nor does it state that the court will oversee or enforce the agreement. There is no evidence in the available documents indicating that the court explicitly retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement post-dismissal. Therefore, the answer is 'No.'",

The actual settlement agreement itself is not included in the documents provided (only as 'Exhibit 1' to the motion, which is not attached here), and the order approving the settlement (entry 157) merely states the case is dismissed with prejudice and prior judgments are vacated. No documentary text describes substantive, non-court-ordered (contractual) settlement terms, nor is there any recitation of obligations, payments, releases, or other significant terms.

As detailed in the Court’s Order and Opinion, Defendants’ enforcement of GPMC 5.61.020, 5.61.030, and 6.46.090 violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment;  3.   As detailed in the Court’s Order and Opinion, defendants’ enforcement of GPMC 5.61.020, 5.61.030, and 6.46.090 violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against excessive fines;  4.  Based upon the above determinations, the Court enjoins Defendant from enforcing City Ordinances against the plaintiff class as follows:  a. Defendant is enjoined from enforcing GPMC 6.46.350 (the park exclusion ordinance);  b. Defendant is enjoined from enforcing GPMC 5.61.030 and GPMC 6.46.090 (the camping ordinances) without first giving a person a warning of at least 24 hours before enforcement;  c.

The record shows extensive litigation, culminating in judgment and appeals, but there is no evidence of any separately negotiated settlement agreement (apart from the attorneys' fees settlement, which is not a class settlement of the claims) or any motion to enforce or request to invoke retained jurisdiction over a settlement. All merits relief was ordered by the court through judgment, and, ultimately, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's injunction, remanding the case. There are no subsequent entries indicating a negotiated settlement agreement was reached and then enforced, nor any motion to enforce such an agreement or to hold a party in contempt for violating such an agreement. The only post-judgment settlement relates to attorneys' fees, which is not within the scope of the request (i.e., it is not a class settlement of the substantive claims).
