        "reasoning": "I reviewed the Complaint, Ex Parte Motion for TRO, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, and the Ninth Circuit Order for explicit identification of the legal vehicles (the 'how' of suing) used to bring the claims. The Complaint and related filings explicitly cite the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) and Chapter 71 of Title 5 (Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute), with repeated references to 5 U.S.C. § 7101 et seq. as the statutory framework both creating rights and being the basis for the ultra vires claim. The Complaint states jurisdiction is under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and requests declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2201, but those are jurisdictional and remedies statutes, not enforcement vehicles. No other statutory or judge-made vehicles (such as § 1983 or Bivens) are pleaded or referenced. The claims are direct actions for constitutional violations and for ultra vires action under federal law. The Complaint and orders do not invoke APA, § 1983, Bivens, or any other vehicle. The only legal vehicle for the statutory (ultra vires) claim is the CSRA/FSLMRS (5 U.S.C. § 7101 et seq.), and for the constitutional claims, the vehicle is a direct cause of action for constitutional violations against federal officials for injunctive/declaratory relief (per Ex parte Young doctrine for federal officials, but Ex parte Young is not cited). No other vehicles are present.",

The Complaint explicitly states that the plaintiff unions 'bring this action on behalf of themselves as organizations and on behalf of their members,' and details how each union represents large groups of employees (e.g., 'AFGE, the largest union of federal workers, represents approximately 800,000 federal civilian employees...'). The case is not brought by individuals but by labor organizations representing collective interests of their members. Nowhere is there mention of individual, named plaintiffs acting in their personal capacities. Thus, the case involves class-type plaintiffs (labor organizations acting in a representative capacity), which falls under the definition of a class action or representative suit for these purposes.",

The 'Order Re Preliminary Injunction' is a formal court decree: it grants a preliminary injunction enjoining implementation of Section 2 of Executive Order 14251. The order specifies that the injunction 'will remain in place pending further order of the Court.' The Ninth Circuit's stay order does not impose any new obligations or set durations; it only stays the district court's injunction pending appeal.

Instead, the documents state that the claims are brought by these organizations and sometimes discuss injuries to their individual members, but not as a class.

A 'decree obligation' is defined as a formal order or judgment issued by a court (such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction), not a negotiated agreement or party request. I searched for any court orders or judgments that impose obligations on any party, looking for explicit language on duration (e.g., 'for X years,' 'until further order,' 'for the pendency of this action,' etc.). The only formal order issued by the Court is the denial of the Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction; no decree obligations were imposed, and thus no obligations of specified duration exist. The Plaintiffs' requests for injunctive relief are not court-ordered decrees. The docket and orders confirm that no consent decree, injunction, or stipulated judgment was entered.

The task is to extract disputes about enforcement of a settlement (negotiated agreement not entered as a court order), such as motions to enforce, contempt, or requests invoking retained jurisdiction, but excluding any disputes over decrees. I searched for any post-settlement enforcement disputes or motions, references to negotiated (but not court-ordered) settlements, and requests to enforce, hold in contempt, or invoke retained jurisdiction regarding such settlements. All disputes in the documents are about statutory and constitutional challenges to agency conduct, not about enforcement of a settlement. There is no mention of any settlement (negotiated agreement) between the parties, nor of any motion or dispute seeking to enforce or hold a party in contempt of a settlement that is not a court order. The litigation here concerns the Department of Education's actions regarding the Institute of Education Sciences, not any prior settlement agreement.

The clearest evidence is found in the complaint's jurisdiction and causes of action sections, as well as in the memorandum opinion's summary of the legal basis for review. All relevant evidence indicates that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., is the legal vehicle being invoked. There are no references to other vehicles such as § 1983, Bivens, or the FTCA. The APA is referenced repeatedly as the mechanism that allows judicial review of agency action and the claims are framed as APA violations.",

These are three municipalities and two organizations (one a doctors' group and one a small business alliance). There is no mention in any document of a plaintiff class, class certification, or putative class action. The plaintiffs are not described as suing on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals; rather, the claims are brought directly by the listed organizations and municipalities, sometimes on behalf of their members (associational standing), but not as a class action. The Memorandum Opinion also discusses associational standing for the organizational plaintiffs but does not mention class action status. Therefore, the plaintiffs are individual entities, not a class action.",

I focused on identifying the legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims, i.e., the specific statutes, regulations, or judge-made doctrines that provide a cause of action for the lawsuits (the 'how' of suing). I disregarded underlying rights, remedies, or procedural doctrines, per instructions. Throughout the complaints, legal memoranda, and the district court's findings, the plaintiffs repeatedly identify the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., as the primary legal vehicle for their claims. The APA is cited as the basis for both 'arbitrary and capricious' and 'contrary to law' claims, and as the mechanism for judicial review of agency action (including agency inaction). The complaints and court opinions also reference specific APA sections (§706(1), §706(2)(A), (B), (C)), but these are all under the umbrella of the APA. There is also reference to ultra vires claims and constitutional claims (such as Spending Clause and separation of powers), but the legal vehicle for the constitutional claims is not a statute or judge-made vehicle like Bivens; instead, the court describes these as 'equitable' claims for injunctive relief against federal officials (per Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320 (2015)), which is a judge-made doctrine allowing prospective relief for unconstitutional federal action. However, the actual legal vehicle for nearly all claims, as expressly pleaded, is the APA. No other statutory cause of action (e.g., § 1983, FTCA, Bivens) is invoked or relied upon for the claims against these federal agencies and officers.",

Defendants had four business days (and four calendar days) to move. Defendants propose that Plaintiffs be provided four business days (six calendar days) to respond. This promotes the interests of justice and efficiency, since the Court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss could impact the administrative record that is being prepared for phase 2.\n\nDefendants asked Plaintiffs for their position on this proposal. State Plaintiffs did not agree and insisted on the 10-day response deadline proposed by Defendants in the parties’ joint statement, and previously unaltered by the Court. Defendants respectfully submit that ten days is inappropriate because Defendants proposed more reciprocal deadlines (Defendants had 7 days to move while Plaintiffs had 10 days to respond) and—most important—in Defendants’ proposal, the decision on the motion to dismiss triggered the deadline for the administrative record. Plaintiffs requested and the Court entered significantly more expedited deadlines for Defendants, including a fixed date to produce the administrative record.

                "text": "As today’s order states, the District Court likely lacked jurisdiction to hear challenges to the grant terminations,  which belong in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC).  See Department  of  Ed.  v.  California,  604  U. S.  ___  (2025) (per curiam).  In my view, however, the Government is not entitled to a stay of the judgments insofar as they vacate the guidance documents.\nPlaintiffs  frequently  seek  vacatur  of  internal  agency guidance on arbitrary-and-capricious grounds in district court or directly in the D. C. Circuit.  See, e.g., Ciox Health, LLC v. Azar, 435 F. Supp. 3d 30 (DDC 2020) (challenge to HHS guidance); POET Biorefining, LLC v. EPA, 970 F. 3d 392 (CADC 2020) (challenge to EPA guidance).  That the agency  guidance  discusses  internal  policies  related  to grants does not transform a challenge to that guidance into a claim “founded . . . upon” contract that only the CFC can hear.  28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1).  So the District Court was likely  correct  to  conclude  that  it  had  jurisdiction  to entertain an APA challenge to the guidance, and it would be  confusing  for  our  disposition  of  this  application  to suggest that the CFC is the right forum for that claim.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE JACKSON maintain that because  the  District  Court  is  the  right  forum  for  the challenge to the guidance, it is necessarily also the right forum for the challenge to the grant terminations.  Post,  at 1 (ROBERTS,  C. J.,  concurring in part and dissenting in  part); post, at 14–16 (JACKSON, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Both logic and law, however, support channeling  challenges  to  the  grant  terminations  and guidance to different forums.  First, logic: Vacating the guidance  does  not  reinstate  terminated  grants.  If  one simply flowed from the other, the District Court would have needed only to vacate the guidance itself.  Cf. Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S. 879, 910 (1988) (one judgment vacating HHS decision).  Here, by contrast, the District Court  separately  “vacated”  the  grant  terminations  and ordered the Government to pay plaintiffs sums due under the agreements “forthwith.”    App.  to  Application  160a.  Second, law: Even if the guidance and grant terminations are linked, vacating the guidance does not necessarily void decisions made under it, as the First Circuit recognized.  145 F. 4th 39, 50 (CA1 2025); see also, e.g., D. A. M. v. Barr, 486 F. Supp. 3d 404, 415 (DDC 2020) (vacatur does not necessarily  “eras[e]  from  legal  existence  all  past\nadjudications under the vacated rule”).

The Court held a full hearing and bench trial as to Phase One. At the conclusion of the trial of Phase One, the Court ruled from the bench that the Challenged Directives taken as a whole, were arbitrary and capricious final agency action, as well as were the terminations of the grants in accordance therewith; the Court took the rest of the matter under advisement. The Court now provides its complete findings of fact and rulings of law as to so much of Phase One as pertains to the APA claims raised therein and addressed from the bench as required under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.",

And the parties, and I include all the parties, have stepped up to afford the Court the chance to make findings and rulings upon an adequate record. ... The Court, on the administrative record, rules that the parties before it have standing. The Court, having carefully considered the briefs and the oral arguments, treats the challenged directives as a whole, as a process, does not break them down into discrete paragraphs, and rules that when treated as a whole, these directives constitute final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act, Sections 551 and 704. ... This Court finds and rules that the explanations are bereft of reasoning virtually in their entirety. These edicts are nothing more than conclusory, unsupported by factual development. ... This Court rules that the determinations -- that the challenged directives, excuse me, taken as a whole are -- and each of them are, when taken as a whole, arbitrary and capricious, they are of no force and effect, they are void and illegal. And so are each of the terminations before this Court declared arbitrary and capricious, void, and of no effect, they are illegal and they are vacated and set aside.",
