        "reasoning": "Reviewing the Complaint and Consent Decree, the litigation is brought by the United States to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Complaint specifically states the action is brought 'to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.' and cites jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b). The Consent Decree likewise states the action was brought to enforce Title VII and references 42 U.S.C. § 2000e and § 2000e-2(k). There are no other legal vehicles (e.g., § 1983, Bivens, FTCA) referenced in any of the documents, and no judge-made cause of action is described. The action is explicitly and solely under the statutory vehicle provided by Title VII, including the government's enforcement powers under Section 707 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6). No other vehicles are presented in the record. All evidence is quoted verbatim with context and source.",

The 'Consent Decree' includes a signature line for the judge, but again, no name is specified. The 'Docket' contains a record that the case was reassigned to Judge Thomas D. Schroeder and that various orders and proceedings were presided over by JUDGE THOMAS D. SCHROEDER, with Magistrate Judge Joi Elizabeth Peake listed for certain referrals and orders. The minute entry for the motion hearing on 12/16/2024 also notes that proceedings were held before JUDGE THOMAS D. SCHROEDER. Therefore, based on court records, the judge involved in the case is Thomas D. Schroeder. Magistrate Judge Joi Elizabeth Peake is also referenced in assignment and order entries. No other judge's first and last names are provided in the case documents.",

However, the docket and Notice of Voluntary Dismissal show that the United States voluntarily dismissed the case under Rule 41(a)(1) before a final order or judgment was entered and before the court entered the Consent Decree as a final order. Therefore, the court never actually entered an enforceable order retaining jurisdiction.

The primary document relevant to this issue is the Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment (Document 58). That order granted summary judgment to Plaintiffs on their as-applied Equal Protection claim, denied the facial challenge, and directed the parties to confer and propose injunctive relief if necessary. However, before judgment or any injunction was entered, the parties filed a Stipulation of Dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii) (Document 65), which was effective upon filing and ended the litigation with prejudice and without fees or costs.

I looked for explicit language regarding the entry of such orders or court approval of settlements as decrees. The documents show a complex litigation history, with an eventual conditional settlement reached and approved for minors' claims. However, the settlement approval order (Doc. 470) only approves the settlement of minors’ claims and the allocation of funds, and does not state that it is a consent decree, stipulated judgment, injunction, or other court-ordered decree affecting prospective conduct. There are no entries of injunctions, consent decrees, stipulated judgments, or any other forms of judicial decrees in these materials. The orders staying proceedings and approving settlement are not decrees as defined in the prompt.

In a previous Order [87], the Court held that the Plaintiffs had adequately alleged a violation of their Eighth Amendment rights but also noted that the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) barred the Plaintiffs from recovering compensatory damages for this claim absent physical injury. Therefore, to the extent the Plaintiffs sought compensatory damages under that claim, the Court granted dismissal. See [87] at p. 13 (“Thus, to the extent the plaintiffs seek compensatory damages based on emotional or mental injury, such claims are properly dismissed.”). The Court dismissed the Plaintiffs’ Section 1985 conspiracy claim in full because the Plaintiffs made no allegation that the Defendants’ conduct was racially motivated, as required for a Section 1985 claim to be viable. ... The Court clarifies that the Plaintiffs are not precluded from recovering compensatory damages to the extent that they are based on physical injury. Having resolved that matter, the Court turns to the class certification issue.",

The record consists of complaints, orders on motions to dismiss, discovery orders, class certification rulings, a protective order, and orders regarding case management. While the plaintiffs sought class-wide injunctive and declaratory relief in their initial complaints, the court never entered any decree imposing obligations on the defendants (e.g., orders requiring specific conduct over a set duration). Instead, the case progressed with rulings on motions to dismiss, discovery, denial of class certification, and ultimately severance and dismissal without prejudice.

The documents detail extensive litigation, motions to dismiss, class certification attempts, severance of claims, and eventual closure of the case without prejudice, but nowhere do they mention any settlement agreement, negotiations, or settlement-related events or dates.

The record shows no mention of a settlement, settlement agreement, or any retention of jurisdiction for settlement enforcement. The case was litigated through motions to dismiss, class certification, and then severed into individual cases, but no settlement was reported, entered, or referenced. The case was ultimately closed without prejudice to refiling as separate actions. No order references a Kokkonen retention of jurisdiction or any similar mechanism.

The only orders entered in this case are rulings on motions to dismiss, orders granting/denying motions for class certification, orders staying/lifting stays, orders on discovery/protective orders, and ultimately the order closing the case after severance. There is no indication that any injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment was entered, nor any modification, suspension, or termination of such a decree. The complaints request injunctive and other relief, but no decree (injunction, consent decree, stipulated judgment, or settlement entered as an order) was ever entered. The case was ultimately dismissed without prejudice and closed after the court ordered the severance of the claims into separate actions.
