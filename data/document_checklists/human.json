The court relied on well-established precedents which instruct that sex- and gender-based classifications invoke intermediate scrutiny, and on Bostock v. Clayton County [../../../../case/17313], 590 U.S. 644, 669 (2020) to apply intermediate scrutiny to claims of gender-identity discrimination. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the court found that the DoD failed to identify any important governmental objective to justify the exclusion and raised only technical and procedural objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 Equal Protection claims; accordingly, the court granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs as to their as-applied Equal Protection claim. However, the court granted partial summary judgment to the DoD as to the plaintiffs' facial Equal Protection claim, finding that the statute could be interpreted in a constitutional manner. The court issued a declaratory judgment stating that the statutory exclusion was unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiffs, and ordered the parties to meet and confer by November 15, 2024 to determine whether injunctive relief was necessary."
