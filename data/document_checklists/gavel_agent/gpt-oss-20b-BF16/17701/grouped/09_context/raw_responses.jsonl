Let's see if there are more facts in other documents: the Class Action Complaint has many facts too. The directive: Extract all distinct values of Factual_Basis_of_Case from the corpus. We have 7 from Amended. There may be more facts in the Class Action Complaint. We have fully read Class Action Complaint. We need to extract additional factual basis items from that document. We have not yet appended those. So next step: read relevant windows in Class Action Complaint that contain facts. We have already read whole document. But we haven't searched for \"facts\" in it. We saw some facts already. We need to identify all distinct fact statements. We should search for \"fact\", \"facts\", \"fact statement\" maybe. But we might manually read through Class Action Complaint to find facts. But we have the entire text in our memory from steps 8-9. We can scan manually for fact statements.\n\nLet's review the Class Action Complaint text for factual statements. Skimming: Lines mention: \"Houston police make hundreds of warrantless arrests every week.\" That's a fact. \"The Fourth Amendment ... requires that anyone arrested without a warrant be released promptly—after 48 hours at the longest—unless a neutral magistrate has concluded that there was probable cause.\" That's a rule, not a fact. \"Houston has a policy and practice of disregarding this simple obligation.\" Fact. \"Whenever the Harris County Jail refuses to accept custody ... Houston continues to detain arrestees...\" Fact. \"In July and August 2016 alone, there were hundreds of people arrested without a warrant who did not receive a probable cause determination within 48 hours but were still kept in City custody.\" Fact. \"The City of Houston arrests hundreds of people each week without a warrant.\" Fact. \"Misdemeanor and felony arrestees in City custody who do not post bail are eventually transferred to the Harris County Jail, where they receive probable cause hearings conducted by video.\" Fact. \"The City does not provide probable cause determinations for warrantless arrestees in its custody.\" Fact. \"Probable cause determinations are provided only after an arrestee has been transferred to the Harris County Jail.\" Fact. \"When it takes longer than 48 hours to transfer an arrestee—and it often does—Houston continues to detain the arrestee.\" Fact. \"The City of Houston arrests hundreds of people each week without a warrant.\" repeated. \"As a matter of policy and practice, the City does not release people who do not pay bail even if 48 hours or more have passed since their arrest.\" Fact. \"The Harris County Jail is notoriously overcrowded.\" Fact. \"In July and August 2016, the overcrowding was so dire that the County told the Houston Police Department to stop transferring inmates to the County Jail, and refused to accept busloads of inmates from the Houston Jail.\" Fact. \"A spokesman for the Harris County Sheriff’s Office told the City that there was 'no room at the inn.'\" Fact. \"Booking records for 2016 show that in July and August alone, Houston held hundreds of inmates in its jail for longer than three days before transferring them to Harris County.\" Fact. \"The large number of illegal detentions in July and August of 2016 reflects Houston’s broad, longstanding, and consistent policy of refusing to release warrantless arrestees even if more than 48 hours have passed since their warrantless arrest.\" Fact. \"For example, booking records show that one person arrested on July 25, 2016, did not receive a probable cause determination until July 31, 2016 (more than 144 hours after arrest); another person, arrested on July 23, 2016, did not receive a probable cause determination until July 30, 2016 (more than 168 hours after arrest); and at least 35 other people in the months of July and August 2016 waited more than four days (96 hours) between arrest and a probable cause determination.\" Fact. \"The City of Houston 'operates under a permanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-four hours without taking the person before a magistrate.'\" Fact. \"As a practical matter, there is no reason to delay probable cause determinations beyond 24 hours.\" Fact. \"In June and July of 2016 alone, the City’s records show that the City of Houston confined hundreds of warrantless arrestees longer than 48 hours without a judicial determination of probable cause.\" Fact. \"The City’s records show that violations occurred throughout 2016.\" Fact. \"Thousands of arrestees likely subjected to policy.\" Fact.\n\nWe also have factual statements about specific individuals: \"On January 7, 2016, at about 4:30 PM, Houston police officers arrested Juan Hernandez, without a warrant, for misdemeanor assault.\" Fact. \"His arrest was entered into records at 4:53 PM.\" Fact. \"He was not brought before a judge until January 9, 2016, at 6:00 PM. He had been held over 49 hours without receiving a judicial determination of probable cause.\" Fact. \"Five days after his hearing—after a week in custody—he pled guilty.\" Fact. \"He was released and given community supervision without jail time.\" Fact. Similarly for Dossett: \"On January 7, 2016, at approximately 8:00 PM, Houston police officers arrested James Dossett, without a warrant, for possession of a controlled substance.\" Fact. \"His arrest was entered at 8:10 PM.\" Fact. \"He was held until January 10, 2016, when transferred to Harris County Jail and received probable cause hearing at 4:00 AM.\" Fact. \"He had been held for 56 hours without receiving a probable cause hearing.\" Fact. \"Two days after his probable cause hearing, on January 12, 2016, he posted bond and was released.\" Fact. \"On April 22, 2016, Harris County dropped the charges.\" Fact.\n\nAlso earlier: \"The City of Houston arrests hundreds of people each week without a warrant.\" repeated. \"The City of Houston does not release people who do not pay bail even if 48 hours or more have passed since their arrest.\" Fact. \"The Harris County Jail is notoriously overcrowded.\" Fact. etc.\n\nThus many factual items. We need to append all distinct factual basis statements. We should add them via append_checklist.\n\nWe need to ensure each entry with evidence including text excerpt, source_document, location. We have the text from Class Action Complaint from step 8-9. We need to provide location (page number). We have page numbers in the text. So we can include e.g., \"Page 1 of 14\". For each fact, we need to provide evidence snippet.\n\nWe must not duplicate existing ones from Amended Complaint. The ones we extracted earlier: 7 values. Let's list them: \n1. \"Houston police make hundreds of warrantless arrests every week.\" (Amended)\n2. \"City of Houston arrests hundreds of people each week without a warrant.\" (Amended? Actually in Amended it had similar line).\n3. \"Misdemeanor and felony arrestees in City custody who do not post bail are eventually transferred to the Harris County Jail, where they receive probable cause hearings conducted by video.\" (Amended)\n4. \"The City of Houston does not provide probable cause determinations for warrantless arrestees in its custody.\" (Amended)\n5. \"Probable cause determinations are provided only after an arrestee has been transferred to the Harris County Jail.\" (Amended)\n6. \"When it takes longer than 48 hours to transfer an arrestee—and it often does—Houston continues to detain the arrestee rather than provide a prompt probable cause hearing or release.\" (Amended)\n7. \"The City of Houston arrests hundreds of people each week without a warrant.\" (Amended, maybe duplicate).\n\nThus we need to extract additional facts from Class Action Complaint that are not among those 7. Let's identify unique facts from Class Action Complaint:\n\n- \"The fourth amendment ... requires prompt release etc.\" Not a fact, rule. \n- \"Houston has a policy and practice of disregarding this simple obligation.\" That's a fact. \n- \"Whenever the Harris County Jail refuses to accept custody ... Houston continues to detain arrestees.\" Fact. \n- \"In July and August 2016 alone, there were hundreds of people arrested without a warrant who did not receive a probable cause determination within 48 hours but were still kept in City custody.\" Fact. \n- \"The City of Houston arrests hundreds of people each week without a warrant.\" (duplicate with Amended). \n- \"Misdemeanor and felony arrestees in City custody who do not post bail are eventually transferred to the Harris County Jail, where they receive probable cause hearings conducted by video.\" (duplicate). \n- \"As a matter of policy and practice, the City does not release people who do not pay bail even if 48 hours or more have passed since their arrest.\" Fact. \n- \"The Harris County Jail is notoriously overcrowded.\" Fact. \n- \"In July and August 2016, the overcrowding was so dire that the County told the Houston Police Department to stop transferring inmates to the County Jail, and refused to accept busloads of inmates from the Houston Jail.\" Fact. \n- \"A spokesman for the Harris County Sheriff’s Office told the City that there was 'no room at the inn.'\" Fact. \n- \"Booking records for 2016 show that in July and August alone, Houston held hundreds of inmates in its jail for longer than three days before transferring them to Harris County.\" Fact. \n- \"The large number of illegal detentions in July and August of 2016 reflects Houston’s broad, longstanding, and consistent policy of refusing to release warrantless arrestees even if more than 48 hours have passed since their warrantless arrest.\" Fact. \n- \"For example, booking records show that one person arrested on July 25, 2016, did not receive a probable cause determination until July 31, 2016 (more than 144 hours after arrest); another person, arrested on July 23, 2016, did not receive a probable cause determination until July 30, 2016 (more than 168 hours after arrest); and at least 35 other people in the months of July and August 2016 waited more than four days (96 hours) between arrest and a probable cause determination.\" Fact. \n- \"The City of Houston 'operates under a permanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-four hours without taking the person before a magistrate.'\" Fact. \n- \"As a practical matter, there is no reason to delay probable cause determinations beyond 24 hours.\" Fact. \n- \"In June and July of 2016 alone, the City’s records show that the City of Houston confined hundreds of warrantless arrestees longer than 48 hours without a judicial determination of probable cause.\" Fact. \n- \"The City’s records show that violations occurred throughout 2016.\" Fact. \n- \"Thousands of arrestees likely subjected to policy.\" Fact. \n- \"On January 7, 2016, at about 4:30 PM, Houston police officers arrested Juan Hernandez, without a warrant, for misdemeanor assault.\" Fact. \n- \"His arrest was entered into the City’s and Harris County’s electronic records at 4:53 PM.\" Fact. \n- \"He was not brought before a judge until January 9, 2016, at 6:00 PM.

Ensure no duplicates.\n\nWe should provide evidence text snippets. We need to include location: page numbers from the complaint, e.g., Page 1 of 14 etc.\n\nLet's extract the evidence text for each fact. We have the text earlier. We should capture snippet. Provide minimal but sufficient.\n\nWe'll prepare a single append_checklist call adding all new entries.\n\nLet's list them with evidence:\n\n1.

Text snippet: \"On April 22, 2016, Harris County dropped the charges.\"\n\nWe should check duplicates: \"The City does not release people who do not pay bail...\" is not in Amended. Good.\n\nWe also need to check that we don't duplicate the 7 from Amended. The above list includes new facts not among those.\n\nThus we can make append_checklist with 24 entries. But we should verify that some facts might be repeated across pages; e.g., \"The City does not release people who do not pay bail...\" appears also in Amended? The Amended had similar line: \"The City of Houston does not provide probable cause determinations for warrantless arrestees in its custody.\" Different. So okay.\n\nWe might also consider adding the fact about \"The City of Houston arrests hundreds of people each week without a warrant.\" Already in Amended. So skip.\n\nAlso \"Misdemeanor and felony arrestees...\" already in Amended.\n\nNow we need to ensure we include evidence with location. For each, we specify page numbers.\n\nWe need to produce a JSON with patch array containing one item for key \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" with extracted array of new entries. Each entry has value and evidence array.\n\nWe will produce one append_checklist call.\n\nSince we are appending many entries, ensure we don't exceed token limit? We'll send list.\n\nLet's proceed.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\":
