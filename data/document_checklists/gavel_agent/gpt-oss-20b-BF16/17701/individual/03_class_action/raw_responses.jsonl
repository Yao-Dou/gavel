Use regex pattern: \"(?i)Individual\" across all docs, top_k maybe 1? But we want to see if any mention \"Individual\" in context of plaintiffs. Let's search for \"Individual\" in all docs. But we might get many matches like \"Individual\" in other contexts. But we can search for \"Individual\" preceded or followed by \"Plaintiff\" or \"Plaintiffs\".

They have found 1 value: presumably \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". But there might be individual plaintiffs described. The prior searches found matches for \"Plaintiffs.*Individual\" six matches including in Amended Class Action Complaint, Class Action Complaint, Memorandum Opinion and Order. However no further extraction was done. The current status indicates only one value extracted. We need to see if there are individual plaintiffs descriptions. The requirement: extract every distinct value, including individual plaintiffs with description.\n\nThus we need to search for patterns indicating individual plaintiffs description. The earlier search for \"(?i)Individual, described\" found none. Search for \"Plaintiff, Individual\" found none. But there might be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as...\" etc. We need to read relevant docs. The doc coverage: Amended Class Action Complaint partially visited 0-186 tokens. That may include the initial statement of the complaint. Possibly contains \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" at the top. But individual plaintiffs might be described later. The other docs: Class Action Complaint, Proposed Second Amended, Docket (002), Memorandum Opinion and Order, etc.\n\nWe need to find any mention of individual plaintiffs. The search results earlier gave 6 matches: 1 in Amended Class Action Complaint, 1 in Class Action Complaint, 1 in Memorandum Opinion and Order (+3 more docs). So we should read those matching areas to confirm if they mention individual plaintiffs and description.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex again with pattern for \"Plaintiff.*Individual\" but maybe we need to capture context. We could search for \"Plaintiff, Individual\" and \"Plaintiff.*Individual\" again. But we might need to locate the matches.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex to get the matches again, but we need to specify doc_names to target. The docs with matches: Amended Class Action Complaint, Class Action Complaint, Memorandum Opinion and Order, plus 3 other docs (maybe the Docket 001, 002? unclear). But we can just search all again; it will return top matches per doc. Then we can read those contexts.\n\nWe need to extract the values: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" (already extracted). If there are individual plaintiffs, we need to extract \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nThus next step: search_document_regex again for pattern \"(?i)Plaintiff.*Individual\" or maybe \"Plaintiffs?[: ]+(Individual)\"? But earlier they used \"(?i)Plaintiff, Individual\" and found none. But maybe the phrase is \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" etc. The earlier search for \"(?i)Plaintiffs?[: ]+(Class Action|Individual)\" found 0 matches. That's odd. Maybe the formatting is different. Could be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" and \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as...\". But earlier search didn't find any matches for Individual. But search for \"Plaintiffs.*Individual\" returned 6 matches. But maybe those matches were not captured due to anchored pattern? Let's check. The earlier search for \"Plaintiffs.*Individual\" might have matched \"Plaintiffs\" followed by any characters then \"Individual\". That could match \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\". But the subsequent search that anchored \"Plaintiffs?[: ]+(Class Action|Individual)\" returned 0. So maybe the formatting is not straightforward. Let's just search again for \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" exactly. But might not match. Could be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as\".\n\nLet's search for \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual,\" etc. Or \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" pattern. Also maybe \"Plaintiff: Individual\". Let's search for \"(?i)Plaintiff.*Individual\" again but capture context. Use search_document_regex with doc_names? We can search all.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex with pattern \"(?i)Plaintiff.*Individual\" to get matches. But this might have already been done earlier and returned 6 matches. But we need to read the contexts to confirm. We can also search for pattern \"Individual, described as\" again because that might give description. But earlier step 5 found 0 matches. So maybe the description is not that phrase.\n\nMaybe the description appears as \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\". If search earlier for \"Individual, described\" found none, maybe the phrase is \"Individual, described as\". That was step 5. No matches.\n\nBut maybe it's \"Plaintiff, Individual, described as\". That was step 6; no matches.\n\nThus maybe the description is not included in the documents? But the requirement is to extract the designation and description if available. If not, only class action.\n\nBut earlier step 8 said stop: only one distinct value (class action) was found and documented. But the system is prompting to double-check. We need to verify if any individual plaintiffs exist. Let's inspect the Amended Class Action Complaint, doc covering 0-186 tokens. Let's read more of that doc to see if there's a mention of individual plaintiffs. Use read_document on Amended Class Action Complaint starting at token 186-500 maybe.

The extracted value should be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". We need to identify all unique values.\n\nThus we should read more of Amended Class Action Complaint and other documents to find if there are any other designations. The Amended Complaint likely says \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". But maybe there is a mention of \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" in the Class Action Complaint or other doc. For example, the \"Class Action Complaint\" may start with \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\".\n\nAlso the \"Docket (002)\" may have docket entries about the case, but might not include designations. The \"Memorandum Opinion and Order\" may mention \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". The \"Memorandum and Order\" etc. But likely they all refer to class action. But we need to confirm.\n\nGoal: Extract all distinct values. So if all documents refer to \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" only, we already have that one. But we need to verify that no other documents mention individual plaintiffs. We should search for \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual,\" in the texts.\n\nWe could use search_document_regex with pattern \"(?i)Plaintiffs?: Individual\" or similar across all documents. Or we could read the earlier partially visited parts of documents.\n\nWe have partially visited tokens: Amended Class Action Complaint: 0-500. We should read further to see the heading. The heading likely includes \"Plaintiffs:\" line. Let's read tokens around 500-1000 maybe. But the earlier read captured introduction, not the heading. The heading might be earlier than token 186. The read started at 186-500, so we might have missed earlier part. Let's read from 0-200 maybe. But we already have 0-500 partially visited. We need to read 500-1000 to see further.\n\nAlternatively, we could search for \"Plaintiffs:\" pattern across all docs. Let's do search_document_regex with pattern \"(?i)Plaintiffs?: Class Action|Plaintiffs?: Individual\" across all docs. That will provide matches. But we need to confirm the context.\n\nGiven we have partial visited content, but we don't know if the heading appears earlier than 186. But let's search.\n\nWe can do search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"(?i)Plaintiffs?: (Class Action|Individual)\" and maybe include \"described as\". Let's do that.\n\nWe should set context_tokens maybe 200.

We saw amending complaint: that is a class action complaint. The class action status is likely \"Class Action\" for that complaint. Individual would be in other docs: e.g., Memorandum Opinion and Order includes named plaintiffs.
