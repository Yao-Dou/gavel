Also maybe other documents contain filing dates. We should find filing dates in other documents. The Amended Class Action Complaint might have its own filing date. We need to search for patterns of date format. The earlier regex did not find matches because maybe format is different e.g., \"Filed on 12/05/16\" or \"Filed: 12/05/16\". We saw \"Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16\". So regex pattern should capture numeric dates like mm/dd/yy. Also maybe dates in other formats like \"Filed: 12/05/2016\" or \"Filed: December 5, 2016\". We should search for pattern \"Filed.*?(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4})\" or \"Filed.*?([A-Za-z]+ \\d{1,2}, \\d{4})\".

The second one was \"Filed\\s*[:\\-]\\s*([A-Za-z]+ \\d{1,2}, \\d{4})\". So numeric dates missed. So we should search for numeric dates. Let's use regex: \"Filed\\s+(?:in\\s+\\w+\\s+on\\s+)?(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4})\" but simpler: \"Filed.*?(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4})\". Let's search all documents for that pattern.

We have already search results showing many matches with dates. We need to extract all distinct filing dates across documents. The search results show many \"Filed on ...\" dates. We should confirm all unique dates. We saw from search that \"Amended Class Action Complaint\" has \"Filed on 03/01/17\". Also the original complaint has \"Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16\". Also docket documents might have filing dates. Possibly other documents have \"Filed\" lines. We need to find all dates.\n\nWe have partial coverage of documents. We can search for \"Filed\" pattern again but maybe we already did. It found 57 matches across 10 docs. We need to read further to capture all. But we have the matches list from step5, showing specific matches with dates for Amended Complaint and Class Complaint. For Docket documents, there are 10 matches each. Also other documents. We need to read them to capture dates.\n\nBetter to search again for pattern \"Filed on\" or \"Filed in\" across all docs. But we already did. The matches are in the results but we haven't extracted all. We could read the full matches for each document. But easier: use search_document_regex again with pattern that captures dates and returns context. We can get all matches. The earlier search returned 57 total matches. We need to capture the filing dates from all these matches. Might be easier to read each match for each doc to extract date. But we can use search_document_regex again with pattern that matches \"Filed.*?(\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4})\". But that will return matches. But we need to read the context to extract evidence. We can use search_document_regex to fetch the matches with context. We can then parse dates.\n\nGiven we are to produce JSON via tool calls. We need to call search_document_regex to get matches. Then we can parse dates and produce append_checklist. But we need to ensure each entry has evidence with text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe might need to read the context to get precise location. search_document_regex returns matches with context. The snippet includes document name and tokens. In the earlier search, we saw the snippet includes \"Case 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 1 of 24\". So that will be evidence snippet.\n\nWe need to capture distinct filing dates: 12/05/16, 03/01/17. There may be other documents with other filing dates. Let's check if other documents have dates: Docket documents might have \"Filed\" lines with dates. Let's search manually? We don't have content. Let's just search for \"Filed\" in Docket (001). Use search_document_regex on that doc. We'll get matches. Similarly for Docket (002). Also for \"Final Approval Order and Judgment\" maybe not relevant. The \"Memorandum Opinion and Order\" might have \"Filed\" but not sure. But we can search all docs again.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for pattern \"Filed.*?(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4})\" on all documents. Already did similar but maybe we can refine. But we need to capture all matches. We should call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern: \"(?i)Filed[^0-9]*(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4})\". Let's do that.\n\nBut we need to see the context around each match to extract evidence. The function returns matches with context tokens.

Already plenty of matches found by search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(?i)filed.*?(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4})\" found many matches. Also earlier search for \"filed on\" etc found 0. The search results show many dates.\n\nWe need to capture all distinct dates from the corpus. The documents include:\n\n- Amended Class Action Complaint: \"Filed on 03/01/17\" appears multiple times. Also \"Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16\" appears in Class Action Complaint and Amended? The Amended complaint also may have \"Filed on 03/01/17\" and maybe \"Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16\"? We saw in Class Action Complaint, \"File in TXSD on 12/05/16\" at top. The Amended complaint also shows \"Filed on 03/01/17\".\n\n- Docket (001) has many entries each with \"Date Filed: 12/05/2016\" etc. Many docket entries \"Date Filed\" values, but filing date refers to initial filing? The requirement: \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So likely the initial filing date of the complaint. For the case, the complaint was filed 12/05/2016. The amended complaint filed later 03/01/2017. But the filing date of the lawsuit is 12/05/2016. So we should extract that unique date.\n\nBut maybe other documents have initial filing dates. The docket entries show many \"Date Filed\" but those are subsequent filings. The complaint itself shows \"Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16\". So we should capture that.\n\nAlso the Amended complaint shows \"Filed on 03/01/17\". That might be the filing date of the amended complaint, but the lawsuit was first filed earlier. The requirement maybe just first filing date. But the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So include all distinct dates that correspond to filing dates. So we may include both 12/05/16 and 03/01/17.\n\nAlso docket entries show \"12/05/2016\" many times. That is same date. So unique dates: 12/05/2016, 03/01/2017. Also possibly other dates like 12/06/2016 etc but those are separate docket entries. However they are also filing dates of docket entries, but the item is \"Filing_Date\" of lawsuit. The question says \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So listing other docket filing dates might be irrelevant. But the instruction says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" If the item is defined as first filing date, then only those two. But we need to be careful.\n\nWe should confirm from documents: In Class Action Complaint, the header shows \"Document 1 Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16\". That is the file date of the complaint. In Amended Class Action Complaint, header shows \"Document 19 Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD\". That is the amended complaint filing date. So distinct values: \"12/05/2016\" and \"03/01/2017\". Also maybe \"12/05/2016\" appears in other documents like docket. But we only need distinct values. So we will have two entries.\n\nWe need to append them with evidence.\n\nWe need to gather evidence snippet text for each date: from the complaint header and amended complaint header.\n\nWe have seen the snippet for Amended complaint: in search results: tokens 0-108 snippet shows \"Case 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 1 of 24\". Good. And Class Action Complaint snippet: tokens 0-108 snippet shows \"Case 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 1 of 14\". So we can use those.\n\nThus we need to call append_checklist with key Filing_Date and extracted entries: two entries, each with evidence.\n\nWe need to include source_document names: \"Amended Class Action Complaint\" and \"Class Action Complaint\". Location: page info.\n\nWe need to include text snippet.\n\nLet's create evidence array for each entry:\n\nEntry 1: value \"12/05/2016\" evidence: text \"Case 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 1 of 14\". source_document: \"Class Action Complaint\". location: \"Document 1, Page 1\".\n\nEntry 2: value \"03/01/2017\" evidence: text \"Case 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 1 of 24\". source_document: \"Amended Class Action Complaint\". location: \"Document 19, Page 1\".\n\nWe should ensure we provide distinct values. The dates are mm/dd/yy format. Should we convert to standard? The requirement: \"The calendar date\". Just provide as text. Good.\n\nThus we call append_checklist.\n\nNow is there any other filing date? The docket entries show \"Date Filed: 12/05/2016\" but that's same date. They also show \"Date Filed 12/05/2016\" etc. So no new. \"12/06/2016\" etc but those are docket entries for other actions. But they are filing dates of those docket entries. But the item is first filing date. So we ignore.\n\nThus we can append.\n\nLet's proceed.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"patch\":[{\"key\":\"Filing_Date\",\"extracted\":[{\"value\":\"12/05/2016\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"Case 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 1 of 14\",\"source_document\":\"Class Action Complaint\",\"location\":\"Document 1, Page 1\"}]},{\"value\":\"03/01/2017\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"Case 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 1 of 24\",\"source_document\":\"Amended Class Action Complaint\",\"location\":\"Document 19, Page 1\"}]}]}]\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14641, "completion_tokens": 1408, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Also in Docket (001) we saw 12/05/2016, 12/27/2016, etc. But filing date refers to the filing of the lawsuit, i.e., the first filing of the complaint. Usually the original complaint filed 12/05/16. The amended complaint filed 03/01/17. There might be other documents with filing dates like \"Date Filed: 12/05/2016\". We need all distinct filing dates across documents. That could be many dates for individual filings of motions, etc., but the \"Filing Date\" in the checklist likely refers to the filing date of the lawsuit (initial filing). But the instructions say \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we should capture all dates that appear in the context of \"Filed\" or \"Date Filed\". That includes many. But we should confirm if the scope is just the filing date of the lawsuit, or all filing dates. The checklist item description: \"Filing_Date: The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" That suggests only the first filing date. So we need to extract the date when the lawsuit was first filed. That would be 12/05/16 (12/05/2016). In the documents, we saw the complaint says \"Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16\". Also the docket shows \"Date Filed: 12/05/2016\". The amended complaint filed 03/01/17 but that's not the first filing. So we should extract only 12/05/2016. But could there be other dates?

But there are multiple documents: Amended Class Action Complaint (Filed on 03/01/17), Docket (001) has date 12/05/2016. There might be other filing dates like 03/01/17, maybe 12/05/16 appears in multiple docs. Also maybe the docket shows other dates for other events. The filing date of the lawsuit is likely the earliest date the complaint was filed: 12/05/2016. The amended complaint filed 03/01/2017. But the filing date check lists the \"calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" That is 12/05/2016. So maybe only one filing date. But the task says extract every distinct value found in any document. There might be other documents that refer to filing dates of other documents (e.g., docket entries). But those are not the filing date of the lawsuit. We must be careful: The checklist item \"Filing_Date\" refers to the lawsuit filing date. So we should only extract 12/05/2016. However, the Amended Complaint also has \"Filed on 03/01/17\", but that's the amendment filing date, not the lawsuit filing. But the instruction might still consider it as a filing date because it's a filing event. The definition: \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So only first filing. So we should only capture 12/05/2016. But we already have it. We need to confirm that no other distinct filing dates appear for the lawsuit. Let's search for \"Filed on\" patterns. We saw \"Filed on 03/01/17\" in Amended Complaint. But that's not the first filing. But if we need distinct filing dates, we might include 03/01/17 as well? But the definition says first filing. So only 12/05/2016. But the instruction \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" That might mean if there are multiple documents referencing the filing date, we need to list each distinct occurrence, but duplicates are fine.

So no further extraction necessary.\n\nWe need to ensure all values extracted: only one value. We have it.

Let's search \"Date Filed\" in all documents. But we already saw Docket (001) shows Date Filed: 12/05/2016. Docket (002) maybe has other dates like 12/07/2016, 12/08/2016 etc. Those are docket entries.\n\nBut the filing date of the lawsuit remains 12/05/2016.

But Amended Class Action Complaint includes many \"Filed on\" entries, e.g., \"Case 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD\". That is a different filing date (03/01/17).

The filing date of the lawsuit is likely the earliest filed complaint, which may be the Class Action Complaint. The Amended Complaint not relevant? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need all distinct filing dates found in any document. So we saw 12/05/2016, 03/01/17.

But we need to confirm if any other documents have other filing dates. They searched Docket (002) and found none. But maybe Amended Class Action Complaint or Proposed Second Amended Class Action Complaint contains different filing date. They haven't fully visited Amended Class Action Complaint (34% coverage). Perhaps there are other filing dates.\n\nWe should search for \"Filed on\" pattern again across all docs, but they already did many regex searches; but maybe the date format differs like \"12/5/2016\" or \"12/05/2016\". They found 93 matches earlier. But only appended one. But maybe other matches are same date. Need to ensure no other distinct dates. Let's search across all documents for date patterns: \"(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4})\" with context. They did earlier but found 57 matches, 40 matches. There might be matches in the Amended complaint that are 12/05/2016. But we need to check if any other date like 06/12/2016 appears. Let's search again across all docs for date patterns but include alternate month/day ordering? They used \\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}. That should capture any. But maybe the filing date appears as \"May 12, 2016\" etc. They searched earlier for \"File.*?(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4})\" but not full year.

Current status: Keys with Values: 1/1, empty keys 0/1? Wait there is 1 key Filing_Date, 1 value extracted (but maybe not fully?). They say \"Keys with Extracted Values (1): Filing_Date: 1 value (1 from Class Action Complaint, 1 from Docket (001))\". That seems contradictory: 1 value but says 1 from each. Maybe they have duplication? Probably they've extracted 12/05/2016 from multiple docs but need to ensure distinct values. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So need to find all distinct filing dates across all documents. They found 12/05/2016 earlier, but maybe there are other dates. The current coverage: some parts of documents partially visited. We saw in Amended Complaint excerpt: \"Case 4:16-cv-03577 Document 19 Filed on 03/01/17\". That's 3/01/2017. Maybe other dates. Also Class Action Complaint might have its own filing date. We need to search for filing dates across all docs. They previously searched with patterns but only got matches in some docs. The earliest step 5 found 57 matches across several docs. Step 6 found 40 matches. The search pattern presumably picks up dates in docket entries. They might have extracted only one date but maybe others exist. We need to confirm distinct dates. Likely there are multiple docket entries for different dates: maybe initial filing date 12/05/2016, docket entries in 2017, etc. So we need to extract all distinct filing dates.\n\nWe should search documents for \"Filed on\" dates. We can use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern: \"(?i)File.*?(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4})\". They already did step 8 with that pattern and got 93 matches across docs. We need to find distinct dates. But we need evidence for each. We can search again, maybe refine to capture \"Filed on\" and \"File on\" etc. The pattern used earlier likely returned many matches; we can process. But we need to extract distinct dates. Probably we need to read some documents to get the dates that are filing dates, not docket entries. Possibly the Class Action Complaint may have a \"Filed on\" date near the beginning. The docket entries show dates of filings. The first filing date might be the earliest docket entry. We need to find unique dates across all docs.\n\nGiven we have many partially visited docs, we should search for \"Filed on\" or \"File on\" across all docs. But they already did step 8 returned 93 matches. We could process those matches to extract distinct dates. But we need to provide evidence. We could use search_document_regex to return context; each match includes context which we could use as evidence. Then we can append unique dates.\n\nHowever we need not read entire docs again; we can rely on search results that include context. The search_document_regex returns top_k matches per doc with context. We can request many. For each distinct date, we can use context as evidence. But we need to ensure we include the exact snippet. The evidence struct requires text, source_document, location. The location may be page number or section. In search_document_regex, the context may include location info. We might need to parse the returned context to get location. Might be simpler to read specific ranges where dates appear.\n\nBut given time, we can just use search_document_regex to get all matches across all docs. Then we can parse unique dates from results. But we need to provide evidence entries for each date. The evidence snippet is the matched text.\n\nWe need to append distinct dates. The earlier append_checklist only appended one value. We need to append all distinct dates found.\n\nBut maybe the earlier append_checklist added one date \"12/05/2016\" from Class Action Complaint and Docket (001). But maybe there are more, like \"03/01/2017\" from Amended Complaint. We need to append that too. Also maybe other dates like \"12/05/2016\" appears multiple times.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern capturing dates. Then append distinct dates. But we need only one action per turn. We can combine searching and appending in separate turns. The step 8 search returned 93 matches. We could perform that search again with top_k maybe 20 per doc. But we need to ensure we capture all.\n\nAlternatively, we could read the documents partially visited to find distinct dates, but that would require many read_document calls. Better to use search_document_regex to gather matches.\n\nThus next action: call search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"(?i)File.*?(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4})\" or similar. Provide context around each match. Already did step 8. But we might need to retrieve matches with more context or all matches. They had top_k default 5. That might have limited number of matches per doc. We need all distinct dates. We can set top_k to maybe 20 per doc. Let's call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern \"(?i)File.*?(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4})\", flags [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k=20, context_tokens=200. That should return matches.

The snapshot says current status: Keys with extracted values (1): Filing_Date: 1 value (1 from Class Action Complaint, 1 from Docket (001)). Actually says 1 value? But earlier they had 1 value? They appended 1 value earlier. It seems they found one distinct filing date 12/05/2016. But the document shows other filing dates like 03/01/17, etc. But maybe those are docket entries, not the initial filing date. The filing date for the lawsuit is the date the complaint was filed: likely 12/05/2016. That appears in the docket. But we need to ensure that we have extracted all distinct filing dates. The earlier step says only one distinct filing date applies. But we need to confirm if that is correct. The docket shows \"Date Filed: 12/05/2016\" and also \"Filed on 03/01/17\" maybe for an amended complaint. The filing date of the lawsuit is the original complaint. So there is only one filing date. But we need to double-check if other documents like \"Amended Class Action Complaint\" might have a filing date. The snippet shows \"Case 4:16-cv-03577 Document 19 Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD\". That is the filing date of the amended complaint. But the question: \"Extract the filing date from the legal documents. Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" That could include original complaint filing date and amended complaint filing date. But the definition: \"Filing_Date: The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So that would be the first filing date only. So only 12/05/2016. So we have that.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have evidence for that date. We saw in Docket (001) the \"Date Filed: 12/05/2016\". Also in Docket (001) there are many entries with 12/05/2016. That is the filing date. Also in the Class Action Complaint maybe there is a date. But we have the evidence.\n\nNow we need to append the extracted value. They already appended earlier but maybe they didn't include evidence. They appended one value but no evidence? Step 9: `append_checklist` (Filing_Date). They appended 1 value for 1 key: Filing_Date. But we don't know what evidence they used. We might need to confirm we have evidence for the extracted value. If we don't see evidence, we might need to re-append with evidence. But the system says we have 1 value extracted. But we must ensure that the evidence is included. The checklist might have extracted entries from earlier step but we can't see them. But we must provide evidence. We could append new entry with evidence. But we must not duplicate. We should check if the extracted value already present. We don't know. We can check the checklist. But we can call get_checklist.\n\nThe instruction: After each read_document or search_document_regex, analyze and then append. But we haven't read any new document. The last action was read_document on Amended Class Action Complaint tokens 108-1008. That was read, but no extract. We might need to extract the filing date from that document. The snippet shows \"Case 4:16-cv-03577 Document 19 Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD\". That's a filing date for the amended complaint. But the original filing date is not there. But we might want to confirm.\n\nBut the requirement: \"Extract the filing date from the legal documents.\" The filing date is the date the lawsuit was first filed. That is 12/05/2016.

{"step": 17, "run_id": "b37f93fd-ac0e-4b01-bfe6-50bdb1add2ea", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T14:16:55.693008-05:00", "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to consider that the checklist has 1 key: Filing_Date. According to the progress, 1 value is extracted. The checklist shows 1/1 filled, 0 empty. That indicates the checklist is considered complete. But we need to confirm if there might be multiple filing dates? The earlier search shows matches for multiple dates in docket (001) and docket (002) etc. But the filing date might be unique (the date the lawsuit was first filed). The docket shows Date Filed: 12/05/2016. The complaint might have a different date? The complaint might have a date filed too. In the read of the Amended Complaint, there's \"Case 4:16-cv-03577 Document 19 Filed on 03/01/17\". But that is a docket entry, not the complaint filing date. The complaint likely was filed earlier. The docket shows Date Filed 12/05/2016. That is the likely filing date. So the checklist might be complete with one value: 12/05/2016.\n\nBut we need to ensure that we didn't miss any other filing dates. The docket (002) might have a Date Filed for the second docket. Let's inspect the docket (002) tokens 0-345, 469-1428, 1798-2293. But we haven't read them. However, the docket (002) might be a later docket. Yet the filing date remains the same. The docket (002) likely starts with \"U.S. District Court ... Date Filed: 12/05/2016\" too. But we haven't read it. But the filing date might be same. But we need to confirm that the filing date is the same across docs. But we have at least one value. If the checklist is considered complete with 1 value, we can stop. But we should double-check whether the \"Class Action Complaint\" might also have a filing date. The \"Class Action Complaint\" read earlier tokens 0-2000 shows \"Case No. 16-CV-3577\" but no date. But maybe later in the document there is a date. But the filing date is usually on the first page of the complaint. The docket shows the filing date. So it's safe.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nHowever, we need to check the system instruction: we must respond with valid JSON only, no prose. The last step we need to do: either stop or append new values. The get_checklist shows 1/1 filled. So we should stop.\n\nThus produce:\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All filing dates extracted\"\n}\n\nCheck format: It says \"stop\" type. Good.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All filing dates extracted\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All filing dates extracted", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9569, "completion_tokens": 586, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
