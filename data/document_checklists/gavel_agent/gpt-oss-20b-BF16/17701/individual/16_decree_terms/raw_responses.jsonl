That was part of complaint referencing injunction but not obligation.\n\nAlso match 3 7652-7852, 7733-7933 reference injunction but the obligation might be earlier.\n\nLet's check other documents: Class Action Complaint also has obligations: tokens 2150-2350 includes \"operates under a permanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-four hours without taking the person before a magistrate.\" That's an obligation.\n\nTokens 3418-3618 includes similar.\n\nSo we need to capture those obligations.\n\nAdditionally, there might be decree terms in the Final Approval Order and Judgment, but we saw only header.

The injunction is a court order, so yes. But we must ensure that the obligations are incorporated into the decree or order, not just settlement. The injunction is an order, so obligations are part of decree.\n\nThus we will append these obligations.\n\nWe need to read each window fully to capture full text for evidence.\n\nLet's read first window: Amended Class Action Complaint tokens 4508-4708.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Amended Class Action Complaint\",\"start_token\":4508,\"end_token\":4708}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Amended Class Action Complaint", "start_token": 4508, "end_token": 4708}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5368, "completion_tokens": 1057, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

So maybe the decree terms are not present? But the final order might include the decree terms after token 231? But the document length is 231 tokens, so no. So maybe the decree terms are not yet extracted because they are in the \"Memorandum Opinion and Order\" but we didn't search for \"decree\" there. Search found 0 matches. So maybe we need to search in other documents like \"Memorandum and Order\" or \"Order and Findings on Sanctions and Motions\" etc. The pattern \"decree\" may not appear in those. But the decree terms might be in \"Final Approval Order and Judgment\" but not found due to pattern not matching? But we searched for \"decree\" and found 0 matches. So maybe the decree terms are not present? Could be that the decree terms are not in the documents we have. But the task expects extraction. Maybe the decree terms are in \"Final Approval Order and Judgment\" but we need to read entire document; we did. So no.\n\nWait maybe the decree terms are in the \"Memorandum Opinion and Order\" but search didn't find \"decree\". But maybe the decree terms are in the \"Memorandum and Order\" or \"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Unopposed Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs\" or \"Order and Findings on Sanctions and Motions\" etc. We haven't searched those. So we should search for \"decree\" in those documents. Let's search across all documents for \"decree\" again; we had earlier searching on Final Approval Order and Judgment found 0. But we could search on all remaining documents. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(decree|injunction)\" maybe. But we already searched for \"injunction\" earlier. But for decree, we should search again on all documents. Let's do search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"decree\". That will return matches with context.

The complaint likely contains requests for a consent decree. But the decree terms would be in the Final Approval Order and Judgment? That doc was fully visited but only 231 tokens, maybe the decree is not in it. Maybe the decrees are in the \"Final Approval Order and Judgment\" but we didn't see. We didn't read beyond 231 tokens? Wait step 5 read 0-2000 tokens but only 231 tokens? The doc has 231 tokens, so fully visited. No decree terms found.\n\nWe have \"Memorandum Opinion and Order\" partially visited. It might contain a decree order. We searched for decree in it and found none. But we might need to read more. The doc has 6,403 tokens. We have read tokens 388-588, 660-2263.

But we need evidence that decree terms are not present. We need explicit text or dispositive posture. Maybe we can use the search results that found 0 matches across all docs. But that is evidence that no decree terms exist. But we must provide evidence. The evidence can be the search result summary? But we need actual text. We could search for \"decree\" again but maybe get no matches. We can use search_document_regex on all docs and get matches list. It returned 0. That is evidence that no decree terms exist. But we need a snippet? The search returns no matches. But we might need to provide evidence from the context that there is no decree. We could search for \"consent decree\" and get 0. That suggests no. But we need evidence that indicates the decree is not present. The search results themselves are evidence? But the evidence field requires text snippet. We could take the snippet from the search results showing no matches. But not a snippet.\n\nMaybe better: Search for \"decree\" again but we might get no matches. But we can then use update_checklist to set Not Applicable with evidence that search found no matches.\n\nBut the spec: Not Applicable requires evidence with text from document. The search result is not text from document. So we might need to read a doc that shows no decree terms. For example, read the entire Final Approval Order and Judgment (which we did). It didn't contain decree terms. That is evidence. But we didn't see content beyond header. But we saw only header.\n\nThus we can use that doc as evidence. But we need to provide the text snippet that shows no decree terms. But we didn't read the entire doc because it only had 231 tokens, and we saw all of it. It didn't contain decree terms. That is evidence.\n\nThus we can set Not Applicable.\n\nBut we must ensure that we have considered all docs. The search across all docs found 0 matches for \"decree\". That covers all docs. So we can set Not Applicable.\n\nThus action: update_checklist for Significant_Terms_of_Decrees with extracted single entry value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence from the search result? But we need evidence text. We could provide evidence from the search result that says \"Search in all documents found 0 total matches\". But that is not text from a document. But we could provide evidence from reading the Final Approval Order and Judgment, showing that no decree terms present. The snippet we saw is only header. That is evidence.\n\nThus we will produce update_checklist with key Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, extracted list: one entry with value \"Not Applicable\", evidence: text: the header snippet, source_document: \"Final Approval Order and Judgment\", location: \"Page 1 of 6\" (or \"Page 1 of 6\" etc).

Use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"decree\" but earlier step 11 did that and found 0 matches. That included all documents? Step 11 says search in 10 documents found 0 total matches. That seems to include all. So likely there is no \"decree\" text in any order.

Step 14 search for \"consent decree\" found 0 matches. So maybe no decrees. But we might still have \"injunction\" but step 6 found matches only in complaints. So maybe no decree terms. The current Not Applicable may be correct. But we should confirm that no other documents contain decree terms. We should search for \"injunction\" again? Step 6 found 9 matches all in complaints. So no order has injunction. Maybe there is a \"court order\" that orders something but not called decree. But the requirement: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders.\" So any substantive obligations ordered by court in an order document. That could be in Final Approval Order and Judgment, which is a court order. But the Not Applicable evidence suggests that the order had no substantive obligations? But Final Approval Order and Judgment likely contains a decree about future conduct? But earlier reading of 231 tokens didn't show any. Did we read entire order? The Final Approval Order and Judgment is only 231 tokens, and we read it fully. It seems to be just a header, no decree. So indeed no substantive obligations.

Currently marked Not Applicable based on evidence from Final Approval Order and Judgment. But we need to confirm if any decree terms are present elsewhere. We saw many references to injunctions and decrees in complaints. However those are not court orders; they refer to a permanent injunction etc. The decree terms should come from court orders, e.g., Final Approval Order and Judgment, Memorandum Opinion and Order, etc. We have read Final Approval Order and Judgment fully; it says it's a decree? But the evidence indicated Not Applicable. That suggests that the final order didn't contain substantive terms.\n\nWe should check other orders: Memorandum Opinion and Order, Memorandum and Order, Order Granting etc. Maybe those contain decree terms.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. So we need to see if any of the orders contain decree terms. Likely the Final Approval Order and Judgment might include decree terms if it enjoins or orders. But the evidence says Not Applicable. Might be that the order just says \"entered\" but no decree terms. So we need to verify other orders.\n\nWe have partially visited memorandum opinion and order (viewed tokens 388-588, 660-4264). That includes large part of document. But maybe the decree terms are in earlier part not read? We have 388-588 covers start. 660-4264 covers later. But we haven't read 0-387. That might contain decree terms. Let's search for \"decree\" in that document. Search again. We did search and found none. But maybe the decree terms are in other order documents.\n\nCheck \"Memorandum and Order\" (token 2263-2463). That's a small part. The rest not visited. Similarly \"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Unopposed Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs\" unvisited. That might not have decree terms.\n\n\"Order and Findings on Sanctions and Motions\" unvisited.\n\nThus we need to search for terms that indicate court orders. Maybe \"decree\" appears but not captured due to pattern. We could search for \"entered\" maybe. But we need substantive obligations. The decree terms could be \"the City shall cease detaining persons without a warrant for more than 24 hours...\" etc. That is from injunction references, but those are court orders (injunction). So we need to find the actual text of the injunction orders. The complaints mention injunction but not the actual order.\n\nThus we need to locate the injunction orders. They might be in the docket documents (001, 002). Those are unvisited. They may contain the actual order decree. So we need to read those documents or search for \"injunction\" within them.\n\nWe should search within Docket (001) and Docket (002) for \"injunction\" or \"decree\" or \"order\" maybe. Let's search for \"injunction\" in both. Use search_document_regex with doc_names list.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Docket (001)\",\"Docket (002)\"],\"pattern\":\"injunction\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Docket (001)", "Docket (002)"], "pattern": "injunction", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7971, "completion_tokens": 675, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But is that correct? The requirement: Extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. We have identified the court order. The order likely has no decree terms? The Final Approval Order and Judgment likely just says order entered, maybe has no decree terms. But we need to ensure if there are any decree terms elsewhere. The search for \"decree\" returned no matches in Final Approval Order and Judgment. But other documents may include injunctions with terms. However, injunctions are orders. The requirement: include substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders. So injunctions can be considered terms. So we need to extract terms from injunctions found in complaints? Wait, injunctions are orders, but the complaints mention injunctions but those may be pre-existing orders (permanent injunction). Are those orders part of the case? They are court orders that impose obligations: \"City remains under a permanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-four hours without taking the person before a magistrate.\" That is a substantive obligation. But is that an order? It's a permanent injunction from a prior case, but it's an order that remains in effect. So it is a court order. So we should extract that as a term. Also there may be other injunction terms: \"City remains under a federal court injunction requiring it to bring warrantless arrestees before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest\". That's also a term. So we need to extract these terms. Also maybe other court orders? The Final Approval Order and Judgment may have a \"decree\" ordering something? But we didn't see. But we might need to search for \"decree\" again, but we did. The search found no matches in Final Approval Order and Judgment. But maybe there are other documents with \"decree\" or \"injunction\" that contain substantive terms. We saw in the complaints, but those are not orders, they're allegations. However, \"injunction\" is a prior order; the complaint references it. But the complaint is not the order. But the order might be elsewhere: maybe the \"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Unopposed Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs\" or \"Order and Findings on Sanctions and Motions\" might contain injunction terms? We haven't searched those. Also \"Memorandum and Order\" might have terms. The \"Memorandum Opinion and Order\" we read part of; but maybe there are no decree terms. But we should search for \"injunction\" in all documents again, but we did search and found 0 matches in Memorandum Opinion and Order, 0 matches in Docket (001) & (002), 0 in the other orders. Maybe we need to search for \"decree\" in other documents. But we did search all documents for \"decree\" and found none. But we might need to search for \"injunction\" again across all documents - we already did, 0 matches. But maybe the injunction terms are not in the order but in the complaint? But the complaint is not an order; but the injunction is a court order; its terms are in the complaint statement of the injunction. But the instruction: \"The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders.\" So even though the injunction is referenced in the complaint, the terms are still substantive obligations. We should extract those terms. But the source evidence should be the text that states the injunction terms. That is in the complaint. So we can extract from the complaint. The complaint is partially visited. We need to read the relevant token ranges that contain \"injunction\" terms. We have matches from search_document_regex for \"injunction\" and the snippets show the injunction text. So we can extract the terms: \"City remains under a permanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-four hours without taking the person before a magistrate.\" That's one term. Also \"City remains under a federal court injunction requiring it to bring warrantless arrestees before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest for a neutral determination of probable cause.\" That's another term. These appear in the complaint and second amended complaint.\n\nWe should verify if there are any other terms: maybe other documents mention \"decree\" that we didn't capture. Search again for \"decree\" might find \"consent decree\" but we saw none. But maybe the \"Final Approval Order and Judgment\" has a \"decree\" but the search didn't find; maybe the word \"decree\" is not present. So probably no others.\n\nThus we need to update the checklist: remove Not Applicable and instead add these terms. We should use update_checklist to replace the list for the key. We need to include evidence for each term.\n\nWe have evidence snippets from complaint: Amended Class Action Complaint token ranges 4640-4840 snippet shows injunction text. Also from Class Action Complaint snippet 2150-2350 shows injunction text. And from Second Amended Complaint snippet 4104-4304 shows injunction text. We can use those. We need to provide evidence per value: text, source_document, location.\n\nLocations: we can use page numbers? The complaint likely has page numbers. The snippet shows \"Page 5 of 14\" at top of snippet. That location can be used. For second amended, we have \"Page ?\" not provided but we can approximate. We can use token offsets.\n\nLet's extract the exact text for each term:\n\nTerm 1: \"City remains under a permanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-four hours without taking the person before a magistrate.\" This appears in the Class Action Complaint snippet 2150-2350. The snippet includes \"16.  The City of Houston “operates under a permanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-four hours without taking the person before a magistrate.”\". So evidence text: that sentence.\n\nTerm 2: \"City remains under a federal court injunction requiring it to bring warrantless arrestees before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest for a neutral determination of probable cause.\" This appears in Amended Complaint snippet 4640-4840: \"31.  Furthermore, the City of Houston remains under a federal-court injunction requiring it to bring warrantless arrestees before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest for a neutral determination of probable cause.\" Also appears in Second Amended Complaint snippet 4104-4304: \"32.  Furthermore, the City of Houston remains under a federal court injunction requiring it to bring warrantless arrestees before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest for a neutral determination of probable cause.\" So we can use one evidence snippet.\n\nThus two distinct terms. Also maybe the injunction \"permanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-four hours without taking the person before a magistrate.\" That is the same term as term1. So we have two terms.\n\nWe need to replace Not Applicable entry. Use update_checklist. Provide extracted array with two entries, each with evidence array of at least one evidence. Provide location: maybe \"Page 5 of 14\" for term1. For term2, maybe \"Page 5 of 14\" as well.\n\nBut the second amended complaint snippet shows similar. We can use one evidence snippet.\n\nNow produce update_checklist call.\n\nWe must include evidence with text exactly as snippet. Let's capture snippet text:\n\nFrom Class Action Complaint snippet:\n\n\"16.  The City of Houston “operates under a permanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-four hours without taking the person before a magistrate.”\"\n\nWe can include that exact phrase.\n\nFrom Amended Complaint snippet:\n\n\"31.  Furthermore, the City of Houston remains under a federal-court injunction requiring it to bring warrantless arrestees before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest for a neutral determination of probable cause.\"\n\nWe can include that.\n\nThus update_checklist patch:\n\nkey: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\"\n\nextracted: array of two entries:\n\nEntry 1:\n\nvalue: \"City remains under a permanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-four hours without taking the person before a magistrate.\"\n\nevidence: array with one evidence:\n\ntext: the snippet\n\nsource_document: \"Class Action Complaint\"\n\nlocation: \"Page 5 of 14\" (or token range 2150-2350)\n\nEntry 2:\n\nvalue: \"City remains under a federal court injunction requiring it to bring warrantless arrestees before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest for a neutral determination of probable cause.\"\n\nevidence: one evidence:\n\ntext: snippet\n\nsource_document: \"Amended Class Action Complaint\"\n\nlocation: \"Page 5 of 14\" (or token range 4640-4840)\n\nWe should also include evidence from Second Amended Complaint maybe, but not necessary.\n\nNow produce function call.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"patch\":[{\"key\":\"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\"extracted\":[{\"value\":\"City remains under a permanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-four hours without taking the person before a magistrate.\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"16.

Let's review unvisited documents: Docket (001), Docket (002), Order Granting Plaintiffs' Unopposed Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs, Order and Findings on Sanctions and Motions. These might contain further decree terms like injunctions? The docket may contain orders but not necessarily decree terms. The order on attorneys' fees might include an order but not a decree. But we need to ensure no other decree terms exist in the corpus. We can search for \"injunction\" across all documents again, maybe missed. But they already searched many times and found 9 matches. But maybe the other documents contain \"injunction\" or \"decree\" terms not captured because search didn't include them? They used pattern \"(decree|injunction)\" in all documents earlier and found 9 matches. Those matches were in the complaint docs. So likely no other decree terms in other documents. Could there be other decrees like \"consent decree\" or \"stipulated judgment\" etc. They searched for \"consent decree\" and found none. But maybe some orders contain \"injunction\" or \"decree\" but not captured due to partial coverage? For example Final Approval Order and Judgment might contain \"injunction\" but the first 231 tokens include just header; maybe further tokens contain decree terms. But the document is only 231 tokens; they read entire thing. So no more.\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion and Order: they read 388-588 and 660-4264 tokens, covering 59% of 6403 tokens. There might be more \"injunction\" terms beyond 4264? They read up to 4264, but token count is 6403, so there is unviewed section 4264-6403. They might contain decree terms. They also read 660-4264, so 4264-6403 unviewed. They should check for any \"injunction\" or \"decree\" there. They previously searched for \"injunction\" in the entire Memorandum Opinion and Order and found none. That search likely scanned entire doc, but maybe the search didn't cover unviewed due to token limit? But the search function returns matches across the entire doc; it would read all tokens anyway. It found none. So no further terms.\n\nThey also didn't search Docket docs. Dockets might contain orders including injunctions? But the docket could contain docket entries like \"Order granting injunction\" etc. The search across all documents earlier might have included dockets. The search was on all documents, so dockets included. They found 9 matches. So likely no more.\n\nThus extraction likely complete. But we need to be sure if any other decree terms exist. Let's consider \"decree\" or \"injunction\" within the other documents: Order Granting Attorneys' Fees, Order and Findings on Sanctions. These are orders but not necessarily decrees. They might contain \"injunction\" but unlikely. But we can search again for \"injunction\" across all documents to confirm no new matches. Already did. But we can call search_document_regex again to double-check maybe with different case flags? They used IGNORECASE maybe earlier? Not shown but likely default is no flags. But we can search for \"(?i)injunction\" to be safe. But they already saw matches. But still.\n\nHowever, the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have 2 values. Are they distinct? Yes.\n\nBut we need to ensure we didn't miss any other decree terms such as \"stated in the order\" like \"The city remains under a permanent injunction preventing...\" etc. They extracted two. One from Class Action Complaint: \"City remains under a permanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-four hours without taking the person before a magistrate.\" Another from Amended Class Action Complaint: \"City remains under a federal court injunction requiring it to bring warrantless arrestees before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest for a neutral determination of probable cause.\" Are there other terms like \"injunction requiring to bring warrantless arrestees before a magistrate within 24 hours\" repeated? That is same as second. So likely complete.\n\nBut what about \"decree terms\" like \"permanent injunction\" \"federal court injunction\" are terms. Might be more like \"injunction requiring...\" etc. But maybe the final approval order and judgment contains an order to stay or to release? But we don't know.\n\nWe could double-check by searching for \"injunction\" again with context. But given the prior search returned all matches, we can assume complete.\n\nSo we can stop.
