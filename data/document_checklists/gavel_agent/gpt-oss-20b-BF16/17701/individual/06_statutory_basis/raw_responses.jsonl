We have seen many matches for Fourth Amendment, and also Eighth Amendment in one document. Also possibly 14th Amendment. But we need to find all distinct bases.\n\nWe have already matched many Fourth Amendment references. We need to capture each distinct basis: e.g., \"Fourth Amendment\" is one. Also \"Fourteenth Amendment\" maybe. Also \"Eighth Amendment\" appears. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is cause-of-action vehicle, not to be included. Also \"Texas law\" maybe but not specific statute. Also \"American with other specific statutes\"? The search regex for Eighth Amendment found one match. We might also search for \"Fourteenth Amendment\" to ensure we capture. Also maybe \"First Amendment\" but not present. Let's search for \"Fourteenth Amendment\" and also \"14th Amendment\" pattern.\n\nWe should also search for \"14th Amendment\" matches. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"\\b(?:Fourteenth|14th) Amendment\\b\". Use all documents. That will give us matches for Fourteenth Amendment. Also \"Fourteenth Amendment\" appears multiple times. Also \"Eighth Amendment\". Also \"Fourteenth Amendment\" maybe repeated. Also \"14th Amendment\".\n\nAdditionally, there might be statutory basis like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" but that's cause-of-action vehicle; but the instructions say not to include cause-of-action vehicle. So ignore 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Also \"Texas law\" not a specific statute; but maybe \"state law\" but not specific.\n\nAlso \"Rehabilitation Act § 504\"? Not present. Check for \"Title II\" etc. Not present.\n\nSo likely distinct bases: Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Eighth Amendment. Also maybe \"Texas law\" but not a specific statute; will not include. Also maybe \"Texas law\" but not a statutory basis; it's a 'statutory basis' maybe but not specified. The instructions: \"statutory rights (e.g., ADA Title II, Rehab Act § 504)\". We need a specific statute. \"Texas law\" is generic, so not include.\n\nCheck also if there is any \"American with\" other specific statutes: maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" but that's cause-of-action. So ignore.\n\nThus we need to extract 3 distinct basis values.\n\nWe already have evidence snippets for Fourth Amendment from many matches. We need to capture distinct value \"Fourth Amendment\" with evidence. Provide evidence from one or more documents. Provide separate entry per distinct value. So we need to create three entries.\n\nWe need to gather evidence: we can use any snippet that mentions Fourth Amendment. We have matches from Amended Class Action Complaint, etc. We should read a snippet that includes the phrase \"Fourth Amendment\" and context. We can use search_document_regex to find matches for Fourth Amendment. But we already have search results for Fourth Amendment. We could use that as evidence without reading further. The search results include context of around 200 tokens. We need to include snippet text. We can use the search results' snippet as evidence.\n\nBut the search_document_regex output not exactly specified. But it returns matches with context tokens. We need to read them? The search result snippet shows excerpt. That can serve as evidence. We can use that snippet. The evidence must include 'text', 'source_document', 'location'. For location, we can use the token range or page? We can use token range. The search results list token ranges. We can use that.\n\nSo we need to perform search_document_regex for Fourth Amendment pattern to capture matches. But we already saw many matches. But we still need to produce evidence. We could use the search results to get evidence. But we might need to confirm it includes the phrase. The snippet includes \"Fourth Amendment\" and context. That qualifies.\n\nSimilarly for Fourteenth Amendment. Use search pattern.\n\nAlso for Eighth Amendment: we have one match.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for pattern \"Fourth Amendment\" and \"Fourteenth Amendment\" and \"Eighth Amendment\". We can search all docs. Use pattern with alternation.\n\nWe may do a single search_document_regex with pattern that includes all three? We can do pattern: \"\\b(?:Fourth|Fourteenth|Eighth) Amendment\\b\". That will find each. So next action: search_document_regex on all documents with that pattern. Then we will get matches with context. Use that as evidence.\n\nThus action: search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern as above.

We have many documents, but we already have search results that show many matches. But we haven't extracted them. We need to read each matched region to get evidence. We might do multiple reads, but we must pick one action per turn. We should read a document covering a match. Likely we should read \"Amended Class Action Complaint\" covering tokens 532-732, etc. But we need to extract all distinct bases: Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Eighth Amendment, maybe others like state law (e.g., Texas law). But the requirement: \"The substantive rights and sources of law allegedly violated—the 'what' was violated—such as specific constitutional provisions or clauses (e.g., Fourteenth Amendment – Equal Protection, First Amendment – Freedom of Association, Eighth Amendment) and statutory rights (e.g., ADA Title II, Rehab Act § 504). Do not include the cause-of-action vehicle itself (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983), remedies (injunctive relief, damages), or purely procedural doctrines (e.g., Rule 23, Ex parte Young). Prefer clause-level detail when available; if only the amendment or statute is named, list that.\"\n\nThus we need to list each distinct basis: Fourth Amendment (prompt probable cause), Fourteenth Amendment (equal protection maybe?), Eighth Amendment? The search for Eighth Amendment only found one mention in memorandum and order, maybe not relevant? But we should capture all.\n\nGiven we already have many matches, we need to read at least one match to extract evidence. Let's read the Amended Class Action Complaint section where tokens 532-732 includes \"Fourth Amendment requires a prompt judicial determination of probable cause\". That is one basis. Also tokens 1003-1299 includes same. But we need distinct values: \"Fourth Amendment\" (prompt probable cause). Also \"Fourteenth Amendment\" appears in many places: \"Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\". Also \"Eighth Amendment\" appears in memorandum and order. We also need state law: Texas law? The complaint says \"Texas law\". But we need statutory rights. They might mention \"Texas law\" but not a specific statute. Might need to include \"Texas law\" but not a specific statutory provision, but the requirement says \"statutory rights (e.g., ADA Title II, Rehab Act § 504)\". Texas law might not be specific, but perhaps \"Texas law\" is a broad statutory basis. Possibly we should include \"Texas law\" as a basis. But maybe it's not a specific statutory right. The requirement: \"The substantive rights and sources of law allegedly violated—the 'what' was violated—such as specific constitutional provisions or clauses (e.g., Fourteenth Amendment – Equal Protection, First Amendment – Freedom of Association, Eighth Amendment) and statutory rights (e.g., ADA Title II, Rehab Act § 504). Do not include the cause-of-action vehicle itself (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983), remedies (injunctive relief, damages), or purely procedural doctrines (e.g., Rule 23, Ex parte Young). Prefer clause-level detail when available; if only the amendment or statute is named, list that.\"\n\nThus \"Texas law\" might not be specific enough. But maybe we should include \"Texas law\" as a statutory basis? Might be arguable.\n\nBetter to extract the constitutional bases: Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment. Also Eighth Amendment from memorandum and order. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is cause-of-action vehicle, so exclude.\n\nAlso maybe \"State law\" refers to \"Texas law\" which might be a statutory right, but not specific. But we might still list \"Texas law\". The instruction says include statutory rights, but examples are specific statutes. If only the amendment or statute is named, list that. If it's just \"Texas law\", maybe that counts as statutory basis? But it's not specific. Might consider as a distinct value.\n\nWe should also check if any other statutes appear, e.g., \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is cause-of-action. \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is cause-of-action, exclude. \"Eighth Amendment\" is constitutional. \"Fourth Amendment\" includes clause. \"Fourteenth Amendment\" includes equal protection. But we need to capture clause-level detail: \"prompt judicial determination of probable cause\" is clause-level. For Fourteenth Amendment, there might be equal protection clause. But do we have that in the text? Let's search for \"Equal Protection\" maybe. The search didn't include that. But we can read further. Let's read the Amended Class Action Complaint around tokens 1003-1203 to capture \"Fourth Amendment\" clause. Then read maybe 1003-1203 includes \"Fourth Amendment requires a prompt judicial determination of probable cause\". That is same. But maybe we need to capture \"Fourth Amendment\" once.\n\nWe also need \"Fourteenth Amendment\" maybe appears in same section. Let's check the text: In match 2, the snippet shows \"Fourth Amendment\" only. But the complaint also includes \"the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\" in some places (e.g., memorandum and order). That is a distinct basis: Fourteenth Amendment. We need to capture that.\n\nAlso \"Eighth Amendment\" appears only in memorandum and order. That is a distinct basis.\n\nThus we should produce entries for:\n\n1. Fourth Amendment – prompt judicial determination of probable cause (clause-level).\n2. Fourteenth Amendment – as part of \"Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\" but maybe not specifying clause. Might include equal protection? But we can't assume, but we can list \"Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\" as a basis. But requirement: \"Prefer clause-level detail when available; if only the amendment or statute is named, list that.\" So we can list \"Fourth Amendment\" as one value, \"Fourteenth Amendment\" as another value. For \"Fourth Amendment\" we include clause-level detail. For Fourteenth Amendment, maybe we don't have clause-level detail, so just list the amendment.\n\n3. Eighth Amendment – maybe no clause-level detail.\n\nAlso maybe \"Texas law\" as a statutory basis. But let's see if text actually says \"Texas law\" in those matches. In match 1 snippet, the text says \"the Fourth Amendment requires a prompt judicial determination of probable cause after a warrantless arrest. ... violating ... the United States Constitution and state law.\" That mentions \"state law\". But not specific. But maybe we can include \"state law\" as a statutory basis. The requirement: \"statutory rights (e.g., ADA Title II, Rehab Act § 504)\". State law might be included if it's a statutory right. But not specific. Might be too vague. I think we should not include \"state law\" unless specific statute is named. So we skip.\n\nThus we need to gather evidence for each.\n\nWe have matches with evidence. Let's pick to read the \"Amended Class Action Complaint\" around tokens 532-732 to capture Fourth Amendment. Then we can also read another match for Fourteenth Amendment. Let's find a match that explicitly mentions Fourteenth Amendment. For example, in the \"Amended Class Action Complaint\" match 1 includes \"Fourth Amendment\" only. But later matches (like 6-7) may include \"Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\". Let's read token 9882-10189 which includes \"Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment\". That would provide evidence for Fourteenth Amendment. But we also might need evidence for Eighth Amendment. That appears in memorandum and order match 1 (tokens 5254-5454). We should read that.\n\nThus we need multiple reads. But we can only do one per turn. We'll start by reading the Amended Class Action Complaint tokens 532-732. That will give evidence for Fourth Amendment clause.\n\nThen we will append that to checklist.\n\nWe need to create patch with key \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\" and extracted entries.\n\nWe need to include evidence: text snippet, source_document, location. Location could be token range or page? We can use token range and maybe \"page 1\" but not given. We'll use token number range.\n\nThus first action: read_document for Amended Class Action Complaint, start_token 532, end_token 732.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Amended Class Action Complaint\",\"start_token\":532,\"end_token\":732}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Amended Class Action Complaint", "start_token": 532, "end_token": 732}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13982, "completion_tokens": 1769, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is not a basis but cause-of-action. So exclude. We also need to capture \"prompt judicial determination of probable cause\" but that's the right? The basis: \"Fourth Amendment\" and \"Fourteenth Amendment\" are the constitutional bases. Eighth Amendment also appears. Also maybe \"state law\" but not specified as a statute.\n\nWe need to extract these distinct values with evidence.\n\nWe have some matches:\n\n- Amended Class Action Complaint: Fourth Amendment (tokens 532-732). Also maybe Fourteenth (not in that snippet). But we can search for \"Fourteenth Amendment\" elsewhere.\n\nWe have many matches of \"Fourth Amendment\" and \"Fourteenth Amendment\" across documents. Also \"Eighth Amendment\" appears once in Memorandum and Order. So we need distinct values: \"Fourth Amendment\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\", \"Eighth Amendment\". Also maybe \"prompt judicial determination of probable cause\" is not a basis but a detail.\n\nThus we need to gather evidence for each. We should fetch at least one snippet for each. We can use search_document_regex to find matches in all documents, but we already have match results. We need to read the pages to capture evidence. We have partial coverage for some. For Fourth Amendment we have snippet from tokens 532-732. For Fourteenth Amendment, maybe tokens 9882-10082 or others. For Eighth Amendment, tokens 5254-5454.\n\nWe should read those ranges to capture the text.\n\nWe can read token ranges for each.\n\nFor Fourth Amendment: we already have snippet includes \"Fourth Amendment requires a prompt judicial determination of probable cause ...\". That's evidence.\n\nFor Fourteenth Amendment: we need snippet containing \"Fourteenth Amendment\". The match 9882-10082 contains: \"Count One: Defendant Violated Plaintiffs’ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights ...\". That includes Fourteenth. Also 9989-10189 maybe similar.\n\nFor Eighth Amendment: the snippet 5254-5454 contains: \"Assuming a violation of the plaintiffs’ Fourth and/or Eighth Amendment rights to a prompt detention hearing\". Good.\n\nThus we need to read these token ranges. Already have read one snippet for Fourth. For Fourteenth we haven't read; we can read tokens 9882-10082 from Amended Class Action Complaint. For Eighth we read tokens 5254-5454 from Memorandum and Order.\n\nWe should also confirm that the text indeed mentions amendment. For Fourth, need to capture \"Fourth Amendment\". For Fourteenth, \"Fourteenth Amendment\". For Eighth, \"Eighth Amendment\".\n\nThus next action: read_document for Amended Class Action Complaint tokens 9882-10082. Also maybe read_document for Memorandum and Order tokens 5254-5454. But we may need to read both. We can call read_document twice? Only one action per turn. We should decide which to do first. We can read the Fourteenth snippet first. Then use append_checklist. After that, maybe read Eighth snippet. Since we must do one action per turn, we can do read_document for Fourteenth.\n\nThus:\n\n- target doc: Amended Class Action Complaint\n- start_token 9882, end_token 10082.\n\nAfter reading, we will parse and identify Fourteenth Amendment. Then we will append.\n\nBut we also need to ensure we have all distinct values. Maybe need to also confirm Fourth Amendment is distinct; but we already have evidence. We might need to add Fourteenth and Eighth now. We'll add both after reading.\n\nBut we only have one action. Let's read Fourteenth. Then next turn we can read Eighth and then append all.\n\nThus next action: read_document.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Amended Class Action Complaint\",\"start_token\":9882,\"end_token\":10082}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Amended Class Action Complaint", "start_token": 9882, "end_token": 10082}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14247, "completion_tokens": 859, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The requirement is \"statutory or constitutional basis\" – include clauses. Could include \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" but that's cause of action, not basis. But the text says \"Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights\" etc. Also \"Eighth Amendment rights to a prompt detention hearing\". Also maybe \"Texas law\" but not a specific statute. Should capture each distinct basis: Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Eighth Amendment. Also maybe \"United States Constitution\" but that's general; we should capture specific provisions: Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Eighth Amendment.\n\nAlso could include \"Texas law\" but not specific. Probably only those three.\n\nWe need to confirm all occurrences. We have seen fourteenth and fourth in many places. Also Eighth amendment in Memorandum and Order. Might be also in other docs. We should search for \"Fourth Amendment\" pattern again across all to ensure no other distinct bases like \"First Amendment\". But given the case is about detention, likely only Fourth, Fourteenth, Eighth.\n\nWe should collect each unique basis: \"Fourth Amendment\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\", \"Eighth Amendment\". Provide evidence from various documents.\n\nWe need to read documents or search. Perhaps use search_document_regex across all docs to capture all occurrences. We already did many searches, but maybe need to check if \"First Amendment\" appears. Could search for \"First Amendment\" but not necessary.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex for pattern \"Fourth Amendment|Fourteenth Amendment|Eighth Amendment\" across all docs. Then read each match's snippet to capture evidence. Also need to ensure each basis captured once. We can gather multiple evidence for each.\n\nWe already have evidence from Amended Class Action Complaint: tokens 532-732 shows Fourth Amendment. Also tokens 9882-10082 shows Fourth and Fourteenth.\n\nMemorandum and Order: tokens 591-791 shows Fourth and Fourteenth.\n\nMemorandum and Order also has Eighth Amendment.\n\nAlso other docs may have Eighth; we saw only one match.\n\nThus we can append checklist with these three entries, each with evidence at least one snippet.\n\nWe need to ensure each entry's evidence list includes at least one snippet. We can include multiple evidence entries per value.\n\nWe should not set Not Applicable.\n\nSo next action: append_checklist for key \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\" with extracted entries: \"Fourth Amendment\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\", \"Eighth Amendment\".\n\nWe need evidence: we can use snippets from the docs. Provide source_document names and location (maybe page numbers or token ranges). Use the snippets we saw.\n\nLet's gather evidence:\n\n- Fourth Amendment: from Amended Class Action Complaint snippet tokens 532-732: \"… as the Fourth Amendment requires.\" Provide that snippet.\n\n- Fourth Amendment also from other docs but one is enough.\n\n- Fourteenth Amendment: from Amended Class Action Complaint tokens 9882-10082: \"Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights\" snippet.\n\n- Eighth Amendment: from Memorandum and Order tokens 5254-5454: snippet containing \"Eighth Amendment rights to a prompt detention hearing\".\n\nWe also can provide evidence from other docs but okay.\n\nThus output append_checklist with patch.\n\nEnsure JSON format.\n\nLet's create patch.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Fourth Amendment\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"… as the Fourth Amendment requires.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Amended Class Action Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 532-732\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Fourteenth Amendment\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Amended Class Action Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 9882-10082\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Eighth Amendment\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Eighth Amendment rights to a prompt detention hearing\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Memorandum and Order\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 5254-5454\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case", "extracted": [{"value": "Fourth Amendment", "evidence": [{"text": "… as the Fourth Amendment requires.", "source_document": "Amended Class Action Complaint", "location": "tokens 532-732"}]}, {"value": "Fourteenth Amendment", "evidence": [{"text": "Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights", "source_document": "Amended Class Action Complaint", "location": "tokens 9882-10082"}]}, {"value": "Eighth Amendment", "evidence": [{"text": "Eighth Amendment rights to a prompt detention hearing", "source_document": "Memorandum and Order", "location": "tokens 5254-5454"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11522, "completion_tokens": 956, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The earlier search for First Amendment found 0.

But 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is cause-of-action, not a basis. The instruction says not include cause-of-action vehicle itself. So we should not include 42 U.S.C. § 1983. But maybe there's \"Texas law\" or \"state law\" that is basis. The summary mentions Texas law. For example, \"Texas law seeking compensatory damages\". But is that a statutory basis? The question: \"statutory or constitutional basis\" includes statutory rights (e.g., ADA Title II, Rehab Act § 504). So we should include any state statutes that are alleged violated. The documents mention \"Texas law\" but not specific statutes. We need to search for \"Texas\" and \"law\" but maybe specific statutes like \"Tex.

But they said do not include cause-of-action vehicle itself (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983). So not 42 U.S.C. §1983. Also Texas law? maybe Texas statutes. Let's search for \"Texas\" with \"law\" might be many. But we need basis like \"Texas law\" itself is a basis but not a specific statute. But likely they want specific statutes. Maybe \"Texas law\" references: \"Texas law\" alone might be too generic. We might need to search for \"Texas\" and \"law\" but also specific statutes: \"Tex. Code\" etc. But the instruction: \"Prefer clause-level detail when available; if only the amendment or statute is named, list that.\" So if documents mention \"Texas law\" maybe not specific. But there might be \"Tex. Code\" or \"Tex. Gov't Code\" etc. Let's search for \"Tex. Code\" or \"Tex.\" but maybe too broad.\n\nGiven current extraction we have 3 values.

Possibly other orders mention \"Texas law\" but not specific.\n\nTo be sure, we can search for \"Texas law\" and \"Statute\" but if it's generic we might exclude. But the requirement: \"statutory or constitutional basis\" includes state statutes. But we have no example of specific statute other than 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (excluded). So likely only constitutional amendments.\n\nThus we can finalize. But we need to ensure we've appended all values. Already appended 3. Are there duplicates? The list currently has 3 distinct values.
