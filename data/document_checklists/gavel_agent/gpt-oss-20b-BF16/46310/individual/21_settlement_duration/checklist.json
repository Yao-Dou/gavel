In the next phase, a different jury \nwould resolve compensatory damages in \u201ctrials in waves of fives, scheduled according to a format \nbased upon factors, including location of the injured person or property at the time of the explosion \nand extent and nature of the damages. The district court anticipates that \u2018after several waves are \ntried, a reasonable judgment value for each category of claims would emerge so as to facilitate \nsettlements.\u201d Id. at 1018. \nThe Court need not expend considerable efforts outlining the differences in Watson and the \ncase at bar. Importantly though, the Court notes that there was only one main event leading to the \ndamages (the explosion) and only two defendants (against whom liability could be determined at \none time). This is, of course, a far cry from the case before the Court."
