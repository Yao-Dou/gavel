We have partial searches. Need to find trial info: scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, rulings. Likely in orders, motions, docket entries. We should search for \"trial\" but we already did search in all docs and got many matches. But we need to read more to capture details. Looking at the search results: many in protective order, complaint, motion to sever, docket, etc. But we need trial info. Look at docket entries: we saw \"NOTICE of Conference: Telephonic Case Management Conference set for 10/29/2024\" not trial. But maybe there are docket entries for trial. Also might be in orders or opinions referencing trial dates.\n\nWe should use search_document_regex for pattern \"trial\" but we already did. But we need to read the contexts. The matches provide context but not full content. We need to gather all distinct trial information. The matches show some mentions: e.g., in protective order, mention of trial in context about confidential. In complaint, mention of jury demand. In motion to sever, mention of \"separate trials\" and \"approximately 4,000 separate trials.\" Those are trial info (number of trials). Also there may be orders that set trial dates.\n\nWe should search again for \"trial\" but maybe we need other patterns like \"date of trial\" or \"trial date\" or \"trial will be conducted\" etc. But likely the search for \"trial\" captured many. We need to read the context of each match to extract trial details.\n\nThe matches are in various documents; we need to read each to extract distinct values.\n\nWe could do search_document_regex again but maybe we need to limit to document names. We have 13 docs. We can search each doc for \"trial\" with context 500 tokens to read. That might be many tokens overall, but we can iterate.\n\nBetter approach: Use search_document_regex again to find all matches in each doc. We already have list of matches for each doc. We could read each matched region to capture details. But we need to know which ones contain trial info.\n\nLet's examine the search results:\n\n- Agreed Protective Order: matches 5 but likely not trial info.\n\n- Class Action Complaint: matches 4. Some mention \"jury demand\", \"trial\" in context of \"at trial\". We need to capture trial info: e.g., \"jury demand\" maybe not trial scheduling but indicates jury trial.\n\n- Defendants' Motion to Sever: matches 4. Contains mention of \"separate trials\", \"approximately 4,000 separate trials.\" That's trial info.\n\n- Docket: matches 5. Contains dates but not trial. Might contain \"Trial\" somewhere? None shown.\n\n- Fifth Amended Complaint: matches 3. Contains \"jury demand\".\n\n- Order (001) etc. There might be trial info.\n\nBut we need to search for \"trial\" and \"jury\" and \"date\" etc.\n\nBetter to search for \"trial\" in all docs again, but we already did. We can read the matched regions to extract details.\n\nGiven we need to extract all distinct values of the Trials key. \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" So we need to capture:\n\n- Trial dates (if scheduled)\n\n- Jury trial demand (maybe count)\n\n- Number of trials requested (e.g., separate trials for each claim)\n\n- Any rulings about trial, e.g., orders setting trial dates, or orders denying class certification leading to trial.\n\n- Outcomes? Probably not yet occurred; maybe an order about trial.\n\nThus we need to read more of the documents to find trial info.\n\nWe could search for \"trial\" again but we might need to read more of the protective order and orders.\n\nAlternatively, search for \"Trial\" pattern with strict case maybe. But we already did.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex to find occurrences of \"Trial\" and maybe \"trial\" in the docket entries. For docket entries, maybe there is a docket entry with \"Trial\" like \"Trial\" or \"Trial date\" etc. But we didn't see those.\n\nOk, next step: read the matched regions for each doc.\n\nBut there are many matches: 31 total. That's a lot. We can read each match region. But we can create a plan: iterate through each doc, read the matched region tokens.\n\nWe can read each match region individually. But we need to pick one action per turn. We can batch read multiple matches? read_document can read a range but can't specify multiple ranges. So we might need to call read_document multiple times.\n\nBut we can do search_document_regex again but maybe we can request more context tokens to capture entire match. But we already have context. But we need to confirm. We can use read_document to read token ranges that contain the matches.\n\nWe have token ranges for each match. For each match, we can read the entire range to capture context.\n\nWe need to extract distinct trial information. Let's go through the matches:\n\n1. Agreed Protective Order: 5 matches. Likely no trial info. But might mention \"at trial\" or \"trial\" but not scheduling.\n\nBut let's read at least the first match: tokens 2399-2599. That snippet shows \"at trial, hearing, or deposition\". That's about confidentiality. Not a trial info.\n\nSecond match: tokens 2764-2964: includes \"at trial\" but again confidentiality.\n\nThird: 3242-3442: again confidentiality.\n\nFourth: 4799-4999: mentions \"trial or a hearing\". Not scheduling.\n\nFifth: 4834-5034: same.\n\nSo no trial scheduling.\n\n2. Class Action Complaint: 4 matches.\n\nMatch 1: tokens 70-270: snippet about plaintiffs, no trial.\n\nMatch 2: tokens 5526-5726: snippet about serious risk, no trial.\n\nMatch 3: tokens 7369-7569: snippet about award at trial. That indicates trial outcome: \"issue a judgment at trial\". Could be trial info: the judge will issue judgment at trial.\n\nMatch 4: tokens 7552-7752: details about jury demand. Contains \"Plaintiffs hereby demand a jury trial.\" That's trial info: jury trial demanded.\n\nThus we need to extract: \"jury trial demanded\" (maybe for this case). Also \"issue a judgment at trial\" - outcome.\n\n3. Defendants' Motion to Sever: 4 matches.\n\nMatch 1: tokens 16-216: includes \"separate trials\" mention \"separate trials\". Also \"separate civil actions or alternatively for separate trials.\" That indicates that defendants are requesting separate trials for each claim: \"separate trials\" and also \"separate civil actions\".\n\nAlso mentions \"separate trials for the Plaintiffs’ claims under Rule 42\". So trial info.\n\nMatch 2: tokens 209-409: includes quote about \"approximately 4,000 separate trials\". That's trial info: number of trials.\n\nMatch 3: tokens 334-534: includes same quote.\n\nMatch 4: tokens 641-841: includes \"separate trials for each of the 14 Plaintiffs.\" So trial info.\n\nAlso mentions \"Defendants request separate trials for each of the 14 Plaintiffs.\" So trial info.\n\nThus we need to capture: separate trial requests, number of separate trials, \"separate trials for 14 plaintiffs\".\n\n4. Docket: 5 matches. The snippet shows docket entries, not trial.\n\nBut we should check if any docket entry mentions \"Trial\". The matches we saw are docket entries but not trial. However, there might be a docket entry for \"Trial\" earlier not captured? The search returned 5 matches. They are docket entries but not trial. So no trial info.\n\n5. Fifth Amended Complaint: 3 matches. Likely similar to complaint: jury demand.\n\nMatch 1: tokens 4818-5018: snippet about ARP grievances, no trial.\n\nMatch 2: tokens 16895-17095: snippet about jury demand. Contains \"jury demand\".\n\nThus we need to capture jury demand.\n\n6. Order (001), Order (002), Order and Memorandum Opinion (001), (002), Order (003), Order Closing Case, Order Staying etc. Not yet visited except some partial. We need to search for trial in those orders.\n\nWe haven't searched those orders individually. The search_document_regex earlier may have not captured them because the search was limited to 13 documents but we didn't include orders? It did include Order (001), etc. But the matches list didn't show any matches from those orders. So maybe no trial info there.\n\nBut there may be extra matches not shown due to limited top_k? The search returned 31 matches. It listed matches from the first 5 docs only. The other docs had no matches.\n\nThus likely no trial info in orders beyond the ones we saw.\n\nThus we have distinct trial info:\n\n- Jury trial demanded (class action complaint, fifth amended complaint). Might be same info, but we should treat each instance as separate? The key \"Trials\" likely expects distinct value of trial info: maybe each trial request. But we need to provide distinct values. The jury demand is same across documents but maybe we need to list it once. But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the same value appears in multiple docs, that's not distinct. So we list unique values like \"Plaintiffs demand a jury trial\".\n\n- Separate trials requested: \"separate trials for each claim\" or \"separate trials for each of the 14 Plaintiffs\". Also \"approximately 4,000 separate trials.\" These are distinct values.\n\n- Judgment at trial: \"issue a judgment at trial\" - outcome.\n\n- Also \"jury demand\" from the fifth amended complaint may be same value.\n\nThus we have unique values: \"jury trial demanded\" (maybe include details). \"separate trials requested\" (for each claim). \"approximately 4,000 separate trials\" (number). \"issue a judgment at trial\" (outcome). Might also include \"separate trials for each of the 14 Plaintiffs.\" That is a variant of separate trials.\n\nThus we need to capture each distinct value: maybe combine them.\n\nBut we need to provide evidence for each.\n\nThus next step: read the relevant matched regions to capture evidence verbatim.\n\nWe need to read:\n\n- Class Action Complaint: match 4 (jury demand) - tokens 7552-7752. Also match 3 (issue a judgment at trial) - tokens 7369-7569.\n\n- Fifth Amended Complaint: match 2 (jury demand) - tokens 16895-17095. Might duplicate.\n\n- Defendants' Motion to Sever: match 1 (separate trials) - tokens 16-216. match 2 and 3 (approx 4,000 separate trials) - tokens 209-409 and 334-534. match 4 (separate trials for each of the 14 Plaintiffs) - tokens 641-841.\n\nThus we need to read these token ranges.\n\nWe can do read_document calls. We should read each in separate calls. But we can batch? No, read_document reads one document and token range. So we need multiple calls.\n\nHowever, we can choose one to read next. Let's start with the first relevant region: Class Action Complaint tokens 7552-7752.\n\nThus action: read_document for \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\" doc, start 7552, end 7752.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\",\"start_token\":7552,\"end_token\":7752}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial", "start_token": 7552, "end_token": 7752}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7819, "completion_tokens": 2441, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Need earlier part where \"Jury Demand\" appears. Already read shows trial demand. Might need to capture that as trial info. Also motion for separate trials: indicates request for separate trials; maybe no trial date yet. But we can extract that as trial request.\n\nAlso Order (001) indicates case before court; maybe trial date not yet set.\n\nWe might need to search for \"Trial\" occurrences again to capture any trial dates or orders.

We can read the tokens around the matches. We have tokens 209-409 etc. Let's read from 200-400. Also 641-841 maybe.\n\nAlso read from Docket for trial conferences: match 5 contains a \"NOTICE of Conference: Telephonic Case Management Conference set for 10/29/2024 at 10:00 AM before Magistrate Judge Jane M. Virden.\" That's a conference, not trial. But maybe later docket contains trial date. But we don't have it.\n\nAlso maybe the complaint contains a \"Jury Demand\" and a date. That is trial demand.\n\nThus we need to extract:\n\n- Jury demand for trial (in complaint): \"Plaintiffs hereby demand a jury trial.\" Could include date of filing.\n\n- Motion for separate trials: \"Defendants request separate trials for the Plaintiffs’ claims under Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" Also mention \"approximately 4,000 separate trials\".\n\n- Also may have orders setting trial dates? Not found.\n\n- Also docket entry \"NOTICE of Conference\" not trial.\n\nMaybe there is an order about trial date in other order not yet visited.

But we already did search across all docs. It returned 31 matches, many in protective order etc. But we didn't read those.\n\nWe might need to read the protective order to see if it sets trial date. Let's read a snippet of protective order around tokens 2399-2599 etc. But that may not have trial. But we can search for \"trial\" again maybe with context.\n\nBut we already have search results: 31 matches across 13 docs. We didn't read all matches. We could retrieve all matches via search_document_regex again, but we can read them. But we need to extract all \"trials\" info. That might include protective order references to trial dates. Let's search again for \"trial date\" or \"trial scheduled\" maybe.\n\nBut to be thorough, we should search for \"trial\" again and read the matches. However, we need to choose one action. The best is to search again for trial and read matches fully. But the search already returned matches but we didn't read them. We could use read_document to read some of those matches, but we need to know token ranges. The search result gave token ranges for matches: e.g., for Defendants' Motion 209-409 etc. So we can read those token ranges to capture evidence.\n\nAlso we need to read complaint's earlier part for trial demand. The search result didn't include that but we can read from 7369-7752 already. But we might also need earlier part for \"Jury Demand\" maybe earlier tokens. But we have that snippet.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims tokens 200-400 to capture trial info. And also read tokens 640-840 for other trial request. That covers the 4 matches.\n\nAlso maybe read from complaint tokens 7369-7752 already. That snippet includes jury demand.\n\nAlso read from Docket match 5 tokens 25721-25921 already. That includes conference.\n\nWe might need to read protective order matches if any. But maybe not needed.\n\nThus we will call read_document on Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims with start_token 200, end_token 400. Also maybe read 640-840. But we can only do one action per turn. We need to decide. We could read a range that includes both 200-400 and 640-840? That would be 640 tokens. That's fine. But we need to include all relevant trial info.

We have partially visited many documents. We need to find all trials: scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, rulings. The documents include a motion to sever claims into separate civil actions or alternatively for separate trials that likely contains proposed separate trials. Also the docket includes many entries that might be trial dates. Also the pleading might mention trial dates. Also the Agreed Protective Order may mention trial scheduling. The Order (001) mentions jury trial demand. Also the complaint demands jury trial. Also the motion to sever claims mentions approximately 4,000 separate trials. Need to identify actual scheduled trial dates? Might be in docket or orders. Let's search for \"trial\" again? Already many matches. But we need distinct values: e.g., \"jury trial\" demanded, \"separate trials\" request. Also docket entries like \"02/10/20\" etc. But maybe we need to capture each trial. The requirement: \"Trials: Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" So we need to extract each trial mention: e.g., \"jury trial\" demanded, \"separate trials\" request, \"trials\" scheduled in docket entries. We can capture each mention with evidence. We need to extract all distinct values.\n\nWe should search for specific trial dates in docket. Let's examine Docket matches: The first match shows docket entries with dates and event types. It includes \"03-12 | ORDER granting [3] Motion to Appear Pro Hac Vice.\" Not a trial. There's \"12 | 2020-03-23 | CLERK'S NOTICE of Past Due Answer...\" Not a trial. \"13 | 2020-04-03 | AMENDED COMPLAINT ... Jury Demand\". That's a filing. \"14 | 2020-04-03 | First MOTION to Appear Entry Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial by Andrew Alexander.\" Not trial. \"15 | 2020-04-07 | AMENDED COMPLAINT ... Jury Demand\". Also \"10/8/2024\" notice of conference, not trial. \"10/23/2024\" motion to sever claims. So docket entries not actual trial scheduling. However maybe other documents have trial date. Perhaps the complaint or order mention trial date. We need to search for \"trial\" again but maybe we need to read specific windows with trial dates.\n\nLet's search for a pattern like \"trial\" with preceding \"Trial:\". But maybe the docket includes \"Trial\" word but not schedule. The earlier search shows many \"trial\" matches. Some of those are in text like \"trial\" in context of \"trial\" but not schedule. We may need to extract distinct trial events: e.g., \"jury trial\" demanded by plaintiffs; \"separate trials\" requested by defendants; \"approx 4,000 separate trials\" referenced; \"court will hold...\".\n\nAlso there may be actual trial dates in the docket (like \"Trial: 06/20/2024\" etc). Not sure.\n\nLet's search for \"trial\" in the docket but maybe there are actual dates. We saw only docket entries until 2024-10-23. Might not have trial dates. But maybe later docket entries exist after 2024-10-23. But we only have up to 2024-10-23. Possibly no trial date scheduled yet.\n\nThus we may extract the trial information as these mentions. The key \"Trials\" may include multiple entries, each with type and description.\n\nWe need to produce append_checklist with extracted entries.\n\nLet's read the complaint again to capture \"jury trial\" demand. We already have the snippet.\n\nWe also need to capture \"separate trials\" request. Let's read the Motion to Sever Claims again to capture details. We have a match with \"separate trials\" in the text. Let's locate the specific snippet with \"separate trials\". The match 2 tokens 207-407 includes text: \"... Defendants request separate trials for the Plaintiffs’ claims under Rule 42...\". The snippet also includes mention of \"approximately 4,000 separate trials\". That is part of the request. Also the earlier snippet includes \"Defendants request separate trials for the Plaintiffs’ claims under Rule 42\". Also \"separate trials for each of the 14 Plaintiffs\".\n\nAlso there is mention of \"4,000 separate trials\" in the motion and in the order and memorandum opinion.\n\nThus we need to collect distinct values: maybe each separate trial request is one value? But we need to be careful: The key \"Trials\" might expect a list of trials with details. We can include each trial request as separate entries: e.g., \"jury trial demanded by plaintiffs\", \"separate trials requested by defendants\", \"approximately 4,000 separate trials requested by defendants\". But maybe we can combine them into one entry with details. But requirement says distinct values; separate entries for each unique value. So maybe each mention of a trial type is distinct.\n\nAlso there may be actual trial date in docket: maybe none.\n\nLet's search for pattern \"Trial\" with preceding \"Trial:\" but not.\n\nAlternatively search for \"Trial\" with \"date\" etc. But maybe not.\n\nGiven limited data, we can extract:\n\n- Jury trial demanded by Plaintiffs (in Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial).\n- Separate trials requested by Defendants (in Motion to Sever...).\n- Approx 4,000 separate trials referenced by Defendants (in Motion, Order and Memorandum Opinion).\n- Possibly \"trial\" scheduled in docket? None.\n\nAlso \"Trial\" may appear in Protective Order: maybe \"trial\" in context of \"at trial\" but not a specific trial.\n\nThus we can create extracted entries:\n\n1. \"Jury trial demanded by Plaintiffs in the Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\" with evidence snippet.\n\n2. \"Separate trials requested by Defendants in Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims into Separate Civil Actions or Alternatively for Separate Trials\" with evidence.\n\n3. \"Approx 4,000 separate trials requested by Defendants in Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims... and referenced in Order and Memorandum Opinion\" with evidence.\n\nWe can also include the \"jury trial\" request in Order (001) maybe same.\n\nBut need to avoid duplicates.\n\nThus we will use append_checklist with these entries.\n\nWe need evidence: text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe have evidence from the complaint snippet: tokens 7552-7752 show \"JURY DEMAND Plaintiffs hereby demand a jury trial.\" We'll use that.\n\nFor separate trials request: tokens 207-407: snippet includes \"Defendants request separate trials for the Plaintiffs’ claims under Rule 42 ...\". We'll use that.\n\nFor 4,000 separate trials: tokens 332-532: snippet includes \"approximately 4,000 separate trials,\" referencing. We'll use that.\n\nWe should include evidence for each.\n\nAlso maybe include the \"jury trial\" in the complaint earlier: but it's same snippet.\n\nWe need to ensure no duplicates.

Also check Docket for \"Trial\" matches: only 5 matches, but we saw \"Notice of Conference\" etc. There might be \"Trial\" in Order (001) or (002) but we didn't read those for trial info. Also \"Defendants' Motion to Sever...\": we have separate trials request. Maybe there is info about actual trial date scheduled? Search for \"trial\" again. But we might need to capture any trial scheduling, proceedings, outcomes. We have not captured outcome of motion to dismiss? That may not be a trial. We may have missed the \"Trial\" in Order (002) maybe includes a dismissal before trial. But the trial info we captured may be incomplete. We should search for \"trial\" in other documents: Order (001) maybe contains \"trial\" but we didn't read. But maybe not relevant. Also \"Defendants' Motion to Sever\" might include the mention \"separate trials\" but perhaps also \"trial\" in other context like \"trial court\" etc.\n\nWe have 3 values: Jury trial demanded, separate trials requested, approx 4000 separate trials. Are there any trial dates? Search Docket for \"Trial\" again. The Docket matches earlier didn't show a trial date. The Docket had \"NOTICE of Conference\" 10/29/2024, and \"MOTION to Sever Claims...\" 10/23/2024. Not a trial. So maybe no scheduled trial date yet. There might be trial scheduled for 12/2024 or something in other documents like Order (001) or (002). Let's search \"trial\" in Order (001). But the last search was only for \"Trial\" pattern all documents found 43 matches. We saw 2 matches in Order (001). Those matches were at tokens 95-295 and 376-576. Those didn't include trial info beyond maybe referencing \"jury trial\". Let's read those matches. But we already captured jury demand in Complaint. The Order (001) might mention \"trial\" in context of dismissal? That may not be a trial. So maybe no other trial info.\n\nAlso maybe there's \"Trial\" in \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" or \"Order Closing Case\" but those might not contain trial. But we can search again.

Already saw match 1 tokens 186-386 but didn't show trial. That seems to be procedural history. Might not have trial content.\n\nThus maybe the Trials key is complete with these 3 values. But we need to verify if any other distinct trial info appears: e.g., \"Trial\" might appear in \"Defendants' Motion to Sever\" earlier. We captured that. Also \"Trial\" might appear in Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) but we captured approximate 4,000 separate trials.

Also search for \"trial\" case-insensitive.\n\nAlso maybe the Order (002) might mention \"Trial\" in other parts beyond the 186-386 tokens. We only saw that snippet.

Need to confirm all Trials values. The current status says Keys with Values: 1/1, but 3 values extracted. Possibly more values exist. We need to ensure we captured all trials: scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, rulings.\n\nWe have seen from earlier searches in Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) mention \"separate trials\" maybe 4,000 separate trials. Also maybe trial dates in Docket etc. We need to examine documents for trial info: maybe trial dates scheduled. Search for \"trial\" in Docket (we saw matches but not full). The Docket probably contains trial dates.\n\nWe should read relevant token ranges in Docket that include trial dates. We saw token ranges 638-972 and 25719-26055. But maybe there are later entries. Let's search Docket for \"Trial\" again but maybe use regex \"Trial\" could catch many. Already found 6 matches. Maybe need to read those matches. We saw token ranges 638-972, 25719-26055. But maybe there are other matches beyond 26055. Let's search again with context longer. Use search_document_regex on Docket pattern \"Trial\" top_k maybe 20. But we already did; found 6. But maybe some matches earlier not captured due to token coverage. But we can read those 6 ranges to capture trial info. The matches included docket entries like \"Trial\" not actual trial date. Let's inspect those matches. We saw match 1: tokens 638-838 includes docket entries for orders, but not trial. Maybe some later in docket near 200-300? We can search for \"Trial\" with context tokens 200-400 maybe. But better to read entire Docket for trial dates. Docket is 26,445 tokens; we have only 3% coverage. Need to read more to find trial info.\n\nWe can search for \"Trial\" again but we already did. The matches might include trial dates. Let's examine match 1: tokens 638-838. The snippet shows docket entries with dates: 03-12 | ORDER granting [3] Motion to Appear Pro Hac Vice. There's no trial. Maybe there are later docket entries for trial with \"Trial\" keyword. Let's search for \"Trial\" again but maybe pattern \"Trial\" will match \"Trial\" in \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\". That is not a trial date but a request.\n\nMaybe trial dates are in \"Docket\" with \"Trial\" but we didn't see. Maybe Docket has \"Trial\" in docket entry like \"Trial\" with dates. We can search for \"Trial\" in Docket again but with more context. Also maybe \"Trial\" appears in \"Order (002)\" etc. But we might have all relevant trials: the motion to sever claims into separate civil actions or alternatively for separate trials (separate trials). Also Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) mentions 4,000 separate trials.\n\nWe might need to extract trial outcomes: e.g., dismissal, etc. But the checklist item \"Trials\" includes information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings. So we need details: scheduled trial dates, trial outcomes (e.g., trial scheduled, trial concluded, dismissal, etc.), rulings.\n\nThe current extraction only has 3 values: 1 from Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial, 2 from Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims into Separate Civil Actions or Alternatively for Separate Trials, 1 from Order and Memorandum Opinion (002). But the count says 3 values; but 1+2+1 = 4. Maybe one duplicates? Let's check: maybe the 2 from motion include same trial? Might be separate. But we need to confirm.\n\nWe should read the portions where these values came from. We need to read the specific token ranges where those trials were identified. We haven't recorded evidence for them yet. We need to append new entries with evidence. So we need to read those documents and extract.\n\nWhich documents contain the 3 values? Likely:\n\n- Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial: contains a trial request. The snippet earlier in step 15 shows the complaint includes \"Demand for Jury Trial\" but not actual trial date. But maybe later in complaint there's a trial date. We need to read relevant portion.\n\n- Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims into Separate Civil Actions or Alternatively for Separate Trials: might contain a trial schedule. We need to read the relevant token ranges where trial info is.\n\n- Order and Memorandum Opinion (002): contains mention of 4,000 separate trials and maybe trial date. We need to extract that.\n\nThus we need to read those documents. We have partial coverage of complaint: tokens 70-270, 5526-5726, 7369-7752. We didn't read the part with \"Demand for Jury Trial\". That may be within 70-270 or 5526-5726. Let's read 70-270 again to get evidence. Also maybe 5526-5726. But we need to check.\n\nAlso we need to read Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims where we have viewed 14-1279. That's almost all; but we should locate the trial info within. We need to read the token ranges with trial info. We saw earlier that search_document_regex matched 4 matches. We should read the ranges for those matches. We need to read the specific token ranges from that search result. We need to get match details; but we only have the results earlier. We didn't view the specific tokens. Let's do a search again with context 500 tokens around each match to get the text.\n\nWe can do search_document_regex on that document with pattern \"Trial\" top_k maybe 4. We already did step 4 and 5. That search found 4 matches. But we didn't read them fully. We can now read those matches by reading token ranges. We need to know the token ranges of each match. We can attempt to re-search with context 200 tokens. But we need to know the token positions. The search result earlier didn't provide token positions. But we can run search_document_regex again with context 200 tokens, top_k 4. That will give matches with token ranges.\n\nAlso we need to read Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) for the 4,000 separate trials mention. We can search in that doc for \"4,000\" or \"four thousand\" or \"separate trials\". We saw in earlier search the mention in match 4. We need to read that part. We can search again with pattern \"4,000\" or \"four thousand\". But easier: search for \"separate trials\" in that doc. We can then read the match.\n\nAlso we need to check if there are any other trials: e.g., trial date in docket. But if we only have 3 values, maybe that's all. But we must confirm no other trial info remains. We can search all documents for \"Trial\" again but we already did; but maybe some matches not captured due to token coverage. But the search returned 43 matches across all docs. We saw many in Order (001), Docket, etc. But many matches may be in complaint and motion. But we need to ensure we extracted all unique trial values. There might be a trial date in the docket; but maybe not, maybe it's for future trial. But we should examine docket for trial entries. Let's search for \"Trial\" again but maybe within docket we can find something like \"Trial\" with date. But we can read the entire docket? That is 26k tokens. But we only have 3% coverage. We need to read more.\n\nHowever, maybe the docket entries for trial scheduling are in the docket. We need to capture that as a trial value. So we must read docket to find any scheduled trial. Let's search docket for \"trial\" again and read matches. We did step 12: found 6 matches. But those matches might not include trial dates. Let's examine one: match 1 tokens 638-838, we saw docket entries but not trial. But there may be more matches beyond 26055. But search returned 6 matches; maybe only those. So maybe no trial date in docket.\n\nThus likely the only trials are the ones we have: the complaint's demand for jury trial, the motion's separate trials, and the order with 4,000 separate trials. So we are done? But we need to extract those as entries with evidence. We need to append them.\n\nThus next action: read relevant token ranges to get evidence for each.\n\nWe have partial coverage of complaint 70-270. That likely contains the demand for jury trial. Let's read 70-270 again. Also maybe 5526-5726 contains the demand. But we need to capture the text that includes \"Demand for Jury Trial\". Let's read 70-270 again.\n\nAlso for motion, we need to read the token ranges where trial info appears. We can search again for \"Trial\" in that motion. Let's do search_document_regex on that doc with pattern \"Trial\" top_k 4. Then read the ranges.\n\nAlso for Order and Memorandum Opinion (002), we need to read the match that contains \"separate trials\" mention. That was match 4 with tokens 13663-13865. Let's read that range.\n\nThus we need several read_document calls. But we can only do one action per turn. We need to choose one. We could batch read multiple ranges? The read_document only allows one doc and one range. So we need to pick one next action. Perhaps we should read the next needed piece: maybe the complaint's demand for jury trial. Let's read 70-270. That will give evidence. Then we will append those values. But we also need evidence for the other two. We can read them in subsequent turns. So next action: read_document on Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial (70-270).<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\",\"start_token\":70,\"end_token\":270}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial", "start_token": 70, "end_token": 270}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8465, "completion_tokens": 2114, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Not sure.\n\nWe need to identify all distinct trial info. Let's search for \"trial\" patterns maybe \"Trial\" with capital T. We had earlier search results.

We saw match 1: \"On May 4, 2020, the plaintiffs filed ...\". But not trial schedule.\n\nAlso \"Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims into Separate Civil Actions or Alternatively for Separate Trials\" likely contains trial info: maybe \"the court has scheduled separate trials for X\" or \"a trial will be held on date\".\n\nWe need to read that document fully? It is 1279 tokens, almost fully visited except maybe not all ranges? In catalog: Viewed tokens: 14-1279 (99% coverage). So almost read. But we haven't read the content of the document; we only saw search matches that didn't include trial info? We should read the document to extract trial info. We need to read entire tokens maybe 0-1279. Let's read from 0 to 1279. The document currently has 99% coverage but not the beginning? Actually viewed tokens 14-1279, so we missed 0-13. That is trivial. The document likely contains trial info somewhere else; we can read from 0-1279 to get context. Let's read.\n\nBut we also need to read Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) to capture trial info. It has 15,688 tokens, only 9% coverage. We should read relevant sections. We saw matches 13663-13865 etc. That includes \"bifurcated trial\" info. We should read that range.\n\nAlso maybe other documents like \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" might contain trial info, but not sure.\n\nWe can search for \"trial\" pattern again but we already did. But we need to extract all distinct values. The extracted values likely include:\n\n- The demand for jury trial in the complaint: \"Demand for Jury Trial\" part. That is a trial request.\n\n- The motion to sever claims into separate civil actions or alternatively for separate trials: may include statement \"a separate trial for each claim\" or \"the court should order separate trials\".\n\n- The Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) includes the plan for bifurcated trial: \"Phase I: bifurcated trial; Phase II: individual trials\".\n\n- Maybe also the Order (001) indicates \"the case is before the Court on the defendants' motion to dismiss\" but not trial.\n\n- Also the Docket may contain scheduled trial dates? The Docket shows many docket entries but likely not trial.\n\nThus we need to extract these distinct trial info entries. We should search again in the Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims into Separate Civil Actions or Alternatively for Separate Trials for trial info. Let's read the whole document.\n\nAlso maybe Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) might contain trial info but not sure.\n\nThus we need to read documents: Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims into Separate Civil Actions or Alternatively for Separate Trials (tokens 0-1279). Also Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) for trial info (maybe tokens 13663-13865 or 14199-14607 etc). Also maybe Order (001) includes trial info? We can read to see if any trial scheduling. Let's read.\n\nWe'll do read_document for Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims into Separate Civil Actions or Alternatively for Separate Trials, tokens 0-1279. Then read for Order and Memorandum Opinion (002), tokens 13663-13865 and 14199-14607 maybe exhaustive. But we can read 13600-14600 to cover both. That is 1000 tokens. Ok.\n\nWe also might need to read the Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial for the demand for jury trial. We already have tokens 70-270; maybe we need the part that states \"Demand for Jury Trial\" which we saw. We might need the full phrase. But we already have snippet with \"Demand for Jury Trial\". We may need extraction value: \"Demand for Jury Trial\". That is a trial request. We have evidence.\n\nWe also need to capture the trial schedule from Defendants' Motion?

We already have 3 values, but likely more. Which documents still partially visited: Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial, Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand, Docket, Agreed Protective Order, Order (001), Order (002), Order and Memorandum Opinion (001), Order and Memorandum Opinion (002). We likely need to find all trial-related info: scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, rulings. We have some from Order (001) about class action, maybe trial date? Also Docket likely has trial dates. Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) includes mention of 4,000 separate trials. Also maybe Order (002) includes trial scheduling. We should search for \"trial date\" or \"trial\" pattern in remaining docs.\n\nWe need to extract distinct values. Each entry includes evidence snippet, doc, location. We can use search_document_regex across remaining unvisited or partially visited docs for \"trial\" pattern. Could do search across all docs (pattern \"trial\") but many matches. We need to focus on specific types: trial dates, trial scheduling, trial outcomes, rulings. Maybe search for \"trial\" with context of date.\n\nWe can search for \"trial\" across remaining partially visited docs: Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial, Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand, Docket, Agreed Protective Order, Order (001), Order (002), Order and Memorandum Opinion (001), Order and Memorandum Opinion (002). Also Order (003), Order Closing Case, Order Staying Certain Proceedings, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (unvisited). But maybe those are irrelevant.\n\nWe already have 3 entries: from Class Action Complaint (jury demand), from Defendants' Motion to Sever (separate trials), from Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) (4,000 separate trials). Need more: maybe trial date scheduled in Docket: e.g., \"Trial scheduled for 10/29/2024\" or something.\n\nLet's search Docket for \"trial\" with regex. Use search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"trial\". We already did earlier step 18, but only 6 matches. We might need to read those tokens for dates. Let's read the Docket matches. We can do read_document for Docket from tokens around each match. Let's retrieve token 25719-26055 already read. That match contains a \"NOTICE of Conference: Telephonic Case Management Conference set for 10/29/2024 at 10:00 AM\". That's a conference, not trial. But maybe earlier matches had trial dates. Let's search again specifically for \"trial\" with context. But we might get many. Let's search for \"trial\" but also capture \"Trial\" as separate word. The earlier search had 6 matches; maybe we read them earlier partially? We saw matches 1-6 but only partially. Let's read Docket for each match separately. We can use search_document_regex again but specify context_tokens maybe 500. But we already saw matches. But we need to read specific tokens to extract trial dates.\n\nAlternatively, search for \"trial\" within Docket but with pattern \"Trial\" and maybe \"scheduled\". Might need to read tokens around each match. Let's just read the entire Docket? 26k tokens, too large. But we can read specific ranges: tokens 638-972 (we saw earlier matches). That contains docket entries with \"Trial\" maybe. Let's read 638-972 again, but we already saw that snippet. It included docket entries but not trial date. Let's read from 638 to 972 again. But we already read that; tokens 638-972 includes docket entries 03-12 etc. No trial date.\n\nMaybe trial date appears elsewhere. Search for \"Trial\" pattern again but with \"Date\" or \"scheduled\". Let's just search for \"Trial\" with context 200 tokens. But maybe easier to search for \"Trial\" in Docket via regex again. Let's call search_document_regex for Docket with pattern \"Trial\". Already did but maybe we can get more context with context_tokens=500. Let's do that. We'll get top matches.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"pattern\":\"\\\\bTrial\\\\b\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "\\bTrial\\b", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9670, "completion_tokens": 907, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Current status shows 3 values extracted but maybe missing others. From the prior steps: In step 14, appended 3 values. Those likely are: one from Class Action Complaint (jury trial demand), two from Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims (separate trials request). Also from Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) maybe one about separate trials or bifurcation.\n\nBut maybe there are more trial items in other documents: e.g., Order (001) maybe has a trial order? The search earlier found matches for \"trial\" in Order (001). Also Docket entries may have trial dates. Also Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) has many mentions of \"trial\" in context of separate trials, bifurcated trial. Also Agreed Protective Order may have trial info. Also Fifth Amended Complaint may have trial info. Also Order (003) etc.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values of Trials. Each entry should represent an event: e.g., \"Jury Trial\" demand, \"Separate Trial\" request, \"Trial date\" or \"Trial scheduled\" etc. The checklist definition: \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" So we need to capture each distinct trial info: date, parties, type (jury, separate, etc.), rulings, etc.\n\nWe must read more documents to gather all trial info. Which documents likely contain trial info beyond what we already extracted?\n\n- Order (001) and Order (002) may contain orders about trial dates. We didn't fully read Order (001) beyond 95-295, 376-576. There may be trial scheduling in later sections. We should read more.\n\n- Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) we read parts 2147-2385, 9814-10014, 13663-13865, 14199-14607, 14820-15239. Those contain many mentions of trial. We might need to capture distinct trial items: e.g., \"approximately 4,000 separate trials\", \"bifurcated trial: Phase I and Phase II\", \"individual trials\". Also maybe mention of \"trial date\".\n\n- Docket may have trial entries. We saw entries for \"Trial\" within docket entries like \"Trial\" as a docket event type. We need to extract each docket entry with \"Trial\": maybe trial date, type, etc.\n\n- Fifth Amended Complaint likely contains a jury trial demand and maybe trial scheduling.\n\n- Agreed Protective Order may have trial information about protective order, but may not be trial.\n\n- Order (003), Order Closing Case, Order Staying Certain Proceedings maybe mention trial.\n\n- Defendants' Motion to Dismiss not relevant.\n\nWe need to systematically search for \"trial\" in each doc. We can use search_document_regex on each document. But we should avoid redundant searches. We can search remaining partially visited documents. We have partially visited many documents. We should maybe search all documents for \"trial\" again to capture any new matches. But we already did earlier. But we may not have read all matches. Some matches may still exist in documents not fully visited. For example, Order (001) we only looked at 95-295, 376-576; maybe there are more matches later. So need to search again.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Order (001) for \"trial\". But we also may need to search on Order (002) again for more matches. And maybe Docket we saw matches but maybe there are more later. However, step 18 earlier captured 6 matches in Docket. Already read 638-972, 25719-26055. Maybe there are more matches beyond. But we saw 6 matches. Might be all.\n\nAlso need to search on Fifth Amended Complaint and Agreed Protective Order for additional matches. But we didn't search them for \"trial\" yet except earlier search covered all documents; but we did not read those matches. But we might need to read. So maybe better to search again for \"trial\" across all documents to capture any unvisited matches. But we might get many. But we can limit to documents not fully visited. That includes several partially visited docs.\n\nThus action: search_document_regex on the remaining partially visited documents: \"Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand\", \"Agreed Protective Order\", \"Order (001)\", \"Order (002)\", \"Order and Memorandum Opinion (001)\". Also maybe \"Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims\" already fully visited. \"Order (003)\" etc are unvisited.\n\nBut we might want to read Order (003) etc. But maybe they don't have trial.\n\nBetter to search \"trial\" across all documents, but might produce many matches. We can focus on documents with known trial info. Let's choose to search on Order (001) and Order (002) and Fifth Amended Complaint and Agreed Protective Order. That will give matches we haven't read.\n\nWe need to collect evidence and then append to checklist. We need to identify distinct values. For each match we need a unique trial entry. For example, in Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) there are many about \"approximately 4,000 separate trials\", \"bifurcated trial Phase I/II\", \"individual trials\". These might be separate entries. Also \"Trial\" docket entries are separate.\n\nWe might need to parse each match and produce distinct entries. We can do this with multiple append_checklist entries.\n\nBut we need to read the text of each match to extract evidence. The search_document_regex returns snippet with context; we can use that.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on relevant docs. We should specify doc_names array with 5 documents.

Also maybe \"separate trials\" request in Defendants' Motion. Also maybe \"jury demand\" in Fifth Amended Complaint. Also maybe \"trial\" mention in other docs. The snapshot indicates 3 values extracted: 1 from Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial, 2 from Defendants' Motion... and 1 from Order and Memorandum Opinion (002). That seems 4? Actually says 3 values: 1 from Complaint, 2 from Motion, 1 from Order (002) => 4? Might be miscount. But likely still incomplete.\n\nWe need to read more. Let's search for \"trial\" in other partially visited docs to capture other trial info. For example, Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) mention \"five-week bench trial\" – that's a trial. Also maybe Order (001) mention \"trial\" in context of procedural history. Also maybe Docket entries mention trials. Also maybe Agreed Protective Order mention trial. But likely we need to extract distinct items: e.g., \"jury trial demand\" from Complaint; \"separate trials requested\" from Motion; \"separate trials for each of 14 plaintiffs\" from Motion; \"five-week bench trial\" from Order (001). Also maybe \"trial\" mention in Order (002) etc.\n\nWe should search for \"five-week bench trial\" or \"bench trial\" in Order and Memorandum Opinion (001). Also search for \"jury trial\" in Complaint. Also search for \"separate trials\" in Motion (already extracted). Also search for \"trial\" in Order (001) maybe mentions \"trial\" as part of procedural history. Also search in Docket for \"Trial\" maybe mentions scheduled trial dates. Also Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) likely contains \"trial\" mention too. But we have extracted 1 from that already.\n\nWe need to identify all distinct trial info. Let's search across all documents for \"trial\" with context. But we can't read all. We need to decide next action. We should search for \"five-week bench trial\" in Order and Memorandum Opinion (001). Also search for \"trial\" in Order (001) maybe. Use search_document_regex on Order (001) with pattern \"trial\" maybe yields matches. But we already did earlier search in Order (001) gave 2 matches, but likely not include bench trial reference. Might need to search again with broader pattern. Let's search in Order (001) for \"bench trial\". Also search in Order (001) for \"trial\" maybe more.\n\nAlso search in Order (002) for \"trial\" maybe. But we have already extracted from Order (002). But maybe other trial info like \"trial\" in Order (002) like \"trial\" mention for \"trial\" schedule.\n\nAlso search in Docket for \"trial\" maybe show scheduled trial dates. Also search in Docket for \"trial\" occurrences.\n\nAlso search in Class Action Complaint for \"jury trial\" maybe we already have.\n\nAlso search in Fifth Amended Complaint for \"jury demand\" which indicates trial request.\n\nAlso search in Agreed Protective Order for \"trial\" - but that could be about trial hearing etc.\n\nWe need to compile all distinct trial information. Let's list potential items:\n\n1. Jury trial demanded in Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial. (Trial type: jury trial; source: Complaint; location: near top of complaint, maybe at beginning; evidence snippet: \"Jury Demand\" or \"Demand for Jury Trial\").\n\n2. Separate trials requested for each of 14 plaintiffs in Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims... (Trial type: separate trials; source: Motion; evidence: \"separate trials for each of the 14 Plaintiffs' claims\").\n\n3. Approximately 4,000 separate trials implied by Defendants' Motion (statistical estimate). (Trial type: separate trials; source: Motion; evidence: \"[212] at 26\").\n\n4. Five-week bench trial in Order and Memorandum Opinion (001). (Trial type: bench trial; source: Order and Memorandum Opinion (001); evidence: \"five-week bench trial\").\n\n5. Jury demand in Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand document. (Trial type: jury trial; source: Fifth Amended Complaint; evidence: \"JURY DEMAND\" etc.).\n\n6. Trial mention in Order (001) maybe referencing scheduled trial? Let's examine Order (001) snippet: It mentions \"On May 4, 2020 ... filed a (Second Amended) Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\". That itself is a trial request. But maybe we already captured that as step 1.\n\n7. Order (002) maybe mentions trial? Let's see snippet: not shown but likely mention \"trial\" maybe.\n\n8. Docket entries: might have scheduled trial dates. But might be beyond scope: \"trial\" in docket entries maybe not actual trial occurrence.\n\nWe need to capture all distinct values. Let's search for \"trial\" in Order (001) again. We'll search for \"trial\" across all documents but restrict to Order (001). Then we can capture any new trial info.\n\nAlso search for \"bench trial\" across all documents.\n\nAlso search for \"jury trial\" across all documents.\n\nAlso search for \"separate trials\" across all documents.\n\nWe also need to include evidence location.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"five-week bench trial\". But maybe easier to search \"bench trial\" globally. Let's do that.\n\nAlso search for \"jury demand\" but maybe already captured.\n\nWe also need to capture \"Trial\" in Order (001) for scheduling. But maybe not necessary.\n\nLet's perform a search for \"bench trial\" across all documents. Also search for \"trial\" in Order (001) again with context. But maybe the bench trial mention is only in Order and Memorandum Opinion (001). We'll capture that.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex on Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) for \"bench trial\". And also search_document_regex on Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) for \"trial\" to capture any other. But we can just search for \"trial\" globally. But we want to avoid duplicates. But we can search for \"trial\" globally and then filter manually.\n\nWe might search for \"trial\" across all documents but we already did earlier many matches. But we still need to capture new distinct items not yet extracted. Which ones haven't been extracted? We have extracted 3 values: one from Complaint (jury trial), two from Motion (separate trials, 4k estimate), one from Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) maybe \"trial\" mention. Actually we have 3 values: maybe they are: \"jury trial\" from Complaint, \"separate trials for each of 14 plaintiffs\" from Motion, and \"approximately 4,000 separate trials\" from Motion. And \"order and memorandum opinion (002)\" maybe not extracted? But they said 3 values, but listed 1 from Complaint, 2 from Motion, 1 from Order and Memorandum Opinion (002). That sums 4. Might be a mistake. Anyway.\n\nWe need to find any trial info not captured: probably \"five-week bench trial\" from Order and Memorandum Opinion (001). Also maybe \"trial\" in Order (001) schedule? But likely not.\n\nAlso maybe \"trial\" in Docket entries indicating trial dates. That might be considered trial info. But perhaps considered as trial scheduling.\n\nWe should search Docket for \"Trial\" again but we already saw many matches. But we didn't extract those. We might need to capture each docket entry that indicates a trial. But there may be many. The extraction requirement: \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" So docket entries that mention trial dates could be considered scheduling info. But we need to extract distinct values. That could be many, maybe too many. But we might need to list each docket entry that mentions a trial. But maybe the docket entries contain trial dates like \"Trial date\". But the snippet earlier didn't show specific trial dates. Let's check Docket snippet: It shows \"03-12\" etc. Not trial.\n\nThus perhaps only bench trial mention is needed.\n\nAlso maybe \"Trial\" appears in Order (002) describing \"trial\" or \"trial\" schedule. But we need to capture.\n\nThus next action: search for \"bench trial\" in Order and Memorandum Opinion (001). Also search for \"Trial\" in Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) maybe to capture any other. Let's perform search_document_regex on Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) for \"bench trial\".

That might be the \"jury trial\" demand. But that might not be a trial that occurred. The \"jury trial\" demand is a request, not a trial.

Actually reading earlier: In Class Action Complaint, we saw the \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\" but no trial event. But maybe the complaint includes a demand for jury trial; that might not be a trial. But the earlier appended 3 values likely include: 1 from Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial (maybe the request for jury trial), 2 from Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims into Separate Civil Actions or Alternatively for Separate Trials (one value for separate trials?), 1 from Order and Memorandum Opinion (002). That's 4? Wait the count: 3 values: 1 from Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial, 2 from Defendants' Motion, 1 from Order and Memorandum Opinion (002). That's 4 but they said 3 values. They might have counted 1 from Complaint, 2 from Motion, 1 from Order (002) -> 4. But maybe they double counted? Not sure.\n\nWe need to double-check: In Defendants' Motion, we saw \"separate trials for the Plaintiffs’ claims under Rule 42\". That is a request for separate trials; but actual trial? Not yet. The motion also references that a prior ruling said \"the only way to resolve ... is to hold approximately 4,000 separate trials\".

Let's search for \"trial\" again with search_document_regex on that doc.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\",\"pattern\":\"trial\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial", "pattern": "trial", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10800, "completion_tokens": 523, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Currently extracted 3 values: likely from class action complaint (jury demand) and motion to sever claims, and order and memorandum opinion (002). But likely more trials indicated: maybe the Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand mentions a \"five-week bench trial\". Also Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) mentions a bench trial. Also Docket has other trial-related entries? The Docket shows docket entries but maybe mention trial dates. We need to extract all distinct trial items. We have many matches. The prior append has 3 values; we need to find missing ones.\n\nWe should search for \"bench trial\" in Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand. Actually match 3 earlier shows bench trial. Let's read that section. We need to read tokens around 16895-17095 already read? Wait we read tokens 16895-17095 earlier. That match 2 includes bench trial. But we didn't append it. Also Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) has bench trial in match 1. That may have been appended? Might not. Also maybe Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) mentions \"separate trials\" estimate 4,000 separate trials? That might be considered trial info. Also Docket entries might include trial dates? The Docket token range 25719-26055 read maybe includes trial? Not sure.\n\nSimplify: We need to ensure all distinct trial info extracted. Let's list potential items:\n\n1. Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial: \"Jury Demand\" – trial type: jury trial. Might include date? Not mentioned. So entry: \"Jury trial demanded\" with source.\n\n2. Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims into Separate Civil Actions or Alternatively for Separate Trials: likely mentions separate trials. It may state \"separate trials\" and maybe a date. We have 2 values extracted from that.\n\n3. Order and Memorandum Opinion (002): has mention of \"separate trials\" estimate 4,000 separate trials. That might be a trial info.\n\n4. Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand: mentions \"five-week bench trial\". That is a trial.\n\n5. Order and Memorandum Opinion (001): mentions \"bench trial\" and \"five-week bench trial\". So maybe same as 4? It mentions bench trial. That is a trial.\n\n6. Docket maybe has trial date: but no explicit \"trial\" mention? The Docket entries show \"ORDER granting...\" etc. Might not.\n\nAlso Order (002) maybe indicates trial? Not sure.\n\nThus we need to ensure all distinct: we have 3 values extracted so far. Likely missing at least 2: Fifth Amended Complaint bench trial, Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) bench trial, Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) separate trials. Also maybe the Docket has trial date? Let's search for \"trial\" within Docket beyond those matches. We could search again. But to avoid too many actions, we can use a search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"bench trial|separate trials|trial date\". Or we can read specific sections.\n\nWe have read Docket tokens 638-972, 25719-26055, but those didn't mention bench? The Docket shows docket entries but not trial info.\n\nBetter to read Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand tokens around 16895-17095 (already read, but maybe not appended). Let's read tokens 16880-17080 to capture bench trial. Then append.\n\nAlso read Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) tokens 2097-2462 already read, but maybe not appended. We need to append bench trial info.\n\nAlso read Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) tokens 13665-13865 (already read) maybe contains separate trials estimate. We need to append that.\n\nThus we need to perform three append_checklist calls? We can batch them. We need to extract evidence snippets.\n\nLet's gather evidence:\n\nFrom Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand: In match 2 (tokens 16895-17095) snippet shows: \" ... hold approximately 4,000 separate trials.\" Wait that's Order and Memorandum Opinion (002). Wait careful.\n\nThe Fifth Amended Complaint match 2 snippet: \" ... and ... include ... 5 week bench trial.\" Actually reading earlier: In match 2 (tokens 16895-17095) we saw: \" ... at trial, including compensatory and punitive damages...\" Wait that's from the Complaint. That snippet didn't have bench trial. Actually bench trial mentioned in earlier snippet? Let's check earlier: In match 3 of Fifth Amended Complaint? The snippet at 16895-17095 maybe not bench. Let's search again. But earlier in Step 23, match 2 of Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand: tokens 16895-17095 shows: \" ... at trial, including compensatory and punitive damages ...\". That's not bench. But earlier in match 3 of Fifth Amended Complaint? Actually Step 23 had 3 matches for Fifth Amended Complaint. The first match 1 tokens 4818-5018: snippet about ARP forms. Second match 2 tokens 16895-17095: trial damages. Third match 3 tokens 17016-17216: jury demand. No bench trial. So bench trial might not be in Fifth Amended Complaint.\n\nThe bench trial appears in Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) match 1 tokens 2097-2462: snippet: \"ultimately culminated in a five-week bench trial, during which the district judge personally toured EMCF\". So that's a trial.\n\nAlso Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) match 4 tokens 13665-13865: snippet includes \"hold approximately 4,000 separate trials.\" That's trial count.\n\nAlso Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) match 5 tokens 14199-14399: maybe also separate trials.\n\nThus we need to append three entries: bench trial (five-week bench trial), separate trials estimate (approx 4,000 separate trials), and maybe separate trials? But separate trials appears twice. We need distinct values: maybe \"separate trials\" with estimate 4,000. Maybe also \"separate trials\" but no estimate? We can combine.\n\nAlso we have separate trials from Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims into Separate Civil Actions or Alternatively for Separate Trials – we already appended two values: likely \"separate civil actions\" and \"separate trials\".\n\nThus we need to append bench trial and separate trials estimate.\n\nAlso check if any other trial info: Docket maybe includes trial date? The Docket entries may include \"Trial\" but not sure. Maybe not.\n\nThus we need to read Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) tokens 2097-2462. Already read. But maybe we need to read more tokens for evidence. We can read 200 tokens around that. The snippet includes bench trial. We can read tokens 2050-2400 to capture context.\n\nAlso read Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) tokens 13665-13865. Already read. But we need to read tokens 13600-13900.\n\nThus we need two read_document calls. Then append.\n\nLet's do read_document for Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) tokens 2050-2410. Then for Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) tokens 13600-13900.\n\nWe'll combine into one read_document? We must choose one action per turn. We can do one read_document. Choose one. We'll read Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) first. Then later read Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) and append. But we need to avoid re-reading if already partially visited partially. It's partially visited but not that range. So read.\n\nThus action: read_document Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) tokens 2050-2410.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order and Memorandum Opinion (001)\",\"start_token\":2050,\"end_token\":2410}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order and Memorandum Opinion (001)", "start_token": 2050, "end_token": 2410}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10409, "completion_tokens": 1664, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The user wants to extract Trials. The prior steps have appended 3 values. Let's inspect current status: Keys with Values: 1/1 (so one key Trials, 3 values). Empty keys 0/1? Means one key? They say 0/1 empty keys. Not Applicable 0/1. Total values 3. So we have extracted 3 trial entries. But we might have missed some trial information in other documents. Review the current status: We have 13 documents, many partially visited. The Trials key probably requires all distinct trial information across all documents. We have extracted from Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial: presumably the jury demand for trial. And from Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims into Separate Civil Actions or Alternatively for Separate Trials: two trial entries. And from Order and Memorandum Opinion (002): one trial entry. But maybe there are more: For example, Order (001) mentions trial? Order (001) may mention \"trial\" but maybe not. The docket may have trial schedule. Also, Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) has bench trial info. That might be a trial. Also, there might be other trial information in other documents like Order (003) or Order Closing Case, but not sure.\n\nWe need to systematically extract all distinct trial info. Steps: we should search for \"trial\" pattern for all documents again to see if any unvisited documents contain trial info. We have not visited Order (003), Order Closing Case, Order Staying Certain Proceedings, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. Also, Order (002) we visited partially but maybe no more trial info beyond the one we extracted. Also, Order (001) we visited partially; maybe there is trial info? The excerpt shows \"Case: 4:20-cv-00021-SA-JMV Doc #: 75 Filed: 03/16/21 12 of 44 PageID #: 2462\" but not trial. The bench trial info is in Order and Memorandum Opinion (001). That we read partially and have extracted a bench trial (five-week bench trial). But we have not appended that to Trials? Wait it's currently listed as 3 values: 1 from Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial, 2 from Defendants' Motion to Sever Claims..., 1 from Order and Memorandum Opinion (002). That's 4 values? But they say 3 values. Let's check earlier: Step 14 appended 3 values for Trials. Which 3? Likely: 1 from Class Action Complaint (jury demand), 2 from Defendants' Motion (two separate trials?), maybe 1 from Order and Memorandum Opinion (002). So maybe Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) has trial info. That might be a separate trial. But we may have missed bench trial info from Order and Memorandum Opinion (001). Let's examine the read from Order and Memorandum Opinion (001). It includes: \"ultimately culminated in a five-week bench trial, during which the district judge personally toured EMCF.\" That is a trial. So we should extract that. Also, there might be trial info in Order (001) or Order (002). For example, Order (002) maybe has trial info? We haven't read fully.\n\nAdditionally, docket might have trial schedule. We have partially visited tokens 638-972, 25719-26055. That might include trial dates.\n\nAlso, Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand might mention trial but maybe already covered.\n\nWe also have not visited Order (003), Order Closing Case, Order Staying Certain Proceedings, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. The latter might mention trial if dismissed before trial.\n\nThus we need to search for \"trial\" across all documents again and identify any unvisited documents with trial info not yet extracted. However, we have already searched many times; but not for new documents maybe. But we didn't search Order (003) etc. So we should run search_document_regex on all documents for \"trial\" or maybe with pattern \"trial\" plus context.\n\nBetter: Search all documents for \"trial\" again to find matches in unvisited docs. Then read those matches and extract.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex on all documents for \"trial\" to see if any new matches. But we might get many matches; but we can focus on unvisited docs. We can search on Order (003), Order Closing Case, Order Staying Certain Proceedings, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. Also maybe other docs like Order (001) etc. But we have already partially visited some but not all. But we might get matches in those. But we need to extract distinct trial information.\n\nThus I will call search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"trial\". The search will retrieve top_k matches per doc with context. That will give us context to determine if new trial info. Let's do that.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"trial\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\",\"MULTILINE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "trial", "flags": ["IGNORECASE", "MULTILINE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9929, "completion_tokens": 1056, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We'll do search_document_regex for all documents with pattern \"trial\" but we already did earlier. But we can target specifically remaining unvisited docs.

We'll see.\n\nAlso \"Defendants' Motion to Sever\" we already extracted separate trials. But maybe also there is a trial date or scheduled trial. Let's search for \"trial\" in that doc? Already read entire doc. Let's search for \"trial\" pattern in that doc to see if any other info. But we likely captured all. But we should confirm.\n\nAlso Order and Memorandum Opinion (001) might have trial scheduling. We saw snippet 2050-2462, but maybe more. Let's search for \"trial\" in that doc. Also Order and Memorandum Opinion (002) we saw snippet 2147-2385, 9814-10014, etc. Might have more trial references. But we may have captured at least one.\n\nThe \"Trials\" key likely expects multiple items: each distinct value. We have at least 3: \"jury trial demanded\" from the complaint, \"separate trials for each of the 14 plaintiffs\" from motion to sever, \"approximately 4,000 separate trials\" from order and memorandum opinion (002). There might also be a trial date or trial scheduling in other documents: e.g., Order (001) might say \"the trial will be held on...\" etc. Let's search.\n\nWe'll perform search_document_regex on Order (001), Order (003), Order Closing Case, Order Staying, Docket, and maybe Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.
