We have 13 documents. We should search for cause of action expressions. Usually in complaint, the cause of action is in the introductory paragraph, e.g., \"Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's conduct constitutes a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\". We need to identify distinct causes of action such as \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\", \"FTC Act\", \"ADA Title II\", \"Bivens\", etc.\n\nWe need to search all documents for patterns that denote cause of action. Could use regex like \"§ \\d+\" or \"42 U.S.C.\" or \"Title II of the ADA\". But we might just search for \"§\" or \"U.S.C.\" or \"Title\" etc. But we need to capture the specific statutory references. The documents are legal filings, so the cause of action will be listed in the complaint. We should search all documents for \"§\" maybe \"42 U.S.C. §\" etc.\n\nBetter use search_document_regex with pattern that captures \"42 U.S.C. § \\d+\" or \"Title \\d+ of the Civil Rights Act\" etc. But to get all we might just search for patterns like \"§\" or \"U.S.C.\" or \"Title \\w+\"? But we need distinct values. Might be easier to search for \"§\" and then parse separate references. However the regex might return many matches across documents.\n\nWe can search across all documents for patterns like \"(42 U.S.C. § \\d+)|(Title \\d+ of the Civil Rights Act)|(FTC Act)|(Title II of the ADA)|(Bivens)|(42 U.S.C. § 1983)\". But maybe easier to just search for \"§\" and then manually parse. However we need to provide evidence for each value. Our next action is to search, then read.\n\nWe should perform search_document_regex for pattern capturing typical cause of action references. Pattern: (42\\sU\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*\\d+[a-z]*)|(?:Title\\s\\d+\\sof\\sthe\\sCivil\\sRights\\sAct)|(FTC\\sAct)|(Title\\sII\\sof\\sthe\\sADA)|(Bivens)|(42\\sU\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*\\d+)\n\nLet's build a pattern: `(42\\sU\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s*\\d+[a-z]*|Title\\s\\d+\\sof\\sthe\\sCivil\\sRights\\sAct|FTC\\sAct|Title\\sII\\sof\\sthe\\sADA|Bivens|42\\sU\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s*\\d+)`.

We have some regex matches already but we need full coverage. We saw matches for 42 U.S.C. § 1983, § 1985(3). Likely also 42 U.S.C. § 1988? But cause of action is the legal vehicle. We need all distinct values. The document likely contains multiple causes: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). Possibly others like 42 U.S.C. § 1997e? That's PLRA but not cause. Also maybe Title II of the ADA? Not seen. We should read more of complaints to capture all. We should read further parts of complaints.\n\nWe have partially visited complaints; we should read more tokens to capture other cause of action sections. Likely \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" repeated. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\"? But that is for fees, not cause. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e)\" which is a limitation but not cause. So probably just the two.\n\nBut we should confirm there is no other cause of action like \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" and maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" (both). Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears twice. Ensure unique. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" but the text shows § 1985(3). Good.\n\nWe should read more of the Fifth Amended Complaint to confirm.

We have partial views. Likely need to search for other patterns like \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" etc. We saw matches in search already. But we need to extract unique causes: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3), maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1988? Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1997e? But 1997e is a statute but not a cause? It's about PLRA. But cause of action is the legal vehicle used to bring the claims: the statutes themselves. So we need to identify each distinct cause: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1988? But that's for attorney fees. Not a cause. So likely just 1983 and 1985(3). Also maybe Title II of ADA? Not seen. So we need to confirm if any other cause appears anywhere else. Let's search for \"Title II\" or \"ADA\" or \"FTC\" or \"FTCA\".\n\nWe have search results only for 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 1985(3). But we might need to read more parts of documents to confirm if any other cause appears. The documents already partially visited show 1983 and 1985(3). Might also have \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" but that's not a cause. But maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is an attorney fee statute but still a cause? But \"cause of action\" refers to the legal vehicle used to bring the claims, such as statutes that create a right of action. 1988 is not a cause; it's a statute providing attorney fee. So not a cause.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1997e\" is a statutory limitation, not a cause. So we only need 1983 and 1985(3).\n\nWe need to extract each unique cause with evidence. We need to confirm the exact text references. We have partial matches, but we need to capture the exact text snippet that includes the cause. For example, in Class Action Complaint, we saw \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" again. In Fifth Amended Complaint, we saw \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\". So we need to provide evidence for each.\n\nWe need to gather evidence from documents. We can read the relevant sections. For 1983: we can read from Class Action Complaint tokens 2750-2950 which includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". That snippet is provided. Also matches 6556-6756 includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". We can use those. For 1985(3): we have from Fifth Amended Complaint tokens 15060-15283 includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1985: Conspiracy...\" We can use that snippet. Also from Order (002) matches 850-1050 includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\". So we can use that.\n\nWe should produce append_checklist with key \"Cause_of_Action\" and two extracted entries: value \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" with evidence referencing Class Action Complaint tokens 2750-2950 or 6556-6756. And value \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" with evidence from Fifth Amended Complaint tokens 15060-15283. Provide location as doc name and token range. The snippet text should be exactly as in doc. We can include the snippet text from the provided snippet. For 1983: snippet: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983. ...\". We can use snippet from match 1: \"18. Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege the allegations of the above paragraphs. 19. This action arises under the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\" So we can capture that.\n\nFor 1985(3): snippet: \"42 U.S.C. § 1985: Conspiracy to Deprive Plaintiffs of the Equal Protection of Laws\". But to be precise, it's \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\". We'll pick snippet: \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) provides that ...\". Use snippet from match 3: \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) provides that ...\".\n\nNow we need to ensure evidence includes veratim snippet. We'll provide the snippet. It may be truncated but okay.\n\nWe need to produce JSON for append_checklist.

Additionally 42 U.S.C. § 1988 appears as remedy but not cause. The cause of action is the legal vehicle. 1985(3) is a cause. 1983 is another. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1985 (the statute itself). But the pattern shows 42 U.S.C. § 1985: Conspiracy to Deprive Plaintiffs of the Equal Protection of Laws. That is same as 1985(3). So we have 2 unique causes.\n\nBut must check if any other cause of action appears in documents: maybe Title II of the ADA? In search results we had Title II of the ADA? The search pattern included Title II of the ADA. Did any document include Title II? I didn't see in the captured matches. But there may be elsewhere. We might need to read more to find other cause of action. The pattern included \"Title II of the ADA\". Might appear in other documents. Let's search again for \"Title II of the ADA\" in all documents. Also \"FTC Act\" maybe. Let's run search_document_regex for these patterns. We may need to search for \"FTC Act\" and \"Title II of the ADA\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" maybe.\n\nWe need to ensure we have all distinct causes. The search earlier used pattern limited to certain items: Title II of the ADA|FTC Act|42 U.S.C. § \\d+[a-z]*|42 U.S.C. § \\d+. That included 1988? pattern \\d+ matches 1988. But we didn't capture that maybe because it's not in the matches. But we need to check.\n\nThe search results earlier had 22 matches. We saw 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). Did any match show 1988? The match 4 (Class Action Complaint) had \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" in the context: \"pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988\". That is a statute but is it a cause of action? The text indicates \"pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988\" as remedy. But cause of action is usually the claim. That sentence might be \"pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988\" but maybe it's a remedy, not cause. The snippet: \"pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and other applicable law;\". That indicates 1988 is used for attorneys' fees, not cause. So we likely exclude 1988. Similarly 42 U.S.C. § 1997e is a limitation, not cause. So we keep only 1983, 1985(3). Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1985? But that's same as 1985(3). The statute 1985(3) is the specific cause. 1985(1) and (2) are not used. So we have 2.\n\nBut check if any other cause of action appears: maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" (general). But it's not in the matches. So likely only 2.\n\nBut we must ensure we didn't miss something like \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\". We already captured that.\n\nThus all checklist items are filled. We have 1 key, with 2 values. No need to set Not Applicable. So we can stop.\n\nBut we need to double-check if any other cause appears in other documents not yet read. The search covered all documents. The matches list includes 22 matches; we saw 1983 and 1985(3). But maybe also Title II of the ADA appears in Order (003) or other documents. But we didn't see it in matches. But we could search again for \"Title II of the ADA\" specifically. But if no matches, then no cause. But we should confirm.\n\nLet's do a targeted search for \"Title II of the ADA\" across all documents. Also \"FTC Act\". Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" maybe also cause? But we think it's remedy. But let's search.\n\nWe should also search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" maybe. But we saw 1985(3) only.\n\nLet's perform search_document_regex for pattern \"Title\\sII\\sof\\sthe\\sCivil\\sRights\\sAct\" again? Wait Title II of the Civil Rights Act? Actually Title II of the ADA is \"Title II of the ADA\". But we may need to search for \"Title II of the ADA\" or \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\". Let's search \"Title II of the ADA\" and \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" and \"FTC Act\".\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" as a possible cause. But let's search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" (without (3)). We'll run search.\n\nWe need to decide next action: a search_document_regex for these patterns.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern for these three.

Not a cause. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e is PLRA. Not cause. 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) is indeed cause. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is cause. Also maybe Title II of the ADA? Not present. FTC Act? Not present. Title II of Civil Rights Act? Not present. So only those two? Also maybe Title II of the ADA but not in docs.\n\nBut could there be Title II of Civil Rights Act? Search: but earlier search didn't show. But maybe present in other documents not yet read. We should search all documents for \"Title II\" etc to ensure none missed.

Also 42 U.S.C. § 1985 is also a cause? The text used 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) but also 42 U.S.C. § 1985 (general). The cause is specifically 42 U.S.C. § 1985 (conspiracy). 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) is a subsection of 1985. But the cause is 42 U.S.C. § 1985 as a statute. But the text explicitly says \"42 U.S.C. § 1985: Conspiracy to Deprive Plaintiffs...\" So the cause is 42 U.S.C. § 1985. The cause of action is the statute itself not the subsection. But earlier we extracted 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). Maybe we should extract 42 U.S.C. § 1985 as cause. Let's check text: In Fifth Amended Complaint matches: \"42 U.S.C. § 1985: Conspiracy to Deprive Plaintiffs of the Equal Protection of Laws\" also \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) provides that...\" So cause of action maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1985. The earlier extraction used 1985(3). Might need to include both? But we can extract the main statute: 42 U.S.C. § 1985. Let's search for any other cause: e.g., \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" maybe not present. \"FTC Act\" maybe not. \"Title II of the ADA\" maybe not. \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" is procedural. So we have 3: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1985, and maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) is sub. But we should treat as same cause? The instructions: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) ... Deduplicate repeats so that each cause of action appears only once.\" So if the cause is 42 U.S.C. § 1985, we include that. 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) is a subsection but it's part of the same cause. Should we list both? Likely just the main statute. But if the complaint specifies 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) as the cause, that is the cause. But the higher-level is 42 U.S.C. § 1985. The instruction ambiguous. I'd include both maybe? But deduplicate: if we list 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) and 42 U.S.C. § 1985, they are not identical, but cause of action is the statute. Might list 42 U.S.C. § 1985. Let's check if any other cause: \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" appears but also \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" appears. There's also \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" but that's for filing. Not cause. \"42 U.S.C. § 1997e\" is PLRA. Not cause. \"FTC Act\" no. \"Title II of the ADA\" no. So two distinct causes: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985.\n\nThus we need to update checklist to include 42 U.S.C. § 1985 (maybe plus 1985(3) but dedupe). Ensure evidence for each.\n\nWe already have evidence for 1983. Need evidence for 1985. We have evidence from Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand: match 3 tokens 15060-15260: shows \"42 U.S.C. § 1985: Conspiracy to Deprive Plaintiffs...\" and also 1985(3). Use that.\n\nAlso see other documents maybe mention 1985 again. We can use that one.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist for Cause_of_Action with extracted values: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each.\n\nWe have evidence for 1983 from Class Action Complaint. Provide text snippet, document name, location. Use tokens 2750-2950 (given). Provide location maybe \"tokens 2750-2950\". Provide source_document \"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\".\n\nFor 1985, use evidence from Fifth Amended Complaint. Provide snippet \"42 U.S.C. § 1985: Conspiracy to Deprive Plaintiffs of the Equal Protection of Laws\" tokens 15060-15260. Provide source_document \"Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand\".\n\nThus action: update_checklist.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Cause_of_Action\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"19.

The instruction says cause of action: statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA). 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is a remedy (injunction).

Also Title II Civil Rights Act? \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" maybe appears. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" is part of 42 U.S.C. § 1985. \"42 U.S.C. § 1997e\" is a cause? but it's a limitation, not cause. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" is about civil rights claims. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is cause.\n\nWe need to find all distinct cause of action mentioned in any document. We have searched for patterns but not found Title II Civil Rights Act. Let's search again with pattern for \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" or \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" or \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" or \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" or \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" or \"Civil Rights Act Title II\". Also \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" might be used. Also \"FTCA\" pattern maybe appears. Let's search all documents for \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" and \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\". Also \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" maybe \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" appears.\n\nAlso search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" maybe appears in Order 001. Indeed we saw 42 U.S.C. § 1988 in Class Action Complaint. That is a cause of action? Yes, 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is a cause (civil rights). So we need to capture it.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1997e\" appears but it's about limitations; maybe not cause.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" is cause; we have.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" is same.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" we have.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" we need.\n\nAlso \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" maybe appears. Let's search.\n\nAlso \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" might be \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" or \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" or \"Civil Rights Act Title II\" etc. But we saw earlier pattern search for Title II of the Civil Rights Act didn't match.\n\nMaybe the documents mention \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" but not found because we didn't search for the exact phrase? We searched for \"Title\\sII\\sof\\sthe\\sCivil\\sRights\\sAct\". That's correct. But maybe it appears as \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" but with different spacing or formatting. Let's search again for \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" with maybe no escape. Also search for \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" plain text.\n\nAlso search for \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" in all docs. Let's do search regex in all docs for \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\". We'll use pattern \"Title\\sII\\sof\\sthe\\sCivil\\sRights\\sAct\" again maybe same. But earlier search returned 0 matches. But maybe the phrase appears in different capitalization or with \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" but with \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" is same. Might be missing due to formatting.\n\nAlternatively, there may be only 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1985, 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears only in Class Action Complaint. Let's confirm via search. Also search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" pattern. Use regex.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears in Order (001). But we saw it earlier.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1997e\" appears but not cause.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" appears but same.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" appears.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears.\n\nThus we have 3 distinct causes.\n\nBut maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" also appears in other documents. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in many.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" appears.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" appears.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" appears. So we need distinct values: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\", \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\".\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" also appears as \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" (with space). So include.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" appears separately but same as 42 U.S.C. § 1985.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears as \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" (with no slash). We'll treat as same.\n\nThus we need to append these 3 values. We already have two. Need to add third. Also ensure no duplicates.\n\nWe should verify that 42 U.S.C. § 1988 appears in Class Action Complaint. Let's search again for that phrase. Use search_document_regex.

Also 42 U.S.C. § 1997e is a procedural rule, not cause. We might also have Title II of the ADA or Title II of the Civil Rights Act, but might not appear. In search we only found those two. Also maybe FTC Act? Search earlier didn't find. So maybe only 1983 and 1985.\n\nBut we should check if there are any other causes in other documents not yet visited: e.g., Docket, protective order, etc. But likely not.\n\nWe could search for pattern \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s1[89]\"?

So no other causes.\n\nBut maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears earlier as remedy but not cause; we must not include. The spec says cause of action is legal vehicle used to bring claims, not remedy. 1988 is remedy (attorney fees). So ignore.\n\nAlso 42 U.S.C. § 1997e is procedural rule. So ignore.\n\nThus we have two distinct causes.\n\nBut we should verify that in the Fifth Amended Complaint, 42 U.S.C. § 1985 is indeed a cause. Yes, it is a cause. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) is part of it. But the cause is 42 U.S.C. § 1985. So we have distinct values: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\".\n\nWe need to ensure no duplicates. Already extracted.\n\nBut we might need to confirm that there isn't a \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" as distinct. But \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" is the general cause; the subparagraph is part of it. The spec likely expects the general section. So fine.\n\nWe need to ensure not to add duplicates.\n\nWe have extracted values from two documents. Next step: maybe we should check if there are other causes in other documents like \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" etc. But likely not.\n\nBut to be safe, we can search for \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s1[89]\" across all docs again. But we already saw 1988. But we don't want to include 1988. But we can search for \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s1[89]\" but filter. But easier: search for \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s1[89]\" maybe. But we already saw 1988. But we don't want to include 1988. So we can just search for other section numbers like \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s1[89][0-9]\"? But 1985 is covered. 1983 is covered. There's also 1985 maybe with (3). But we already have 1985.\n\nAlso \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" maybe in some other doc like \"Order (002)\" but we saw search didn't find. So maybe none.\n\nThus we can stop. But we must ensure that we have all extracted values. We might need to check if any other causes appear in unvisited documents. Let's search again across all docs for \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s1[89]\" but maybe we want to exclude 1988. But we can search for \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s19[89]\"? That's 1989? Not relevant.\n\nLet's search for \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s1[89]\"? Actually 1983, 1985, 1988. Maybe 1997e is 1997. But we don't need.\n\nBut maybe there is \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears many times. But we already captured.\n\nBut we might also have \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" which is cause, but we captured 1985.\n\nAlso could be \"Title II of the ADA\" but search found none.\n\nThus we can stop. But before stopping, we must check that the checklist has only one key? The user said checklist items: \"Cause_of_Action\". So only that key. We have values.\n\nThus we can stop. But we need to ensure we didn't miss any. Let's maybe search for \"FTC\\sAct\" across all docs again to be sure. But previous search found none. But we can quickly run search_document_regex for pattern \"FTC\\sAct\" across all docs. That might reveal if there's any. But we saw earlier that search returned 0 matches.

The question: Are there other cause of action values found? In step 9 we found 42 U.S.C. § 1988. That is also a cause of action. The earlier search pattern included 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Step 9 shows that Class Action Complaint includes 42 U.S.C. § 1988. But the earlier extraction didn't include that. The step 10 stop was premature. We need to extract 42 U.S.C. § 1988 as well. Also check for any other cause of action like Title II of the ADA? The earlier searches didn't find matches. But perhaps there are other cause of actions in other documents not yet visited. We haven't visited Docket, Agreed Protective Order, etc. But likely cause of actions are in Complaint documents. We have 42 U.S.C. § 1988 found. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1985 (conspiracy) is there. We already have 1983 and 1985. Step 5 and 6 didn't find others. So we need to add 42 U.S.C. § 1988. But also check for Title II of the ADA or FTC. Step 7-9 didn't find. But we should search again to be sure. But step 8 didn't find any matches for Title II of CA or ADA or FTC. Step 9 found 1988. So we need to add 1988.\n\nAlso check if any other cause of action like Title II of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 1988?) Actually Title II of the Civil Rights Act is 42 U.S.C. § 1988? Wait Title II of the Civil Rights Act is the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title II prohibits discrimination in public accommodations. That's 42 U.S.C. § 1988? No, Title II is 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Yes. So we should add 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1985? Already added. 42 U.S.C. § 1983? Added. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1985? Already. So need 1988.\n\nAlso check if any other cause of action like \"Title II of the ADA\" not found. Possibly \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" could be present but not found. But we should search again. But step 8 had a search for Title II of the Civil Rights Act but found 0. So likely no mention.\n\nAlso check if any 42 U.S.C. § 1985? Already have. 42 U.S.C. § 1988 found. Also 42 U.S.C. § 1985? Yes.\n\nAlso check for \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" maybe also \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" appears. Already added. No other.\n\nThus we need to update checklist: add 42 U.S.C. § 1988. This is a distinct value. We must also make sure each entry has evidence. We have evidence snippet from Step 9: the class action complaint snippet contains \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\". We should read that snippet from the document to include evidence. Step 9 provides snippet but not full context. We can read the region 7445-7645 from Class Action Complaint. Let's read that to capture the text.\n\nWe need to call read_document on the Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial from token 7445-7645. That snippet shows \"pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988\". We need to capture that text. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\",\"start_token\":7445,\"end_token\":7645}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial", "start_token": 7445, "end_token": 7645}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4434, "completion_tokens": 857, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

So far we have extracted 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985? Actually earlier steps: step 3 appended 2 values. Step 7 updated 2 values. Step 10 says: All distinct Cause_of_Action values (42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985) have been extracted. But reading the excerpt from Class Action Complaint shows 42 U.S.C. § 1988, not 1983 or 1985. Wait: earlier indexing may have extracted 1983 and 1985 from other documents. But we need to ensure that all distinct values are captured. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we must find all distinct causes of action across all 13 documents. We have extracted 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985. But we see 42 U.S.C. § 1988 in the excerpt. That is a cause of action too. Actually 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is about \"civil action for civil rights violations\" and is a cause of action. So we missed that. So we need to extract that too. Also maybe other statutes like Title II of the Civil Rights Act, FTC Act, Title II of the ADA, etc. We need to search all documents for those patterns. The prior search step 8 had no matches for Title II Civil Rights Act/ADA/FTC. But step 9 found 42 U.S.C. § 1988 in Class Action Complaint. But maybe other documents contain other causes of action like 42 U.S.C. § 1985, 1983, etc. But we already have 1985 and 1983. Let's confirm which ones we have extracted: from earlier steps, we have appended two values: presumably 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985. But we need to check if there are any others like 42 U.S.C. § 1988 or Title II of the Civil Rights Act or Title II of ADA. The search step 8 found 0 matches for Title II Civil Rights Act/ADA/FTC across 13 docs after some search. But we found 1988 in Class Action Complaint. So some search might have missed that if pattern didn't match. We might need to search for \"§\\s*1988\" or \"42\\sU\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s1988\". Already step 9 did that. So we need to extract 1988. Also might be \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" or \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. But we have those. Are there any other causes? Maybe \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" might appear in some documents but earlier search step 8 didn't find. But maybe other documents like Order (002) had some. Actually step 6 search pattern included \"Title\\sII\\sof\\sthe\\sCivil\\sRights\\sAct|FTC\\sAct|Title\\sII\\sof\\sthe\\sADA|42\\sU\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s1988|42\\sU\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s1997e|42\\sU\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s1985\" and found 12 matches: 1 in Class Action Complaint, 2 in Fifth Amended Complaint, 4 in Order (002), +2 more docs. So there are matches for Title II Civil Rights Act, FTC Act, Title II ADA, 1988, 1997e, 1985. But step 6 only found 12 matches. Step 7 updated to 2 values. So maybe the extraction missed some. We need to ensure we capture all distinct values. Let's gather all distinct causes of action from the entire set of documents.\n\nWe need to search for patterns: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, § 1985, § 1988, § 1997e, Title II of the Civil Rights Act, Title II of ADA, FTC Act, Bivens maybe. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1985? Already included. But also maybe other statutes like 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Also 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and 1997e. Also 42 U.S.C. § 1988 appears. Let's search all documents for these patterns.\n\nWe need to issue a search_document_regex on all docs with pattern that matches all potential causes. Let's create a pattern that covers: 42 U.S.C. § \\d+e? or Title\\sII\\sof\\sthe\\sCivil\\sRights\\sAct|Title\\sII\\sof\\sthe\\sADA|FTC\\sAct|Bivens. That might capture them. Let's use pattern: \"(42\\sU\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s\\d+[a-z]*|Title\\sII\\sof\\sthe\\sCivil\\sRights\\sAct|Title\\sII\\sof\\sthe\\sADA|FTC\\sAct|Bivens)\". That's similar to earlier but we need to capture 1985, 1988, 1997e. The earlier pattern had \\d+[a-z]* which covers 1985, 1988, 1997e? 1997e has e suffix. Yes. So we can use that.\n\nWe need to search all documents. Let's call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" and pattern above, flags maybe IGNORECASE. We want top_k maybe 5. context_tokens maybe 200.\n\nThen we need to read the results and append them. But we must ensure to dedupe.\n\nWe have already extracted 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985. Let's check if those were captured earlier. Yes. But we also need to capture 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and possibly Title II Civil Rights Act, Title II ADA, FTC Act, and Bivens.\n\nHowever, step 6 found 12 matches but only 2 values appended. That suggests we missed many. So we need to capture all. So let's perform a search across all docs again.\n\nWe'll use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern above.\n\nThen we need to parse the returned matches. We need to examine the matches to extract the distinct values. We need to include evidence for each.\n\nWe should avoid duplicates: if we already have 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 1985, we need to not add them again. But we may not know if they are already in the list. But we can read the current extracted list via get_checklist. But we only have to perform one action per turn. We can choose to do search_document_regex. Then next turn we will read the matches (actually the search returns matches with context). We can then append the new ones. But we might need to read more to get the context. But search_document_regex returns context. That may be enough.\n\nOk. So the next action: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern capturing all possible cause of action. Let's do that.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(42\\\\sU\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\.\\\\s§\\\\s\\\\d+[a-z]*|Title\\\\sII\\\\sof\\\\sthe\\\\sCivil\\\\sRights\\\\sAct|Title\\\\sII\\\\sof\\\\sthe\\\\sADA|FTC\\\\sAct|Bivens)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(42\\sU\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s\\d+[a-z]*|Title\\sII\\sof\\sthe\\sCivil\\sRights\\sAct|Title\\sII\\sof\\sthe\\sADA|FTC\\sAct|Bivens)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4450, "completion_tokens": 1643, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Current status: They have extracted 2 values: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985? Actually earlier they extracted 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985? Step 10 says all distinct Cause_of_Action values (42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985) extracted. But earlier they had extracted 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985? Let's check: In step 4 they appended 2 values: from Fifth Amended Complaint: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985? Actually reading step 3 result: \"Read 200 tokens\" but not shown. Step 4 appended 2 values. Step 7 updated 2 values. So we have 2 values: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985? Wait, Step 10 shows 42 U.S.C. § 1988 also. But step 10 says \"All distinct Cause_of_Action values (42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985) have been extracted with evidence from the documents.\" But the snippet in step 9 shows 42 U.S.C. § 1988. That is a different cause of action. So maybe they need to also extract 42 U.S.C. § 1988. But step 10 says all distinct values extracted: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985. But step 12 shows 42 U.S.C. § 1988. So maybe they miss that 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is also a cause of action. The extraction of 42 U.S.C. § 1988 may not have been appended. So we need to confirm if 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is a cause of action. Yes, 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is a statute that provides that a civil action may be brought against a state for violations of civil rights; it is indeed a cause of action. So we need to include that. Also there might be 42 U.S.C. § 1988 in other documents. Also 42 U.S.C. § 1985? 42 U.S.C. § 1985 is a cause of action for conspiracy to deprive equal protection. So we have 3 distinct causes of action: §1983, §1985, §1988. The current extracted list only has 2 values. So we need to extract the missing 1988.\n\nThus we need to read the text where 42 U.S.C. § 1988 appears. There's a snippet in step 9 already: in Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial, tokens 7445-7645 includes 42 U.S.C. § 1988. But maybe we didn't append that. So we need to append 42 U.S.C. § 1988 with evidence. That snippet is already in our view. We should confirm the evidence details: tokens 7445-7645 from Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial. Provide snippet: \"d. Award Plaintiffs the costs of this suit, and reasonable attorneys' fees and litigation expenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and other applicable law;\". So we can append this value.\n\nAlso confirm if there are any other causes of action not yet extracted: maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1985 is extracted. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is extracted. 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is missing. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) is same as §1985; but we treat as cause of action 42 U.S.C. § 1985. Also 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is a cause of action.\n\nThus we need to append the missing cause of action.\n\nThus we choose to append_checklist for Cause_of_Action with value \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\".\n\nWe need evidence: text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe have text: \"pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988\". We'll provide that. Source document: Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial. Location: tokens 7445-7645, page? not given. We'll use \"tokens 7445-7645\" as location.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.\n\nLet's produce JSON function call.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"patch\":[{\"key\":\"Cause_of_Action\",\"extracted\":[{\"value\":\"42 U.S.C. § 1988\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988\",\"source_document\":\"Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial\",\"location\":\"tokens 7445-7645\"}]}]}]}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Cause_of_Action", "extracted": [{"value": "42 U.S.C. § 1988", "evidence": [{"text": "pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988", "source_document": "Class Action Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial", "location": "tokens 7445-7645"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9139, "completion_tokens": 1083, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have extracted 3 so far: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1985 (probably 1985(3) but just 1985), 42 U.S.C. § 1988, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) maybe considered same as 1985? Also 42 U.S.C. § 1997e? but that's PLRA, not a cause. Also 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) might be separate. Also 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is a separate cause. Also 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Also 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). Also 42 U.S.C. § 1985. Possibly 42 U.S.C. § 1985. But we might want to capture the phrase exactly as appears: \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\". But is 1985(3) a separate substatute? It's a specific subsection. The instruction: extract the legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims — statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action. So 1985(3) is a vehicle. So we should include both 1985(3) and 1985? In the text, we saw \"42 U.S.C. § 1985: Conspiracy to Deprive...\" and also \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\". So we have two forms: the general 1985 and the specific 1985(3). Both are vehicles. So we should list distinct values: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\", \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\", \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\". Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" are distinct. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" distinct. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" appears. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" appears. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears. So we have 4 distinct values.\n\nWe have evidence for each from the various reads. We need to append these to checklist. We already have 3: 1983, 1985, 1988. We need to add 1985(3). Also verify that 1985(3) not already appended? We saw we appended 3 values (2 from class action and 1 from fifth amended). The 2 from class action were 1983, 1988. The one from fifth amended was 1985. So 1985(3) not yet appended.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist for Cause_of_Action adding 1985(3). Provide evidence: from Fifth Amended Complaint tokens 15060-15260 and 15083-15283 where 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) appears. We have two matches. We can use any one. We need to include evidence text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nLocation: token range 15060-15260? That is part of Fifth Amended Complaint. Provide location string maybe \"tokens 15060-15260\". Could also include page? But token offsets are fine.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't duplicate 1985. Only add new one. So patch: key \"Cause_of_Action\" with extracted entry value \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" and evidence.\n\nThus we call append_checklist with patch.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"patch\":[{\"key\":\"Cause_of_Action\",\"extracted\":[{\"value\":\"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) provides that “[i]f two or more persons . . . conspire . . . for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws . . .”\",\"source_document\":\"Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand\",\"location\":\"tokens 15060-15260\"}]}]}]}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Cause_of_Action", "extracted": [{"value": "42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)", "evidence": [{"text": "42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) provides that “[i]f two or more persons . . . conspire . . . for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws . . .”", "source_document": "Fifth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand", "location": "tokens 15060-15260"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8992, "completion_tokens": 975, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have 13 docs; some not visited. We already have 42 U.S.C. §1983, §1985, §1988, §1985(3). Also maybe 42 U.S.C § 1997e or § 1997i? In documents, we saw mention of PLRA section 1997e in Order (002). But that is a procedural claim about damages barred; not a cause of action? It's a procedural rule, not a cause. The cause of action is the private right of action, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, § 1985(3). The PLRA is not a cause of action. Also maybe 42 U.S.C § 1988 is a claim for special damages? It's a statute that provides for civil rights claims—private right. So we have that.\n\nCheck other documents like Docket, Protective Order etc. Those likely don't contain cause of action. But maybe the Motion to Dismiss includes cause of action? Might mention 42 U.S.C. § 1983. But we already captured that. Might also mention 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). So we may not need extra.\n\nBut to be thorough, we could search remaining unvisited docs for cause of action patterns. Use search_document_regex across unvisited docs for pattern of \"42\\sU\\.S\\.C\\.\\s§\\s\\d+[a-z]*\" etc. That may surface other statutes like 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). Already captured. But maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Already captured. 42 U.S.C. § 1988 captured. Also 42 U.S.C. § 1997e appears, but that's not cause of action. But maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) appears again but we already have.\n\nWe should confirm if any other cause of action like \"Title II of the Civil Rights Act\" or \"Title II of the ADA\" appears. In the earlier search, no matches found after Step 8. But maybe in other documents? We saw search earlier but no matches in the subset. So likely none.\n\nThus we might be done. But we need to ensure we didn't miss any cause of action like \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" etc. Already included. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" included. So we have 4.\n\nWe need to ensure list includes each distinct. We have: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1985, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3), 42 U.S.C. § 1988. That's four. Did we include 42 U.S.C § 1985 (without (3))? In the Fifth Amended Complaint, the cause of action includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1985: Conspiracy to Deprive Plaintiffs of the Equal Protection of Laws\". That's 42 U.S.C. § 1985. Good.\n\nThus we have all four. Are there any other such as \"42 U.S.C. § 1997e\"? Not cause. \"42 U.S.C. § 1997i\"? Not cause. \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" already. \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" done. \"42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\" done. \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" done.\n\nThus checklist is complete. Need to stop.
