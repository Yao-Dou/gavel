Stipulation has only 692 tokens total; we read all. So no settlement duration there.\n\nThe Docket maybe contains settlement dates. The Docket view 5885-6085 lines show \"Joint Status Report re status of settlement due by 12/16/2024.\" That indicates settlement due date. That is a duration? It says \"settlement due by 12/16/2024\". Might count as duration: \"due by 12/16/2024.\" But it's a date, not duration. Also \"Responses due by 1/3/2025.\" That is due dates for responses, not settlement. Might be settlement deadlines though. The requirement: \"duration of settlement obligations, including any monitoring periods, for negotiated agreements between parties that resolve a dispute, as opposed to formal court orders or judgments. Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.

But the requirement: \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\". So we could produce \"by 12/16/2024: settlement due.\" But we need to confirm that it's a settlement obligation not part of a court order. This is a docket entry, not a court order. So maybe qualifies.\n\nBut need distinct values; we have only that one maybe. But maybe there's also settlement due by 1/3/2025 for responses. That's also a settlement-related deadline. However it's a response to motion, not settlement. But could be settlement obligation? Might be not. But maybe we need only settlement obligations like \"settlement due by X\" which is a condition of settlement. Could include \"joint status report re status of settlement due by 12/16/2024\".

The key also says \"duration of settlement obligations, including any monitoring periods, for negotiated agreements between parties that resolve a dispute\". So we need to find if there is a negotiated settlement agreement specifying a period, e.g., \"the parties agree that the settlement will last for 12 months\" or \"the parties will comply with settlement for 3 years.\" If no such specification, then Not Applicable.\n\nWe should verify if any document contains such a duration. The \"Notice From the U.S. House of Representatives That Its Intervention Motion is Not Moot After Stipulated Dismissal\" might mention settlement but likely not duration. The \"Motion of the U.S. House of Representatives to Intervene\" includes \"settlement\" but likely not duration. The \"Response and Objection\" includes \"settlement agreement\" but not duration. The \"Stipulation for Dismissal\" is the dismissal of the case, so no settlement.\n\nThus likely No settlement duration. But we need to ensure there is no settlement agreement with duration. The search patterns didn't find matches. Could there be a settlement agreement text in \"Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\"? That document is about summary judgment, not settlement. The \"Complaint\" might contain settlement? The Complaint is not a settlement.\n\nThus the key is Not Applicable. The prior action updated the key to Not Applicable with evidence from Stipulation for Dismissal. That seems correct. All keys are addressed. There is only one key. So we can stop.\n\nBut we must ensure that the Not Applicable value is indeed correct. The evidence: Stipulation for Dismissal says \"no binding judgment has been entered in this matter consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58\". That indicates no settlement. So Not Applicable. Good.\n\nThus we should choose action stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items have been addressed; How_Long_Settlement_will_Last is marked Not Applicable with supporting evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items have been addressed; How_Long_Settlement_will_Last is marked Not Applicable with supporting evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12529, "completion_tokens": 781, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The prior step 18 set Not Applicable based on stipulation for dismissal. But maybe other documents have settlement durations? The task is to extract settlement duration from the legal documents. Checklist item: How_Long_Settlement_will_Last. We must extract all distinct values found in any document. So we must search for settlement durations in all documents. The prior steps searched for patterns, but none found. However we should confirm by scanning remaining documents for any settlement durations. The document list includes Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (unvisited). Possibly has settlement clause. Also Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. We should search those for \"settlement\" and durations. Let's search across all documents for pattern \"settlement.*?(for|until|through|after|during|over|within|by)\\s+(\\d+)\\s+(month|months|year|years|day|days|week|weeks)\". But earlier search didn't find. But maybe durations are expressed differently, e.g., \"for 12 months\", \"for a period of 12 months\". Could be \"for 12 months\" or \"for 12-year\". Maybe we should search for \"settlement.*?(for|until|through|after|during|over|within|by)\\s+\\d+\\s+(month|months|year|years|day|days|week|weeks)\". Already did. But maybe durations are after \"settlement\" but no 'for'. Maybe \"settlement will last\" etc. Could search for \"settlement will last\" or \"settlement period\" or \"settlement obligations\" etc. Let's search for \"settlement will last\" pattern. Also maybe \"settlement obligation\" phrase.\n\nAlso check other documents for \"settlement\" mentions.\n\nLet's search across all documents for \"settlement\" again but could include context. But earlier search returned matches only in some documents but no durations. Perhaps the settlement duration is in a settlement agreement mention in the docket? The docket mentions \"Joint Status Report re status of settlement due by 12/16/2024.\" That's a date, not duration. So maybe no settlement duration. But maybe the settlement agreement is in other documents not yet visited. Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is unvisited; maybe contains settlement clause. Let's search that document for \"settlement\". But we haven't read it. So we should search all documents for pattern \"settlement\" with context. Already did search, but maybe it didn't include that document because it was unvisited yet but search should search all. The earlier search results had 11 matches across 7 documents. That likely included all. So no unmatched. But we still need to confirm there are no settlement durations elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, the settlement duration could be in the order on cross-motions. But search didn't find. But maybe the order includes text like \"the parties agree that the settlement obligations shall last for a period of...\" Might have been missed by pattern. Let's search for \"settlement\" and \"period\" or \"term\" or \"duration\". Let's call search_document_regex for pattern \"settlement.*?(period|term|duration|obligation)\" on all docs. That may return context. Let's try.\n\nWe should also search for \"settlement agreement\" to see if included. But again pattern may catch.\n\nBetter to search for \"settlement.*?(for|until|through|after|during|over|within|by|for a period of|for a term of|for a duration of|for a period|for a term|for a duration)\". But this is complex.\n\nGiven the prior exhaustive search, maybe there is truly no settlement duration, making Not Applicable correct. But we must ensure no other doc has a settlement duration. Let's double-check the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. We can search for \"settlement\" there. Let's call search_document_regex on that doc specifically, pattern \"settlement\", flags IGNORECASE, top_k maybe 10. We'll get hits. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"pattern\":\"settlement\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "pattern": "settlement", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6751, "completion_tokens": 899, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We earlier set Not Applicable based on Stipulation for Dismissal. But we might need to verify if there is any settlement duration in other documents. In Step 18 we updated to Not Applicable. But the policy says: If later evidence shows that the item does have real values, use update_checklist to replace Not Applicable. So check other documents for any settlement duration.\n\nWe have seen many documents with \"settlement\" but no duration. Could there be a settlement agreement with a duration? Let's search the other documents for patterns like \"for X months\" or \"through\" etc. Already did many searches, none found. But maybe in the \"Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\" or \"Motion of the U.S. House of Representatives to Intervene\" or \"Plaintiffs Jane Doe and Susan Roe's Response\" there might be a settlement period. The earlier searches didn't find durations.\n\nBut maybe there is a settlement implied and has a duration like \"through 12/31/2025\" etc. We should search for \"through\" near \"settlement\". Let's search across all documents for \"settlement.*through\". We'll use search_document_regex.\n\nWe need to consider that we might need to read more of the documents. The search results earlier did not show any matches for \"settlement.*through\". But we might search for \"settlement.*[0-9]{1,4} month\" etc. Already searched for \"settlement.*?(?:for|in)\\s+\\d+\\s+(month|months|year|years|day|days|week|weeks)\" and none. Also \"settlement.*?(\\d+)\\s+(month|months|year|years|day|days|week|weeks)\" none.\n\nThus likely no settlement duration appears.\n\nBut we set Not Applicable because the stipulation for dismissal indicates no binding judgment, thus no settlement? But the stipulation might indicate a settlement agreement, but not necessarily a settlement obligation that lasts beyond a court order. The rule says: The duration of settlement obligations, including any monitoring periods, for negotiated agreements between parties that resolve a dispute, as opposed to formal court orders or judgments. Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment. So if the settlement is in a stipulation for dismissal, that is a court order. So it's not included. So Not Applicable is correct.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that the value \"Not Applicable\" is indeed justified. We have evidence from Stipulation for Dismissal. Good.\n\nBut we need to ensure that there are no other settlement obligations outside of court orders. The search didn't find any durations. So we can stop.\n\nBut we must verify that the checklist key is fully filled. The key is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\". We have one entry: Not Applicable. That's correct.\n\nThus we should stop.\n\nBut we must check that the last action was \"stop\" at Step 20. But Step 20 was stop, but Step 21 got checklist and confirmed. Step 22 performed a search. So we might still need to confirm no other values.\n\nThe \"search_document_regex\" on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief found 0 matches. The search on all documents for \"settlement\" had 11 matches but no durations. So likely no entries.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nDouble-check that the \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" key is not empty. It's Not Applicable. Good.\n\nTherefore we should output stop.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have evidence for Not Applicable. We have evidence snippet from Stipulation for Dismissal. So it's fine.\n\nThus the next action: stop.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All checklist items have been addressed; How_Long_Settlement_will_Last is correctly marked Not Applicable with supporting evidence and no other settlement durations were found in the corpus.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items have been addressed; How_Long_Settlement_will_Last is correctly marked Not Applicable with supporting evidence and no other settlement durations were found in the corpus.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6669, "completion_tokens": 839, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
