The search already found many matches. We need to ensure we capture all distinct judge names. In Docket, we saw \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON\" and \"JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN\". Also \"United States District Judge Nancy Torresen\" in the Order on Cross-Motions. Also maybe other judges in other documents.\n\nWe should read more of the Order on Cross-Motions to confirm judge name. Also maybe other documents contain judge names. We need to extract all distinct judge names. Let's search all documents for \"Judge\" pattern. The search already did, but may have missed some in other docs. Might need to search in Complaint, Notice, etc. Let's run search_document_regex for all documents again but maybe narrower to \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" etc. But we already have many matches. Likely the judge names are:\n\n- John C. NIVISON (Magistrate Judge)\n- Nancy Torresen (United States District Judge)\nAlso maybe \"Judge\" appears in other doc like \"Judge Nancy Torresen\" or \"Judge John C. NIVISON\". Also maybe other judges appear in other documents? Let's search again across all docs for \"Judge\" maybe with regex \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\".\n\nBut we have coverage of many docs; we need to read the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to see if judge name appears. Let's read a portion near the top where the judge may sign the order? Usually the complaint doesn't contain judge name. But maybe the Complaint includes \"United States District Court for the District of Maine\" etc, but not judge name.\n\nThe Order on Cross-Motions has the judge signature at the end: \"United States District Judge Nancy Torresen\". So we need to capture that.\n\nAlso there might be other judge names in other documents such as \"Magistrate Judge John C. NIVISON\" appears in many docket entries. That's all.\n\nThus we need to extract two distinct judge names: \"John C. NIVISON\" and \"Nancy Torresen\". Ensure evidence.\n\nWe have evidence for John C. NIVISON from Docket matches. For Nancy Torresen from Docket match 9 and Order on Cross-Motions signature.\n\nWe need to append these entries. Use append_checklist with key First_and_Last_name_of_Judge and extracted entries.\n\nWe should gather evidence snippets:\n\nFrom Docket match 1? Actually match 1 didn't show. match 3 includes \"By MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON.\" So use that snippet.\n\nFrom Docket match 9: \"By JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN.\" Also from Order on Cross-Motions: the signature block.\n\nWe need to provide evidence with text, source_document, location.\n\nWe can use Docket for both. For Nancy Torresen we can also use Order on Cross-Motions.\n\nLet's collect:\n\nEvidence 1: Docket, location maybe token range 2140-2340 snippet: \"By MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON.\" Provide that.\n\nEvidence 2: Docket, location 3013-3213 snippet: \"By JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN.\" Provide.\n\nAlso evidence 3: Order on Cross-Motions, location 16320-16434 snippet: \"/s/ Nancy Torresen\" and \"United States District Judge\".\n\nWe might combine evidence for each entry maybe multiple.\n\nThus we need to call append_checklist.\n\nLet's craft JSON call: patch array with key First_and_Last_name_of_Judge, extracted array of two entries. Each entry has value string and evidence array.\n\nEnsure value includes full name: \"John C.

NIVISON and Nancy Torresen. We need to decide if any other judges appear in other documents. There might be other judges in the unvisited documents. The task is to extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So we need to search all documents for judge names. The search in Docket captured many occurrences but may be incomplete. We saw \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON\" multiple times. Also \"JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN\" appears. Maybe also other judge names like \"United States District Judge Nancy Torresen\" in the opinion. There might be other judges like \"United States District Judge\" but with other names. We need to scan other documents: Complaint, Notice, etc. Likely other judges may appear in the Complaint or other documents. We need to search all documents for \"JUDGE\" or \"Judge\". Let's search all documents for pattern \"JUDGE\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" again? But we need to ensure we capture all occurrences. The previous searches already scanned all documents and found matches in Docket and Opinion. But maybe other documents also contain judge names. The search results indicated 17 matches in Docket, 5 matches in Docket for the second regex, 6 matches in Docket for third regex, and 1 match in Opinion. There were no matches in other documents reported. That suggests that only Docket and Opinion contain judge names. However, we should confirm by scanning Complaint and others. The search_regex function returns top matches per document. The earlier search results were for all documents. \"search_document_regex\" with pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*\" on all documents found 6 total matches: all within Docket and 1 in Opinion. So likely no judge names in other docs. But we must still double-check if there might be different patterns like \"United States District Judge Nancy Torresen\" was captured. Could there be \"United States District Judge\" with no name? Unlikely. So we likely have all judge names: \"John C. NIVISON\" and \"Nancy Torresen\". Are there any other judge names in the docket like \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON\" and \"JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN\". Also \"By MAGISTRATE JUDGE X\" might appear with other names? But search results didn't find other names.\n\nThus we can consider the key complete. Need to ensure we didn't miss \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE\" with other names. The search found only NIVISON. So we have all.\n\nNow we need to ensure we have evidence for each value. We already have evidence: from Docket tokens 2140-2340 for NIVISON, and from Docket tokens 3013-3213 and Opinion tokens 16320-16434 for Nancy Torresen. But we need to provide evidence for each extracted value. The evidence must include source_document, location, text. We need to produce an append_checklist call with both values extracted. But we already did that earlier. But we might need to confirm no duplicates. The earlier append added both values. We need to check if any duplicates exist. We got two values. Are there any missing values? Perhaps \"United States District Judge\" is a title but not a name. Not applicable.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we must check if the key is complete: \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\". We extracted 2 values. The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we have 2 distinct values. We must provide evidence for each. We have evidence. So we can stop.\n\nBut we must be careful: we have evidence for both values. For John C. NIVISON, we have evidence from Docket tokens 2140-2340: \"By MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON.\" Provide that as evidence. For Nancy Torresen, evidence from Docket tokens 3013-3213: \"By JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN.\" and from Opinion tokens 16320-16434: \"/s/ Nancy Torresen United States District Judge\". Provide either or both. We can provide two evidence entries for each value.

The Order on Cross-Motions has Nancy Torresen. There might be other judge names in the other documents like Complaint, etc. We should search other docs for \"Judge\" pattern again? Already did search across all docs earlier; found matches only in Docket and Order. But earlier search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" found 6 matches: 5 in Docket, 1 in Order on Cross-Motions. That likely captured Nancy Torresen. However maybe there are other judge names in documents that were not searched? The search earlier used pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*\" which would match \"Judge Nancy Torresen\" but maybe pattern didn't catch because of preceding \"United States District Judge Nancy Torresen\"? It did match pattern \"Judge Nancy Torresen\"? The pattern requires \"Judge \" then a capitalized word. In \"United States District Judge Nancy Torresen\" it matches \"Judge Nancy Torresen\".
