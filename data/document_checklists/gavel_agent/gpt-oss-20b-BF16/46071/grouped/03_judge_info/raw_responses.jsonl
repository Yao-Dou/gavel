We have seen matches in Docket and Order. But we need to extract fully. We likely need to read the Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment to get judge's name. The snippet shows \"Nancy Torresen\" and \"United States District Judge\" but the full name is Nancy Torresen. Also there may be other judge names in Docket: \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON\", \"JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN\". Also maybe others. We need all distinct values of the key. The key is the name of the presiding judge; first and last name. For \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON\" first and last: John NIVISON? But pattern: \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON\" includes middle initial. Should we include middle? It says first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided. So we might capture \"John NIVISON\" or \"John C. NIVISON\"? The definition says first and last name. Probably \"John NIVISON\" or \"John C. NIVISON\"? The requirement: \"The name of the presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided). The extracted value should be formatted as '[full name]'.\"\n\nSo we include full name as appears. For \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON\", full name appears to be \"JOHN C. NIVISON\". Similarly \"JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN\". So we should capture \"Nancy Torresen\" and \"John C. NIVISON\". Also possibly \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE\" preceding. We can include the name with first and last. So we should extract those two names.\n\nWe need evidence: text snippet, source document, location indicating page/section or token offsets. We can use token offsets from search results. For Docket, we have matches with tokens 1919-2119 etc. We might need to read the relevant token ranges to confirm names. We have partial coverage but those ranges include the names. We might read from Docket to capture both names. Also read from Order to capture Nancy Torresen.\n\nWe need to call read_document for Docket maybe token ranges that have names. We have partial coverage already includes those ranges but we need context. The coverage shows we have read tokens 1919-2119, 2140-2674, 2742-2942, etc. Those ranges include names. But we might need to confirm that \"John C. NIVISON\" appears. We can read a range that contains it. For example 2140-2340 includes \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON\". So we can read that. Also 1919-2119 includes earlier. So we can read 2140-2340. That is within coverage? We already partially visited 2140-2674. So we might not need to read again? The visited tokens show 2140-2674 is partially visited. Actually visited tokens list includes 2140-2674. So we have read that range. We didn't see evidence but we can re-read that range to confirm. It's within 10k tokens. So we can call read_document for Docket start 2140 end 2340. That will give snippet. Then we can extract the name.\n\nAlso for Order, we have only seen 16320-16434. That includes Nancy Torresen but we should read maybe 16320-16440 to capture full. We'll read that.\n\nWe may also need to capture \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE\" but not required. So we need at least two names.\n\nThus next action: read_document for Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment for tokens 16320-16450. Also read_document for Docket for tokens 2140-2340. But we can only call one function per turn. We need to choose one. Which is more efficient? We might need evidence for both. We can read one, then append. But we can also call read_document for both simultaneously? The function only allows one read_document call. So we pick one. Next step likely read Order to get Nancy Torresen. Then later read Docket to get John C. NIVISON. So we choose read_document on Order.\n\nThus next action: read_document for Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment doc_name: \"Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\" start_token: 16320 end_token: 16450.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\",\"start_token\":16320,\"end_token\":16450}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment", "start_token": 16320, "end_token": 16450}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6700, "completion_tokens": 984, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need list all distinct values. The rule: extract every distinct value of each checklist item. So we need to collect all judge names. We must provide evidence for each. We should look into all documents; likely many. We should search regex for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" maybe also \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE\". Could have \"United States District Judge\". But likely names. We need to gather all distinct judge names. Let's search across all docs for \"Judge\" patterns. We have many matches but we need to confirm names.\n\nWe should call search_document_regex for all documents with pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" and also maybe \"JUDGE\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\"? The pattern in previous search captured many like \"By MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON\". That includes \"JUDGE JOHN\". But we need names. So we can search for \"JUDGE\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" and \"judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" but maybe case-insensitive. Use flags IGNORECASE. Pattern: \"JUDGE\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\"? But that will capture \"JUDGE John\" etc. We need full names. Many names are like \"JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN\". Also \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON\". So we need to capture full names after \"JUDGE\" maybe with preceding \"MAGISTRATE\" or \"United States District Judge\". To capture names: pattern \"JUDGE\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)\" maybe. But simpler: search for \"JUDGE\\s+([A-Z][A-Za-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][A-Za-z]+)+)\" but cannot use capturing groups in regex search? The tool returns context, not matched groups. But we can parse evidence ourselves. We can search for \"JUDGE\" to get contexts.\n\nBetter: Use search_document_regex with pattern \"JUDGE\". That would capture many tokens. Then we read each match to see names. But we already have numerous matches from previous search. We need to confirm all distinct names: from Docket: MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON, JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN, United States District Judge Nancy Torresen. Also maybe others like \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE\" etc. Might be many.\n\nWe should perform search over all documents for \"JUDGE\". Then read relevant token ranges to capture full names.\n\nBut we should not re-read previously visited token ranges. Use visited tokens list. For Docket we have visited ranges: 1644-1844, 1919-2119, 2140-2674, 2742-2942, 2959-3367, 3470-3670, 5699-5982. We need to search all documents. For Order on Cross-Motions we have visited 16320-16434. There might be more judge names beyond that. But likely only one. So we need to find all judge names across all documents.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"JUDGE\" flags IGNORECASE. That will produce matches. But we need to limit number of matches; default top_k=5 per doc. But we might need more. Could set top_k high. But we can then read the tokens for each match to get names. We can loop.\n\nGiven time, maybe we can gather from existing evidence: we have names: Nancy Torresen, John C. Nivison. Are there others? We saw \"MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON\". Also \"JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN\". Also \"United States District Judge Nancy Torresen\". Also maybe \"JUDGE\" in other docs: \"JUDGE\" maybe appears in Complaint etc. But we need distinct values. Let's search.\n\nWe'll do search_document_regex on \"all\" with pattern \"JUDGE\" IGNORECASE. We'll get up to 20 matches per doc. That may give us all.

So two names.\n\nAlso maybe other judge names in other docket sections: In search results, we saw \"By MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON\" multiple times. Also \"By JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN\" in other docket entries.\n\nWe need to confirm that we capture all distinct judge names. Are there other judges? Maybe \"Magistrate JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON\" appears many times. Also any \"Judge\" with other names? Search results show only those two.\n\nThus we need to append these two entries.\n\nWe should use append_checklist with key First_and_Last_name_of_Judge.

So append.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.\n\nWe need to provide patch array with key and extracted entries.\n\nLet's craft evidence objects:\n\nFor Nancy Torresen:\ntext: \"/s/ Nancy Torresen\\nUnited States District Judge\" location: \"Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment, page ???\" We can use token range 16320-16434. Provide source_document \"Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\". location token range.\n\nFor John C. Nivison:\ntext: \"By MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C.

Nivison. The checklist has only one key: First_and_Last_name_of_Judge. We have values for it; but we need to ensure completeness: Are there any other judges referenced? The search results found 6 matches in Docket. We saw Judge Nancy Torresen and Judge John C. Nivison. But maybe there are others: In Docket, maybe other entries: \"By JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN\" appears; also \"By MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON.\" We might have also \"By JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN\" appears in multiple docket entries. Are there other judge names? Possibly \"United States District Judge\" appears with Nancy Torresen only. The Docket might have other judges like \"By Judge\" or \"By JUDGE\". Search results earlier: pattern \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)\" gave 5 matches in Docket. Let's inspect those matches: We saw first match tokens 1919-2119 includes \"By MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON.\" The second match tokens 3167-3367 might include? It shows lines but not judge names. Third match tokens 3470-3670 might include? No judge names. Fourth match tokens 5699-5899 includes \"By JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN.\" Fifth match tokens 5782-5982 includes again \"By JUDGE NANCY TORRESEN.\" So only those two names.\n\nBut we need to ensure we captured all distinct values. There are two distinct: Nancy Torresen and John C. Nivison. The current extracted list contains those two. Are there any other judge names elsewhere in other documents? Maybe in Complaint, Notice, etc. But likely not. But let's quickly search for \"Judge\" across all documents again with a regex capturing names, maybe \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\"? But we already matched. But there might be other judge names with middle initials. Eg \"Judge John C. Nivison\" captured. \"Judge Nancy Torresen\" captured. Are there any other \"Judge\" maybe \"Judge\" followed by something else? Could be \"Judge\" without name? Eg \"United States District Judge\" but no name. So probably only those two.\n\nThus the checklist key is satisfied. The requirement: \"Every distinct value\" must be extracted. We have 2. Should we verify that we didn't miss duplicates? The key might allow multiple values; we have 2. Check if any duplicates: None.\n\nThus we can stop. But we need to ensure we haven't omitted any judge names from other docs. Let's quickly search across all documents for \"Judge\" to see if any other names appear.\n\nWe can do search_document_regex for pattern \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+)\" which earlier found 11 matches. Those matches included 10 in Docket, 1 in Order. But we only captured two names. The other 9 matches likely are within docket entries but maybe include references to \"Judge\" in other contexts (like \"By JUDGE\" etc). But we captured all. Let's double-check: The docket matches 5 matches we saw. But earlier search pattern 2 had 11 matches: 10 in Docket, 1 in Order. That indicates there might be additional judge mentions outside the 5 matches we saw. But maybe those were not captured by the regex used earlier. The first search had pattern \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)\" capturing names with at least two words. That might not capture single-word names. But our names have two words: Nancy Torresen, John C. Nivison. That's fine. But there might be judge names with three words? Not likely.\n\nBut there might be other judge mentions like \"Judge\" token alone or \"United States District Judge\" without name. That might not be extracted. The checklist requires first and last name. So we only need names. So we have 2.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure no other judge names exist in other documents: e.g., Complaint or other filings. Let's search again across all documents with pattern \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)\" and confirm.\n\nBut we already did earlier; maybe we need to read more of Docket to confirm there are no other judge names. View more tokens? The Docket covered 40% coverage. There might be other judge names in other sections not covered. For completeness, maybe we should search the entire docket for \"Judge\" using search_document_regex again. That will give matches. We should examine them to see if any other names exist. But the search earlier found 5 matches. But there might be more matches beyond the token ranges we read. Let's check again with search_document_regex across all documents, pattern capturing names.

We should search all documents for \"Judge\" patterns to ensure no missing. We already have search results for Docket and Order. But other documents are unvisited.
