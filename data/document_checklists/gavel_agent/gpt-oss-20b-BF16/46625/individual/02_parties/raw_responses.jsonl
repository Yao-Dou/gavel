We have some matches from search. But need to gather distinct parties. Likely many: Plaintiffs: Vera Institute of Justice, Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for affirmative action, Force Detroit, Health Resources in Action; defendants: U.S. Department of Justice, Pamela J. Bondi, Office of Justice Programs, Maureen A. Henneberg. Also Amicus states: Washington, etc. Need to capture each distinct value with explanation.\n\nWe need to read more to capture full parties. The search gave partial. We should search for \"Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated\" or similar. But we might need to read the Complaint fully. We have partially visited it. We should read more of the Complaint beyond token 605 etc. But we have seen tokens 51-605 includes parties. We need to capture all parties. Let's read further tokens 606-1000 maybe. But we already have token 914-1191 partially. We need to capture all plaintiffs and defendants. Also in Amicus Brief includes Amicus States. But parties include plaintiffs and defendants. The Amicus may include Amicus States but not parties.\n\nWe should search for \"Plaintiffs\" and \"Defendants\" maybe. But we already have matches. To ensure all distinct, maybe read the entire Complaint? But 15,650 tokens, we can't read all at once, but we can read another token range. We have coverage 7%. We need to read rest.\n\nWe need to extract each distinct party: For plaintiffs, list each organization: Vera Institute of Justice, Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for affirmative action, Force Detroit, Health Resources in Action. Maybe also others? Look at the match 1 includes those five. Also maybe other plaintiffs like \"United States Department of Justice\"? Not plaintiff.\n\nDefendants: United States Department of Justice, Pamela J. Bondi, Office of Justice Programs, Maureen A. Henneberg. Also possibly \"United States Department of Justice\" as a defendant.\n\nAlso there might be \"Defendants\" multiple lines: \"United States Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20530; Pamela J. Bondi, 9950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20530; Office of Justice Programs, 810 7th St NW, Washington, DC 20001; Maureen A. Henneberg, 810 7th St NW, Washington, DC 20001.\" So include those.\n\nAlso \"Defendants.\" might appear again.\n\nWe need to capture each distinct party. So we need to produce entries for each. Format: 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\n\nThus we need evidence snippet: each snippet that includes the party description. Provide text, source document, location.\n\nWe need to choose next action: likely read more of the Complaint to capture all parties.\n\nWe have not yet read tokens after 1191. Let's read tokens 1200-2000 maybe. But we have to be efficient. Let's get tokens 1200-2000. But 2000 token range is 800 tokens - okay.\n\nBut we might also read the rest of the Amicus Brief to capture all amicus states? But party list is likely only in Complaint.\n\nBut maybe the Amicus Brief has parties: \"United States Department of Justice\" as defendants? But that document is an amicus brief supporting plaintiffs motion. It lists plaintiffs and defendants? It may list \"United States Department of Justice\" as defendant. But we already have that. But we want all parties. So reading the Amicus Brief might give same parties plus Amicus states. But those states are not parties; they are amici. But the brief might list them as \"Amicus States\".\n\nBut the requirement: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" So include each party with description. The Amicus states might not be parties, but the brief may list them as parties? I think \"Amicus States\" are not plaintiffs or defendants; they are amici. So we shouldn't include them.\n\nThus we only need parties: plaintiffs and defendants.\n\nThus reading Complaint should suffice.\n\nWe need to capture all parties. Let's read token range 1200-2000. But let's ensure we capture all. There's also token 1520 maybe. Let's read 1200-2000.\n\nAlso we may need to read the rest of Complaint: 2000-3000, 3000-4000, etc. But maybe all parties are listed near the beginning (the \"PARTIES\" section). It probably lists the plaintiffs and defendants near the top. We have seen up to 1191. That may include all parties. Let's read more to confirm.\n\nWe should read 1200-2000.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":1200,\"end_token\":2000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 1200, "end_token": 2000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7988, "completion_tokens": 1053, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have partial coverage of the complaint, which includes plaintiff list and defendants. We need to extract all distinct parties: plaintiffs and defendants, with descriptions. We need to capture each party with description formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\n\nWe have some info from complaint part: Plaintiffs list includes:\n\n- The Children and Youth Justice Center d/b/a Center for Children & Youth Justice (CCYJ) is a Washington State based nonprofit funded in 2006 by Washington State Supreme Court Justice Bobbe J. Bridge (ret.) to create better lives for generations of children and youth by reforming the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. (that's description). It may be truncated.\n\nBut the snippet shows \"The Children and Youth Justice Center d/b/a Center for Children & Youth Justice (CCYJ) is a Washington State based nonprofit funded in 2006 by Washington State Supreme Court Justice Bobbe J. Bridge (ret.) to create better lives for generations of children and youth by reforming the child welfare and juvenile justice systems.\" That is the description.\n\nNext:\n\n- Chinese for Affimative Action d/b/a Stop AAPI Hate: \"Chinese for Affimative Action d/b/a Stop AAPI Hate is a U.S.-based non-partisan Civil Rights coalition dedicated to ending racism and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs).\"\n\n- FORCE (Faithfully Organizing for Community Empowerment) Detroit: \"FORCE (Faithfully Organizing for Community Empowerment) Detroit is a community violence intervention (CVI) organization dedicated to building a safer, freer Detroit, Michigan.\"\n\n- Health Resources in Action (HRiA): \"Health Resources in Action (HRiA) is a Massachusetts based non-profit organization working to improve and reimagine public health, with a vision of healthy people thriving in equitable and just communities.\"\n\n- Vera Institute of Justice (Vera): \"Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) is a New York based non-profit, with a national footprint, working to advance safety and justice.\" \n\nAlso earlier in the complaint there may be other plaintiffs like \"Institute of Justice\" etc. Let's search for more \"Plaintiff\" lines maybe.\n\nWe saw earlier in the complaint part we saw \"Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, v. United States Department of Justice, ...\". But we need to capture the list of plaintiffs with description. The list is in the complaint near the top; we have partial coverage but maybe we need to read more tokens to get all plaintiffs. Let's read more tokens from the complaint around the section that lists plaintiffs to capture all. We have tokens 1200-2046 and 9818-10097. The plaintiffs list is between 1200-2046. We should read the section from token 1200-2046 again to capture all plaintiffs. We have read that portion but maybe we have only part; the snippet shows 13-17 lines. That likely covers all plaintiffs in that list. Let's confirm if there are others beyond 17. The snippet ends at \"17. Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) is a New York based non-profit, with a national footprint, working to advance safety and justice.\" That might be the last plaintiff. So we have 5 plaintiffs.\n\nNow defendants: We have the defendants section in the complaint. We saw \"Defendants\" section starting around token 1835-1850 etc. In snippet: \"Defendants. 18. Defendant DOJ is a federal agency headquartered in Washington, D.C. 19. Defendant Pamela J. Bondi is the Attorney General of the United States. She is sued in her ...\". There's also \"Defendant Office of Justice Programs (OJP)\" etc. Let's search for \"Defendant\" lines in the complaint to capture all defendants. The snippet shows \"Defendants.\" at token 1834? Actually snippet shows \"Defendants.\" but not the list. The snippet also shows \"Defendants. 18. Defendant DOJ is a federal agency headquartered in Washington, D.C. 19. Defendant Pamela J. Bondi is the Attorney General of the United States. She is sued in her ...\". Possibly there are more lines like \"Defendant Office of Justice Programs (OJP)\" etc. The snippet may be incomplete. We need to read the relevant range containing the defendants list. We have currently viewed tokens 1846-2046 (the snippet included lines 15-17 plus \"DEFENDANTS\" header). But the defendants list might be after that header, maybe tokens 2046-... Let's inspect more tokens after 2046.\n\nWe have coverage up to 2046 for that match. We might need to read more tokens, e.g., 2046-2600 to capture defendants. Let's read from 2046-2600.\n\nWe'll do read_document on Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 2046-2600.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":2046,\"end_token\":2600}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 2046, "end_token": 2600}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10139, "completion_tokens": 1081, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have read many parts. We need all distinct parties, listing plaintiff and defendant descriptions. We have seen plaintiffs list: Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for affirmative action, FORCE, Health Resources in Action, Vera Institute of Justice. And defendants: U.S. Department of Justice, Pamela J. Bondi (Attorney General), Office of Justice Programs, Maureen A. Henneberg (Deputy Assistant Attorney General). Also maybe DOJ agency. Also maybe Amicus states but those are amici not parties. Also in Amicus brief, the parties include plaintiffs. But we should capture distinct parties across all documents. We have already seen plaintiffs and defendants in the Complaint. Also the Amicus brief lists the Amici states as parties? It's an amicus but not a party. The question: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" So we should include all parties: plaintiffs list and defendants list. Extract each as separate entry. We need evidence snippets. We have evidence from the Complaint (tokens 1200-2600 show plaintiffs list; tokens 179-379 show defendants list). Also earlier we saw Plaintiff list in the earlier part (tokens 51-605). So we should append entries. We should not include duplicates. How many distinct parties? Plaintiffs: 5 parties: Center for Children & Youth Justice (CCYJ), Chinese for affirmative action (Stop AAPI Hate), FORCE (Faithfully Organizing for Community Empowerment Detroit), Health Resources in Action (HRiA), Vera Institute of Justice. Defendants: U.S. Department of Justice, Pamela J. Bondi (Attorney General), Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Maureen A. Henneberg (Deputy Assistant Attorney General). Also DOJ could be counted as a party, but it's an agency. So 4 defendants.\n\nAlso maybe the plaintiffs in the Amicus? Those are state agencies, but they may not be parties. The brief lists \"VERA INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE, et al., Plaintiffs...\". But those are the same 5 plaintiffs. Also the Amicus states are listed as \"States of Washington, Arizona...\" but they are amicus, not parties. So we focus on parties. Also possibly \"Defendants\" includes DOJ, Bondi, OJP, Henneberg. Confirm in the Complaint we saw a line \"Defendants are United States agencies and officers sued in their official capacities, and at least one Defendant resides in this district\". That sentence exists. So we should capture.\n\nWe need to include evidence snippets. For each entry, we need a snippet text. We can provide multiple snippets. But one snippet per entry is fine. For plaintiffs, we have snippet: \"13. The Children and Youth Justice Center d/b/a Center for Children & Youth Justice (CCYJ) is a Washington State based nonprofit...\" etc. For Chinese: \"14. Chinese for ...\". For FORCE: \"15. FORCE (Faithfully ...)\" etc. For HRiA: \"16. Health Resources in Action (HRiA) is a Massachusetts based non-profit organization...\" For Vera: \"17. Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) is a New York based non-profit\". For defendants: From tokens 179-379: \"United States Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20530; PAMELA J. BONDI, in her official capacity as United States Attorney General, 9950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20530; OFFICE OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS, 810 7th St NW Washington, DC 20001; MAUREEN A. HENNEBERG, in her official capacity as Acting Head of the Office of Justice Programs, 810 7th St NW Washington, DC 20001;\". That is good evidence.\n\nAlso maybe additional defendant entries from other documents. But these are the main ones.\n\nThus we should call append_checklist with key Who_are_the_Parties and extracted entries. Provide evidence for each. Ensure list of extracted entries includes all distinct ones. Let's prepare JSON.\n\nWe must not include other keys. Only one key.\n\nWe need to format as per append_checklist: patch array with objects. For each extracted entry: value: string like \"Plaintiff: Center for Children & Youth Justice (CCYJ)\". But the spec says formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'. So we can use that.\n\nThus entries:\n\n- \"Plaintiff: Center for Children & Youth Justice (CCYJ), Washington State based nonprofit...\"\n- \"Plaintiff: Chinese for affirmative action (Stop AAPI Hate), U.S.-based non-partisan coalition...\"\n- \"Plaintiff: FORCE (Faithfully Organizing for Community Empowerment) Detroit, community violence intervention...\"\n- \"Plaintiff: Health Resources in Action (HRiA), Massachusetts based non-profit...\"\n- \"Plaintiff: Vera Institute of Justice (Vera), New York based non-profit...\"\n- \"Defendant: United States Department of Justice, federal agency headquartered in Washington, D.C.\"\n- \"Defendant: Pamela J. Bondi, Attorney General of the United States, sued in official capacity.\"\n- \"Defendant: Office of Justice Programs (OJP), agency of DOJ.\"\n- \"Defendant: Maureen A. Henneberg, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Operations and Management and Acting Head of the Office of Justice Programs.\"\n\nWe need evidence for each. Use snippet from Complaint tokens. Provide source_document = \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". Provide location: maybe \"Page 5 of 33\" for plaintiffs, \"Page 4 of 33\" for defendants. Use token ranges or page numbers. Let's gather from earlier read: The plaintiffs list starts at token 1200-2600, but page numbers: \"Page 5 of 33\" for plaintiffs. The defendants list appears at tokens 179-379, \"Page 4 of 33\". We can use those.\n\nThus for each entry, we include evidence array with one evidence: text snippet. Provide snippet of the relevant line. For plaintiffs, we can provide snippet like \"13. The Children and Youth Justice Center d/b/a Center for Children & Youth Justice (CCYJ) is a Washington State based nonprofit funded in 2006...\" etc.\n\nBut we already read from tokens 1200-2600 and saw 13-17 lines. So we can use that snippet.\n\nFor defendants snippet: \"United States Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20530; PAMELA J. BONDI, in her official capacity as United States Attorney General, 9950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20530; OFFICE OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS, 810 7th St NW Washington, DC 20001; MAUREEN A. HENNEBERG, in her official capacity as Acting Head of the Office of Justice Programs, 810 7th St NW Washington, DC 20001;\". That is from match 1.\n\nWe need evidence text exactly from doc.

But there may be additional parties in other documents: e.g., Amicus brief includes many parties (VERA, etc). The checklist requires all distinct party descriptions across any document. So we need to extract all parties, including those in amicus, motions, etc.\n\nWe have partial coverage; we need to search for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" patterns in other documents not fully visited. We have already searched all documents for pattern \"Plaintiff\" and got many matches, but not all documents fully scanned. We need to gather all distinct party names and descriptions.\n\nWe have 9 entries from complaint. There may be additional parties: e.g., Amicus brief includes VERA INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE et al., and many states as amici. Also the \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" and others may list parties. Also the \"Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" etc.\n\nThus we need to continue scanning. We have a list of documents and coverage. We need to read more portions of the Amicus brief, maybe the beginning and the \"Plaintiff\" section includes many parties.\n\nAlso the \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" likely lists defendants as DOJ, etc. Might also list plaintiffs.\n\nWe should extract all parties. So far we have:\n\nPlaintiffs: Center for Children & Youth Justice (CCYJ); Chinese for affirmative action (Stop AAPI Hate); FORCE Detroit; Health Resources in Action (HRiA); Vera Institute of Justice (Vera). Also maybe others? The \"Amicus\" includes Vera Institute of Justice et al., and many states. The complaint also may have \"Plaintiff: unspecified\" but we captured those 5.\n\nDefendants: DOJ; Pamela J. Bondi; Office of Justice Programs (OJP); Maureen A. Henneberg. Also maybe others? The \"Defendants\" list may be limited to those 4.\n\nAlso maybe other documents include other parties such as \"United States Department of Justice\" etc. Also \"Defendants\" in other documents. Also \"Plaintiff\" may include \"VERA INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE, et al.\" and \"States of Washington, Arizona, etc.\" as amici.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct parties, with description.\n\nThus we need to search for patterns \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" across all documents, read the relevant tokens to capture names, and then append to checklist.\n\nWe should also confirm that we haven't missed any parties in other documents. For example, the amicus brief has many parties. Let's search \"Plaintiff\" again but maybe with context. We already did search across all docs and got 55 matches, but we only captured a few. We need to read those matched sections to capture parties.\n\nAlso \"Defendants\" might appear in the amicus brief as well. Also \"Defendants\" in other documents.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Plaintiff\" again but maybe more specific pattern \"Plaintiff\" with preceding context. But we already did that. We need to read each match to extract parties. But there are 55 matches; we can't read all at once. We need to pick a document with unvisited tokens that likely contains new parties. The Amicus brief has the part at the top with many parties. That is likely not fully visited. The Amicus brief has tokens 0-309 visited, but not all. The match for \"Plaintiff\" at tokens 0-145 shows \"VERA INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE, et al., Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated\". That includes Vera. But we already have Vera. However, the list might include \"States of ...\" as plaintiffs (amici). These are not captured. Also the Amicus brief likely lists many states as parties.\n\nThus we need to read the Amicus brief around the \"Plaintiff\" section to capture all party names. That may be tokens 0-309? We already visited 0-309 in the amicus brief. We saw the snippet. It includes \"VERA INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE, et al., Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated\". That includes Vera. But not the states. The states list appears later at tokens 3649-3879 etc. That might contain the list of states. We haven't visited those tokens. So we should read that range to capture the states.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Amicus brief tokens 3600-3900 to capture the list of states. Also read maybe tokens 4000-4200 if needed.\n\nAlso check other documents for new parties: the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, etc. Might list \"United States Department of Justice\" again, but we already have that. However, maybe also \"Office of Justice Programs\" etc. Already captured. But maybe there are other parties like \"United States Department of Justice\" but that is same.\n\nThus likely missing parties: states.\n\nThus next action: read_document Amicus brief tokens 3600-4000.\n\nWe'll call read_document with doc_name \"Amicus Curiae Brief of Washington, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon and Rhode Island in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" and start_token 3600, end_token 4100.

But likely there are additional parties in other documents: e.g., Amicus Brief includes states as parties. But are states considered parties? Yes, they are amici curiae, not litigants. But the task is parties involved: descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices. So states as plaintiffs? They are amici, but they might be considered parties? But the definition may include parties like the states as plaintiffs (Amici). Might need to include them. We need to confirm.\n\nLet's examine the Amicus Brief snippet: It lists states as \"The States of Washington, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and Rhode Island (Amici States)\". That could be parties: Plaintiffs: the states, but they are amici. They might be considered parties. The brief states \"Amici States\" and \"Plaintiffs\". But the parties list might include them.\n\nAlso, the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss includes Defendants: United States Department of Justice. Also possibly other defendants: maybe the department's sub-agencies. The motion might list them. We need to scan.\n\nThus we should read other documents. We can search for \"United States Department of\" to find defendants. Already did earlier. But we need to read the relevant sections to extract parties.\n\nWe need to avoid duplicate extraction. We already have 9 values. We need to check if there are more.\n\nLet's read the top of the Class Action Complaint again from 0-500.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":500}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 500}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6162, "completion_tokens": 797, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Already 9 values extracted. But we might have more parties in other documents. Need to ensure all distinct party descriptions are extracted from all documents. We have read some documents: Complaint, Motion for Preliminary Injunction, etc. We might need to check other documents for additional parties not captured yet.\n\nWe currently have 9 values extracted from Complaint. Need to see if other documents contain additional parties. For example, the Amicus brief may contain parties. The other motions may list parties. But likely parties are same across documents. However, the Amicus brief might include additional parties like other plaintiffs? But still same.\n\nWe might need to ensure all distinct parties across all docs. Let's check the other documents for any parties not already captured. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction lists plaintiffs: Vera Institute of Justice, Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Aff. Action, FORCE Detroit, Health Resources in Action, and maybe others? The text shows \"Plaintiffs Vera Institute of Justice, Children and Youth Justice Center d/b/a Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Aff. Action d/b/a Stop AAPI Hate, FORCE Detroit, Health Resources in Action, and Vera Institute of Justice\". So same. Defendants: United States Department of Justice. Also Pamela J. Bondi, etc. So same.\n\nThus 9 values may be: Plaintiff: Vera Institute of Justice; Plaintiff: Center for Children & Youth Justice; Plaintiff: Chinese for Aff. Action; Plaintiff: FORCE Detroit; Plaintiff: Health Resources in Action; Plaintiff: Vera Institute of Justice? duplicate? Actually repeated? Maybe duplicates. There are also Defendants: United States Department of Justice; Also Pamela J. Bondi; Office of Justice Programs; Maureen A. Henneberg. But the list includes Defendants. So distinct parties: Plaintiff entries and defendant entries. 9 values: maybe 5 plaintiff entries + 4 defendant entries? Actually 9 values listed. Let's check the appended values: We don't know exactly which 9 values. But likely includes 5 plaintiffs + 4 defendants.\n\nNeed to verify if any other parties appear elsewhere, e.g., \"United States Department of Justice\" is listed. Maybe \"Office of Justice Programs\" is a defendant. Also \"United States Attorney General\" might be a defendant. But that's same as Pamela J. Bondi. So might be duplicate.\n\nCheck other documents for additional parties: The Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal might have different parties? It probably references same parties. The Docket may have other parties. The Memorandum of Law may have other parties. But likely same.\n\nThus maybe all parties are captured. But need to confirm that we captured all distinct parties. Let's search for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" across remaining documents to see if any new parties appear. We can run search_document_regex on all documents for pattern that captures party names. But we need to extract distinct values. Let's search for \"Plaintiff\" again but with context to see if other parties. But we already did earlier. But maybe other docs contain \"Plaintiff\" lines. Could get additional names like \"Vera Institute of Justice\" etc. But we likely captured them.\n\nHowever, we might have missed some parties: For example, \"United States Department of Justice\" appears as defendant. Also \"United States Attorney General\" appears as defendant (Pamela J. Bondi). Also \"Office of Justice Programs\" appears. Also \"Maureen A. Henneberg\" appears. Also \"Children and Youth Justice Center\" appears. Also \"Center for Children & Youth Justice\" appears. Also \"Chinese for Aff. Action\" appears. Also \"FORCE Detroit\" appears. Also \"Health Resources in Action\" appears. Also maybe \"Vera Institute of Justice\" appears twice. So 9 distinct parties: 5 plaintiffs + 4 defendants. That matches 9.\n\nBut check if any other parties like \"United States Department of Justice\" might appear with a different role? Already counted. So likely complete.\n\nBut to be safe, we should still search other documents to confirm no additional parties. Let's search for pattern \"United States Department\" but we already saw. Also \"United States Attorney General\" etc. But all appear. Let's search for \"Plaintiff\" in other docs but we have limited coverage. But maybe the Amicus brief includes other parties: maybe other states? But likely same.\n\nGiven that the user steps show 9 values extracted and the status shows 1 key filled with 9 values. If all distinct parties are indeed 9, then we are done. But we need to confirm no missing. The instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if any document contains a party that is not in the 9, we need to add. We haven't fully scanned all documents. Could be incomplete coverage. We have only partial coverage of many docs. So we might need to search for parties in the remaining docs. Let's search for \"Plaintiff\" in all documents again, but we already did and got 55 matches across many docs. But those likely just include the same parties. But to be thorough, we could search for \"Defendant\" in all docs. But we did earlier. But maybe there are other parties like \"United States Department of Justice\" appear as defendant. Already counted.\n\nBut maybe other parties like \"United States Department of Justice\" might appear as a separate entity. Also \"Office of Justice Programs\" appears. Already included.\n\nOk. To be safe, we can run search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(Plaintiff|Defendant):? [A-Za-z0-9 &\\-()\\/.]+\"? But text may not be formatted that way. Might be \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\". We can search for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" lines. But we already did search and got many matches. But we need to extract distinct parties. We might need to parse the lines. But we can also read more tokens from the Amicus brief and other docs to see if any new parties appear.\n\nLet's read a portion of the Amicus brief around token 3600-4249 already read. But we may need to read earlier tokens 309-? maybe earlier portion. But we saw 0-309 too but not read. Let's read 309-600 maybe to see if any parties. Let's do read_document on Amicus brief tokens 300-600.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Amicus Curiae Brief of Washington, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon and Rhode Island in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\"start_token\":300,\"end_token\":600}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Amicus Curiae Brief of Washington, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon and Rhode Island in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "start_token": 300, "end_token": 600}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6149, "completion_tokens": 1429, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

They did 9 values from Class Action Complaint. But maybe other documents contain additional parties not yet captured, like the amicus brief may include additional parties or other documents might list parties. The checklist says \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" So we need all distinct values across all documents. Already have 9 values from complaint. But maybe the amicus brief includes other parties? The amicus brief includes names of attorneys, but maybe parties are also included? The amicus brief might include \"State of Washington\" etc. But the parties might be entities like \"VERA INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE\", \"CENTER FOR CHILDREN & YOUTH JUSTICE\", etc. Those are plaintiffs. Also \"United States Department of Justice\" is defendant. But maybe the amicus brief also includes other parties as plaintiffs or defendants? The amicus brief may list \"State of Washington\" etc. But those might be amicus attorneys not parties. The problem: the parties list includes only parties to the main lawsuit (plaintiffs and defendants). So likely the 9 parties already cover all. But we need to confirm if any other document has parties not captured.\n\nWe have other documents: Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Order, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, etc. Those may contain parties. But likely the parties list is same. However, the amicus brief might list \"State of Washington\" as a party? But not a party to the case. It's an amicus. So maybe not.\n\nBut the app says step 9: stop - all distinct parties have been extracted. But we are asked to decide next action. The current status says keys with values: 1/1, empty keys: 0/1, not applicable: 0/1. So the checklist is considered complete. But we must double-check. The extracted 9 values come from Class Action Complaint. Are there 9 parties? Let's see: In complaint, plaintiffs include: Vera Institute of Justice, Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Aff. Action, Force Detroit, Health Resources in Action. That's 5 plaintiffs. Defendants: United States Department of Justice, Pamela J. Bondi, Office of Justice Programs, Maureen A. Henneberg. That's 4 defendants. Total 9. Good.\n\nDoes any other document mention additional parties? Maybe the amicus brief includes other parties like \"State of Washington\" etc. But those are not plaintiffs/defendants. They are attorneys from states, but not parties. So likely no new parties.\n\nThus the checklist is complete.\n\nThus we should stop. But double-check: Did we include \"United States Department of Justice\" as a defendant? Yes. Did we include \"Pamela J. Bondi\" as a defendant? Yes. Did we include Office of Justice Programs and Maureen Henneberg as defendants? Yes. Did we include all plaintiffs? Yes. So completeness.\n\nThus we can stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All distinct parties have been extracted and the Who_are_the_Parties key is complete.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct parties have been extracted and the Who_are_the_Parties key is complete.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6625, "completion_tokens": 656, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
