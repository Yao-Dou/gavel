Could search for \"decree\" again? Step 6 search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \"decree\") found 0 matches. Means no \"decree\" word. But the checklist item is for formal court order or judgment: injunction, consent decree, etc. The \"Order\" is a court order. Might have other orders: maybe \"Memorandum Opinion\" includes \"This order shall remain in effect until\". Let's search within other documents for \"remain in effect until\". Step 8 and 9 found only one match in Order. But maybe \"effective until\" phrase. Let's search for \"effective until\".<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"effective until\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "effective until", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9009, "completion_tokens": 351, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Need to identify any other decrees durations in other documents: likely other orders, maybe in other documents like \"Memorandum Opinion\" or \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" etc. But likely only courts orders, injunctions, consent decrees. The Order is a court order. There might be \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" but that's a motion, not a decree. There might be \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" but not a decree. \"Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" not a decree. \"Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" – no. \"Plaintiffs-Appellants' Emergency Motion for an Injunction Pending Appeal\" – no. \"Memorandum Opinion\" – could be an opinion, not a decree. \"Amicus Brief\" – no. \"Class Action Complaint\" – no. \"Docket\" – no. So only the Order likely. But we should search for \"decree\" again in other docs? Step 6 earlier said search_document_regex on all docs pattern \"decree\" found none. But maybe the order contains \"decree\" but not. However we might need to capture other durations like \"effective until\" pattern found only in Order. So maybe just that one.\n\nBut check if there are other \"shall remain in effect until\" in other docs. We could search \"remain in effect until\" again but we saw only one match in Order. Could search \"remain in effect\" maybe others. But likely just Order.\n\nGiven we have 1 value extracted. The key has 1/1. There's 1 key total. We have all values? We need to confirm if there are any other decrees. Maybe \"Memorandum Opinion\" might contain a decree duration. Let's search within \"Memorandum Opinion\" for \"effective until\" or \"remain in effect until\". Search \"effective until\" again but only Order. Let's search \"until\" pattern? Could be \"effective until\". But commit to search for \"effective until\" again but step 11 search effective until found 0. So no.\n\nThus we can conclude only one value. But we need to ensure we haven't missed any other decree durations like \"This decree shall remain in effect until...\" in other documents. The Order is the only order. But maybe the \"Memorandum Opinion\" might have a decree, but likely it's a judicial opinion not a decree. The key is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" which is for any formal court order or judgment such as injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction. The Order is a formal court order. That value extracted. There are no other court orders or judgments. So we can mark as complete.\n\nThus we should stop.\n\nBut let's double-check that no other documents contain \"decree will last\" pattern. We could search for \"decree\" again but step 6 said none. So okay.\n\nHence final action: stop.\n\nBut we need to output JSON with decision stop and reason.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All checklist items have been fully extracted; only one decree duration found in the Order and no other court orders or judgments with durations exist in the corpus.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items have been fully extracted; only one decree duration found in the Order and no other court orders or judgments with durations exist in the corpus.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9034, "completion_tokens": 700, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The earlier search didn't find any. But we should confirm if any other documents contain a decree duration. Could be other orders or judgments. The Order is likely the only decree. But we should search for \"remain in effect until\" in all documents again? Already step 11 did search for \"effective until\" and step 9 for \"shall remain in effect until\" found only in Order. Step 8 found \"(?i)remain in effect until\" in Order. So likely no other. But maybe there's a different phrasing like \"will remain in effect until\" or \"will last until\"? Let's search all documents for \"remain in effect until\" again, but we already did. Maybe \"until\" but not phrase \"remain\" but \"will remain in effect until\" we did. Could be \"will last until\" but that may be rare. Let's search for \"will remain\" pattern? But we have no evidence. The earlier step 3 did search for \"decree will last\" no matches. Maybe the decree duration appears only in the Order. So the extraction is complete. The user earlier called stop, but system warns that we can stop again or continue. We can decide to stop final.
