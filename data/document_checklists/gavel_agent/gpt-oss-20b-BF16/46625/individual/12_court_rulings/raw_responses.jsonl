We have many matches from search_document_regex. But we need to extract all distinct rulings. We have some excerpts: Docket shows Order: Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction denied, Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss granted, Plaintiffs' 2 Motion to Certify Class denied as moot. Also Memorandum Opinion shows same. Also Order shows denied preliminary injunction and dismissed case for lack of jurisdiction. Also Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal: Court denied Plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunction and class certification and granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss. Also brief etc.\n\nWe need to read more context to capture each ruling. We should read the Docket order fully. We have partial view tokens 5047-5247. Let's read more tokens maybe 5000-6000. But we need each ruling. Might need to read more of the Docket? The Docket likely has the order. But our search results already captured the key statements. Could use read_document on Docket near tokens 5000-6000 to capture rest. But we have enough? For each ruling, we need value: e.g., \"Denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction on July 7, 2025.\" etc.\n\nAlso the Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal has two matches: first shows Court denied Plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunction and class certification and granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss. The second shows Court denied preliminary injunction because lacked jurisdiction. Also mentions court recognized ... We need to capture each distinct ruling: denial of preliminary injunction, denial of class certification, grant of motion to dismiss.\n\nAlso Order shows denied preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed case for lack of jurisdiction. That is similar but maybe separate order. So we need distinct rulings: (1) Denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (July 7, 2025) (2) Granted Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (July 7, 2025) (3) Denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification as moot (July 7, 2025) (4) Denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (July 7, 2025) and dismissed case for lack of jurisdiction (Order). But maybe overlapping. But we should consider distinct rulings across documents. Might combine? The instruction: extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So each unique ruling statement. So we need separate entries for each unique ruling. So we can list 3 or 4.\n\nWe should read the Docket order fully to capture date. Also read the Order for date and details. Also read the Memorandum Opinion for date. Let's read Docket order tokens 5000-6000? The Docket has tokens 5047-5247 already captured. Maybe read tokens 5200-5800. Let's read Docket from 5000-6500? But we need to avoid exceeding 10k tokens. It's fine. We'll read tokens 5000-6500.

We have seen matches in search. We need to read more to capture all rulings. We need to extract all distinct rulings: denied/ granted motions, etc. We have seen from Docket: Order denied Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction, granted Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss, denied Plaintiffs' 2 Motion to Certify Class as moot. Also from Memorandum Opinion: same. Also from Order: denial of motion for preliminary injunctive relief and dismissal for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state claim. Also from Emergency Motion: denial and grant.\n\nWe should read more relevant sections: Order token 105-305 includes denial of preliminary injunctive relief and dismissal. We saw that. Also the docket includes Order for 57: order granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal. That is a ruling. Also maybe other orders: 57. Also maybe earlier orders.\n\nNeed to read the Order token 105-305 (we have snippet). Also Order token 549-749 snippet includes mention of injunction pending appeal. Let's read token 549-749 to capture ruling there. Also read token 105-305 fully to capture evidence. Already snippet shows denial and dismissal. Let's read again 549-749 to capture details. Also read token 105-305 to capture full text. Then read token 549-749. Also maybe read token 105-305 again to get date. It shows at line \"On July 7, 2025, this court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\" Good.\n\nAlso read token 549-749 snippet: includes mention of injunction pending appeal. Let's read that. Also read token 105-305 again. Also read token 549-749 fully.\n\nAlso need to read the Order 57: token 57 lines? We saw snippet: \"ORDER granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal.\" So we need to capture that ruling.\n\nAlso maybe other orders: The docket includes Order 57. There might be other orders like 55? But not needed.\n\nAlso need to read the Memorandum Opinion snippet: it says denied motion for preliminary injunction, granted motion to dismiss, denied motion for class certification as moot. Already have.\n\nAlso need to read the Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal snippet: shows denial of preliminary injunction and class certification, grant of motion to dismiss. Already captured.\n\nAlso need to read the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss snippet: but maybe not needed.\n\nAlso need to read the Court ruling in the Docket \"Order\" token 105-305 shows denial and dismissal. Already captured.\n\nThus we need to extract these distinct rulings:\n\n1. Denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3) – \"denied\" – by Judge Mehta – date July 7, 2025. (Also from Order, same). Provide evidence.\n\n2. Granted Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (27) – \"granted\" – date July 7, 2025.\n\n3. Denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification (2) – \"denied as moot\" – date July 7, 2025.\n\n4. Denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief – same as 1 but maybe separate? It's same motion but in Order it refers to preliminary injunctive relief. But we can treat as same as #1. But maybe separate due to different phrasing. But we should list distinct rulings. It's same motion but different context. But we should still include as separate? The instruction: Extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Distinct values: each ruling. If same ruling appears multiple times, we don't duplicate. So we have one ruling: \"denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" (or preliminary injunctive relief). It's same.\n\n5. Denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief and dismissed case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. That's still denial of motion for preliminary injunctive relief; dismissal is separate ruling? The dismissal is a ruling too. So we need a distinct ruling: \"dismissed case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim\" – but maybe counts as a ruling on the case. Might include.\n\n6. Denied Plaintiffs' Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal in part? Actually Order 57: \"granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\". That's a partial ruling. We need to capture that.\n\n7. Denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction and granted Defendants' motion to dismiss – that's a ruling pair but same as earlier.\n\n8. Denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification as moot – already.\n\n9. Denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Emergency Motion: \"denied Plaintiffs' motions for preliminary injunction and class certification and granted Defendants' motion to dismiss.\" That's a ruling.\n\nThus we can extract these distinct rulings:\n\n- Denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3) – Judge Mehta – July 7, 2025.\n\n- Granted Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (27) – Judge Mehta – July 7, 2025.\n\n- Denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification (2) as moot – Judge Mehta – July 7, 2025.\n\n- Denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief and dismissed case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim – Judge Mehta – July 7, 2025. (This is a separate ruling on dismissal, but maybe same as previous? Actually denial of preliminary injunctive relief and dismissal are separate rulings: denial and dismissal. So we include both.\n\n- Granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal – Judge Mehta – July 21, 2025.\n\n- Denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Class Certification and granted Defendants' motion to dismiss (from Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal) – Judge Mehta – July 7, 2025.\n\nBut that last might be duplicate of earlier rulings.\n\nWe need to ensure no duplicates: If we have separate rulings for denial of preliminary injunctive relief and dismissal, they are separate.\n\nAlso partial ruling for Emergency Motion.\n\nThus we need to read Order 105-305 to capture denial and dismissal. Also read Order 549-749 to capture partial ruling. Also read Order 57 snippet fully. Also read Memorandum Opinion snippet for denial and grant.\n\nThus next action: read more of Order 549-749 maybe.\n\nWe have already read token 549-749 snippet: includes mention of injunction pending appeal. Let's read token 549-749 fully. Also read token 105-305 fully. Also read Order 57 from docket: but docket only contains summary, not full text of Order 57. We need to read the actual Order document (the document named \"Order\"? we have Order doc token 105-305 and 549-749. But Order 57 may refer to a separate Order? The docket shows \"57 | 2025-07-21 | ORDER granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal.\" That is likely a separate Order document. So we need to read that Order document. Which document is that? Probably the \"Order\" [Order/Opinion] document has multiple orders. The snippet token 105-305 is one order. The snippet token 549-749 is another. But the docket's Order 57 might be the same as token 549-749? Let's check token 549-749 snippet: It starts with \"-APM Document 57 Filed 07/21/25 Page 2 of 4\". So it's Order 57. Good. So token 549-749 is Order 57. So we need to read from token 549-749 fully to capture partial ruling. We also need to read token 105-305 fully.\n\nThus next action: read Order document token 105-305. Then read Order token 549-749. We can read both in separate calls. Let's first read Order token 105-305.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order\",\"start_token\":105,\"end_token\":305}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order", "start_token": 105, "end_token": 305}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8822, "completion_tokens": 1787, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have already read some relevant sections: Docket shows Order etc. Also Order read shows denial of preliminary injunctive relief and dismissal. Also the search results earlier show matches with rulings. We need to extract all distinct rulings.\n\nWe have seen in Docket: Order on July 7, 2025: Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction denied; Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss granted; Plaintiffs' 2 Motion to Certify Class denied as moot.\n\nAlso Order (token 105-305) says court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\n\nAlso Memorandum Opinion snippet (20078-20258) says Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction denied; Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss granted; Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification denied as moot.\n\nAlso Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal? It says in match 1: \"This Court’s July 7 Order denied Plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunction and class certification and granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss.\" So same.\n\nAlso there might be other documents with rulings, e.g., Order granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal (July 21, 2025). That is a ruling. We have that excerpt in Docket. Also maybe the Order (maybe 57) but that is the same.\n\nAlso maybe other orders like \"Order granting in part and denying in part\" etc. Also there may be other rulings in other documents like the \"Order\" or \"Memorandum Opinion\" etc. We might need to read more to capture all distinct rulings: e.g., \"Order granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" is a distinct ruling.\n\nAlso maybe there are other orders like \"Order on Motion to Dismiss\" or \"Order on Motion to Certify Class\" etc. But the docket lines show them. We should capture each unique court ruling as a separate value with context.\n\nWe have evidence from the Docket lines for those rulings. We also have the Order text for the denial of preliminary injunctive relief. We have the Memorandum Opinion text for denial of preliminary injunction etc.\n\nThus we need to append new values to Court_Rulings. We currently have 0 values.\n\nWe should build entries:\n\n1. Denial of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction on July 7, 2025 (in Order and Memorandum Opinion). Evidence: Docket entry 48, Order text, Memorandum Opinion snippet.\n\n2. Grant of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss on July 7, 2025. Evidence: Docket entry 48, Order text, Memorandum Opinion snippet.\n\n3. Denial of Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification on July 7, 2025 (denied as moot). Evidence: Docket entry 48, Memorandum Opinion snippet.\n\n4. Grant in part and denial in part of Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal on July 21, 2025. Evidence: Docket entry 57.\n\nPossibly other rulings like “Order granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs’ 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal” is the same. That's one.\n\nAlso, maybe earlier Order on July 7, 2025 denies preliminary injunctive relief. That is same as denial of preliminary injunction. But we might want a separate entry for that order (the denial is one ruling). It's the same as the earlier.\n\nWe might also have the Order on July 7, 2025 that \"denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\" That's the same denial. But we can add evidence from Order.\n\nWe need to ensure distinct values: there are 4 distinct rulings.\n\nBut we need to double-check if there are other rulings in other documents. For example, the \"Order\" may also contain \"ORDER: ...\". The snippet we read shows only denial. There may be other orders later, but we have not read them. The \"Order\" is the same as the Docket entry 48. So we captured that.\n\nBut there might also be \"Order\" that granted in part and denied in part of the Emergency Motion pending appeal. That's Docket entry 57; also there might be an Order in the order document after that. But we have the Docket entry evidence.\n\nThus we should append these 4 values.\n\nWe must include evidence for each: we can provide multiple evidence pieces per value. Each evidence piece includes text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe need to locate the text for each evidence snippet. We have the Docket snippet lines. For example:\n\nFrom Docket: lines 48: \"ORDER. For the reasons set forth in the court's 47 Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied and Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss is granted. Plaintiffs' 2 Motion to Certify Class is denied as moot.\"\n\nAlso Order text: \"On July 7, 2025, this court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\" That's a denial.\n\nMemorandum Opinion snippet: \"Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 3, is denied, and Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 27, is granted. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, ECF No. 2, is denied as moot.\"\n\nEmergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal match: \"This Court’s July 7 Order denied Plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunction and class certification and granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss.\"\n\nSo we can use those.\n\nAlso the Order for Emergency Motion: \"ORDER granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal.\"\n\nThus we need to produce an append_checklist call with patch for key Court_Rulings with extracted entries.\n\nWe need to ensure each entry has evidence list with text snippets. Provide source_document and location.\n\nWe have documents: Docket, Order, Memorandum Opinion, Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal (but we only have snippet). We can cite Docket and Order for the first three. For the fourth we can cite Docket entry 57. Provide location \"Line 57\" or \"Entry 57\" etc.\n\nWe need to include evidence from at least one snippet per entry. For each we can provide two evidence pieces: from Docket and from Order/Opinion.\n\nLet's craft the JSON.\n\nWe will call append_checklist with patch for key \"Court_Rulings\" and extracted array of 4 entries.\n\nEach entry:\n\n1. Value: \"July 7, 2025 – Court denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\" Evidence: Docket snippet 48, Order snippet.\n\n2. Value: \"July 7, 2025 – Court granted Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\" Evidence: Docket snippet 48, Order snippet.\n\n3. Value: \"July 7, 2025 – Court denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification as moot.\" Evidence: Docket snippet 48, Memorandum Opinion snippet.\n\n4. Value: \"July 21, 2025 – Court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal.\" Evidence: Docket entry 57.\n\nWe could also mention the date 07/21/2025. Provide evidence from Docket line 57.\n\nDouble-check Docket line 57: \"ORDER granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal. The parties shall file a Joint Status Report by September 29, 2025, ... Signed by Judge Amit P. Mehta on 7/21/2025.\"\n\nSo we can use that.\n\nAlso the text from Order snippet gives \"On July 7, 2025, this court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\" That could be evidence for the denial of preliminary injunction.\n\nThus for value 1 we can use that snippet. For value 2 we can use the same Order snippet: \"and dismissed the case\" might not mention motion to dismiss. But the Docket snippet does. We might add evidence from Docket snippet for motion to dismiss.\n\nOk.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each.\n\nLet's design each evidence:\n\nEntry 1 evidence:\n- text: \"ORDER. For the reasons set forth in the court's 47 Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied...\" from Docket (source_document: Docket, location: \"Entry 48\").\n- text: \"On July 7, 2025, this court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief...\" from Order (source_document: Order, location: \"Tokens 105-305\").\n\nEntry 2 evidence:\n- text: \"ORDER. For the reasons set forth in the court's 47 Memorandum Opinion, ... Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss is granted.\" from Docket.\n- text: \"and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\" from Order (but that indicates dismissal of case; still evidence that motion to dismiss was granted).\n\nEntry 3 evidence:\n- text: \"ORDER. For the reasons set forth in the court's 47 Memorandum Opinion, ... Plaintiffs' 2 Motion to Certify Class is denied as moot.\" from Docket.\n- text: \"Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, ECF No. 2, is denied as moot.\" from Memorandum Opinion (source_document: Memorandum Opinion, location: \"Tokens 20078-20258\").\n\nEntry 4 evidence:\n- text: \"ORDER granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal.\" from Docket (source_document: Docket, location: \"Entry 57\").\n\nWe might also add evidence from the Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal match: but not needed.\n\nWe must ensure evidence text is verbatim snippet. Use the exact text from the snippets we have. For the Order snippet, the text we have: \"On July 7, 2025, this court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\" That is exactly the snippet. For Docket entry 48: the snippet: \"ORDER. For the reasons set forth in the court's 47 Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied and Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss is granted. Plaintiffs' 2 Motion to Certify Class is denied as moot.\" We'll use that.\n\nFor Memorandum Opinion snippet: \"Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 3, is denied, and Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 27, is granted. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, ECF No. 2, is denied as moot.\"\n\nWe need to include the text exactly as in the snippet. Need to ensure punctuation and quotes match.\n\nLet's copy them carefully.\n\nFrom Docket snippet: \n\"ORDER. For the reasons set forth in the court's 47 Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied and Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss is granted. Plaintiffs' 2 Motion to Certify Class is denied as moot.\"\n\nFrom Order snippet:\n\"On July 7, 2025, this court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\"\n\nFrom Memorandum Opinion snippet:\n\"Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 3, is denied, and Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 27, is granted. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, ECF No. 2, is denied as moot.\"\n\nFrom Docket entry 57: \n\"ORDER granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal. The parties shall file a Joint Status Report by September 29, 2025, ... Signed by Judge Amit P. Mehta on 7/21/2025.\"\n\nWe need to capture the snippet exactly. The snippet given in step 3: \"ORDER granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal. The parties shall file a Joint Status Report by September 29, 2025, which updates the court on the status of appellate proceedings, including whether the court of appeals has granted emergency relief or expedited review. The parties shall advise whether the injunction should be extended. See the attached Order for additional details. Signed by Judge Amit P. Mehta on 7/21/2025.\"\n\nWe'll use that snippet.\n\nOk.\n\nNow produce the append_checklist call.\n\nWe need to include patch array with key \"Court_Rulings\" and extracted array of 4 objects.\n\nEach object has value string and evidence array of evidence objects.\n\nLet's craft.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Court_Rulings\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"July 7, 2025 – Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"ORDER.

But need to ensure we have all distinct Court_Rulings. Need to search remaining docs for other rulings. Likely opinions, orders, etc. There may be ruling in Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal, maybe earlier orders? Also maybe in \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum\" there is a ruling? But that is a pleading.\n\nWe should search all documents for pattern \"denied\", \"granted\", \"ordered\", \"issued\" etc. We already captured some. But maybe there are additional rulings in Order/Opinion not yet read fully: maybe the Order at 549-749 includes more rulings? We read 105-305 but not 549-749. That segment might contain a ruling about an injunction pending appeal or something. Let's read that portion.\n\nAlso maybe there is an Order on July 21 that we captured partially: we saw entry 57 from docket. That is a ruling. Might be additional rulings in other orders or in other documents like \"Memorandum of Law\" etc but they are not orders. Also maybe \"Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" could have a ruling? That is a pleading not order.\n\nWe should search for \"denied\" or \"granted\" again beyond what we have. Let's search all docs for \"denied\" \"granted\" etc. Use search_document_regex on all docs with pattern capturing rulings. Use pattern: \"(denied|granted|ordered|issued|declined|dismissed|denied).*?(motion|injunction|class certification|preliminary injunction|summary judgment|motion).*\" But we need to be careful. Maybe use same pattern as earlier but search again to confirm any missing.\n\nAlternatively, read the Order 549-749 to see if there's a ruling of \"denied\" etc. Let's do that.\n\nAlso read Memorandum Opinion fully? Already partially. But maybe there are other rulings in that doc, like \"preliminary injunction denied\" etc. We captured that.\n\nAlso maybe there are rulings in the \"Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" doc? That might be not an order.\n\nWe should also consider the \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum\" doc might contain a ruling if it is a court order? But it's a pleading. So ignore.\n\nAlso there might be a ruling in the \"Amicus Brief\" but no.\n\nThus likely only rulings are those four: (1) July 7: deny motion for preliminary injunction. (2) July 7: grant motion to dismiss. (3) July 7: deny class cert. (4) July 21: grant in part deny in part emergency motion. But maybe there is also a ruling in the \"Order\" at 549-749 that we haven't read: maybe something about \"denied injunction pending appeal\" etc.\n\nLet's read that part.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order\",\"start_token\":549,\"end_token\":749}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order", "start_token": 549, "end_token": 749}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9671, "completion_tokens": 642, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But maybe the Emergency Motion includes a paragraph \"On July 7, 2025, the court denied ...\". That was captured in Order. But maybe there is a ruling in the Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal (the Docket entry 51 etc). But we might need to capture rulings like \"Court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" (July 21). We captured that.\n\nAre there further rulings in the docket entries after 57? No further matches.\n\nBut we may have missed rulings from other documents: e.g., the \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" maybe has a ruling? The motion might contain a summary of the court's decision? Likely not; motions don't contain rulings.\n\nBut maybe the \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum in Opposition\" includes a paragraph \"The court granted the motion\". Unlikely.\n\nAlso \"Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" might have text \"The court granted the motion\"? But it's a motion.\n\nAlso \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" maybe includes a ruling? It's a motion; no.\n\n\"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" is a complaint; no.\n\n\"Amicus Curiae Brief\" etc; no.\n\n\"Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" maybe includes a ruling? No.\n\nBut there is \"Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" no.\n\nThus we have 4 rulings.\n\nBut we need to ensure completeness. Are there any rulings in the \"Memorandum Opinion\" we captured? Yes.\n\nAlso \"Order\" we captured.\n\nAlso \"Docket\" we captured.\n\nCould there be a ruling in \"Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" or \"Plaintiffs-Appellants' Emergency Motion for an Injunction Pending Appeal\" that states \"On July 7, 2025, the court denied ...\"? That's already in Order. But maybe in the Emergency Motion the court's ruling is stated? The motion itself wouldn't.\n\nThus 4 is likely complete.\n\nBut we might have missed a \"Court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" (July 21). We captured that.\n\nThere might be a later order after 57? The docket shows no further orders.\n\nCould there be a \"Court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" again? No.\n\nNow, next step: do we need to continue reading? Perhaps we should verify if the \"Class Action Complaint\" or \"Amicus\" or \"Defendants' Opposition\" contain rulings. But those are not likely.\n\nBut maybe the \"Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" may contain a ruling that the court denied class certification? But that would be in the docket.\n\nThus likely complete.\n\nBut we should confirm if the \"Docket\" has entries for \"ORDER\" after 57? No.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we must be certain that no other rulings exist in the documents we haven't read. We can search for \"ordered\" or \"granted\" etc. But we already did a regex search that found 17 matches; we captured the relevant ones.\n\nThe search matches might not include all, but we saw 17 matches. Those were from 5 documents: Docket, Emergency Motion, Memorandum Opinion, Order, Plaintiffs-Appellants' Emergency Motion.\n\nBut we didn't read the Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal content beyond tokens 139-339 and 1849-2049; but that is a motion, not a ruling.\n\nBut maybe the Emergency Motion contains a sentence \"The court granted the motion\" but that would be a ruling. But it's a motion file, not a ruling.\n\nCheck the content: tokens 139-339 show \"This Court’s July 7 Order denied Plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunction and class certification and granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss. ECF 48. But the Court’s Memorandum Opinion suggested that Plaintiffs had shown all the factors warranting an injunction pending their appeal of the Order.\" That is indeed the ruling referenced in the order. So that is captured.\n\nThus no more.\n\nBut maybe the \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" contains \"The court granted the motion\" but that's a motion, not a ruling. Might not be.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we need to return final decision: stop.\n\nReturn JSON: {\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All Court_Rulings extracted.\"}\n\nEnsure no other keys.

The checklist item: Court_Rulings – all distinct values. We extracted 4 values: \n1) July 7, 2025 – Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \n2) July 7, 2025 – Court granted Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. \n3) July 7, 2025 – Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification as moot. \n4) July 21, 2025 – Court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ 51 Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal.\n\nBut maybe there are more rulings in other documents: there might be rulings on other motions, e.g., Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal? That is the same as item 4. Also maybe in other docs like Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum, etc. But we already have that. However maybe there are rulings on Class Certification? We have denial. Are there any other rulings like granting of preliminary injunction pending appeal? We saw denial. Also perhaps there is a ruling on the preliminary injunction (the same). Maybe there's a ruling on dismissal of the case? Already included as part of denial. Also maybe a ruling on dismissal for lack of jurisdiction? That might be a separate ruling: \"denied motion ... and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\" That is part of the same ruling. We could consider that a separate ruling: Court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. But the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Create separate entries for each unique value.\" Each value should be a short self-contained narrative. So we might need to include that \"Court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\" That is part of the same order. We should treat it as a separate ruling. Also maybe there is a ruling on the Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal that was granted in part and denied in part. We have that. Also maybe a ruling on the motion to dismiss? Already included. Also maybe a ruling on preliminary injunction pending appeal? Already included. Also maybe a ruling on the opposition to class certification? Possibly there is a ruling on that. But we have denial of class certification. So maybe we need to add \"Court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\" That is a distinct ruling. Possibly also a ruling on \"Dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim\" is separate. Also maybe a ruling on the emergency motion - maybe the court granted in part and denied in part. That's one. Also maybe a ruling on the preliminary injunction? Already. Also maybe a ruling on the denial of the motion for preliminary injunctive relief? Already. But that is same as denial. It's a distinct ruling: \"Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\" That we have. Also maybe a ruling on \"Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification\" denial. We have that. So we might add the dismissal ruling.\n\nThus we need to add one more value: \"July 7, 2025 – Court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\" Provide evidence: from Order tokens 105-305: \"On July 7, 2025, this court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\" Also from Docket: similar.\n\nThus we need to append this value to Court_Rulings. The current checklist has 4 values. We will append one more. So we need to call append_checklist with patch key Court_Rulings extracted array with one entry. Provide evidence. Use evidence from Order (Tokens 105-305) and Docket (Entry 48). Provide text snippet.\n\nLet's craft evidence.\n\nFrom Order: \n\"On July 7, 2025, this court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\"\n\nFrom Docket: \n\"ORDER. For the reasons set forth in the court's 47 Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied and Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss is granted. Plaintiffs' 2 Motion t...\" That includes denial and dismissal? Actually Docket entry 48 includes denial and dismissal? It might not include dismissal phrase. But we have from Order.\n\nSo just use Order evidence. Maybe also Docket: \"ORDER. For the reasons set forth in the court's 47 Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied and Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss is granted.\" That doesn't mention dismissal. So maybe only Order.\n\nThus evidence: text from Order tokens 105-305: \"On July 7, 2025, this court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\"\n\nOk.

We should search documents for rulings patterns. The `search_document_regex` approach: pattern similar to earlier, but we need to search again maybe with refined pattern. Let's list unvisited docs: Class Action Complaint, Amicus brief, Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification, Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification, Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, etc. These may contain rulings? The rulings are usually in orders, memoranda, docket. But maybe some orders not yet read. The Order has two windows read: 105-305 and 549-749. The Order may contain more rulings further down. We may need to read more of Order. Also the Memorandum Opinion has only 20078-20258 read (1% coverage). Might contain rulings. The Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum in Opposition may contain rulings? Likely not.\n\nThe Docket has 5000-6500 read.

Let's search again for pattern across all docs. Use search_document_regex with pattern similar to earlier but maybe additional triggers like \"ordered\", \"dismissed\", \"denied\". Already used pattern earlier. But we need to find any matches not captured. We could just search again with same pattern across all documents, but we need to confirm that the initial search captured all? It found 17 matches across all docs. But we only extracted 5.

The user says 5 values extracted (3 from Order, 4 from Docket, 1 from Memorandum Opinion). Wait that's 8? The list says 5 values but describes 3+4+1=8. Likely duplication? Maybe some duplicates counted separately? We need to check if any missing rulings. Documents list: many unvisited documents may contain rulings. The search earlier found 7 matches; we may have captured some but maybe not all. We should verify that all distinct rulings are captured. The Court_Rulings should include any distinct decisions in the documents: e.g., from Order: denied preliminary injunctive relief, dismissed case. Also from Docket: denial of motion for preliminary injunction, grant of motion to dismiss, denial of motion to certify class as moot. From Memorandum Opinion: denial of preliminary injunction, grant of motion to dismiss, denial of class certification. Also from \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum in Opposition\" maybe other rulings? That document might contain a ruling? Actually it's a pleading, not a court order. But could include statements of case law? But the court ruling might be in that document? Search pattern found maybe no rulings. However, there could be other rulings in \"Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" - but that's a pleading too. But the \"Order\" already covers that. The \"Plaintiffs-Appellants' Emergency Motion for an Injunction Pending Appeal\" is a pleading. \"Class Action Complaint\" maybe no rulings. \"Amicus Brief\" no. \"Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" no. \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" no. So likely all rulings captured.\n\nBut we need to ensure each ruling is a separate entry with evidence and is self-contained. They have 5 values? Let's examine the ones extracted earlier: In step 5, 4 values were appended. In step 9, one more appended. So 5 total. But description says 3 from Order, 4 from Docket, 1 from Memorandum Opinion = 8. Maybe some duplicates: Order has 3 rulings: 1) denied preliminary injunctive relief, 2) dismissed case, 3) maybe something else. Docket has 4 rulings: denial of preliminary injunction, grant of motion to dismiss, denial of class certification as moot, maybe something else. Memorandum Opinion has 1: denial of preliminary injunction, grant of motion to dismiss, denial of class certification as moot. So 1 unique? But duplicates across documents because same ruling appears in multiple documents? Actually Order is the same as Docket? I'm not sure. The Order text gives denial of preliminary injunctive relief and dismissal. Docket gives denial of preliminary injunction, grant of motion to dismiss, denial of class certification as moot. Memorandum Opinion also gives same. So maybe the 5 values are: 1) Order denial of preliminary injunctive relief; 2) Order dismissal of case; 3) Docket denial of preliminary injunction; 4) Docket grant of motion to dismiss; 5) Docket denial of class certification as moot. But the Memorandum Opinion duplicates #3-5? So maybe they considered only 5 unique distinct rulings: Order's two rulings, Docket's two distinct rulings (grant of motion to dismiss and denial of class certification as moot) and Memorandum Opinion's denial of preliminary injunction? But that would be 5. But the description earlier said 3 from Order, 4 from Docket, 1 from Memorandum Opinion. That seems inconsistent.\n\nWe need to confirm all distinct rulings. Let's search for any other rulings in other documents. Search pattern for \"granted|denied|issued|made|certified|declined|ordered|approved|dismissed\" again maybe new matches not captured. But we already did search on all documents earlier. It found 7 matches across 7 documents. We may have missed some matches because we only looked at those. But the search earlier may not have captured all potential rulings because the regex might miss some. Let's search again with broader pattern. But the allowed action: we can call search_document_regex. Let's search again for \"denied|granted|dismissed|issued|made|certified|declined|ordered|approved\" with any following words \"motion|injunction|class certification|summary judgment|preliminary injunction\". Use pattern again. The earlier search found 7 matches. That likely covers all. So we probably have all rulings.\n\nBut we need to ensure no missing rulings: maybe \"Order\" has also \"issued a preliminary injunction\"? But reading the excerpt shows denial, not issuance. \"Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal\" maybe has \"court's July 7 Order denied Plaintiffs' motions for preliminary injunction and class certification and granted Defendants' motion to dismiss.\" That's captured.\n\nSo we have 5 values.\n\nBut the user wants to extract all distinct values. There are 5 distinct values, so we've covered.\n\nNow we need to decide next action. We could verify with get_checklist that all keys are complete. But we already have 5 values. Are we sure that all are extracted? We could verify by calling get_checklist to see if any missing (maybe there are duplicates we didn't add). But the state says 5 values. We need to ensure no missing distinct rulings.\n\nLet's examine each match we have evidence for:\n\n1. Order: \"denied Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief\" and \"dismissed the case\". That's 2 distinct rulings.\n\n2. Docket: \"Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied\" (that's same as earlier?), \"Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss is granted\", \"Plaintiffs' 2 Motion to Certify Class is denied as moot\". That's 3 distinct rulings.\n\n3. Memorandum Opinion: \"Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied\", \"Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is granted\", \"Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification is denied as moot\". These overlap with Docket rulings. So duplicates.\n\nThus the distinct rulings are:\n\n- Order: Denied preliminary injunctive relief.\n- Order: Dismissed case for lack of jurisdiction/failure to state claim.\n- Docket: Denied preliminary injunction.\n- Docket: Granted motion to dismiss.\n- Docket: Denied class certification as moot.\n\nBut note that Order's denial of preliminary injunctive relief might be same as Docket's denial of preliminary injunction. But they are distinct documents but same ruling. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Does \"distinct value\" refer to unique content or unique occurrence? Likely unique content: each distinct ruling. If same ruling appears in multiple documents, we might still treat them as same value? But the instruction says \"extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the same ruling appears in multiple docs, it's still the same distinct value. But we need to decide whether to duplicate. I think we should extract each unique ruling once. The earlier extraction took 5 values, which might be duplicates? Let's check: earlier list had 5 values: maybe they included duplicates? The step 9 says appended 1 key: Court_Rulings - value 1: \"July 7, 2025 – Court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\" That is one of the Order's two rulings. But earlier step 5 appended 4 values: likely those were the other rulings. Let's list from earlier: Step 5 appended 4 values. Not shown. Step 9 appended 1 more value. That totals 5. So likely the 4 values from step 5 were: 1) Denied preliminary injunctive relief, 2) Denied preliminary injunction (?), 3) Granted motion to dismiss, 4) Denied class certification. But duplicates? Hard to know.\n\nGiven we have 5 values, we need to check if any distinct ruling remains missing. Potential missing: The denial of preliminary injunctive relief from Order is covered. The dismissal of case is covered. The denial of preliminary injunction from Docket is covered. The grant of motion to dismiss from Docket is covered. The denial of class certification as moot from Docket is covered. That seems all distinct.\n\nThus we can decide to stop. But ensure that the checklist has no empty keys. There is only one key Court_Rulings, which is filled. So we can stop.\n\nThus action: \"stop\" with decision.\n\nWe need to output JSON: {\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All distinct Court_Rulings extracted\"}<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All distinct Court_Rulings extracted\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct Court_Rulings extracted", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5689, "completion_tokens": 1869, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
