Need to find whether plaintiffs are class action or individuals. From complaint, likely class action. We need evidence. We should search for \"class action\" or \"individual plaintiffs\". We have already saw in complaint that \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\". That indicates class action. Also \"Plaintiffs are non-profit organizations\". That indicates individual plaintiffs are organizations. We need to extract \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" and also maybe \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as non-profit organizations\". The requirement: extract every distinct value. So two values: Class Action, and Individual described as non-profit organizations. Are there other individual descriptions? Possibly individuals as in other documents. But within complaint, plaintiffs are non-profit organizations. So we can extract both.\n\nWe need evidence from documents. We have part of complaint that shows \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\" and \"Plaintiffs are non-profit organizations\". We need to read the relevant parts. We have seen complaint tokens 183-420 include \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR\". Also tokens 786-986 include \"Plaintiffs are non-profit organizations\". Let's confirm the snippet. The snippet provided shows \"Plaintiffs are non-profit organizations\". Good.\n\nThus we need to read those token ranges to capture evidence. We have those ranges already in coverage. We could just use the existing coverage. But we need to provide evidence with text. We can use the snippet from the search results? It might be enough. But to be safe, we should read the token ranges to get verbatim text. So we can call read_document for complaint with start_token 183, end_token 420 to capture the \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\" line. Then read 786-986 to capture \"Plaintiffs are non-profit organizations\". Actually 786-986 already captured snippet but we might read again maybe 786-986. But those are part of coverage. But we may need to read to provide evidence. We can read token 786-986 again. Or maybe we can read 1002-1046 to capture description. But we have snippet at 786-986 which includes \"Plaintiffs are non-profit organizations that were awarded federal grant funding.\" That is good.\n\nThus we need to produce two entries:\n\n1. Value: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" evidence: snippet and location.\n\n2. Value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as non-profit organizations\" evidence: snippet.\n\nBut the second description: \"non-profit organizations\" are not individuals. But the requirement says \"designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs (with a brief description of the individuals when applicable)\". In our case, plaintiffs are non-profit organizations, not individuals. So we can say \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as non-profit organizations\". That may be contradictory but we can interpret as individual plaintiffs (i.e., not a class). But the complaint states it is a class action. So maybe the second value is not needed. Wait, the key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". We need to extract whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs. So the key may have one value: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\". But the requirement says extract EVERY distinct value. So if there is a case where plaintiffs are individuals, we would extract that. But in this case, we only have one value: class action. The complaint indicates plaintiffs are non-profit organizations but that is part of the description of the plaintiffs, but they are part of the class. So we only need one value. But we might also note that plaintiffs are non-profit organizations. But that is not a separate value for the key; it's part of the description. So we should produce one entry: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". Should we include description? The spec: \"The extracted value should be formated as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\" So for class action, we just put that string. So we only need one entry.\n\nThus we only need to provide evidence for that. Use snippet from complaint: \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR\".\n\nAlso maybe there is mention in other documents that plaintiffs are class action. But we already have evidence.\n\nThus we need to append that entry. We'll use append_checklist. We need to provide evidence array with text, source_document, location.\n\nLet's read the snippet again to include exact text. The snippet from search result: it shows \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR\". Let's capture that. We can call read_document to get that snippet exactly. We'll read tokens 183-420. But we need \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR\" within that range. That snippet is part of the search. Let's read 183-420 to get the text. Then we can use that as evidence. Also maybe include \"Plaintiffs are non-profit organizations\" but that's not necessary for class action designation. But we can include it as extra evidence. But we can just use the class action line.\n\nThus we will perform read_document on complaint with 183-420. Then append_checklist.

They already extracted one value: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" from complaint. But we need to ensure all distinct values. We need to find if any documents have \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" or description. We saw searches that found many matches for \"Class Action\" and \"Individual\". The previous steps: step 7 search for \"individual plaintiffs\" found no matches. Step 8 stop. But maybe there are other documents with individual plaintiffs. Need to search for \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" or similar. However we might need to read other documents.\n\nWe need to ensure that we capture all distinct values. The current extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". If any other documents indicate individual plaintiffs, we must add them. So we should search for \"Individual\" or \"Individual plaintiffs\" again but maybe not found earlier because pattern might not match. Maybe the phrasing is \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as\". Let's search for \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual\". Also search \"Individual, described as\". Because the definition says \"or as individual plaintiffs (with a brief description of the individuals when applicable). The extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'. So we need to check if any doc has individual plaintiffs.\n\nThus we should perform a search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" or just \"Individual\" maybe. But earlier search for \"Individual\" found many matches but didn't produce any \"Individual\" status. Maybe the documents have \"individual plaintiffs\" but not \"Plaintiffs: Individual\". Also maybe the class action complaint has the heading \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\".\n\nLet's search for \"individual plaintiffs\" again but maybe case-insensitive with different context. Let's search for \"individual plaintiff\" again. Already did. Might be \"individual plaintiffs\" not found. Could be \"individual(s)\". But the search for \"individuals?\" found 5 matches in complaint. But those might be describing individuals.\n\nWe need to confirm if any document indicates individual plaintiffs. Let's search for \"individual plaintiff\" (case-insensitive). But we already did and found 0. Maybe the phrase \"individual\" appears but not \"Plaintiffs: Individual\". But we need to find if any document includes \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" or similar. Could be \"Plaintiff: Individual\" singular. Let's search for \"Plaintiff: Individual\". Also \"Plaintiff: Individual\" might appear.\n\nLet's issue a search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(Plaintiff[s]?: Individual|Plaintiffs? to Individual|Individual, described as)\" etc. But we can just search for \"Plaintiff: Individual\" and \"Plaintiffs: Individual\". Let's do that.\n\nWe might also need to read the complaint again to confirm if there's any mention of \"Individual\" status. But step 6 found 5 matches for \"individuals?\" in complaint. That could be describing the individuals. We need to check if the complaint includes a separate heading \"Plaintiffs: Individual\". But likely not. The complaint is a class action complaint, so it likely doesn't have individual status.\n\nThus we likely only have one value: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". But we need to double-check other documents. There are many documents: amicus brief, motions, etc. They might also refer to plaintiffs as class or individual. But the amicus brief may refer to \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" in context of the case. But let's search.\n\nWe can do a search for \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" across all. Also search for \"Plaintiff: Individual\". Also \"Individual, described as\". Let's do that.\n\nWe should also consider if a document might mention \"Individual plaintiffs\" as a heading like \"Individual plaintiffs\" but earlier search didn't find. However the previous search for \"individual plaintiffs\" returned 0. So likely no such heading.\n\nThus we might be done. But to be safe, we should search again. Let's perform search_document_regex on \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" and \"Plaintiff: Individual\" across all docs.\n\nAlso maybe \"Individual\" is used but not preceded by \"Plaintiff\". But we need the status, not just individuals. The status indicates whether plaintiffs proceed as a class or individual. So if a document indicates \"Plaintiff: Individual\" then we need that status.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"(Plaintiff[s]?: Individual|Individual, described as)\".

We currently have 1 value extracted: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" from complaint title. But we need to ensure if there are any other distinct values, such as individual plaintiffs or other status. The prior steps looked for \"individual plaintiff\" etc. But maybe in some documents there are references. We must systematically check remaining documents.\n\nWe have 11 documents. Some are unvisited: Docket, Order, Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. Others partially visited. We need to search for \"individual\" or \"individual plaintiffs\" etc. But we already did search for \"individual plaintiff\" patterns and found zero matches. But maybe the phrase \"individual\" appears but not \"individual plaintiffs\". But we need to capture \"Class Action\" or \"Individual\". The extraction requirement: \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\": designates whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs (with brief description). So we need to find if any documents state \"Individual\" or \"Individual plaintiffs\" or similar. The prior searches for \"individual\" found matches, but no \"individual plaintiff\" matches. But maybe there are references to \"individual\" but not as plaintiffs, like \"individual defendants\" etc. But we need to be careful.\n\nThe search for \"individual\" returned many matches in documents. That suggests there are individual references but not necessarily plaintiffs. We need to read those matches to see if they refer to plaintiffs individually. The last step 8 indicated stop because only distinct class action status identified is 'Plaintiffs: Class Action', no other documents provide a different status, and no evidence indicates Not Applicable.\n\nBut we need to verify whether there's any other status like \"Individual\" or \"Individual plaintiffs\" in any documents. We should double-check unvisited documents: Docket, Order, Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. These might contain the status. Also maybe the complaint's heading might mention \"Class Action\" but maybe the defendants' motion to dismiss might mention \"Individual\" when dismissing class action? But likely not.\n\nWe should search for pattern \"Plaintiff[s]?:\\s*Individual\" in all documents. Already did and found 0. But maybe the phrase \"Individual\" appears as part of \"Individual\" but not preceded by \"Plaintiff\". The requirement: \"designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs (with a brief description of the individuals when applicable).\" So we need to find if plaintiffs proceed as individual plaintiffs. That would likely be in a motion for individual claims or something. But maybe not present.\n\nTo be sure, we should search for \"individual\" patterns in the remaining unvisited documents. But we must choose one action. We could search all docs again with pattern \"Individual\" but we already did? Step 3 and 6 used search_document_regex on all docs for \"Individual\". Step 3 found 65 matches across many docs. But we didn't read them. We need to confirm if any of those matches refer to plaintiffs as individuals. The pattern \"individual\" is broad. We need to inspect matches. We can use search_document_regex again with pattern \"individual\" but with context_tokens? Already did. But we can ask search_document_regex with pattern \"Individual\" and context_tokens 200? But we might need to review matches. But the tool returns matches, not full text. We need to read them. But we can use search_document_regex again to get matches that include context. The prior search returned matches but not the context? It likely returned context. But we didn't get the output. We need to now use search_document_regex again to get matches for \"Individual\" across all docs, with context, to inspect. But the tool returns matches, we can then read them.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"Individual\" in the unvisited documents only. But maybe the matches were in visited docs. But we can still search all. We should not re-read previously visited token ranges. But search_document_regex will find matches across entire docs, but we need to read the text to confirm. But we should choose search_document_regex. Then after reading the matched context, we will append if needed.\n\nThus, next action: search_document_regex on all documents (doc_name: \"all\") with pattern \"Individual\" maybe with flags IGNORECASE. But we want to get context. We need top_k maybe 20. But we need to limit matches. But we can set top_k 20. But there were many matches. We need to inspect all matches to see if any refer to plaintiffs individually. But we might need to review all. But we can set context tokens high to capture enough. But we can also use separate search for \"individual plaintiffs\". But that returned 0 matches earlier. But we can search for \"Individual\" only again. But we need to be careful not to re-read already read tokens. But reading the matches may include repeated segments. But reading them again is fine.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex.\n\nWe need to provide doc_name \"all\", pattern \"Individual\" maybe with IGNORECASE. Provide top_k maybe 50. But we might get many. But we can set top_k 20. But we need to capture all. But maybe we set top_k 100? But tool might limit. We'll set top_k 20 and then we can iterate. But we might need more. But we can just do one search and then read matches. But we can do multiple searches if needed.\n\nWe need to be efficient. Let's do search_document_regex across all docs for pattern \"Individual\" with IGNORECASE, top_k 20, context_tokens=200. That should return 20 top matches. But if there are more, we may miss some. But we can then do subsequent search for remaining matches. But we can use offset? But no.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"Individual\" across all docs and get all matches - but tool default top_k 5. But we can set top_k 20. That might give us many. But we need to inspect all. But if some matches are in visited tokens, we might not need to read them. But we need to confirm if any mention plaintiffs individually.\n\nGiven the time, we will do search_document_regex for \"Individual\" across all docs. Then read the context for each match. Then decide if any new status.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Individual\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Individual", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4104, "completion_tokens": 1366, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The checklist requires distinct values: either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nWe currently have extraction of \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" from the complaint. But we need to confirm whether any other documents mention plaintiffs as individuals. For example, the Amicus briefs might mention \"individual plaintiffs\" but may still be part of the class. However the classification could be ambiguous. We need to search for \"individual plaintiffs\" or similar phrases. Step 13 had zero matches for \"individual plaintiffs\" but many matches for \"Individual\" alone. That may not be enough. Perhaps some documents have \"Class Action\" explicitly.

But we need to avoid false positives. Let's try a regex: \"Plaintiffs.*Individual\" with flags IGNORECASE. That might capture many. Alternatively, \"Plaintiffs\\s*:\\s*Individual\" but that's exact.\n\nBetter approach: Search for \"Plaintiffs.*Individual\" across all documents. This could return many lines.
