There may be other trial info in other docs like \"Class Action Complaint\" or \"Order\" or \"Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" etc. We need to search for trial-related terms like \"trial\", \"schedule\", \"court\", \"date\", \"hearing\". But we should focus on \"Trial\". Search again all docs for \"trial\" maybe we missed due to earlier search limited to 5 top matches? It returns 5 top matches per doc. But earlier we saw 4 matches across 4 docs. That may be all.\n\nThus maybe there are no trial details in corpus. But we need to confirm that no trial info exists; maybe the case hasn't had a trial yet. But we should check docket entries for \"hearing\" maybe considered trial? But requirement is \"Trials: any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" If no trial, we may set Not Applicable. But we must provide evidence that there is no trial.\n\nWe should search for \"trial\" again in all docs, maybe also \"trial\" with capital T but we already did. Could search for \"Trial\" again but already did. But we might search for \"trial\" in the remaining unvisited docs. But the search should catch all. We can double-check by searching for \"trial\" with ignorecase and in all docs, top_k 20. Let's do that.\n\nAlso consider \"hearing\" might be considered trial, but the checklist specifically \"Trials\". If no trial, we set Not Applicable. We need evidence: maybe a notice stating \"no trial has been scheduled\" or \"trial has been postponed\" or \"no trial\" phrase. We saw earlier step 8 search for \"no trial\" found 0 matches. So no explicit \"no trial\". Could be that there is no trial yet, but no explicit statement. In that case, maybe we cannot set Not Applicable because we don't have explicit evidence. According to Not Applicable Encoding rule: \"require explicit text or a dispositive posture supporting Not Applicable (e.g., dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree; 'no class certification sought' → class action items Not Applicable).\" So we need an explicit indication that no trial is scheduled or that the case is dismissed. We don't have that. So we should not mark Not Applicable until evidence.\n\nThus we might need to search for \"dismissed\" or \"dismissal\" that indicates no trial. For example \"dismissed\" or \"dismissed with prejudice\" may indicate no trial. But \"Trials\" refers to actual trial events, not dismissal. If dismissed, there is no trial, but may still be Not Applicable. But we need explicit evidence like \"dismissed with prejudice\".\n\nSearch for \"dismiss\" or \"dismissed\" maybe. But maybe there is a motion to dismiss but not dismissed yet. So we may not find.\n\nThus maybe we need to read more of documents to find trial information. Let's search for \"trial\" again with top_k 20 and context 200. Could reveal more matches.

The docket shows \"Order\" on 7/7/2025: denying preliminary injunction, granting dismissal. That may be an order, not a trial. The trial might be in \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" but not visited.\n\nAlso \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" is a brief, maybe includes trial date. But we haven't read it.\n\nWe should search for \"trial\" again but maybe earlier matches didn't include trial dates.

The trial may not yet be scheduled. Could be that there is no trial scheduled, and thus Trials key might be considered Not Applicable. But \"Not Applicable\" needs explicit evidence that no trial is scheduled or will occur. Maybe the docket indicates that the case was dismissed or settlement, but not trial.\n\nWe need to examine the docket lines near 48-49 where orders were issued: 48 Order on Motion to Dismiss, 49 Order on Motion to Certify Class. That indicates the case may not proceed to trial. So Trials might be Not Applicable. But we need evidence that trial will not occur. The docket shows dismissal. But is there any explicit statement \"no trial\" or \"case dismissed\" that indicates no trial? The docket entries include \"Order. For the reasons set forth in the court's 47 Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied and Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss is granted.

Alternatively, we can search for \"trial\" in the Order or other unvisited documents.\n\nWe can search all documents for \"trial\" again to confirm. But we might just rely on the evidence we have. But the Not Applicable requires explicit evidence. The docket evidence may be enough.\n\nBut the system may expect we confirm that there were no trials. The best evidence is that there is no docket entry for a trial and no mention of trial in documents. But the evidence we used is an order denying motion, not necessarily indicating no trial. But the order denies motion for preliminary injunction, but no trial. The docket entry 48 is an order, not a trial.

The prior steps have concluded that Trials are Not Applicable based on evidence from Docket (Order 48). But that may be wrong: Are there trial proceedings? The docket shows a status conference and a motion hearing on 6/26/2025. That is a hearing, not a trial. But trial might refer to trial of case. There may be no trial scheduled.\n\nWe need to ensure we haven't missed any trial information in other documents. The \"Memorandum Opinion\" may mention trial, but likely not. The \"Defendants' Opposition\" etc.\n\nThe user wants extraction of trials - any trials, scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, etc. Might be no trial. So Not Applicable is correct. But we must ensure evidence. The evidence extracted earlier: from Docket entry 48: \"Order. For the reasons set forth in the court's 47 Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiffs' 3 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied and Defendants' 27 Motion to Dismiss is granted. Plaintiffs' 2 Motion to Certify Class is denied as moot.\" That is about orders, not trial. But still no trial. That evidence may not directly say \"No trial\". But that indicates no trial? Not necessarily. But the docket shows no trial entry. There is a status conference and hearing. So maybe no trial yet.\n\nBut we need evidence that trial is not applicable. Might need to find a statement that \"no trial\" or \"trial postponed\" etc. But not found.\n\nWe could search for \"trial\" again in remaining documents to confirm there is no trial. But there were matches in earlier search, but those were just mentions of \"Trial\" in other contexts. They didn't indicate a trial.\n\nThus, the best is to set \"Trials\" Not Applicable with evidence. But we need to provide evidence that indicates trial is not applicable. The evidence earlier (entry 48) shows orders about motions, not a trial. That could be used as evidence that there was no trial. But maybe we need more explicit \"no trial\" evidence.\n\nWe could search for \"no trial\" pattern. Step 8 did search \"no trial\" and found none. So no explicit \"no trial\".\n\nBut we could search for \"trial\" in documents fully visited to confirm none mention a trial. But we already did search across all documents; it found 4 matches in various documents. Those matches didn't mention trial as a proceeding.\n\nThus, we can assume no trial. So Not Applicable is fine.\n\nBut need to check if other documents might mention trial. For completeness, we could read some of the documents partially visited: e.g., \"Memorandum Opinion\" (only 1% coverage). But maybe there's a mention of trial elsewhere. But given we have many tokens not read, we can't be 100% sure. But we need to follow procedure: we must read all documents that might contain trial info. The list shows many unvisited documents: Order, Amicus Brief, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss etc. They might mention trial. We should search for \"trial\" in those documents. We did a search across all documents and found 4 matches, but those were in documents we partially visited. The search results show 4 matches, but not necessarily all. It says found 4 total matches across 11 docs. So no more matches beyond those. So no other mentions of \"trial\". So we can assume no trial.\n\nThus, we can set Not Applicable. But we need to ensure we didn't miss any trial. The search earlier was executed many times. At step 21, it found 4 matches. So no other documents mention \"trial\". Good.\n\nThus, we can finalize.\n\nWe must issue `stop`. But we need to ensure that we have appended the Not Applicable entry.\n\nWe already did `update_checklist` at step 18. So we have Trials marked Not Applicable. The current status shows Trials marked Not Applicable.\n\nThus, we can stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All checklist items processed; Trials marked Not Applicable with supporting evidence.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items processed; Trials marked Not Applicable with supporting evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7540, "completion_tokens": 855, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
