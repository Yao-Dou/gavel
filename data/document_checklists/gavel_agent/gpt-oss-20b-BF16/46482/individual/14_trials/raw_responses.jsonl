We have some matches in Defendants' Motion to Stay Proceedings. Those matches mention trial court, stay of proceedings, etc. But we need to identify trial information: scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, rulings. The matches likely describe the concept of trial court staying proceedings, not an actual trial event. There may be other documents like Complaint, etc. We should search for \"Trial\" pattern in other documents. Use search_document_regex over all documents for \"Trial\". Already did step 2 and 3 but only found 3 matches in that motion. That may be all. But maybe \"Trial\" appears in other docs but not captured because search regex limited to \"Trial\" exactly. Could be \"Trial\" appears in \"Trial of the defendant\" etc. But we should search again across all docs to confirm. The search already did across all 9 docs and found only 3 matches in that one doc. So other docs have no 'Trial'? Might have \"trial\" but maybe not exactly. Could be \"Trial\" inside \"Trial of\" maybe present. But if not found, maybe there are no trial info beyond that motion. However, the Trials checklist item may capture trial scheduling etc. But if no trial occurred, maybe Not Applicable. But the motion references trial court and stay. The question: is that considered trial info? The checklist says: \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" The motion includes discussion of trial court, stay of proceedings, but not actual trial. So maybe no actual trial. But we need to decide if Not Applicable. But we need evidence. We have no evidence of trial date or outcomes. The motion references trial court but not a specific trial. So we can mark Not Applicable: \"No trial scheduled or held.\" But need evidence. We can cite the motion, but it doesn't state there is no trial. The best evidence is that no trial is referenced anywhere else. But we need explicit text or dispositive posture supporting Not Applicable. The document shows \"trial court may ... stay proceedings\" but not an actual trial event. The lack of any trial info might be evidence. But does that count? The instruction: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence (e.g., dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree; 'no class certification sought' → class action items Not Applicable).\" So we need explicit evidence that no trial. The motion about staying proceedings might be argument that trial is being stayed. But still a trial exists but not scheduled? The term \"trial court\" indicates a court that conducts trials. But we don't have scheduling. There's no trial date. But the motion may be about staying proceedings, not about a specific trial date. So maybe the trial hasn't started yet. We could say no trial scheduled. But that's not explicit. We could interpret that the motion is to stay proceedings, thus delaying the trial. So we have a trial but not scheduled. The checklist expects scheduling info. We might not have that. However, we could extract the information that \"trial court\" exists and that proceedings are being stayed pending independent proceedings. That could be considered trial info: that a trial court may stay proceedings pending resolution of independent proceedings. But that is not a specific trial scheduling.\n\nProbably the best is to extract the information from those matches: that the trial court may stay proceedings pending independent proceedings. That is a trial info: \"Trial court may stay proceedings pending independent proceedings.\" We can capture that as a trial info entry.\n\nLet's extract each match as separate entry, but we might combine? The matches are overlapping and similar. But we have 3 matches, but they are similar content. We can extract unique values: The mention that \"A trial court may, with propriety, find it is efficient for its own docket and the fairest course for the parties to enter a stay of an action before it, pending resolution of independent proceedings which bear upon the case.\" That's a \"trial\" info: the trial court may stay proceedings.\n\nAlso the other matches talk about trial court, appellate, etc. Could extract: \"To do otherwise would be tantamount to having one trial court sit as an appellate court, reviewing the decision of another trial court.\" That's also a trial info: concept of trial court behavior.\n\nWe might need to extract multiple entries: one for trial court stay, one for appellate trial court. They are distinct.\n\nThus we can append two entries. We need evidence: the text snippet, doc name, location tokens. We have tokens ranges: 692-892, 944-1168. We'll use those.\n\nSo we need to call append_checklist with key Trials and two entries.\n\nLet's craft evidence: For first entry: snippet from match 1. For second: snippet from match 2 or 3. Use match 2 maybe.\n\nWe need to include evidence array with text, source_document, location. Location could be page? We don't have page numbers. We can use token range.

The task: extract ALL distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. We need to search for trial info in all documents.\n\nWe have already found trial references in the motion. But likely the Complaint mentions trial? Possibly the case will go to trial; maybe scheduled trial dates in docket. Also the memorandum opinion might include trial date. The order may include trial date. The plaintiffs' motion may mention trial. So we need to search all documents for trial information.\n\nWe should use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern like \"trial\". But we already did search for \\bTrial\\b and found only in the motion. However other documents might have \"Trial\" but not as a word? Maybe \"trial\" appears in capitalized or lower-case. We did case-insensitive search but still only found in motion. But that may not capture all trial info if not the word \"trial\" but e.g., \"trial court\" or \"court of law\" but not \"trial\". But we might need to search for \"trial date\", \"trial scheduled\", etc. Maybe \"Trial\" appears but we didn't find due to scanning only 5 matches.

It returned same results.\n\nMaybe the docket has \"Trial\" spelled differently? Let's search in docket for \"Trial\" again? The search in docket earlier returned 0 matches. So docket may not mention trial. The other documents might not contain the word \"Trial\" but may mention \"court\" and \"date\" for trial. But the task says \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" So if a document indicates \"the trial is scheduled for June 15\", that is a trial info. The word \"trial\" might appear.\n\nBut we might need to search for \"trial\" across all docs again. We did. Only motion had 3 matches. So maybe there is no other trial info. But to be safe, we should open other documents to confirm. We can read the Complaint and see if it mentions trial. But that document has 15k tokens. We might read sections relevant to trial.

So likely other documents don't contain \"trial\" word.\n\nBut maybe the docket contains \"Trial\" but the earlier search returned 0. So maybe docket doesn't mention trial.\n\nThus, only the motion contains trial info. But the checklist might require all distinct values. We have two distinct values extracted. Are there more distinct values? Perhaps the motion contains more distinct statements about trial? We might capture each distinct statement. There's mention of \"A trial court may, with propriety, find it is efficient...\" and \"To do otherwise would be tantamount to having one trial court sit as an appellate court...\". We captured those two. Are there other distinct statements about trial in the motion? Let's re-examine the matches. In the motion, we had 3 matches: match 1 includes the first statement; match 2 includes the second statement; match 3 duplicates the second statement. So only two distinct statements. So extraction complete for that doc.\n\nBut the question: \"Extract the trial information from the legal documents.\" It might include trial dates, outcomes, rulings. But if none appear, then all trial info is extracted. But we should confirm if any other doc contains trial info.\n\nWe can search for pattern \"trial\" ignoring case in all 9 documents. We did. Only motion found. So likely no other trial info.\n\nWe should check if the docket contains \"Trial\" but maybe not. But we can read the docket to ensure. But reading whole docket 4k tokens is okay. But we might consider reading the first part.\n\nBut we can also search for \"date\" or \"scheduled\" or \"trial\" in docket. But if we assume no trial info, we can stop. But to be safe, we can search docket for \"Trial\" again. We did and got 0. So no trial.\n\nThus, all trial info extracted. But we should confirm that the checklist expects all distinct values. We have 2. So we can stop.\n\nBut before stopping, we need to verify that all keys are filled or not applicable. We have 1 key: Trials. It has 2 values. So it's complete. No other keys.
