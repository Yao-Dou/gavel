We need to extract parties.\n\nWe have partial coverage 0-2000 tokens, which includes list of plaintiffs and defendants. We need all distinct parties. The Complaint snippet shows:\n\nPlaintiffs: National Academy of Education (NAEd), National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME). Also \"and\" lists? It lists \"Plaintiffs, vs. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, LINDA MCMAHON as Secretary of Education\" as defendants. So defendants: Department of Education, Linda McMahon (in official capacity Secretary). Also maybe others? But we only read 0-2000; maybe more parties later (like national center etc). But we should search for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" patterns. The earlier search returned 0 matches because pattern didn't match due to formatting, but we can search for \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" as separate words.\n\nWe should search all documents for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" patterns.\n\nBetter: use search_document_regex for pattern \"Plaintiff(s)?|Defendant(s)?\" maybe capturing lines. But we need to capture the description of parties. The complaint gives description paragraphs for each plaintiff. We need to extract each party description. Should we include \"Plaintiff: National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a ...\". And \"Plaintiff: National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME) is a ...\". Also \"Defendant: Department of Education (the Department) is ...\"? The description of Department might not be in the snippet but maybe later. But there is description of Defendants earlier? The snippet didn't include description of Department. But maybe in later part of complaint.\n\nWe can search for \"Defendant\" pattern to get description lines. Since we haven't visited those, we should search all documents. Let's search for pattern \"Defendant[s]?\" with context. Let's use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern \"(Plaintiff|Defendant)\". But we saw earlier it returned 0 matches. Because maybe the text has line breaks and formatting unusual. Let's try pattern \"(Plaintiff|Defendant)[^\\n]*\" with DOTALL? Might find lines. But maybe the pattern didn't match due to missing colon. Let's search for \"Plaintiff\" alone. Use pattern \"Plaintiff\" maybe would match. But earlier search returned 0 matches. So maybe the text uses \"Plaintiffs,\" with plural, and \"Defendants.\" So we search for \"Plaintiffs\" or \"Defendants\". Use pattern \"(Plaintiffs|Defendants)\". Let's try that.\n\nAlternatively, we can read more of Complaint beyond 2000 tokens to capture descriptions. We can read 2000-4000 tokens. That might contain the rest of parties description. Let's do read_document for Complaint tokens 2000-4000. That will give more context. The snippet might have lines \"Plaintiff National Academy...\" etc. That is within 2000-4000 tokens? The snippet shows at page 5 etc; maybe within 4000. Let's read 2000-4000.\n\nAfter reading, we can then append parties.\n\nWe have to consider we might miss some parties if not all described.

We have already seen in Complaint list of plaintiffs and defendants. Probably also other documents might list parties. But our task: extract all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. So we need all parties descriptions: each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and roles.\n\nFrom Complaint we have:\n\nPlaintiffs: National Academy of Education (NAEd) and National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME). Also maybe others? The Complaint lists \"Plaintiffs,\" then the list of plaintiffs. It has two: NAEd and NCME. Are there other plaintiffs? Let's scroll further. The Complaint has \"Plaintiffs\" and \"Defendants\" list. It lists DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, LINDA MCMAHON. That's two defendants. Also other defendants: the Department, the Secretary. Also maybe \"United States Department of Education\" and \"Linda McMahon\". So we need separate entries for each unique party. The extracted value format: 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\n\nWe need description: likely include organization name and maybe role. The description in text: e.g., \"National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization ...\". We can use that. Also \"National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME) is a professional organization ...\". For defendants: Department of Education: \"United States Department of Education is a Cabinet agency headquartered in Washington, D.C., responsible for oversight ...\". For Linda McMahon: \"Linda McMahon is the U.S. Secretary of Education and is sued in her official capacity.\"\n\nAlso maybe \"Department of Education\" is referenced earlier as \"DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\". That is same entity. So parties: NAEd, NCME, Department of Education, Linda McMahon.\n\nAdditionally, maybe the Complaint includes \"NATIONAL ACADEMY OF EDUCATION\" as plaintiff, and \"NATIONAL COUNCIL ON MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATION\" as plaintiff. So we should create entries for those two with their description.\n\nWe need to produce evidence for each. We have the text from Complaint (tokens 0-4000). We need to capture verbatim snippet for each. For NAEd: we have snippet lines 12-15: \"Plaintiff National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization...\" We should capture that snippet.\n\nFor NCME: snippet lines 13-... \"Plaintiff National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME) is a professional organization founded in 1938...\"\n\nFor Department: snippet lines 14-15: \"Defendant United States Department of Education is a Cabinet agency headquartered in Washington, D.C., responsible for oversight...\"\n\nFor Linda McMahon: snippet lines 15-16: \"Defendant Linda McMahon is the U.S. Secretary of Education and is sued in her official capacity.\"\n\nWe need to specify location: maybe page number: \"Page 1 of 34\" etc. We can give location as \"Page 1\" for NAEd and NCME, \"Page 6\" for Department, \"Page 6\" for McMahon too. But the snippet for Department and McMahon is on page 6, as per text. We can note location \"Page 6 of 34\".\n\nWe need to include evidence array with these fields.\n\nWe should append these entries.

For instance, the Defendants' Motion to Stay Proceedings might list all defendants. Let's read some of Docket or Motion. Could be many parties like \"United States\" as a party? But maybe the complaint is from NAEd and NCME against Dept of Education and Linda McMahon. So parties are those four.\n\nCheck if \"United States\" is a party?

Are there any other parties? The complaint had 4. The docket also mentions \"U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\" as defendants? There's mention of summons to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General. That might count as parties? They are defendants too. Also \"All Plaintiffs\" and \"All Defendants\" appear. But we need descriptions. The docket might not have description. We might need to search for other documents, e.g., Defendants' Motion to Stay Proceedings might mention parties. But we have only 4 parties already: 2 plaintiffs, 2 defendants. Is there any other? The docket also has \"All Plaintiffs\" and \"All Defendants\" but those are generic. The complaint likely contains all parties. But we might need to confirm if there are other defendants like U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General. The complaint didn't mention them? The complaint had only 2 defendants. The docket mentions summons to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General.\n\nWe need to extract every distinct value. We should search for \"U.S. Attorney\" patterns. Let's search for \"U.S. Attorney\" in all documents. Also \"U.S. Attorney General\". Use regex.

But we need to extract all distinct values of Who_are_the_Parties from all documents. The complaint had 4 parties. But there might be more parties in other documents, e.g., Docket lists parties, maybe other documents mention other parties. We need to find all parties. The docket shows \"Case 1:25-cv-01266-TNM\" etc. It lists events: \"COMPLAINT against All Defendants ( Filing fee $ 405 receipt number ADCDC-11640852) filed by NATIONAL ACADEMY OF EDUCATION, NATIONAL COUNCIL ON MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATION.\" So parties: Plaintiffs: National Academy of Education, National Council on Measurement in Education. Defendants: U.S. Department of Education, Linda McMahon. Also maybe other defendants: U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney General? The docket shows summons to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General. So those are defendants too. Also maybe \"All Defendants\" includes those. Also \"All Plaintiffs\" includes the two plaintiffs. So parties list: Plaintiffs: National Academy of Education, National Council on Measurement in Education. Defendants: United States Department of Education, Linda McMahon, U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney General.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event: \"Notice of Appearance by Dimitar Georgiev-Remmel on behalf of All Defendants\". That indicates Dimitar Georgiev-Remmel is an attorney representing defendants.\n\nAlso \"Notice of Appearance by Samuel Spital on behalf of All Plaintiffs\". So attorneys: Samuel Spital (representing plaintiffs), Allison Scharfstein, Lily Grisafi, Colin Burke, Morenike Fajana, etc. But parties likely are the actual parties, not attorneys. But the requirement: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" So we should include attorneys? The typical parties are plaintiffs/defendants. Attorneys are representatives, not parties. But might still be considered parties? The extraction says \"descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" So we probably only list plaintiffs and defendants, not attorneys.\n\nThus we need to extract all parties from all documents. We have 4 from Complaint. But we also need to confirm if there are other plaintiffs or defendants in other documents. The docket shows same parties. There might be more defendants like \"U.S. Attorney\" and \"U.S. Attorney General\" but these are likely not parties but officials. But they appear as defendants in summons. In the complaint they might be named? Let's search the complaint for \"U.S. Attorney\" or \"U.S. Attorney General\". The complaint text might not include them. We saw no pattern earlier. But the docket lists summons to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General. This indicates they are defendants. So we should include them as defendants.\n\nAlso \"All Defendants\" includes those. The complaint might list them as defendants. But we didn't see them in the extracted 4 values. So we need to find them. Let's search the Complaint for \"United States Attorney\" or \"U.S. Attorney\". We can use search_document_regex. Also search for \"U\\.S\\. Attorney\". Already did that on all documents, found matches in Docket only, not in Complaint. So complaint did not include them. But the complaint might have \"United States Department of Education\" only. So the other defendants may not be in the complaint; they appear in docket because they were added later? But the assignment says extract parties from the legal documents. So we should extract from all documents. The docket lists them. So we should include them.\n\nAlso maybe the memorandum or order may mention other parties? But likely not.\n\nThus we need to extract from Docket: Plaintiffs: National Academy of Education (NAEd), National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME). Defendants: United States Department of Education, Linda McMahon, U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney General. Also possibly \"All Defendants\" is a placeholder but we need to list individual defendants.\n\nAlso the docket lists \"Notice of Appearance by Dimitar Georgiev-Remmel on behalf of All Defendants\". So Dimitar Georgiev-Remmel is attorney for defendants. But not a party.\n\nAlso \"Notice of Appearance by Samuel Spital on behalf of All Plaintiffs\" - attorney for plaintiffs.\n\nThus we will extract these 6 parties.\n\nWe might need to confirm if U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General are indeed parties. The docket entry \"SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\" indicates they are defendants. So we include them.\n\nThus we need evidence snippets from Docket.\n\nWe saw in the docket snippet:\n\n- \"SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, LINDA MCMAHON\" earlier. In the docket snippet we saw:\n\n```\n3 | 2025-04-24 | SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, LINDA MCMAHON. (Attachments: # 1 Notice and Consent)(zmtm) (Entered: 04/24/2025)\n```\n\nAlso later:\n\n```\n12 | 2025-04-25 | SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General (mg) (Entered: 04/25/2025)\n```\n\nThus we have evidence.\n\nAlso for plaintiffs: The docket entry \"COMPLAINT against All Defendants... filed by NATIONAL ACADEMY OF EDUCATION, NATIONAL COUNCIL ON MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATION.\" So evidence.\n\nThus we need to append these 6 parties.\n\nWe already have 4 parties appended. We need to append 2 more: U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney General. Actually we also need to confirm if we need to append \"U.S. Attorney\" and \"U.S. Attorney General\" as separate parties. The docket says \"U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\" as two parties. So we need to add those.\n\nAlso check if any other parties like \"All Defendants\" includes maybe \"U.S. Attorney\" and \"U.S. Attorney General\" only. So 6 total.\n\nThus we need to produce an append_checklist with 2 new entries for the key \"Who_are_the_Parties\".\n\nBut we also need to ensure that we don't duplicate existing entries. The existing entries are the 4 parties from Complaint. We need to add the new ones.\n\nThus perform append_checklist with patch key \"Who_are_the_Parties\", extracted values 2.\n\nWe need evidence: text snippet from Docket for each.\n\nWe can use the snippet from the docket we saw earlier. For U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General: text \"SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\". We can provide that.\n\nFor completeness, we might also include evidence for the plaintiffs? But those already appended earlier. So we don't need to reappend.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.\n\nWe need to provide for each value:\n\n- value: \"Defendant: U.S. Attorney\" or \"Defendant: U.S. Attorney General\"? The format: 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'. The description can include role/offices. For U.S. Attorney, description: \"U.S. Attorney\" (maybe mention 'representing the U.S. federal government'). But we can just provide \"Defendant: U.S. Attorney\" - but we might want to include role. Let's read the snippet: \"SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\". That indicates both. So we can provide each as separate entries: \"Defendant: U.S. Attorney\" and \"Defendant: U.S. Attorney General\".\n\nNow we need to provide evidence objects: text snippet, source_document = \"Docket\", location maybe \"Event 12 | 2025-04-25 | SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\".\n\nWe also need to provide location for each. For the U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General, the snippet covers both. It's okay to provide one evidence for both? But each value requires evidence. We can provide same evidence text for each.\n\nThus we need to produce the JSON call.\n\nLet's produce:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Who_are_the_Parties\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: U.S. Attorney\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"Event 12 | 2025-04-25 | SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: U.S. Attorney General\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"Event 12 | 2025-04-25 | SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThus next action append_checklist.\n\nWe must ensure that we are not missing other parties. Let's double-check docket snippet for plaintiffs. The docket entry \"COMPLAINT against All Defendants ( Filing fee $ 405 receipt number ADCDC-11640852) filed by NATIONAL ACADEMY OF EDUCATION, NATIONAL COUNCIL ON MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATION.\" That includes both plaintiffs. But we already have them. They are \"Plaintiff: National Academy of Education\" and \"Plaintiff: National Council on Measurement in Education\". Already extracted.\n\nThus we are done.\n\nBut we also might have \"All Defendants\" as a party. But we likely don't include \"All Defendants\" as a party. Not needed.\n\nThus we proceed.\n\nWe only need to append the two new entries.\n\nThus call append_checklist.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Who_are_the_Parties\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: U.S. Attorney\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"Event 12 | 2025-04-25 | SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: U.S. Attorney General\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"Event 12 | 2025-04-25 | SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Who_are_the_Parties", "extracted": [{"value": "Defendant: U.S. Attorney", "evidence": [{"text": "SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Event 12 | 2025-04-25 | SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General"}]}, {"value": "Defendant: U.S. Attorney General", "evidence": [{"text": "SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Event 12 | 2025-04-25 | SUMMONS (2) Issued Electronically as to U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7755, "completion_tokens": 2468, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Likely there are more parties: e.g., other defendants like \"Department of Education\" and \"Linda McMahon\". But we already have those from Complaint. Also other plaintiffs? The Complaint lists Plaintiffs: National Academy of Education, National Council on Measurement in Education. And Defendants: Department of Education, Linda McMahon. Also possibly others like \"Department of Education\" maybe as a single entity? Already captured. Also \"All Defendants\" maybe. Also \"All Plaintiffs\". But we should capture distinct parties. We need to read other documents for any additional parties not already captured. The search results show matches in many documents. But we already captured 6 values: presumably 4 from Complaint: likely Plaintiff: National Academy of Education, Plaintiff: National Council on Measurement in Education, Defendant: Department of Education, Defendant: Linda McMahon. The two from Docket: maybe \"All Plaintiffs\" and \"All Defendants\" or \"National Academy of Education\" etc. But we need to confirm. The list says 6 values: 4 from Complaint, 2 from Docket. So maybe the Docket list includes \"All Plaintiffs\" and \"All Defendants\" as generic. But we should consider if these are separate entities or not. The instruction says: provide distinct values. So \"All Plaintiffs\" is a distinct value but maybe we treat it as a description. However, we might want to only include actual named parties. The docket entries include \"All Defendants\" and \"All Plaintiffs\". But are those distinct from the specific ones? They are a generic description. The instruction says: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" So \"All Plaintiffs\" is a description. Could be included. But maybe they want all distinct values. We currently have 6. We need to verify if any more parties appear elsewhere.\n\nSearch for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" patterns again but maybe we missed. We can search for \"Plaintiff:\" pattern? But the documents don't use that exact format. They use \"Plaintiffs\" and \"Defendants\" headings. We might search for \"Plaintiffs,\" and \"Defendants.\" But we can search for \"Plaintiffs,\" or \"Defendants,\". But we already used \"Plaintiff|Defendant\" pattern which found 80 matches across documents. But we didn't parse them all. The Complaint had matches. The other documents likely mention the same parties but no new ones.\n\nAlso there might be \"United States\" etc. But likely not new parties.\n\nWe should read the 'First Amended Complaint' fully visited shows maybe no new parties. The Docket shows maybe \"All Defendants\" and \"All Plaintiffs\" which we already have. The other documents may have the same parties.\n\nThus the list of parties may be complete. However, we should double-check the Complaint for any other parties like \"Department of Education\" and \"Linda McMahon\" already captured. Also maybe \"National Academy of Education\" and \"National Council on Measurement in Education\" as two plaintiffs. But maybe there's also \"National Council on Measurement in Education\" as a separate entity. Already captured? The 4 values from Complaint likely include those 4. So we have all.\n\nWe need to ensure we have all distinct values. The list of 6 values: might include \"Plaintiff: National Academy of Education\" (1), \"Plaintiff: National Council on Measurement in Education\" (2), \"Defendant: Department of Education\" (3), \"Defendant: Linda McMahon\" (4). The two from Docket maybe \"All Plaintiffs\" (5), \"All Defendants\" (6). But these are generic. But they might be considered distinct values.\n\nWe should check the Docket entries for \"All Plaintiffs\" and \"All Defendants\". In the Docket snippet, we see:\n\n- \"All Defendants\" in line: \"COMPLAINT against All Defendants\" etc.\n- \"All Plaintiffs\" in line: \"ENTERED IN ERROR.....NOTICE OF RELATED CASE by All Plaintiffs.\" So those two generic items.\n\nThus we have 6 distinct values.\n\nBut are there any others? Maybe \"Department of Education\" is a separate entity from \"U.S. Attorney\" as defendant? But we only have \"U.S. Attorney\" and \"U.S. Attorney General\" captured earlier from Docket. Wait we saw earlier appended 2 values: Defendant: U.S. Attorney and Defendant: U.S. Attorney General. Actually from step 11, the appended 1 key had 2 values: Defendant: U.S. Attorney, Defendant: U.S. Attorney General. That was from Docket. So we have total 6 values: 4 from Complaint, 2 from Docket. But the 2 from Docket are U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General. So the 6 values are: 4 from Complaint (likely the named parties) + U.S. Attorney + U.S. Attorney General. So we have 6 distinct values: maybe:\n\n1. Plaintiff: National Academy of Education\n2. Plaintiff: National Council on Measurement in Education\n3. Defendant: Department of Education\n4. Defendant: Linda McMahon\n5. Defendant: U.S. Attorney\n6. Defendant: U.S. Attorney General\n\nThus we have 6 values. Are there any other parties like \"Department of Education\" appears as a defendant too but we have that.\n\nThus maybe the list is complete.\n\nHowever, we might double-check if there are any other parties like \"Department of Education\" appears also as a defendant separately? Already counted.\n\nAlso \"National Academy of Education\" might be in the docket as \"NATIONAL ACADEMY OF EDUCATION\" again. But that's same.\n\nThus no new parties.\n\nBut to be safe, we can search for \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" in the remaining documents: Memorandum Opinion, Order, etc. But they likely repeat the same parties. But we can confirm quickly by searching in the whole corpus for \"Plaintiffs,\" and \"Defendants.\" But we already did search for \"Plaintiff|Defendant\" and got 80 matches, but we didn't parse all. But we could search for \"National Academy of Education\" etc. But we assume we have all.\n\nThus we can stop? But we must ensure any missing distinct values. Could there be any other parties like \"Department of Education\" also \"Department of Education\" might be repeated but not new.\n\nGiven that the extraction progress says 6 values extracted, and the keys with values: 1/1. So no empty keys. So we are done.\n\nBut we might need to confirm that all extracted values have evidence. The appended earlier had evidence for each value. But we might need to check if the 4 values from Complaint had evidence. The earlier step 6 appended 4 values for 1 key: Who_are_the_Parties. That likely had evidence. The 2 values from Docket were appended in step 11. That had evidence.

Need to check if all parties are captured. From complaint we have plaintiffs: National Academy of Education (NAEd), National Council on Measurement in Education? Wait the complaint shows \"NATIONAL ACADEMY OF EDUCATION, 500 5th Street NW ... and NATIONAL COUNCIL ON MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATION COMPLAINT\". Actually the \"Plaintiffs\" listed: National Academy of Education and National Council on Measurement in Education? The complaint text earlier shows \"Plaintiffs, vs. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION and LINDA MCMAHON\". So we need to extract all distinct parties: Plaintiffs: National Academy of Education (NAEd), National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME?). The actual name is \"NATIONAL COUNCIL ON MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATION\". Defendants: Department of Education, Linda McMahon (Secretary of Education). Also from docket, we have U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General? In step 11, they appended \"Defendant: U.S. Attorney\" and \"Defendant: U.S. Attorney General\". Those are also parties. Also maybe other parties appear in other documents (e.g., the \"Defendants' Motion to Stay Proceedings\" includes \"Defendants Department of Education and Linda McMahon, in her official capacity as Education Secretary\" - same as earlier.\n\nThus total parties: Plaintiffs: National Academy of Education, National Council on Measurement in Education. Defendants: Department of Education, Linda McMahon, U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney General. That's 6 values. The current extraction has 6 values: 4 from Complaint, 2 from Docket. Which 4? Probably the two plaintiffs and two defendants (Dept and Linda). The two from Docket are U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General. So all 6 are present. So extraction is complete. Check if any other parties appear elsewhere: maybe \"National Council on Measurement in Education\" appears in other docs but already captured. So checklist complete.\n\nThus next action should be `stop`.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All parties have been extracted with evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All parties have been extracted with evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12552, "completion_tokens": 472, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
