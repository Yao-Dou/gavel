The term list might be in the orders with \"decreed\" or \"judgment\" or \"injunction\" language. We should search for \"decree\" and \"order\" and \"decreed\" etc. We have partial coverage: we saw one match in Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification around tokens 1639-1839. That snippet included:\n\n\"It is, accordingly, hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED:\n1. This action shall be maintained as a class action ...\"\n\nWe need to extract each term as separate value. Terms are substantive obligations. The snippet likely continues with a list of terms. We need to read more of that order to extract all terms.

We should read more tokens from that document, maybe the entire document or a large chunk to capture all decree terms.\n\nAlso other documents like Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction might contain a decree. We should search in those documents as well. We could search for \"decreed\" or \"decree\" in those orders. But first, let's read more of the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification to get the full list. We'll read from token 1800 to maybe 2000 or until end. The doc is 1992 tokens. We have 10% coverage (i.e., ~199 tokens). Actually 10% coverage of 1992 tokens is ~200 tokens. We have 1639-1839 (200 tokens). So we need to read the rest: maybe tokens 1839-1992.

Also \"Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement\" might contain decree terms but maybe settlement. But we only need terms ordered by the court; any terms that appear only in settlement unless incorporated.\n\nThe best approach: search for \"decree\" pattern in all documents. Already did but only 4 matches. Those matches might include decree terms. But we may need to read more around them. Additionally, maybe \"decree\" appears in other documents not captured due to limited context. We can search again for \"decree\" with more context. Or search for \"ORDERED\" or \"DECREED\" or \"DECREED:\" pattern.\n\nBut the pattern search earlier returned some matches, but might have missed some because of context. Let's search again for \"decree\" with broader context tokens. Also maybe search for \"DECREED:\" or \"DECREED\" case-insensitive.

We have seen some matches but need to find all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" refers to substantive obligations ordered by the court: consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions that are court orders. So we need to identify all such terms in the documents. We have some partial reading: Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification includes \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) and ...\". But that is a decree but maybe not a \"term\" specifically. Possibly the order lists obligations like \"The action shall be maintained as a class action\" maybe not a term. We need to find terms like \"shall be maintained\", \"class action\", etc. We need to see if there are other orders: maybe \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction\", etc. We should search for \"DECREED\" or \"DECREED:\" or \"ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED\" etc.\n\nWe have seen \"DECREED\" in Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification. But we must extract terms: maybe the obligations are enumerated as bullet points in the order. The snippet only shows the start of the order. Likely more details follow beyond token 1992. We need to read further to capture the rest of the decree terms. The current view tokens 1639-1992 covers the start. We need to read subsequent tokens. Let's read more of the order. We should read next chunk, maybe tokens 1992-3000.\n\nAlso check other orders: \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" might contain obligations. \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction\" likely contains obligations. \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification\" contains obligations. \"Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement\" might contain terms if it's a decree.\n\nAlso \"Amended Permanent Injunction\" might contain terms.\n\nWe need to find all distinct terms of decrees across all documents. That is likely a list of obligations, each might be a clause, e.g., \"The defendants shall not engage in X\", \"The court orders that Y\". We need to extract each distinct value. We need to read all orders.\n\nWe can search for \"DECREED\" across all documents to get matches. Already did search for \"DECREED\" and found only one match. Maybe other orders don't contain \"DECREED\" but still contain \"ORDERED\" etc. We need to find all decrees. The term \"DECREED\" might be used only in that order. But other orders might use \"ORDERED\" or \"DECREED\" within. Let's search for \"ORDERED\" or \"ADJUDGED AND DECREED\" maybe.\n\nBut given the complexity, we might need to read many documents. The instruction: choose one action per turn. So we need to decide which document to read next. We should likely read the next portion of the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification to capture all its terms. That seems necessary.\n\nThus we will do read_document on that order, start_token 1992 to maybe 3000? The document length is 1992 tokens, so maybe 1992 is end. Actually the order is 1992 tokens total. The read covered 1639-1992, which is the remaining portion. So we have fully read that order. So no more content there.\n\nThus we need to read other orders. Let's search for \"DECREED\" again but we already did. Maybe other orders have \"DECREED\" but not captured because the pattern may not match? The search earlier was only for \"DECREED\". But maybe other orders use \"DECREED:\" with colon, or \"DECREED:\" etc. We could broaden pattern to \"DECREED[: ]\". But maybe better to search for \"ORDERED\" pattern. But we need to identify tangible terms. Potentially the \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" might contain \"ORDERED\" and \"DECREED\" etc.\n\nThus choose search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"ORDERED\" or \"DECREED\". Let's do pattern \"ORDERED|DECREED\". That will return matches. We need to provide context.

We have partial reads. We should search for decree terms. We saw matches for \"ORDERED\", \"DECREED\". The decree terms likely in the orders: e.g., in Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification: line 1: \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) and on behalf of the following Class: All individuals who have been issued predicate Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”) orders by Washington state courts...\" That is a significant term: maintain class action under Fed R Civ P 23(b)(3). Also the order to maintain class action. Also maybe the preliminary injunction order terms: \"USCIS to adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days...\" That is a significant term. Also \"USCIS shall reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition that was denied on the grounds that the Washington state court did not have jurisdiction or authority to “reunify” an immigrant with his or her parents.\" etc. Also \"USCIS to adjudicate all outstanding Special Immigrant Juvenile Status petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed.\" etc. Also \"USCIS to adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed.\" Also \"USCIS to adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days ...\". We need to gather all distinct terms. We should read the relevant order windows to capture all.\n\nWe have read some of the \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" windows: tokens 8464-8664 includes some terms. Let's examine the excerpt: It says:\n\n\"…the Court has the power to temporarily enjoin removals … It is hereby ORDERED that defendants and their officers, agents, employees, representatives, and all persons acting in concert or participating with them are ENJOINED AND RESTRAINED from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J) on the ground that a Washington…\"\n\nAlso tokens 8752-8952 include:\n\n\"USCIS shall, within thirty days of the date of this Order, reopen and readjudicate any Special Immigrant Juvenile Status petition that was denied on the grounds that the Washington state court did not have jurisdiction or authority to “reunify” an immigrant with his or her parents. USCIS is also ORDERED to adjudicate all outstanding Special Immigrant Juvenile Status petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed. All other Special Immigrant Juvenile Status petitions based on Washington state court orders shall be adjudicated within the 180-day period set forth.\"\n\nAlso earlier tokens 8464-8664 include \"the Court has the power to temporarily enjoin removals … and is ORDERED that defendants … are ENJOINED AND RESTRAINED from denying SIJ status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J) on the ground that a Washington state court did not have jurisdiction or authority to “reunify” an immigrant with his or her parents.\" That's a term.\n\nAlso in the preliminary injunction order, likely earlier tokens (maybe 3127-3327) but it's less relevant. We also need terms from the Class Certification order: tokens 1633-1992 lines 1-4: \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) and on behalf of the following Class: All individuals who have been issued predicate Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”) orders by Washington state courts after turning eighteen years old but prior to turning twenty-one years old and have submitted or will submit SIJS petitions to USCIS prior to turning twenty-one years old.\" That is a term: maintain class action under Fed R Civ P 23(b)(3). Also the class definition. So that is a term.\n\nAlso maybe other orders: Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement: but that is about settlement agreement terms; but if any terms incorporated by order, might be included. But likely not.\n\nAlso \"Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration\" includes terms: \"the Court also ordered the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) to: reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition that was denied on the grounds that the Washington state court did not have jurisdiction or authority to ...\" That's a term. Also earlier: \"the Court has the power to temporarily enjoin removals … and is ORDERED that defendants … are ENJOINED AND RESTRAINED from denying SIJ status …\" But that might be from the preliminary injunction. The reconsideration order may not have the same terms.\n\nAlso \"Amended Permanent Injunction\" maybe contains terms. But we haven't read that. But we may need to read that order too. Let's search for \"Enjoin\" in that order. But we need to search. Let's do search_document_regex for \"enjoin\" or \"adjudicate\" or \"reopen\" in all documents. But we should limit to \"Order\" documents. But we can search all documents. Let's choose search_document_regex with pattern \"enjoin|adjudicate|reopen|restraint|class action|SIJS|Special Immigrant Juvenile Status\" maybe. But better to search for \"adjudicate\" because that likely yields terms.

Also Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration (reconsideration terms). So we need to extract obligations like \"USCIS must adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions within 180 days\", \"USCIS must reopen and readjudicate SIJ petitions denied for lack of jurisdiction\", \"USCIS must not unreasonably delay adjudication\", \"USCIS must not deny SIJ petitions arbitrarily\", etc. Also from class certification order: \"action maintained as a class action under Fed. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\", \"class members have rights\", etc. But we need to list terms of decrees: substantive obligations ordered by court. So we must read each order that includes specific obligations. We have search regex results that show some key obligations. We need to gather all distinct obligations.\n\nWe need to read each relevant order to extract obligations. We should plan to read each relevant order fully or at least the pertinent sections. For each order, we need to extract terms:\n\n1. Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification: In the excerpt, it includes \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\" that's a term: maintain class action. Also maybe \"class representatives appointed\" etc. But maybe the main terms: maintain class action, appoint class representatives, etc.\n\n2. Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction: contains terms like \"USCIS must adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed; otherwise within 180 days.\" Also \"USCIS must reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition denied on the grounds that Washington state court lacked jurisdiction or authority to reunify.\" Also \"USCIS must not deny SIJ petitions arbitrarily.\" Also \"USCIS must not unreasonably delay adjudication.\" Also \"USCIS must not enjoin the denial of SIJ petitions.\" Also \"USCIS must not violate statutory deadlines.\" Also \"USCIS must comply with the injunction.\" Might have many obligations.\n\n3. Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction: includes \"USCIS must promptly adjudicate or readjudicate all class members’ SIJ petitions.\" Also \"USCIS must not unreasonably delay adjudication of SIJ petitions.\" Also \"USCIS must comply with permanent injunction.\" Also \"USCIS must not deny SIJ petitions arbitrarily.\" Also \"USCIS must not fail to adjudicate within 180 days.\" Also \"USCIS must not maintain a backlog.\" etc.\n\n4. Amended Permanent Injunction: \"Defendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application is filed.\" Also \"Defendants are ordered to remove tolling provision.\" Also maybe \"Defendants must not delay adjudication.\" Also maybe \"Defendants must not fail to adjudicate within statutory timeframe.\"\n\n5. Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement: This might incorporate settlement terms into court order. But we need to check if it includes obligations. Search results show \"IT IS SO ORDERED.\" but no obligations listed in snippet. We need to read more.\n\n6. Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration: includes obligations like \"USCIS must reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition denied on the grounds that Washington state court lacked jurisdiction or authority to reunify.\" Also \"USCIS must not unreasonably delay adjudication.\" Also \"USCIS must comply with order.\"\n\nWe need to read relevant sections of each to capture all obligations.\n\nThus next action: read_document for each relevant order to capture obligations. We can batch read multiple documents? We can read 10k tokens per call. We have many documents, but we can sequence by reading each.\n\nWhich document has not yet been fully visited? All documents have partial coverage but not full. We need to read more from each to capture obligations. Let's start with Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. We have partial coverage of matches but not all obligations. The snippet from match 2 shows obligations. We need to read more near those matches to capture all obligations. We should read more tokens around 8464-8664 and 8752-8952 already captured, but maybe earlier obligations at 2130? Let's search for \"must adjudicate\" pattern in that order. But we can just read more of that order. We need to find all obligations. Let's read the entire order? It's 9,104 tokens. But we can read segments gradually.\n\nWe can start by reading from token 2000 to 4000 of that order to capture terms. But we don't know offsets. Let's read from token 2000 to 4000. But we need to ensure not overlapping already read. Document currently has viewed tokens: 3127-3327, 3330-3530, 6815-7015, 7173-7412, 8464-8664, 8752-8952. So we can read from 2000-3000 to capture earlier terms. Let's read 2000-3000. That's 1000 tokens. We'll read that.\n\nBut also need to read Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification. Already have tokens 708-908, 1633-1992. Need earlier section maybe token 0-200? But we can read 0-1000.\n\nAlso Amended Permanent Injunction: only 435-635 read; need more. But we can read 0-800.\n\nAlso Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction: only 356-561, 2274-2597. Need earlier and later. Let's read 0-500 and 2600-3200.\n\nAlso Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement: 934-1134 read; need earlier maybe 0-2000. Let's read 0-2000.\n\nAlso Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration: 138-549, 718-1015, 1629-1829 read; need more coverage. Let's read 0-500, 1000-1500, 1900-2400.\n\nThus we need multiple read_document calls. But we must pick one action per turn. We can only do one action. So we need to choose the most pressing next step. We could search for pattern \"ORDERED\" or \"must\" to locate obligations quickly. But we already have many matches with obligations. We need to ensure we capture all terms. We can search for \"must\" pattern across all relevant orders. That may return many matches. We could then read each match. But we need to read entire context.\n\nBetter approach: read entire orders in 10k token chunks. But each call limited to 10k tokens. We can read large portion but need to read each separately. We may need multiple turns. For now, start with one key order: Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. We'll read tokens 2000-3000. That should capture obligations like \"USCIS must adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions ...\". Then we can append obligations.\n\nThus next action: read_document for that order from 2000-3000.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\"start_token\":2000,\"end_token\":3000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "start_token": 2000, "end_token": 3000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13016, "completion_tokens": 1715, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to extract each distinct obligation. We should compile a set of terms. Let's search in that order for \"order\" or \"shall\" obligations.\n\nWe can search that document for \"shall\" maybe. But better to search for \"must\" and \"shall\" terms.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on that order for pattern \"must\" or \"shall\" combined with \"adjudicate\" etc. But maybe easier to read entire order?

Let's list distinct obligations.\n\nFrom preliminary injunction order (search matches):\n\n- \"adjudicate all outstanding [SIJ] petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed . . . [or otherwise] within the 180-day period set forth in the statute in the absence of an affirmative showing that the petition raises novel or complex issues which cannot be resolved within the allotted time.\" (From Opinion match 3). This is a clause.\n\n- \"adjudicate all outstanding [SIJ] petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed\" (similar but maybe separate clause in order).\n\n- \"adjudicate all outstanding [SIJ] petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed\" (maybe a variation). We need unique values.\n\n- \"adjudicate all outstanding [SIJ] petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed\" (again similar but with 180 days). Might be same as above.\n\n- \"adjudicate all outstanding [SIJ] petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed\" appears maybe twice.\n\n- \"adjudicate all outstanding [SIJ] petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed\" appears.\n\n- \"adjudicate all outstanding [SIJ] petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed\" appears.\n\nBut maybe it's the same clause repeated. We need to capture distinct obligations. The unique obligations are:\n\n1. Adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on Washington state court order within 180 days of application filing.\n\n2. Adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on Washington state court order within 30 days of this Order if >150 days have passed; otherwise within 180 days.\n\n3. Reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition denied on authority grounds within 30 days of this Order.\n\n4. Adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on Washington state court order within 30 days of this Order (maybe separate from above? maybe same).\n\n5. Adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on Washington state court order within 180 days of this Order (maybe separate from above; but same as 2 but without the >150 days clause).\n\nWe should check the actual text to confirm uniqueness.\n\nWe need to read relevant sections to extract each distinct term. We have already read some tokens. But maybe we need more detail. Let's read the order granting preliminary injunction around the clause where it says \"ordered USCIS to adjudicate all outstanding [SIJ] petitions\". The earlier search in step 5 included tokens 8464-8664 etc. Let's read those tokens.\n\nWe'll read from Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, tokens 8460-8660.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\"start_token\":8460,\"end_token\":8660}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "start_token": 8460, "end_token": 8660}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13080, "completion_tokens": 1609, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement: that order orders enforcement of terms of Agreement, but those are court-ordered. So include those. Need to find all mentions of \"ordered\" or \"decree\" or \"adjudicate\" etc. Likely in preliminary injunction, class certification, summary judgment, permanent injunction, etc.\n\nWe have some extracts already: from preliminary injunction matches: tokens 786? We saw \"ORDERED that defendants and their officers, agents, employees, representatives, and all persons acting in concert or participating with them are ENJOINED AND RESTRAINED from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\". Also \"must adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on Washington state court order within 180 days\" from Amended Permanent Injunction. Also earlier from preliminary injunction: \"USCIS to adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed ... or within the 180-day period set forth\". And \"USCIS shall, within thirty days of the date of this Order, reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition that was denied on the grounds that the Washington state court did not have jurisdiction or authority to 'reunify' an immigrant with his or her parents. USCIS is also ORDERED to adjudicate all outstanding Special Immigrant Juvenile Status petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed. All other SIJ petitions based on Washington state court orders shall be adjudicated within the 180-day period set forth\". Also from class certification: \"ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED: 1. This action shall be maintained as a class action...\" but that's class action itself, not terms.\n\nAlso from settlement agreement order: \"the Agreement, including but not limited to interpretation and enforcement of the terms of the Agreement, except as provided in the Agreement and pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.\" Might be too general; maybe not specific terms.\n\nLet's search for \"ordered\" within preliminary injunction and summary judgment. We have matches. We need to read more to capture all terms. We have read some parts but maybe need to read more token ranges to capture all ordered terms. We need to ensure we capture distinct terms. Let's identify candidate terms:\n\nFrom preliminary injunction (Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction):\n- \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed, or within the 180-day period set forth in the statute in the absence of an affirmative showing that the petition raises novel or complex issues which cannot be resolved within the allotted time.\" (Term: adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 30 days if >150 days passed, or within 180 days).\n\n- \"USCIS shall, within thirty days of the date of this Order, reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition that was denied on the grounds that the Washington state court did not have jurisdiction or authority to 'reunify' an immigrant with his or her parents.\" (Term: reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition denied on those grounds within 30 days).\n\n- \"USCIS is also ORDERED to adjudicate all outstanding Special Immigrant Juvenile Status petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed. All other SIJ petitions based on Washington state court orders shall be adjudicated within the 180-day period set forth\". (Term: adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on Washington state court order within 30 days if >150 days passed, or 180 days otherwise).\n\n- \"defendants and their officers, agents, employees, representatives, and all persons acting in concert or participating with them are ENJOINED AND RESTRAINED from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\". (Term: enjoined and restrained from denying SIJ status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)).\n\nFrom Amended Permanent Injunction:\n- \"Defendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application is filed by the petitioner.\" (Term: adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on Washington state court order within 180 days of application filed).\n\nAlso from summary judgment and permanent injunction: \"USCIS to promptly adjudicate or readjudicate all class members’ SIJ petitions.\" (Term: promptly adjudicate or readjudicate all class members’ SIJ petitions). Also maybe \"adjudicate all SIJ petitions within 180 days\".\n\nAlso from settlement agreement order: might have \"interpretation and enforcement of the terms of Agreement\" but not specific obligations.\n\nAlso from class certification order: maybe \"maintained as a class action\" but not decree terms.\n\nAlso from other orders: maybe \"ORDERED that defendants and their officers ... are enjoined ...\".\n\nThus need to extract all distinct terms. Let's compile list:\n\n1. Adjudicate all outstanding Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJ) petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed, or within the 180-day period set forth in the statute in the absence of an affirmative showing that the petition raises novel or complex issues which cannot be resolved within the allotted time. (This is one term; maybe split into two: within 30 days if >150 days; within 180 days otherwise.)\n\n2. Reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition that was denied on the grounds that the Washington state court did not have jurisdiction or authority to 'reunify' an immigrant with his or her parents within thirty days of the order.\n\n3. Adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed; all other SIJ petitions based on Washington state court orders shall be adjudicated within the 180-day period set forth.\n\n4. Enjoin and restrain defendants and their officers, agents, employees, representatives, and all persons acting in concert or participating with them from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J).\n\n5. Defendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within 180 days of the date that the application is filed by the petitioner. (From amended permanent injunction)\n\n6. Promptly adjudicate or readjudicate all class members’ SIJ petitions. (From summary judgment/permanent injunction)\n\n7. \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on Washington state court order within thirty days of the order\" maybe duplicate; but count distinct.\n\nAlso from settlement agreement: maybe \"interpretation and enforcement of the terms of the Agreement\" which is a court order. But not specific obligations? The order says \"interpretation and enforcement of the terms of the Agreement\" but that's not a term; it's an obligation to interpret and enforce. It might count as a term: \"interpretation and enforcement of the terms of the Agreement, except as provided in the Agreement and pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.\" That's a general requirement. Might include.\n\nAlso from other documents like \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification\" may have \"class action maintained\" but not obligations.\n\nThus need to capture each distinct term.\n\nWe should read more token ranges for preliminary injunction to capture all terms. We have partial reads 2000-3000, 3127-3327, 3330-3530, 6815-7015, 7173-7412, 8460-8664, 8752-8952. We haven't read 3127-3327 but we saw some. Also 3330-3530 includes maybe some terms.

The instruction: \"This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders.\" So any order that includes \"ORDERED\" and \"DECREED\" maybe. But the concept of \"decree\" is a legal order. The key is to extract the substantive obligations ordered by the court. So we need the terms that are obligations, e.g., \"defendants are ENJOINED AND RESTRAINED from denying SIJS\" etc. Also the class action maintenance.\n\nThus we need to read more of Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification to capture all the decreed terms. Also maybe read Amended Permanent Injunction to capture the decree terms.\n\nWe should search for \"DECREED\" in other docs. Step 5 found matches in several docs. We saw in \"Opinion\" maybe. Let's search \"DECREED\" across all docs. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"DECREED\". That will return context.\n\nWe need to locate all decree terms. So next action: search_document_regex across all documents for \"DECREED\". That will give us matches with context. We can then parse the obligations.\n\nSo choose search_document_regex.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n  \"pattern\": \"DECREED\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 20,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "DECREED", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4645, "completion_tokens": 488, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have seen some decree text in the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification. It had \"ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED\". That might be a class certification decree. Also other documents may have decrees, e.g., Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction had \"ORDERED\" and \"ENJOINED\". But \"decree\" might refer to substantive obligations, e.g., injunction terms. But the instruction: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders.\" So we need to find the terms that are substantive obligations that are ordered. That includes injunction terms: \"enjoined from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status\", etc. That is a substantive obligation. Also the order to maintain class action is a decree but not a substantive obligation? It might be a substantive order. But we need to extract the terms of the decree.\n\nSo we need to search for patterns like \"ORDERED\" and \"DECREED\" or \"enjoined\" or \"restrained\" etc. We might search for \"ORDERED\" and capture the obligation. But we need to extract each term separately. So we need to read relevant sections.\n\nWe have partially visited many documents. Let's see if there are other decrees. The \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" contains injunction terms. We need to capture the specific obligations: \"enjoined from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\". Also maybe other terms like \"restraint\" etc. Also \"enjoined and restrained from denying...\" maybe.\n\nAlso the \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification\" has the decree \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\". That is a substantive order but maybe not an obligation. It could be considered a decree term. But likely we need to extract the substantive obligations: the injunction terms.\n\nAlso could be in other orders such as \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction\" and \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement\" etc. But we haven't seen those. We need to search for \"enjoined\" \"decree\" \"ORDERED\" \"DECREED\" across all documents. We can use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"enjoined|decree|decreed|ORDERED\". But careful to avoid noise.\n\nWe should search for \"enjoined\" across all documents, but we already did search for \"enjoined\" in Preliminary Injunction. We need to read the surrounding context to capture the obligation. We have seen the snippet. But we should read more tokens around that region to capture the full obligation: maybe \"enjoined from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\". Also maybe other obligations like \"enjoined from removing\" etc.\n\nAlso search for \"decreed\" in Class Certification. We saw \"It is, accordingly, hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED\". That had the class definition but not obligations. But the decree might also have terms like \"The court hereby decrees that ...\". Might be in other orders.\n\nThus, next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"enjoined\" to capture injunction terms. Also maybe \"decree\" for other obligations. But we already searched for \"decree\" and \"DECREED\". But maybe other obligations are in other orders. Let's search for \"decree\" again with context. But we already have matches. But we didn't read full context for Preliminary Injunction beyond the snippet. We might need to read more tokens around the match to capture the obligation. The snippet we read shows the obligation: \"enjoined and restrained from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\". That is a single obligation. So we can extract that.\n\nAlso maybe there are other obligations in other orders. Let's search for \"enjoined\" again? Already done. But maybe \"DECREED\" contains obligations. Let's search for \"decree\" again with more context. But we saw earlier only 4 matches. Could be enough.\n\nAlso \"Decreed\" appears in Class Certification. That didn't contain obligations. But it's a decree of class certification. That might be considered a substantive obligation: the court orders that the action be maintained as a class action. That is a substantive order. So we could extract that as a term: \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\". That is a substantive obligation. So we should extract that.\n\nThus, we need to extract:\n\n1. \"enjoined and restrained from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\" (from Preliminary Injunction).\n\n2. \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\" (from Class Certification).\n\nAlso possibly other obligations: maybe there are other \"enjoined\" terms in other documents. We haven't searched for \"enjoined\" in other documents. Let's search for \"enjoined\" on all documents again to be sure. But we did search and found only in Preliminary Injunction. But maybe there are others. Let's run search_document_regex for \"enjoined\" again with top_k maybe 10. But we already did step 11. That only found 1 match in Preliminary Injunction. So no other.\n\nAlso \"decreed\" maybe appears in other orders, but we saw only one match in Class Certification. But maybe other orders have \"decreed\". We can search again with \"DECREED\" pattern. But we saw 1 match. So likely these two obligations.\n\nAlso maybe there are \"decree\" or \"decreed\" in Settlement Agreement orders. But we didn't search. Let's search for \"decreed\" again in all docs; we saw only one. But maybe \"decree\" appears elsewhere. But we saw 4 matches earlier: 2 in Brief of Amicus Curiae, 1 in Opinion, 1 in Order Class Certification. But those may not contain obligations. But we could check the Brief of Amicus Curiae. But that might be a brief, not an order.\n\nThus, we likely have only two significant terms.\n\nNow we need to extract them with evidence. We need to read the relevant portions to get the exact text and location.\n\nWe have from Preliminary Injunction snippet. We need to capture tokens around that match to get the full obligation. The snippet shows lines 20-23. We might need to read a bit more context to ensure we capture the entire obligation phrase.\n\nLet's read more tokens around that region. We have tokens 8460-8660 already read. That includes the obligation. We can read tokens 8450-8670 maybe to get the context. But we already have the snippet. But we need to provide evidence with \"text\" snippet. We can use the snippet we already have. It includes the obligation. We can use that.\n\nBut we need to include evidence with source_document and location. For location, we can use token range or page? The snippet says tokens 8460-8660. So location could be \"tokens 8460-8660\". Or \"page X\". But we don't know page. So we use token range.\n\nFor the class certification decree, we have snippet tokens 1639-1839. That includes the decree phrase. We need to capture the phrase: \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\". The snippet shows lines 12-14: \"It is, accordingly, hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED: 1. This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\". So we can use that.\n\nThus, we should append these two entries.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with key \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" and two entries.\n\nWe need to use the evidence format: text, source_document, location.\n\nSo for first entry: text: \"enjoined and restrained from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\". Source_document: \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\". Location: \"tokens 8460-8660\" (or maybe line numbers 20-23). We'll use token range.\n\nSecond entry: text: \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\". Source_document: \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification\". Location: \"tokens 1639-1839\".\n\nWe should provide evidence with entire snippet? The snippet includes the phrase. We'll just provide the snippet. But evidence should be verbatim snippet. We'll include the entire snippet lines around the phrase. But we can also just provide the phrase with context. The snippet for class certification: lines 12-14. We'll provide that.\n\nThus, we call append_checklist.\n\nLet's produce the JSON call.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"enjoined and restrained from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"● from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 8460-8660\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed.

R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\". However, we need to extract all distinct values of Significant_Terms_of_Decrees. We need to search for other decree terms, such as \"ordered\" or \"decreed\" statements that are substantive obligations. Potentially there are other orders in the document set: e.g., Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction might have such terms; Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement might have terms (maybe \"ordered to pay\" etc). Also Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction includes the \"enjoined and restrained\" we captured. But there may be other terms like \"shall be remanded\" etc. We should search across all documents for patterns like \"DECREED:\" or \"ORDERED:\" or \"DECREED TO\" etc. The pattern \"decreed\" may capture. Already we have search on \"DECREED\" in all documents and found 1 match in Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification. But maybe there are other \"ORDERED\" matches with substantive obligations. We might search for \"ORDERED:\" or \"ORDERED TO\" patterns. But we might need to search for \"ordered\" or \"decreed\" with specific patterns like \"ordered that\" etc. We can use regex \"ORDERED.*?:\"? But we might get many matches. We need to manually check for other decree terms.\n\nThe requirement: \"significant terms of decrees: substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders. Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court. Extract each term as a separate value.\"\n\nThus, we need to capture terms that are part of court orders, not settlement agreements. So we need to read orders and see if they contain such terms. The extracted ones we have are indeed terms from orders.\n\nWe need to search for other orders. The documents list: many orders. The ones that likely contain terms: Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction, Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement (but the order may incorporate settlement terms, but we need to check if they are incorporated). The Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration, Amended Permanent Injunction, Opinion (but opinions may not contain substantive obligations). The Brief of Amicus may not contain. The Complaint may not.\n\nThus, we should search for \"ORDERED\" with colon and then see if any substantive obligations. Also \"DECREED\" maybe in other orders. Let's search across all documents for pattern \"ORDERED[^:]*:\"? But that might be too broad. Maybe use \"ORDERED.*?:\" with DOTALL for multiple lines.\n\nWe can search for \"ORDERED.*?:\" within all documents. Use search_document_regex. Then we can examine matches.

Are there any more? We saw earlier search for \"ORDERED.*?\" gave many matches, but we didn't extract further terms. The need is to extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. We must ensure we have all terms. We need to search for more \"decree\" or \"ordered\" that are substantive obligations. Perhaps there are other orders: e.g., \"Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration\" includes orders to USCIS to reopen and readjudicate, etc. Those are court orders that impose obligations. Those are likely significant terms of decrees. Also \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction\" probably contains orders. Also \"Amended Permanent Injunction\" likely contains orders. Also \"Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement\" includes \"IT IS SO ORDERED\" but that's about settlement agreement terms. But the instruction: \"Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court.\" The joint motion for settlement agreement order may incorporate settlement terms? We need to examine.\n\nWe have not yet read many parts. We need to search for \"IT IS SO ORDERED\" maybe. But we already found \"IT IS SO ORDERED\" in the settlement agreement order. That likely orders the settlement terms. But we need to determine if those terms are substantive obligations under the decree. Probably the settlement is part of the court order. So we should extract the terms. However, the earlier extraction only had two values. We likely need more.\n\nWe need to systematically identify all court orders with substantive obligations. Use search_document_regex for pattern \"ORDERED\" plus some context like \"to\" or \"shall\" etc. But we must examine tokens.\n\nWe can search for \"ORDERED\" across all docs. Already did search for \"ORDERED.*:\" giving 9 matches. But we need to check each match for substantive terms.\n\nWe also need to search for \"DECREED\" maybe. Already did. But we need more.\n\nAlso \"ORDERED\" might appear in \"Amended Permanent Injunction\". Let's check.\n\nWe should search for \"ORDERED\" in \"Amended Permanent Injunction\". Also \"ORDERED\" in \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction\". Also \"ORDERED\" in other docs.\n\nWe'll do search_document_regex on all docs for pattern \"ORDERED\" or \"DECREED\" with context tokens. But we need to use search_document_regex. Let's call it for pattern \"ORDERED\" and maybe \"DECREED\" separately.\n\nBut we also need to capture terms like \"shall be maintained\" etc.\n\nWe have to consider the definition: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders.\"\n\nThus for each order, we need to capture each term. We have found two terms: \"enjoined and restrained from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\" and \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\".\n\nBut there are likely more: e.g., \"IT IS SO ORDERED\" in settlement approval order. That may contain \"the parties shall...\" etc.\n\nAlso \"Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration\" includes orders to USCIS to \"reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition that was denied\" and \"reopen and readjudicate\".\n\nAlso \"Amended Permanent Injunction\" likely contains orders.\n\nAlso \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction\" may contain orders.\n\nAlso \"Opinion\" might contain orders.\n\nAlso \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" we already captured the enjoined term. Might also contain other orders like \"order USCIS to adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions within 30 days\". That is a substantive obligation. That was in the Opinion's match. That could be considered a term. We should add: \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order\" etc.\n\nAlso \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification\" we captured the class maintenance. There might be other obligations like \"the action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\". Possibly also \"the court shall...\" But we only captured one.\n\nWe need to scan all documents for more.\n\nGiven we have many tokens and we can only read 10k tokens per call, we need to read or search.\n\nWe should search for \"ORDERED\" with context, but we may get many irrelevant. But we can refine pattern: \"ORDERED.*? to\" capturing \"to\" after ORDERED. Let's search for \"ORDERED.*to\" across all docs.\n\nAlternatively, search for \"ORDERED\" and then read surrounding area.\n\nWe have already searched for \"ORDERED.*:\" which gave 9 matches across docs. But we didn't read all matches. We need to examine each match to see if they contain substantive obligations. We can request the matches with context. Let's do search_document_regex with pattern \"ORDERED.*?to\" maybe.\n\nBut let's review the matches listed in Step 15. They include many docs; we can examine each match's context. But we only have the raw snippet for the matches; we need to read more context maybe.\n\nLet's list the matches from Step 15 again:\n\n1. Brief of Amicus Curiae: 2 matches, but the snippet didn't show the \"ORDERED\" part. The snippet is about Washington statutes. Might not contain orders.\n\n2. Docket: 1 match, but snippet about hearing. Not relevant.\n\n3. Opinion: 1 match, snippet about preliminary injunction ordered USCIS to adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions. That is a substantive obligation. So we need to extract that term.\n\n4. Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement: 1 match, snippet about \"IT IS SO ORDERED.\" No detail shown. Might contain settlement terms. But we didn't read full. We need to read more.\n\n5. Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification: 1 match, we already captured the \"This action shall be maintained as a class action\".\n\n6. Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction: 1 match, snippet about order removed. Might not contain substantive obligations.\n\n7. Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration: 2 matches, snippet about \"the Court also ordered the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) to:\" and list of orders. That's substantive.\n\n8. Possibly others.\n\nThus we need to add these obligations as new values.\n\nLet's plan:\n\n- For Opinion: Extract term: \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed, ... or otherwise within the 180-day period set forth in the statute in the absence of an affirmative showing that the petition raises novel or complex issues which cannot be resolved within the allotted time.\"\n\nThat's a long term.\n\n- For Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration: extract terms: \"reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition that was denied on the grounds that the Washington state court did not have jurisdiction or authority to ...\", also maybe \"USCIS to ...\", but we need to capture each order. There may be multiple.\n\n- For Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement: need to read to capture the terms. But we only have a snippet. Let's read that document around the match region to see what terms are ordered.\n\n- For Amended Permanent Injunction: we haven't extracted. It likely contains orders like \"the court orders that certain actions must occur\". Let's search for \"ORDERED\" in that doc.\n\n- For Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction: also likely.\n\n- For Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction: we already extracted the enjoined term but also there might be other obligations like \"USCIS to adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions within 30 days\" etc. That was in the Opinion, not in the preliminary injunction order itself. But the order itself might also contain orders. Let's check.\n\nThus we should gather all.\n\nWe need to plan to read more portions. We can use search_document_regex for pattern \"ORDERED\" or \"DECREED\" with context.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on \"Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement\" for pattern \"ORDERED\". But we already have a match. We need to read around that match to capture terms. The match snippet had \"IT IS SO ORDERED.\" That phrase appears with no terms. But the actual order may have more text after. We need to read the surrounding tokens.\n\nLet's call read_document for that doc with start around 800-1200 to capture around match. The match was at tokens 934-1134. So we can read tokens 800-1200 to capture context.\n\nAlso for \"Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration\" we need to read tokens 138-549 and 718-1015, which we already have. But we need to read the full match to capture each ordered term. We saw some but not all.\n\nWe also need to read \"Amended Permanent Injunction\" doc. The snippet at 435-635 was already read. Let's read more.\n\nWe also need to read \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction\". We have tokens 356-561 and 2274-2597. Let's read more.\n\nWe also need to read \"Opinion\" doc beyond the snippet. The snippet at 3190-3395 shows the preliminary injunction order. But maybe more orders further. Let's read tokens 3000-4000. And also maybe earlier tokens 2000-3000.\n\nWe also need to read \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" beyond the enjoined terms. But we have the snippet. Maybe there's more.\n\nAlso \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification\" we have the class maintenance. There may be additional terms.\n\nAlso \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction\" could contain orders.\n\nThus we need to gather more.\n\nGiven time, we will start by reading some documents. But we must avoid re-reading fully visited tokens.\n\nThe catalog shows partially visited docs. For each doc we need to read unviewed ranges.\n\nLet's start with \"Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement\". We have tokens 934-1134 viewed. That is the match region. We need to read maybe 800-1200. Let's read 800-1200.\n\nAlso \"Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration\" we need to read tokens 138-549, 718-1015, 1629-1829. We have some but maybe need to read full match. But we already have read those ranges. Let's re-open maybe read 138-2000 to capture all. But that might exceed 10k? The doc has 2,984 tokens, so reading 138-2000 is <10k. Let's read 138-2000 to capture all.\n\nAlso \"Amended Permanent Injunction\" maybe we need to read entire doc? It's 822 tokens. We only have 435-635. Let's read 1-822 to capture all.\n\nAlso \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction\" we need to read more. Let's read 1-2000 maybe.\n\nAlso \"Opinion\" doc: 19,868 tokens. We need to read more around 3000-5000. Let's read 3000-5000.\n\nAlso \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" we already captured enjoined term. But maybe other obligations. The snippet at 8460-8664 shows the enjoined. There might be earlier obligations. Let's read 8000-9500.\n\nAlso \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification\" we captured one. But maybe other obligations. The snippet at 1639-1839 gave the class maintenance. There might be more obligations like \"the action shall be maintained\" etc. Let's read 1-2000.\n\nAlso \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction\" we will read.\n\nAlso \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction\" may contain orders like \"the court orders that ...\"\n\nAlso \"Opinion\" maybe contains orders like \"the court orders that ...\".\n\nOk, but we need to be careful with token limits. Each read must be <=10k. We can read multiple ranges.\n\nBut we can make multiple calls. The system expects one action per turn. So we need to choose one action now. We could choose to read one of these documents. But we need to decide which one will yield new values.\n\nWe already have two values. The next likely new values will come from \"Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration\" and \"Opinion\" and \"Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement\". Let's start with \"Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration\" because we have partial coverage but need full.\n\nThus we will call read_document on that doc with start 138-2000. That will give us full context. Then we can extract new values. So next action: read_document.\n\nWe need to specify doc_name: \"Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration\". Start_token 138, end_token 2000.\n\nWe must ensure we don't exceed 10k. 2000-138 = 1862 tokens, fine.\n\nThus next action: read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration\",\"start_token\":138,\"end_token\":2000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration", "start_token": 138, "end_token": 2000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7033, "completion_tokens": 2977, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\".\n\nWe need to find all other decrees terms. Likely in other documents: Amended Permanent Injunction, Opinion, Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement, Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction, Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration (we already read large part), also maybe in Complaint? But complaint is not a decree.\n\nWe should search for \"DECREED\" in all documents again but we already did, found 4 matches earlier. But we need to ensure we capture all. Perhaps there are additional terms like \"ordered\" with \"decree\". Use search_document_regex on all documents pattern: \"decree\" or \"decreed\". Already did earlier. But maybe we missed some because we didn't capture all matches? The search returns top_k matches per document, but we might need to read further windows. But we already read Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction tokens 8460-8660, which contained the enjoined term. We also read Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification tokens 1639-1839, which contained the \"maintained as a class action\" term.\n\nBut there may also be a decree in the Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction, or in Amended Permanent Injunction.\n\nAlso the Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement may contain terms: \"IT IS SO ORDERED\" but not necessarily a decree. But it might contain a decree: \"the parties agree to ...\" but it's a settlement agreement order.\n\nWe should search for \"ordered\" or \"decree\" in those docs. Let's search for \"ORDERED\" pattern with regex \"ORDERED|DECREED\" but we already did earlier. But we may need to read the full order to capture all terms.\n\nWe can read the remaining tokens of Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction. Let's read from 2000-4000 maybe. Also read from Amended Permanent Injunction. Also read from Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement beyond 1134 tokens? We saw 934-1134 but maybe there are more. It's only 1,368 tokens total; we have only 934-1134. We need to read earlier tokens 0-933. Also later tokens 1134-1368. So we should read those.\n\nAlso read Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction tokens 356-561 we already saw some, but need to read 2274-2597 we already saw. We might need to read 561-2274.\n\nAlso read Amended Permanent Injunction 435-635 we saw, but need further tokens maybe 635-822.\n\nAlso read Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction 356-561, 2274-2597, we need rest.\n\nAlso read Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement 0-933, 1134-1368.\n\nAlso read Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction possibly more decrees? We already captured the enjoined. Maybe there are others in other parts of that order. But we captured two already.\n\nWe should also search for \"DECREED:\" maybe.\n\nLet's plan: read remaining parts of each document.\n\nAlso maybe there is a decree in the Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration beyond tokens 138-2000? We read up to 2000 and saw many terms. There may be further \"decreed\" statements later. Let's read 2000-2984.\n\nAlso read Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction 2000-4000? But its total 11589 tokens, we only read limited.\n\nGiven the large number of tokens, we need to prioritize. I think we should read the remaining parts of Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration (tokens 2000-2984). That will capture any omitted decree terms. Also read Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction (we have 356-561, 2274-2597). We need to read 561-2274 and 2597-11589.\n\nAlso read Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement (0-933, 1134-1368).\n\nAlso read Amended Permanent Injunction 635-822.\n\nAlso read Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction maybe tokens 8952-? We have up to 8952. But maybe there are more tokens beyond 8952? The total is 9104 tokens, so we need 8952-9104.\n\nAlso read Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction for the rest.\n\nGiven limited time, maybe we can search for \"decree\" again but with top_k 20 across all docs. But we already did search. But maybe the search didn't return all matches due to token context truncated. But we can search again with context_tokens high and top_k 20.\n\nI think reading the remaining parts is safer.\n\nLet's perform search_document_regex for all docs pattern \"decree|decreed|ORDERED.*?:\". But we already did. But maybe search with pattern \"DECREED\" again will capture all matches. Let's just search again with top_k 20, context_tokens 200, doc_name=\"all\". That will return all matches. Then we can read the relevant token ranges.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"DECREED\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "DECREED", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9037, "completion_tokens": 1282, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The evidence snippet shown includes \"● from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\". But we might need the full sentence: \"enjoined and restrained from denying ...\". The snippet is truncated. Might need read again for full phrase. Also the second value: \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\" from Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (tokens 1639-1839). The snippet shows the clause beginning \"It is, accordingly, hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED: 1. This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\". Good.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values of Significant_Terms_of_Decrees from any document. There may be more beyond these two. We have seen many partial reads. We saw in Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration tokens 138-2000, there were many orders: enjoining defendants from denying SIJ, initiating removal proceedings, etc. Those are also significant decree terms. So there may be many additional terms.\n\nAlso in the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, there may be other terms: maybe \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions within thirty days\" etc. Also \"adjudicate all other SIJ petitions within 180 days\". Those are significant terms. Also \"reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition denied\" etc. Also \"order USCIS to ...\". So we need to extract all distinct terms.\n\nWe also saw in the Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration, there are multiple orders: \"enjoining defendants from denying SIJ status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\", \"initiating removal proceedings against or removing any SIJ petitioner whose SIJ petition has been denied...\", \"ordered USCIS to reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition denied\", \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days if more than 150 days had already passed\", \"adjudicate all other SIJ petitions based on Washington state court orders within the 180‑day period set forth\". Those are separate terms.\n\nAlso earlier in Preliminary Injunction order, tokens 8460-8660 contained part of \"enjoined and restrained from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\". But the full phrase may have \"enjoined and restrained from denying SIJS pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\". Also there may be additional items after 8664? We haven't looked.\n\nWe should search for \"enjoined\" or \"adjudicate\" or \"reopen\" etc. But we need to extract all significant terms.\n\nWe have some evidence from search_document_regex results in Step 15: various matches for \"ORDERED.*:\" but only the Preliminary Injunction match didn't show the specific terms. But we have the Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration read tokens 138-2000. That contains many terms but we need to parse them.\n\nWe should read the rest of Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration beyond token 2000 to see if more terms later. We saw up to 2000; but the document is 2984 tokens, so there may be more terms after 2000. We should read tokens 2000-2984.\n\nAlso maybe other documents contain terms like \"order USCIS to...\" etc. For example, the Preliminary Injunction order tokens 8460-8664 might include \"enjoined and restrained from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\". But that was partially captured; we need the full sentence.\n\nAlso the Preliminary Injunction order might also contain orders like \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on Washington state court order within thirty days if more than 150 days had already passed\" etc. But those may be in the same order.\n\nAlso the Preliminary Injunction order might include \"order USCIS to reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition denied\" etc. But that might be in the Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration order.\n\nAlso the Preliminary Injunction order might have \"order USCIS to ...\". We need to search for \"USCIS\" in that order. We can use search_document_regex on Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction for pattern \"USCIS\". That might reveal terms.\n\nAlso search for \"adjudicate\" in that order.\n\nAlso search for \"reopen\" in that order.\n\nAlso search for \"reopen and readjudicate\" etc.\n\nAlso search for \"enjoined and restrained\" maybe.\n\nWe need to be systematic: extract all distinct terms. We should treat each distinct clause as a separate value. The terms likely include:\n\nFrom Preliminary Injunction order:\n\n- \"enjoined and restrained from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\"\n- \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on Washington state court order within thirty days if more than 150 days had already passed\" (maybe in the order)\n- \"adjudicate all other SIJ petitions based on Washington state court orders within the 180‑day period set forth in the statute in the absence of an affirmative showing that the petition raises novel or complex issues which cannot be resolved within the allotted time\" (maybe)\n- \"order USCIS to reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition denied\" (maybe)\n- \"order USCIS to ... something else\" (maybe)\n- \"order USCIS to ...\"\n\nFrom Class Certification order:\n\n- \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\"\n- maybe also \"maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\" only.\n\nFrom Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration order:\n\n- \"enjoining defendants from denying applications for Special Immigrant Juvenile (“SIJ”) status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J) on the ground that a Washington state court did not have jurisdiction or authority to “reunify” an immigrant with his or her parents; or\"\n- \"enjoining defendants from initiating removal proceedings against or removing any SIJ petitioner whose SIJ petition has been denied on the ground that the Washington state court did not have jurisdiction or authority to “reunify” an immigrant with his or her parents.\"\n- \"ordered USCIS to reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition that was denied on the grounds that the Washington state court did not have jurisdiction or authority to “reunify” an immigrant with his or her parents within thirty days of the date of the order\"\n- \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days if more than 150 days had already passed since the petition was filed\"\n- \"adjudicate all other SIJ petitions based on Washington state court orders within the 180‑day period set forth in the statute in the absence of an affirmative showing that the petition raises novel or complex issues which cannot be resolved within the allotted time.\"\n\nAlso possibly \"order USCIS to ... something else\" appears later.\n\nAlso maybe \"order the court to ...\". But we need to be precise.\n\nAlso in the Preliminary Injunction order, we might have \"enjoined and restrained from denying SIJ status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\". That is similar to the first term in the Defendants’ order, but we should treat them as separate values only if they are distinct. The content might be identical, but we might still record them as separate values if they appear in multiple documents? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the same phrase appears exactly the same, we consider it one distinct value. But we need to capture all unique values across all documents. So duplicate phrases may be counted once. However, if the phrase appears in multiple docs, we still include only one entry? The instruction says \"distinct value\" not \"distinct per document\". So if identical phrase appears in multiple docs, we might only need one entry. But we must still provide evidence from one or more documents. We could include multiple evidence pieces for same value across docs. But we need to ensure each entry is unique.\n\nThus we should find all unique decree terms.\n\nLet's search for \"enjoined\" in Preliminary Injunction order. Use search_document_regex on that document for \"enjoined\".\n\nAlso search for \"adjudicate\" in that order.\n\nAlso search for \"reopen\" in that order.\n\nAlso search for \"USCIS\" in that order.\n\nAlso search for \"order USCIS\" maybe.\n\nAlso search for \"reopen and readjudicate\" in that order.\n\nLet's call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", pattern \"enjoined\", flags [\"IGNORECASE\"].\n\nAlso pattern \"adjudicate\".\n\nAlso pattern \"reopen\".\n\nAlso pattern \"USCIS\".\n\nAlso pattern \"reopen and readjudicate\".\n\nBut we might need to read tokens manually to see full clause.\n\nBut we can use search_document_regex which returns top matches with context. That may give us the snippet.\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nBut we also need to read the rest of Defendants’ order beyond token 2000. Let's read tokens 2000-2984. The document is 2984 tokens. So we need to read tokens 2000-2984. That will cover the rest. Let's read that.\n\nAlso maybe there are other orders with terms: e.g., the Summary Judgment order might contain terms. But we haven't read it. But maybe not.\n\nBut to be thorough, we should search for \"decree\" or \"decreed\" across all documents for potential terms. But we already saw only a few matches. But maybe there are more that we haven't captured due to partial coverage. But we can search again for \"ORDERED\" or \"DECREED\" across all docs.\n\nBut we need to extract all distinct terms. It seems many terms are in the Preliminary Injunction and the Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration. Also maybe in the Summary Judgment order. But we haven't looked.\n\nAlso maybe in the \"Amended Permanent Injunction\" order. That might contain terms like \"enjoined\" etc. But we haven't read it. But we can search for \"enjoined\" or \"adjudicate\" in that order. But we can search across all documents.\n\nBut first, let's read the rest of Defendants’ order to capture any additional terms.\n\nProceed with read_document (tokens 2000-2985).<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration\",\"start_token\":2000,\"end_token\":2985}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration", "start_token": 2000, "end_token": 2985}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9075, "completion_tokens": 2397, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\" (from Class Certification)\n\nWe need to see if there are any other decree terms in other documents.\n\nWe saw many search results: \"ORDERED\" pattern shows many matches, but we need \"decree terms\" i.e., substantive obligations ordered by the court. Terms like \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions\" etc. Those are also decreed obligations. Many appear in Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration: the court ordered USCIS to reopen, readjudicate, adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions within 30 days, etc. Those are decreed obligations.\n\nAlso the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction includes order to \"adjudicate all outstanding [SIJ] petitions\". That was already captured? The earlier value extracted was \"enjoined and restrained from denying SIJ status\" but not the adjudication order. That might be another term. Also the Preliminary Injunction order likely includes \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on Washington state court order within thirty days if more than 150 days had already passed since the petition was filed\" etc. That is a distinct term.\n\nAlso the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction? Might have terms? Not sure.\n\nAlso the Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration contains many decrees: \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on Washington state court order within thirty days if more than 150 days had already passed since the petition was filed\", \"adjudicate all other SIJ petitions based on Washington state court orders within the 180-day period\", \"reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition that was denied\", \"enjoin defendants from denying applications for SIJ status\" etc. These are multiple terms.\n\nThus we need to extract all distinct terms. Let's list potential terms from documents:\n\nFrom Preliminary Injunction (order):\n\n- \"enjoined and restrained from denying Special Immigrant Juvenile Status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\" (already extracted)\n- \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days if more than 150 days had already passed since the petition was filed\"\n- \"adjudicate all other SIJ petitions based on Washington state court orders within the 180-day period set forth in the statute in the absence of an affirmative showing that the petition raises novel or complex issues which cannot be resolved within the allotted time.\"\n\nFrom Class Certification:\n\n- \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\" (already extracted)\n- maybe \"maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\" only.\n\nFrom Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration:\n\n- \"enjoin defendants from denying applications for Special Immigrant Juvenile (“SIJ”) status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J)\" (similar but maybe separate term? It's the same as earlier? But the earlier was \"enjoined and restrained from denying\". This is \"enjoin defendants from denying applications\". Might be considered distinct? It's essentially same obligation but phrased differently. Might treat as separate.\n\n- \"enjoin defendants from initiating removal proceedings against or removing any SIJ petitioner whose SIJ petition has been denied on the ground that the Washington state court did not have jurisdiction or authority to “reunify” an immigrant with his or her parents.\" That's a distinct term.\n\n- \"reopen and readjudicate any SIJ petition that was denied on the grounds that the Washington state court did not have jurisdiction or authority to “reunify” an immigrant with his or her parents within thirty days of the date of the order\"\n\n- \"adjudicate all outstanding SIJ petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days if more than 150 days had already passed since the petition was filed\"\n\n- \"adjudicate all other SIJ petitions based on Washington state court orders within the 180-day period set forth in the statute in the absence of an affirmative showing that the petition raises novel or complex issues which cannot be resolved within the allotted time.\"\n\nThese appear repeated across documents. But we must extract distinct values - uniqueness by text. Could have overlaps. We need to extract all distinct values found across documents.\n\nWe have already 2. Need to find others.\n\nWe should search for \"adjudicate\" in relevant documents. We already read Preliminary Injunction and Reconsideration. Maybe also in Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction? Let's search.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on all docs for pattern: \"adjudicate|enjoin\". But we need distinct terms. Let's search for \"adjudicate\" pattern across all docs.\n\nWe need to call search_document_regex across all docs pattern \"adjudicate\". But we have already seen many matches in Preliminary Injunction and Reconsideration. But there might be other matches in other documents like Opinion etc. But we should search.\n\nLet's do a search for \"adjudicate\" across all documents.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"adjudicate\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "adjudicate", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10015, "completion_tokens": 1185, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But there may be more decree terms. Need to search for other orders that contain \"decree\" or \"ordered\" or \"decreed\" that might include substantive obligations.\n\nWe didn't yet search in Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction, Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement, Amended Permanent Injunction, Docket, etc. Also maybe the Settlement Agreement has terms, but those are settlement agreement, not necessarily decree terms unless incorporated into order. But there may be a \"final approval of settlement agreement\" order that may have terms, but those might be part of the order.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct significant terms of decrees: substantive obligations ordered by the court. These include consent decrees, stipulated judgments, injunctions, etc. For each, we need separate values with evidence.\n\nWe have two so far: from Preliminary Injunction: \"adjudicate all outstanding [SIJ] petitions based on a Washington state court order within thirty days of the date of this Order if more than 150 days have already passed since the petition was filed ... or within the 180-day period set forth in the statute ...\". And from Class Certification: maybe \"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\"? That's a substantive obligation: maintaining class status. Might be considered a decree.\n\nWe need to see if there are other decrees. Let's search again for \"DECREED\" or \"ORDERED\" across all documents for any other matches. The prior search for \"DECREED\" returned only 1 match in Class Certification. But there may be other \"DECREED\" in e.g., Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement: It may have \"IT IS SO ORDERED\" but not \"DECREED\". The summary says \"IT IS SO ORDERED\". That might be a decree. But the pattern \"DECREED\" might not appear. But \"ORDERED\" pattern we did earlier found many. We need to find \"ORDERED\" with colon pattern? The previous search for \"ORDERED.*:\" found many matches, but we only extracted 2. There might be more substantive obligations in those matches.\n\nWe need to carefully extract all significant terms of decrees from all documents.\n\nWe should look at the \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" to identify all ordered obligations. We already captured the adjudication timeframe. But the order may also include prohibitions or requirements on USCIS: e.g., \"USCIS must not deny ...\", etc. Let's read more of that order. The earlier read included tokens 2000-3000, 3127-3327, 3330-3530, 6815-7015, 7173-7412, 8238-8438, 8460-8664, 8694-9042. We need to read more of the order beyond 9042 to cover full order. The order is 9104 tokens long. We have only partially visited. We need to read remaining tokens e.g., 9042-9104? Actually 9042-9042? Wait we saw range 8694-9042. We need more beyond 9042: 9042-9104? But order length 9104 tokens, so we need 9042-9104. But maybe order has more after 9042. We should read tokens 9042-9104. Let's read that.\n\nAlso, the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification: we have only 708-908 and 1633-1992. We need to read rest of order to capture all ordered obligations: maybe the order includes more than class status maintenance, like \"class certification is granted\" \"class will be maintained\". Might include other obligations like \"USCIS to comply with order\" etc. But order is shorter.\n\nAlso, the Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement has terms: \"IT IS SO ORDERED\". We need to see if that order incorporates settlement terms into order. Likely yes. We need to capture those terms as significant terms of decree: e.g., \"The parties agree that the settlement agreement is incorporated into this order.\" Or maybe \"the parties agree to perform certain obligations.\" We need to read that order fully.\n\nAlso, the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction likely contains substantive obligations: e.g., \"USCIS must adjudicate all SIJ petitions within 180 days\" etc. We need to capture those from that order.\n\nAlso, the Amended Permanent Injunction likely contains substantive obligations: e.g., \"USCIS must adjudicate all SIJ petitions within 180 days\" etc. But that might be the same as earlier.\n\nAlso, Docket may not have substantive obligations.\n\nAlso, Settlement Agreement order may incorporate terms. But we need to confirm.\n\nThus, next action: read more of Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, maybe read 9042-9104. Also read more of Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, maybe tokens 1993-1992? Wait 1992 end. It was 1992 tokens. Already read up to 1992? The order length 1992 tokens. The ranges we have 708-908 and 1633-1992. That covers up to 1992. We might need to read 908-1633 to capture missing portions. We need to read 908-1633.\n\nAlso read Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction: we need to read remaining parts beyond 11429? The order length 11589 tokens. We have 11075-11429. Need 11429-11589. Also earlier sections missing.\n\nAlso read Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement: we have 934-1134. Need rest: 1135-1368.\n\nAlso read Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction beyond 9042-9104.\n\nAlso read Amended Permanent Injunction beyond 435-635? We have 435-635; need rest: 636-822.\n\nAlso read Opinion beyond 9415-9615? We have 9415-9615; need rest: 9616-19868? Many tokens.\n\nBut maybe we can focus on orders that contain substantive obligations.\n\nGiven time, maybe we can search regex pattern for \"ORDERED.*:\". That gave many matches. We may parse them all. But maybe easier to read entire orders.\n\nWe need a systematic approach: we need to find all \"orders\" that contain substantive obligations. The orders we've listed: Preliminary Injunction, Class Certification, Summary Judgment & Permanent Injunction, Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement, Amended Permanent Injunction, and maybe others.\n\nLet's read the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction tokens 9042-9104.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\"start_token\":9042,\"end_token\":9104}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "start_token": 9042, "end_token": 9104}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14788, "completion_tokens": 1517, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have already 2 values extracted: from Preliminary Injunction and Class Certification. There may be more terms in other orders: e.g., Amended Permanent Injunction, Opinion, maybe Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration (though that is a motion, not decree). Also other orders: Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement likely not decree. The Preliminary Injunction likely contains multiple terms: we might have missed some. Let's search within preliminary injunction for \"ORDERED\" or \"DECREED\" patterns. We have read some ranges but not all. We saw earlier search matches for \"ORDERED\" etc. We need to find all decree terms.\n\nMaybe easier: search for \"DECREED:\" pattern in each relevant order. We can search all documents for \"DECREED:\" or \"DECREED\" maybe with colon. But there may be other orders like Amended Permanent Injunction and Opinion that include terms like \"ORDERS\" etc. We need to capture every distinct term. Let's search across all documents for \"DECREED\" and \"ORDERED\" but we need terms themselves. The terms might be bullet lists enumerated as \"1.\" etc. For preliminary injunction, likely bullet list of orders. We need to capture each term.\n\nLet's search across all documents for \"DECREED:\" pattern.

Already we have 2 values appended. But we need to extract ALL distinct values found in any document. We have read some parts but not all matches. We need to search for all \"decreed\" or \"ordered\" terms that are decrees (court orders). Need to capture each distinct term.\n\nWe have seen in Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification. Need to search other documents for \"DECREED\" or \"ORDERED\" lines that constitute decree terms. Also for \"adjudicate\" etc?\n\nWe need to extract each distinct term of decree. That likely includes specific obligations. Let's find more matches. We saw earlier search_document_regex results: Step 5 had 13 matches across many docs: 2 in Brief of Amicus, 1 in Docket, 1 in Opinion (+4 more docs). We haven't read those. Also Step 19 had many matches of \"adjudicate\" across documents; some are decree terms? In Amended Permanent Injunction, there is \"Defendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions ... within 180 days\" which is a decree. Also Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction likely has similar terms. Also Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction might contain decree terms. Also Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration perhaps not.\n\nWe need to systematically extract all distinct decree terms. The checklist has only one key. We should gather all distinct terms. They are likely sentences or clauses that start with \"This action ...\", \"Defendants must adjudicate ...\", etc. We need to capture the obligation content.\n\nWe need to read documents to fetch all such clauses. We have partial coverage. We need to search for \"DECREED\" pattern again maybe to catch all. Also \"ordered\" pattern maybe. But we need to capture the clause content, not just the word. So we should search for \"DECREED:\" or \"ORDERED:\" and capture following text.\n\nBetter: For each doc, search for pattern \"DECREED\" and \"ORDERED\" and read around. We already have some. We need to check other docs:\n\n- Complaint - Class Action: likely no decree terms.\n- Docket: maybe not.\n- Amended Permanent Injunction: we have read tokens 435-635. That includes \"Defendants must adjudicate any SIJ petitions ... within 180 days\". That's a decree. Also may have others later. We need to read rest of doc for more. Let's read the entire doc (822 tokens). We have seen 435-635; need to read rest. So read 0-822.\n\n- Opinion: we have partial coverage. Need to read sections with decree terms. In the Op, we saw decree terms? We saw in matches: The preliminary injunction order (the actual order) is in the Op? The Op may include the decree terms in the \"Order\" section; but we need to capture them. We saw matches 452-652, 2387-2587, 3190-3395, 3791-4027 etc. The decree terms appear in the Op at certain positions. We need to read those sections fully.\n\n- Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement: likely not.\n\n- Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification: we have partial coverage; we saw \"It is, accordingly, hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED:\" and then the decree. Need to read that entire clause.\n\n- Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction: we have partial coverage; need to read the part where the decree terms are listed. We saw some earlier but not all. We need to read the clause.\n\n- Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction: may contain decree terms. Need to read.\n\n- Order Regarding Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration: not likely.\n\n- Brief of Amicus: may contain decree terms? Possibly not.\n\nThus we need to gather all distinct terms.\n\nGiven the volume, we can read each doc fully or at least the relevant sections. Use read_document to read entire doc for those with small token counts (Order Granting..., Amended Permanent Injunction, maybe others). For large docs like Opinion, we need to read relevant sections identified by regex. We can do multiple read_document calls.\n\nWe should plan to read:\n\n1. Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification entire doc (1992 tokens). We have part 708-908, 1633-1992. Need to read 0-708 as well to get earlier part, but decree likely after 1633. Let's read 0-2000 maybe. But maximum 10k tokens, so fine. We'll read 0-2000. That covers all.\n\n2. Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction entire doc (9104 tokens). We have partial coverage. Need to read the decree terms. They might be near the start. Let's read 0-2000 first. Then later read more as needed. But we need all decree clauses; likely at the end of the order. Let's read 8000-9000 maybe. We'll read 0-2000 first.\n\n3. Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction (11589 tokens). We need decree terms. Likely at the end. We'll read 0-2000, then 8000-9000.\n\n4. Amended Permanent Injunction (822 tokens). We have 435-635. Let's read 0-822 to capture all.\n\n5. Opinion (19868 tokens). We need decree terms. They may appear in the \"Order\" part. We saw matches in 452-652, 2387-2587, 3190-3395, 3791-4027, 5026-5226, 5369-5721, 7918-8602, 8746-9116, 9415-9615, 11382-11582. These match lines contain decree terms. We should read 400-700, 2300-2600, 3100-3400, 3700-4100, 5000-5200, 5300-5700, 7900-8700, 8700-9200, 9400-9600, 11380-11600 to capture all.\n\nAlso maybe earlier or later sections. But these likely cover all.\n\n6. Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement: maybe not.\n\n7. Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification we already covered.\n\n8. Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction we will cover.\n\n9. Brief of Amicus: unlikely.\n\n10. Docket: likely not.\n\nThus we need to read these sections.\n\nGoal: Append all distinct decree terms.\n\nWe have already appended 2 terms: from Preliminary and Class Certification. We need others.\n\nLet's read Amended Permanent Injunction first.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Amended Permanent Injunction\",\"start_token
