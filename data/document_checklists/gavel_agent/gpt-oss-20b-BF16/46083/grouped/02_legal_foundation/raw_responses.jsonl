Search for \"Cause of Action\" or \"Causes of Action\" in the complaint. Since we only read 0-10000 tokens, we might need to search for pattern \"Cause of Action\" in the complaint.

We should search for \"Cause of Action\" but earlier search found 0 matches, maybe because of formatting. The phrase maybe \"Cause of Action\" but with newline breaks. The read snippet shows at line 9: \"Case No. 2:19-cv-321\" etc. The complaint probably has a heading \"Cause of Action\" later. We should search for \"Cause of Action\" again with regex across entire doc. Use search_document_regex with doc_name=Complaint. pattern: \"Cause of Action\". Already did but returned 0 matches; maybe it's \"Cause of Action\" with different capitalization or formatting. Let's try regex \"Cause of Action\" with IGNORECASE. Also maybe \"Cause of Action\" appears in the heading \"Cause of Action\" but inside. Let's search for \"Cause of Action\" again. If not found, maybe \"Cause of Action:\" or \"Causes of Action\". I'll search for \"Cause of Action\" ignoring case and maybe with newline.\n\nAlso Remedy sought maybe appears under \"Remedies Sought\" or \"Remedy Sought\". Search for \"Remedy Sought\" or \"Remedies Sought\". Also \"Statutory or Constitutional Basis\" may be under \"Statutory Basis\". Let's search for \"Statutory\" or \"Constitutional\". Let's start with search regex for \"Cause of Action\" ignoring case.\n\nAlso we need to read the rest of document beyond 10k tokens. The complaint has 16,773 tokens. We have read 0-10000, need to read rest 10000-16773. Let's read token 10000-16773. That will cover the rest. Then search within that read. Or we can search across entire doc. Let's just read rest to get context.\n\nBut first, we need to locate \"Cause of Action\" section. The read snippet from 0-10000 might include it? Let's quickly glance: The snippet ends at page 18. The earlier part likely includes the introduction and maybe \"Cause of Action\" section. But maybe the section is after page 18. Let's read rest.\n\nWe'll read 10000-17000? Actually 10000-16773. We'll read 10000-17000 but doc is 16773 tokens so end at 16773. Let's request read_document for Complaint from 10000 to 17000 (or 16773). That will get rest of doc.\n\nWe'll then search within that read for the sections.\n\nAlso we might want to search for \"Statutory\" or \"Constitutional\" within the read.

We should find cause of action - listed in the complaint: \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" section, with \"COUNT I (Violation of the INA and the APA)\", etc. Each count is a cause of action. So likely multiple entries: \"Violation of the INA and the APA\", \"Violation of the APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Action\", \"Violation of the APA – Notice and Comment Rulemaking\", \"Violation of the INA and the APA; Petition for Mandamus\". So four cause of actions.\n\nStatutory or constitutional basis: Need to list statutes/constitutional provisions underlying claims. Likely references: Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2), Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., 5 U.S.C. § 702, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), 5 U.S.C. § 555(b), 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, etc. Also maybe 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1361, etc. Need to capture all distinct statutes/provisions referenced. We'll extract each distinct statutory reference.\n\nRemedy sought: The relief requested: In \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\": items a-h list. The remedy includes: jurisdiction, class certification, appointment, declaratory relief, injunctions: deny SIJS, remove, notice, delay, rescind improper denials, reopen petitions, attorneys fees, etc. This is many items. Probably we should list each remedy as separate value: e.g., \"Assume jurisdiction over this matter\", \"Certify the case as a class action\", \"Appoint Plaintiffs as representatives of the class\", \"Declare that Defendants’ denial of SIJS ... is contrary to state and federal law and violates the INA and APA\", \"Declare that the imposition of a new requirement ... is arbitrary\", \"Permanently enjoin Defendants from: ... (several sub-actions)\", \"Rescind the improper denials ... and order USCIS to reopen\", \"Award plaintiffs counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees\", \"Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate\". We can treat each bullet as a separate entry. Also the injunction items i-iv are sub-bullets; we might treat them as separate entries as well.\n\nWe need to retrieve evidence for each. We have the complaint text in the read_document. We need to capture for each entry the text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe need to identify the tokens for each entry. The complaint is 16,773 tokens; we have the whole read. We need to locate each relevant section. The \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" lines: from page 24? The excerpt includes \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" at page 24 line 9. It lists COUNT I... etc. We should capture each count. For each count, the heading line: \"COUNT I (Violation of the INA and the APA)\" etc. Then the body. We can take the heading as the value.\n\nStatutory basis: we need to list each statutory reference. We need to extract all distinct references. We can search for patterns like \"8 U.S.C.\", \"5 U.S.C.\", \"28 U.S.C.\", etc. Let's search.\n\nWe could use search_document_regex for pattern \"8 U.S.C.\" etc. Let's search the entire complaint.\n\nBut we already have the complaint read; but we need to capture evidence.\n\nWe may need to read more of the complaint to capture all statutory references. We have the complaint fully read, but we might need to identify all references. It contains many references. We could search for \"U.S.C.\" or specifically \"8 U.S.C.\" \"5 U.S.C.\" \"28 U.S.C.\" \"APA\" etc.\n\nBetter approach: use search_document_regex on complaint for pattern \"8 U.S.C.[0-9]+\". But need to capture context. Let's do search_document_regex across \"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" for pattern \"8 U.S.C. § [0-9]+\" etc. Use flags IGNORECASE. Limit top_k maybe 20.\n\nBut we have already read the document; but we need to avoid re-reading entire. But we can search; it will return matches with context. That is okay.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"APA\" or \"Administrative Procedure Act\". But we need to capture all. Let's search for \"U.S.C.\" pattern.\n\nWe'll do search_document_regex on complaint with pattern: \"U.S.C. § [0-9]+(?:[a-z])?\" capturing numbers.\n\nBut we also need to capture \"APA\" references. We can search for \"APA\" or \"Administrative Procedure Act\". Might be enough to capture.\n\nWe also need the remedy entries. The remedy section is in the \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" part. We need to extract each bullet. We can search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" and capture the subsequent lines. We can search for pattern \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" and then capture following context.\n\nThus action: search_document_regex for pattern \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" with context maybe 200 tokens. That will give us the section. Then we can parse the bullet list.\n\nAlso search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" pattern to capture the counts.\n\nAlso search for \"Statutory\" maybe.\n\nThus we can do one search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" and one search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" and one search for \"U.S.C.\" to capture statutes.\n\nBut we may need to combine. We can do a search for each pattern separately. But we want to use only one action per turn. We can choose search_document_regex for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" to extract counts. That will give context. Then we can parse counts.\n\nWe also need remedy and statutes. But we can use multiple searches. But we have to do one action per turn. So first do search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\". Then next turn we can search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". Then next for \"U.S.C.\".\n\nBut we might combine multiple patterns in one search_document_regex call: doc_names array? We can specify doc_names: [\"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\"], pattern: \"(CAUSES OF ACTION|PRAYER FOR RELIEF|U.S.C. § [0-9]+)\" with flags IGNORECASE. But the pattern might capture context but we need separate matches. The search returns top_k matches per document. We can set top_k high. But each match will include context around each match. That might produce overlapping contexts but that's fine. Then we can parse.\n\nThus let's do one search_document_regex for pattern capturing all three. But we might need to capture context for each match. We can set context_tokens 200. That will return matches for each phrase. Then we can parse.\n\nThen we can use append_checklist to add entries.\n\nThus action: search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\"],\"pattern\":\"CAUSES OF ACTION|PRAYER FOR RELIEF|U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. § [0-9]+\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief"], "pattern": "CAUSES OF ACTION|PRAYER FOR RELIEF|U\\.S\\.C\\. § [0-9]+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 21521, "completion_tokens": 1644, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

From the text, we need to extract:\n\n- Cause_of_Action: The legal claim(s) asserted. In the complaint, the causes of action are listed near the end. We saw \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" section. We need to capture each cause. Likely multiple causes: Violation of INA, Violation of APA, etc. We need to extract each cause. Also, maybe each cause includes a description? But the checklist expects just the claim(s) asserted, theory. So probably just the titles: \"Violation of the INA and the APA\", \"Violation of the APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Action\", \"Violation of the APA – Notice and Comment Rulemaking\", \"Violation of the INA and APA; Petition for Mandamus\". Also earlier \"Cause of Action\" section. There's also \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" header. Also \"CAUSE of Action\" earlier maybe not present. The \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" section enumerates 4 counts. So we need to extract those counts as values.\n\n- Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case: The governing statutes or constitutional provisions underlying the claims, including specific clauses and amendments. So list of laws cited: 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2), 5 U.S.C. § 701, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, 5 U.S.C. § 702, 28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), 5 U.S.C. § 553, also 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)(i)-(ii). Also maybe 28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202, 5 U.S.C. § 702, 28 U.S.C. § 1361. Also mention APA (Administrative Procedure Act). Also maybe \"International\" but not necessary. Also constitutional provisions: 5 U.S.C. § 702 (maybe not). Maybe also \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\". Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" is part of APA. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)\". Also \"5 U.S.C. § 553\" for notice and comment. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" for deference. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" maybe. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" repeated. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" also. So we need to capture each statutory or constitutional basis. So each separate value.\n\n- Remedy_Sought: Relief requested. In the complaint, the relief: \"declared injunctive relief\", \"declaratory relief\", \"rescind improper denials\", \"reopen SIJS petitions\", \"enjoin Defendants from denying SIJS petitions\", \"rescind denials\", \"order USCIS to reopen petitions\", \"award attorneys' fees\", etc. Need to capture each. The \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" section lists items a to i. We can extract each item as a remedy. Also other items: \"Assume jurisdiction\", \"certify the case as class action\", \"appoint plaintiffs as representatives\", \"declare that Defendants’ denial ... is contrary to law\", etc. We'll capture each as separate remedy.\n\nWe need to read the \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" and \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" sections. We have the text in the read_document chunks. Let's locate them.\n\nFrom read_document, we saw \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" at about tokens 2626. The text snippet shows:\n\n```\nCAUSES OF ACTION \n COUNT I \n (Violation of the INA and the APA) \n 85.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth herein.\n...\n COUNT II \n (Violation of the APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Action) \n...\n COUNT III \n (Violation of the APA – Notice and Comment Rulemaking) \n...\n COUNT IV \n (Violation of the INA and APA; Petition for Mandamus) \n```\n\nWe should capture each count title as a cause of action.\n\nAlso earlier \"Cause of Action\" may appear. But we saw \"Cause of Action\" earlier in the \"INTRODUCTION\" maybe not relevant. We can capture the \"CASES OF ACTION\" section.\n\nNext, \"Statutory or Constitutional Basis\". We can extract all statutes cited in the \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" section. They include:\n\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1)\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2)\n- 5 U.S.C. § 701\n- 28 U.S.C. § 1331\n- 28 U.S.C. § 1361\n- 5 U.S.C. § 702\n- 28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202\n- 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)\n- 5 U.S.C. § 553\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)(i)-(ii)\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1) appears again\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2) again\n- 5 U.S.C. § 702 again\n- 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) again\n- 5 U.S.C. § 553 again\n- 5 U.S.C. § 702 again\n- 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) again\n- Also 5 U.S.C. § 702 maybe.\n\nAlso APA is a statute: The Administrative Procedure Act. We could include as \"Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\". Also possibly 5 U.S.C. § 701. Also 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, 28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202. Also maybe \"U.S.C. § 701 et seq.\" but we can mention 5 U.S.C. § 701. etc.\n\nWe also need to capture the \"Remedy sought\" items. The \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" section lists items a-i. Let's capture each as an entry.\n\nFrom the text:\n\n```\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray for this Court to: \n a.  Assume the jurisdiction over this matter; \n b.  Certify the case as class action as proposed herein; \n c.  Appoint Plaintiffs as representatives of the class;  \n d.  Declare that Defendants’ denial of SIJS and imposition of a new requirement for SIJS relief is contrary to state and federal law and violates the Immigration and Nationality and Administrative Procedure Act;  \n e.  Declare that the imposition of a new requirement for SIJS eligibility and resulting denial of Plaintiffs’ and the putative class members’ SIJS petitions by USCIS were arbitrary;  \n f.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from:  \n   i.  Denying SIJS petitions on the grounds that a Washington state court does not have jurisdiction or authority to reunify an 18 to 20 year old with his or her parents; \n   ii.  Initiating removal proceedings against or removing any SIJS petitioner who has been placed into the custody of a state agency or department pursuant to RCW § 13.40.300, appointed a guardian pursuant to RCW § 13.90.010 et seq., or placed into extended foster care under RCW § 13.34.267, and whose SIJS petition has been denied on the grounds that the Washington state court did not have authority to “reunify” an individual who has reached age 18 with his or her parents; \n   iii.  Providing less than 14 days’ notice to Plaintiffs’ counsel before Defendants take any adverse adjudicatory or enforcement action against any of the Plaintiffs or members of the Proposed class during the pendency of this litigation; \n   iv.  Delaying the adjudication of class members’ SIJS petitions beyond the statutory 180-day deadline for rendering a decision on such petitions; \n g.  Rescind the improper denials of Plaintiffs’ and class members’ SIJS petitions, and order USCIS to reopen their petitions; \n h.  Award Plaintiffs’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, and any other applicable statute or regulation; \n i.  Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate. \n```\n\nWe need each remedy: e.g., \"Assume jurisdiction\", \"Certify class action\", \"Appoint plaintiffs as representatives\", \"Declare denial contrary to law\", \"Declare arbitrary\", \"Enjoin defendants from denying SIJS petitions\", \"Enjoin defendants from initiating removal proceedings\", \"Enjoin defendants from providing less than 14 days' notice\", \"Enjoin defendants from delaying adjudication beyond 180 days\", \"Rescind denials and order reopening\", \"Award attorneys' fees\", \"Grant further relief\".\n\nAlso earlier in \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" we had \"Assume the jurisdiction over this matter\" etc.\n\nAlso earlier, in the \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" section, there might also be \"REMEDY Sought\" referenced in the claims. But we will capture the above.\n\nNow we need to extract evidence. We have the text of the complaint loaded from 0-16773. We need to provide evidence for each extracted value. For each value, we need to include evidence with text (verbatim snippet), source_document, and location (page). Let's identify location pages: For \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" appears around page 23? Actually we saw \"CASE\" at page 23. The matches show \"page 23 of 30\" earlier. So \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" appears on page 23? Let's look at the snippet near match 20: \"Case 2:19-cv-00321-RSL Document 1 Filed 03/05/19 Page 23 of 30\". Then the text \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" appears. So location: page 23. Good.\n\nSimilarly, \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" appears near the end, on page 28 maybe. Let's check snippet near match 19? Actually the \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" appears earlier but after the \"COUNT IV\" section. After that, at the bottom of the complaint we see \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" preceding the signature lines. The \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" appears on page 28 of 30, as we saw in the snippet near the bottom: \"Case 2:19-cv-00321-RSL Document 1 Filed 03/05/19 Page 28 of 30\". So location: page 28.\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each extracted value. For each cause of action: the text \"COUNT I (Violation of the INA and the APA)\" etc. Provide that snippet. For statutory basis: gather each statute. We can provide evidence: the list of statutes as cited in the \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" section. Provide the snippet that includes them, maybe the entire section. For remedy sought: each item from \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" with the text.\n\nWe must produce a single function call: likely append_checklist with patches for each key. Since we have not extracted any yet, we need to append entries. We should list each extracted entry under each key with evidence.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each value. For example, for Cause_of_Action: \"Violation of the INA and the APA\" with evidence text snippet: maybe \"COUNT I (Violation of the INA and the APA)\". For each cause, we need separate entries.\n\nFor Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case: each statute. For each, we need evidence snippet: e.g. \"8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)\" etc. We can gather from the \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" section.\n\nFor Remedy_Sought: each item from \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" with evidence snippet. We'll provide each separately.\n\nWe should ensure evidence location includes page number. For each snippet, we can provide the page number. We'll use \"Page 23 of 30\" for causes and statutes, \"Page 28 of 30\" for remedies.\n\nWe need to include the text snippet exactly from the document. We'll need to extract the relevant text. We have the snippet from the \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" section. Let's capture the lines:\n\n```\nCAUSES OF ACTION \n COUNT I \n (Violation of the INA and the APA) \n 85.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth herein. \n 86.  The INA deems a child eligible for SIJS if he or she is (1) under 21 years of age at \n ...\n 88.  ... etc\n COUNT II \n (Violation of the APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Action) \n ...\n COUNT III \n (Violation of the APA – Notice and Comment Rulemaking) \n ...\n COUNT IV \n (Violation of the INA and APA; Petition for Mandamus) \n ...\n```\n\nAlso the statutes are mentioned in the text: e.g., \"8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)\", \"8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1)\", \"8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 701\", \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\", \"28 U.S.C. § 1361\", \"5 U.S.C. § 702\", \"28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202\", \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 553\". We can use the snippet that lists them. For example, the snippet in match 3 includes a list: \"28 U.S.C. § 1331 ... 28 U.S.C. § 1361 ... 5 U.S.C. § 702 ... 28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202\". That snippet is evidence for the statutes. Also match 1 includes \"8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)(i)-(ii)\" etc. We'll use that snippet as evidence.\n\nFor remedy sought: we can use the snippet from \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" block.\n\nNow, we need to produce the append_checklist call.\n\nWe must include patch array with each key and extracted entries.\n\nWe must ensure each entry has evidence array with at least one evidence object containing text, source_document, location.\n\nsource_document: \"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\". location: page number.\n\nWe need to provide text exactly as snippet. We can include the snippet lines. It's okay if we include them trimmed.\n\nLet's prepare the entries.\n\nCause_of_Action:\n\n- \"Violation of the INA and the APA\"\n- \"Violation of the APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Action\"\n- \"Violation of the APA – Notice and Comment Rulemaking\"\n- \"Violation of the INA and APA; Petition for Mandamus\"\n\nWe can extract each from the \"COUNT\" lines.\n\nEvidence: snippet \"COUNT I (Violation of the INA and the APA)\" etc. Provide location page 23.\n\nStatutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case:\n\nList of statutes:\n\n1. \"8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)\"\n2. \"8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1)\"\n3. \"8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2)\"\n4. \"5 U.S.C. § 701\"\n5. \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\"\n6. \"28 U.S.C. § 1361\"\n7. \"5 U.S.C. § 702\"\n8. \"28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202\"\n9. \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)\"\n10. \"5 U.S.C. § 553\"\n\nWe can also include \"Administrative Procedure Act\" but maybe not needed. But we can include as a basis too. But the statutes above cover.\n\nEvidence: snippet showing these statutes. For example, match 3 snippet: lines 18-22 show the statutes. Also match 1 snippet includes 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)(i)-(ii). We'll use the snippet from match 3 for multiple statutes.\n\nRemedy_Sought:\n\nList each remedy:\n\n- \"Assume jurisdiction over this matter\"\n- \"Certify the case as class action as proposed herein\"\n- \"Appoint Plaintiffs as representatives of the class\"\n- \"Declare that Defendants’ denial of SIJS and imposition of a new requirement for SIJS relief is contrary to state and federal law and violates the Immigration and Nationality and Administrative Procedure Act\"\n- \"Declare that the imposition of a new requirement for SIJS eligibility and resulting denial of Plaintiffs’ and the putative class members’ SIJS petitions by USCIS were arbitrary\"\n- \"Enjoin Defendants from denying SIJS petitions on the grounds that a Washington state court does not have jurisdiction or authority to reunify an 18 to 20 year old with his or her parents\"\n- \"Enjoin Defendants from initiating removal proceedings against or removing any SIJS petitioner who has been placed into the custody of a state agency or department pursuant to RCW § 13.40.300, appointed a guardian pursuant to RCW § 13.90.010 et seq., or placed into extended foster care under RCW § 13.34.267, and whose SIJS petition has been denied on the grounds that the Washington state court did not have authority to “reunify” an individual who has reached age 18 with his or her parents\"\n- \"Enjoin Defendants from providing less than 14 days’ notice to Plaintiffs’ counsel before Defendants take any adverse adjudicatory or enforcement action against any of the Plaintiffs or members of the Proposed class during the pendency of this litigation\"\n- \"Enjoin Defendants from delaying adjudication of class members’ SIJS petitions beyond the statutory 180-day deadline for rendering a decision on such petitions\"\n- \"Rescind the improper denials of Plaintiffs’ and class members’ SIJS petitions, and order USCIS to reopen their petitions\"\n- \"Award Plaintiffs’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, and any other applicable statute or regulation\"\n- \"Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate\"\n\nWe can combine the enjoin items into separate entries or keep them separate. The checklist expects \"Remedy_Sought\" maybe multiple values. We'll list each separately.\n\nEvidence: snippet from \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" block. Location page 28.\n\nNow produce the append_checklist call.\n\nWe need to ensure each entry's extracted field has an array of evidence objects. For each entry, we can provide single evidence. But we could also provide multiple evidence. We'll provide one.\n\nWe should include the text field exactly as the extracted value. For each, we need to make sure the text is trimmed but accurate. We'll use the text as in the document snippet.\n\nFor example, for \"Violation of the INA and the APA\", we can use that text exactly.\n\nFor statutes, we need to extract each text exactly as appears.\n\nLet's capture the snippet for statutes. We saw match 3 snippet:\n\n```\n 18  11.  Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as a civil \n 19  action arising under the laws of the United States, and the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962, \n 20  28 U.S.C. § 1361. The Court may grant declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n 21  §§ 2201-2202, 5 U.S.C. § 702, and 28 U.S.C. § 1361. The United States has waived its sovereign \n 22  immunity pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n```\n\nAlso earlier match 1:\n\n```\n 9  it is not in the youth’s best interest to be returned to their country of origin. See 8 U.S.C. § \n 10  1101(a)(27)(J)(i)-(ii). In each Plaintiff’s case, a Washington state court has made these requisite \n 11  findings...\n 13  ... 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2). \n```\n\nAlso match 2 snippet had:\n\n```\n 12  SIJS, to be “an unmarried person under twenty-one years of age.” 8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1). \n 14  ... 8 C.F.R. § 204.11(c)(1). \n```\n\nAlso match 6 snippet had:\n\n```\n 5  ... 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n```\n\nBut that is not part of statutes for claims. But we can include only those relevant to claims.\n\nWe need to include the statutes that are the governing statutes. The \"Statutory or Constitutional Basis\" includes the statutes underlying the claims. So we should include at least the main ones: 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2), 5 U.S.C. § 701, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, 5 U.S.C. § 702, 28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), 5 U.S.C. § 553. Also maybe mention APA but not needed.\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each. For each statute, we can use the snippet from match 3 that includes them. But match 3 snippet includes 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, 28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202, 5 U.S.C. § 702. That covers some. For others we can use match 1 snippet for 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)(i)-(ii) and 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2). For 8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1) we can use match 2 snippet. For 5 U.S.C. § 701 maybe not directly in snippet. But we can still include as evidence from the \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" header maybe? The snippet shows \"5 U.S.C. § 701\" earlier? Actually the match 3 snippet includes \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" but not 5 U.S.C. § 701. But the \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" section might mention 5 U.S.C. § 701 earlier. Let's search. The \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" text earlier might include \"5 U.S.C. § 701\" in the \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" or earlier. We saw in match 3 snippet: \"5 U.S.C. § 702\". But we didn't see 5 U.S.C. § 701. But we saw in earlier match 3 snippet: \"5 U.S.C. § 702\". The \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" might mention 5 U.S.C. § 701 in earlier part of the complaint. But we can still include it as an extracted value because it's part of the statutes underlying the claims. We can provide evidence from a snippet that shows 5 U.S.C. § 701. We saw match 3 snippet includes \"5 U.S.C. § 702\", \"28 U.S.C. § 1361\". But we didn't see 5 U.S.C. § 701. But maybe earlier in the complaint, there is mention of 5 U.S.C. § 701. Let's search. But we have not used search_document_regex. We could do a search for \"5 U.S.C. § 701\". But we can guess that it's included. Let's search quickly.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\"pattern\":\"5 U.S.C. § 701\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"]}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "pattern": "5 U.S.C. § 701", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 26350, "completion_tokens": 5262, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The complaint has these. We have read entire complaint. We need to scan for cause of action. The complaint likely lists causes of action in section \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" with count I, II, III, IV. We saw part of the text: \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" heading at line 89? Actually in snippet around line 88-90. We saw \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" earlier. Let's check the snippet: In step 6 matches, we saw \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" near line 88? The snippet: after \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" there was \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" heading. We need to extract each cause: \"Violation of the INA and the APA\", \"Violation of the APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Action\", \"Violation of the APA – Notice and Comment Rulemaking\", \"Violation of the INA and APA; Petition for Mandamus\"? Actually we saw 4 counts: Count I, Count II, Count III, Count IV. Each count lists the cause. We need to extract each cause text as a value. Also Statutory or Constitutional Basis: likely the statutes referenced: 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J), 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2), 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, 5 U.S.C. § 702, 28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202, 5 U.S.C. § 701, 5 U.S.C. § 702, 28 U.S.C. § 1361 etc. But we need to identify the governing statutes or constitutional provisions underlying the claims. That may involve listing each statute cited in the causes of action. The complaint text includes many citations. We can extract the statutes referenced in the causes of action. For each cause, list the statutes. But the checklist item is a single field: \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\". It likely expects all statutes that form basis. We can provide each distinct statute as separate extracted entry. But the description: \"The governing statute(s) or constitutional provision(s) underlying the claims, including specific clauses and amendments when constitutional.\" So likely multiple entries.\n\nRemedy_Sought: The relief requested: declaratory relief, injunctive relief, permanent injunction, etc. The complaint includes \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" with list of relief: assume jurisdiction, certify class, appoint plaintiffs, declare, permanently enjoin defendants from certain actions, rescind denials, award fees, etc. So we extract remedy items.\n\nThus we need to parse text to extract these items. We have full complaint text. We can perform a targeted search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" heading to find the causes.\n\nWe should run a search_document_regex on the complaint for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" or \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" with a pattern to capture the block. But we already saw part of it. We might just read the portion with the causes. But we have entire complaint read. We can use search_document_regex to find pattern \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" and then maybe capture the following lines until next heading like \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". But easier: we can manually extract from the snippet we saw earlier. We saw:\n\n\"CAUSES OF ACTION\" at line 88? Let's find snippet: In step 6, we saw:\n\n```\n  89.  COUNT I \n   (Violation of the INA and the APA) \n  85.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \n  86.  herein. \n  87.  The INA deems a child eligible for SIJS if he or she is (1) under 21 years of age at \n  88.  the time the petition is filed; (2) unmarried; ...\n```\n\nWait earlier we saw:\n\n```\n  88.  COUNT I \n   (Violation of the INA and the APA) \n  85.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \n  86.  herein. \n```\n\nBut the snippet seems out of order. Let's search within the complaint for \"COUNT I\" etc. But we can use search_document_regex for \"COUNT I\" and \"COUNT II\" etc. But easier: read the complaint around the \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" section by reading tokens around that heading; we have entire complaint so we can read again from token maybe 8000-9000? But we can just use search_document_regex to find \"CAUSES OF ACTION\". That will return context including the block. Let's do that.\n\nWe also need to extract remedy: \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" heading. Search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". That will give block with list of relief.\n\nAlso need to extract statutory basis: likely from the same \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" block, we can parse the statutes. But we might also search for \"8 U.S.C.\" etc.\n\nBetter approach: Search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" to get block. Then parse manually for cause items. For the statutory basis, we can search for \"8 U.S.C.\" within the entire complaint. But we need to gather all statutes. But we will gather from the cause section. Could also search for \"5 U.S.C.\" etc. But we can gather all statutory citations present. The instructions: list all distinct values that directly match the item's definition. For statutory basis, we should list each statute that is the governing basis for the claims. So we should list each distinct citation like \"8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)\", \"8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2)\", \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\", \"28 U.S.C. § 1361\", \"5 U.S.C. § 702\", \"28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202\", \"5 U.S.C. § 701\", etc. Also maybe \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" appears twice. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" (the same). But okay.\n\nAlso \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" is also the APA injunctive relief. \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" and \"28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202\" are injunctive relief. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" is also part of the APA. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" is repeated. Also \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\" is jurisdiction. Also \"28 U.S.C. § 1361\" for mandamus and venue. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" appears again for injunctive relief. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" is part of the APA. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" again. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" appears again. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" again. But we can list each unique.\n\nAlso \"8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1)\" appears in the statutory basis. Also \"8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)\" etc. Also \"8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2)\". Also \"8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2)\" is the 180-day requirement. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" maybe repeated. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" again. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" again. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" again. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\". Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" again.\n\nAlso \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" appears in the remedy. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" also part of the APA injunctive relief. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" appears again. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" repeated.\n\nAlso \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" appears in the \"Remedy_Sought\" maybe.\n\nAlso \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" appears in the \"Remedy_Sought\".\n\nAlso \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" appears again.\n\nAlso \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" repeated.\n\nAlso \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" appears again.\n\nAlso \"5 U.S.C. § 702\" repeated.\n\nOk.\n\nNow, we need to produce JSON. We need to call append_checklist with patch for each key with extracted entries. We have not extracted any yet. So we need to perform search_document_regex to get the relevant blocks for causes and remedy and statutory basis. Let's do that.\n\nWe'll search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" in the complaint. Then \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". Then maybe \"Statutory or Constitutional Basis\" can be extracted from the same cause section. But we might also need to search for \"8 U.S.C.\" etc. But we can extract from cause block.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief for pattern \"CAUSES OF ACTION\". Use doc_name \"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\". We can set flags: IGNORECASE. top_k maybe 1. context_tokens maybe 500. That will give block containing causes.\n\nSimilarly search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". Then maybe search for \"8 U.S.C.\" to capture statutes. But we can also parse from causes. But might be easier to search for \"8 U.S.C.\" and \"5 U.S.C.\" etc. But we can just include all unique citations.\n\nWe can do two search_document_regex calls or one combined? We can call search twice. But we need to choose one action per turn. We can do a search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION|PRAYER FOR RELIEF|8 U.S.C.|5 U.S.C.\" but pattern might be too broad. But we can search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" first. After that, we will parse. But we need to get the text to extract values. But we can extract from the search output. But we need to parse manually. We have the snippet from step 6 that includes causes. But we might need to refine. The snippet shows the causes but not all lines. But we can use search to get the block.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\". Then we will parse the returned matches. Let's do that.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\"pattern\":\"CAUSES OF ACTION\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":500}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "pattern": "CAUSES OF ACTION", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 500}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 26645, "completion_tokens": 2328, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Also maybe other claims. The \"Statutory or Constitutional Basis\" includes INA, APA, U.S.C. 1101, 1232, 1101(a)(27)(J), etc. Remedy sought: injunctive relief, declaratory relief, specific performance? From prayer for relief: injunction, declaratory relief, rescind denials, reopen petitions, attorney fees, etc.\n\nWe need to read more of the complaint to capture all cause of action titles and statutory basis, remedy sought. We have read up to token 16773. The CAUSES OF ACTION section appears around tokens 13096-13596. That is within read window. We should read that area to extract. We need to read the specific lines. We should call read_document with tokens 13096-13596 or a bit earlier to capture context. Or use search_document_regex to find \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" which we already did and got context. The context snippet shows the CAUSES OF ACTION header and some lines. The snippet shows Count I etc. We may need to read more lines to capture all counts. It shows up to Count I lines, but not further counts. The snippet ends at Count I lines. It might not show Count II etc. So we need to read more tokens to capture all counts.

In the complaint, we saw \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" heading and then counts: \"COUNT I (Violation of the INA and the APA)\", \"COUNT II (Violation of the APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Action)\", \"COUNT III (Violation of the APA – Notice and Comment Rulemaking)\", \"COUNT IV (Violation of the INA and APA; Petition for Mandamus)\". These are the causes of action. We need to extract each as a separate entry. Provide evidence snippet with location.\n\nAlso statutory basis: In each count, statutory basis is given: e.g., Count I: INA and APA (so statutes: 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(b)(1), etc. Also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). Also 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J), 1232(d)(6), etc. Also maybe 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 1361, 2201-2202, 5 U.S.C. § 702. But the Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case likely refers to the statutes underlying the claims. So we need to list each statutory basis: e.g., \"Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 1101(a)(27)(J), § 1101(b)(1), § 1232(d)(6)\" etc. Also APA 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) etc. Also maybe 28 U.S.C. § 1331, § 1361, etc. Also 5 U.S.C. § 702. But we should capture all distinct statutes mentioned in the complaint that are the basis for the claims.\n\nRemedy sought: The \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" section lists many items: \"a. Assume jurisdiction...\", \"b. Certify the case as class action...\", \"c. Appoint Plaintiffs...\", \"d. Declare that Defendants’ denial of SIJS ...\", \"e. Declare that the imposition ...\", \"f. Permanently enjoin Defendants from: ...\", \"g. Rescind improper denials ...\", \"h. Award attorneys’ fees ...\", \"i. Grant such further relief ...\". So remedy sought includes injunctive relief, declaratory relief, provisional and permanent injunctions, rescission, attorneys' fees, etc.\n\nWe need to extract each distinct remedy.\n\nThus next action: read_document with a token range that contains \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" section, maybe tokens 14000-15000? But we already read 13096-14000 tokens. The PRAYER FOR RELIEF appears after that. We need to read further. Complaint tokens total 16773. So we can read remaining tokens 14000-16773. Let's read range 14000-16773. Then we parse.\n\nThus next action: read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\"start_token\":14000,\"end_token\":16773}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "start_token": 14000, "end_token": 16773}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 17419, "completion_tokens": 761, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have read entire complaint. We can locate sections: \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" shows count I (Violation of INA and APA), count II (Violation of APA - Arbitrary and Capricious Action), count III (Violation of APA - Notice and Comment Rulemaking), count IV (Violation of INA and APA; Petition for Mandamus). So Cause_of_Action includes those. Also maybe other cause items? There's \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" heading. So we need to extract each cause. Provide each with evidence. Also Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case: likely the statutes cited: 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(b)(1), 1101(a)(27)(J), 1232(d)(6), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) etc. Also 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1361, 2201-2202, 702, 1361. Also 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2). Also 5 U.S.C. § 553. Also 5 U.S.C. § 555(b). Also 5 U.S.C. § 553. Also 5 U.S.C. § 553? Already. Also 5 U.S.C. § 553? Yes. Also 5 U.S.C. § 553. But we must include specific clauses and amendments. So compile list of statutory/constitutional bases used in the complaint.\n\nRemedy_Sought: The prayer for relief lists relief: assume jurisdiction, certify class action, appoint plaintiffs as representatives, declare violations, permanently enjoin defendants from certain actions, rescind improper denials, order USCIS to reopen petitions, award attorneys’ fees, grant further relief. Also may include injunctive relief. So we need to extract remedies.\n\nWe must use append_checklist. Provide evidence snippets. We can extract from the read text. We need to provide evidence location: maybe token ranges? But we can just give location like \"page 24\" etc. Provide text snippet.\n\nWe have entire complaint text; we can provide snippets like:\n\nCause_of_Action: \"Violation of the INA and the APA\" (Count I)\nAlso \"Violation of the APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Action\" (Count II)\n\"Violation of the APA – Notice and Comment Rulemaking\" (Count III)\n\"Violation of the INA and APA; Petition for Mandamus\" (Count IV)\n\nStatutory bases: list each statute with clause. Provide evidence snippet: e.g., \"See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(b)(1), 1101(a)(27)(J), and 1232(d)(6).\" Also \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)\" etc. Provide snippet.\n\nRemedy: list each item from prayer: a., b., c., d., e., f. Etc. Provide snippet.\n\nWe must ensure each extracted entry has evidence. We can batch multiple keys in one patch.\n\nLet's craft append_checklist with patch array containing three keys. For each key, extracted array of entries.\n\nWe need to include evidence array for each value. Provide text snippet and source_document and location. Use source_document \"Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\". For location, use page numbers or token ranges? We have page references like \"Page 24 of 30\" etc. Use that.\n\nWe need to provide the evidence text exactly as in the snippet. For cause of action, we can provide the snippet lines containing \"COUNT I (Violation of the INA and the APA)\" etc.\n\nSimilarly for statutory bases, snippet lines with \"See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(b)(1), 1101(a)(27)(J), and 1232(d)(6).\" Provide also listing of other statutes.\n\nFor remedy: snippet lines from prayer of relief.\n\nWe must ensure each entry has evidence with text. Provide maybe one evidence per entry.\n\nLet's craft.\n\nNote: For statutory bases, maybe each statute as separate value? The requirement: \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case: The governing statute(s) or constitutional provision(s) underlying the claims, including specific clauses and amendments when constitutional.\" So we can list each statute as separate value. Provide evidence for each.\n\nList:\n\n- 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(b)(1)\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(6)\n- 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)\n- 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\n- 5 U.S.C. § 706(1)\n- 5 U.S.C. § 553\n- 5 U.S.C. § 555(b)\n- 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331\n- 28 U.S.C. § 1361\n- 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202\n- 5 U.S.C. § 702\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2)\n\nWe may also include 5 U.S.C. § 553 (Notice and Comment Rulemaking). Already included. Also 5 U.S.C. § 553. Also 5 U.S.C. § 553? yes.\n\nAlso maybe 5 U.S.C. § 553? repeated.\n\nAlso 5 U.S.C. § 553 - same.\n\nAlso 5 U.S.C. § 553? yes.\n\nAlso 5 U.S.C. § 553: we have.\n\nAlso 5 U.S.C. § 553: Not necessary multiple.\n\nAlso 5 U.S.C. § 553: repeated.\n\nOk.\n\nNow remedy entries:\n\n- a. Assume jurisdiction over this matter.\n- b. Certify the case as class action as proposed herein.\n- c. Appoint Plaintiffs as representatives of the class.\n- d. Declare that Defendants’ denial of SIJS and imposition of a new requirement for SIJS relief is contrary to state and federal law and violates the Immigration and Nationality and Administrative Procedure Act.\n- e. Declare that the imposition of a new requirement for SIJS eligibility and resulting denial of Plaintiffs’ and the putative class members’ SIJS petitions by USCIS were arbitrary.\n- f. Permanently enjoin Defendants from: (multiple subpoints) but we can treat each as separate? The requirement says each extracted entry separate. We may list each subpoint separately: i. Denying SIJS petitions on the grounds that a Washington state court does not have jurisdiction or authority to reunify an 18 to 20 year old with his or her parents; ii. Initiating removal proceedings against or removing any SIJS petitioner who was placed into the custody of a state agency or department pursuant to RCW § 13.40.300, appointed a guardian pursuant to RCW § 13.90.010 et seq., or placed into extended foster care under RCW § 13.34.267, and whose SIJS petition has been denied on the grounds that the Washington state court did not have authority to “reunify” an individual who has reached age 18 with his or her parents; iii. Providing less than 14 days’ notice to Plaintiffs’ counsel before Defendants take any adverse adjudicatory or enforcement action against any of the Plaintiffs or members of the Proposed class during the pendency of this litigation; iv. Delaying the adjudication of class members’ SIJS petitions beyond the statutory 180-day deadline for rendering a decision on such petitions.\n- g. Rescind the improper denials of Plaintiffs’ and class members’ SIJS petitions, and order USCIS to reopen their petitions.\n- h. Award Plaintiffs’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, and any other applicable statute or regulation.\n- i. Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate.\n\nAlso maybe remedy includes injunctive relief, declaratory relief. But we can capture above.\n\nWe need evidence snippet for each. We can use the prayer text lines. Provide snippet for each.\n\nWe might need to split subpoints into separate values; but maybe combine each subpoint into one value string. But \"each extracted entry separate\" - better to separate each subpoint as a distinct value. So many entries.\n\nBut we need to be careful not to overdo. But requirement: every distinct value of each checklist item. For remedy, each distinct relief request. So each subpoint counts. So we will create many entries.\n\nAlso maybe include \"Assume jurisdiction over this matter\" as one entry.\n\nOk.\n\nNow create append_checklist patch with keys: Cause_of_Action, Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case, Remedy_Sought.\n\nFor each key, extracted array with entries.\n\nEach entry: evidence array with snippet, source_document, location. We need to provide text exactly. Let's use snippet from the provided text.\n\nWe need to include for cause of action: snippet lines:\n\n\"COUNT I (Violation of the INA and the APA)\"\n\"COUNT II (Violation of the APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Action)\"\n\"COUNT III (Violation of the APA – Notice and Comment Rulemaking)\"\n\"COUNT IV (Violation of the INA and APA; Petition for Mandamus)\"\n\nWe can use those.\n\nFor statutory bases: snippet lines like:\n\n\"See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(b)(1), 1101(a)(27)(J), and 1232(d)(6).\"\n\"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).\"\n\"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\"\n\"5 U.S.C. § 706(1).\"\n\"5 U.S.C. § 553.\"\n\"5 U.S.C. § 555(b).\"\n\"28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1361.\"\n\"28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202.\"\n\"5 U.S.C. § 702.\"\n\"8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2).\"\n\nWe should provide separate evidence for each.\n\nRemedy: snippet lines from prayer. Provide each subpoint text.\n\nLet's craft the JSON.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Cause_of_Action\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Violation of the INA and the APA\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"COUNT I (Violation of the INA and the APA)\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint -

Are there other documents that might add more values? The checklist items: Cause_of_Action, Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case, Remedy_Sought. We have extracted from complaint. But other documents might contain additional claims, statutes, or remedies. For completeness, we should check other documents.\n\nWe should search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" or other cause statements in other documents, but likely not; the complaint has the primary cause of action. Statutory basis may include more statutes in other documents, e.g., orders may cite statutes but not new ones. Remedy sought might be expanded in orders? However, remedy sought is likely in complaint.\n\nHowever, we need to be thorough: check order granting class certification, preliminary injunction, etc. Those orders may recite relief but not new remedies. But they might add new statutory basis if they reference new statutes for relief. But it's unlikely.\n\nBut we should check at least for any additional statutory references not captured, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1361, 5 U.S.C. § 702, etc. Already captured.\n\nWe might have missed 5 U.S.C. § 553 as \"5 U.S.C. § 553\" is present. 5 U.S.C. § 555(b) present. 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). We also have 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1361, 2201-2202. 5 U.S.C. § 702. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(b)(1), 1101(a)(27)(J), 1232(d)(6). Also 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2). Good.\n\nCould there be other statutes like 28 U.S.C. § 1361, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, etc. Already covered.\n\nWe might have missed 28 U.S.C. § 1361 is included. 28 U.S.C. § 1331 included. 28 U.S.C. § 1361 included. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 included. 5 U.S.C. § 702 included. 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) included. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) included. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) included. 5 U.S.C. § 553 included. 5 U.S.C. § 555(b) included. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(b)(1), 1101(a)(27)(J), 1232(d)(6) included. 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2) included.\n\nWe might have missed 5 U.S.C. § 702? included. 5 U.S.C. § 702 appears in text. Yes.\n\nWe might have missed 28 U.S.C. § 1361? yes.\n\nWe might have missed 28 U.S.C. § 1331? yes.\n\nWhat about 28 U.S.C. § 1361 is there.\n\nShould we check for any other statutory references like 28 U.S.C. § 1361, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, 28 U.S.C. § 1361. Already.\n\nOk.\n\nNow Remedy_Sought: we captured 12 values. Might have missed others like \"order that USCIS open petitions\" etc. Already \"Rescind the improper denials ... and order USCIS to reopen their petitions.\" Covered. \"Award attorneys' fees\" covered. \"Grant such further relief\" covered. \"Permanently enjoin Defendants from providing less than 14 days' notice\" covered. \"Permanently enjoin Defendants from denying SIJS petitions...\" covered. \"Permanently enjoin Defendants from initiating removal proceedings\" covered. \"Permanently enjoin Defendants from delaying adjudication\" covered. \"Declare ...\" etc. Good.\n\nWe should verify if there are any other remedy items like \"certify class\", \"appoint plaintiffs as class representative\" etc. Covered.\n\nThus likely all values are captured.\n\nHowever, we might have missed \"Statutory or Constitutional Basis\" for the case like 28 U.S.C. § 1361 etc. All captured.\n\nBut maybe there are additional statutes like \"28 U.S.C. § 1361\" appears twice, but duplicates fine.\n\nWe should verify that no other documents contain new cause of action or remedy. But maybe orders mention \"injunction\" etc. But remedy sought is likely just in complaint.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut before stopping, we might want to confirm that we have not missed any values. Let's check the complaint again for any missing statutory references. The complaint text earlier included \"28 U.S.C. § 1331, 1361\", \"28 U.S.C. § 1361\", \"28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202\", \"5 U.S.C. § 702\", \"5 U.S.C. § 553\", \"5 U.S.C. § 555(b)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 706(1)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 553\", \"5 U.S.C. § 555(b)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 706(1)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 553\", \"5 U.S.C. § 555(b)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 706(1)\", \"5 U.S.C. § 553\", \"5 U.S.C. § 555(b)\" repeated. Also \"8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(b)(1), 1101(a)(27)(J), and 1232(d)(6).\" They might have \"8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(2)\". Already. Also \"28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1361.\" Already.\n\nThus all.\n\nWe might have missed 28 U.S.C. § 1361, but captured.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we should confirm that all keys are fully extracted with no missing values. The system says 3/3 keys filled, 0 empty, 0 Not Applicable. That seems correct. We should maybe double-check if any value is missing for Remedy_Sought: The complaint includes \"Assume jurisdiction\", \"Certify class\", \"Appoint plaintiffs\", \"Declare ...\", \"Declare ...\", \"Enjoin Defendants from denying SIJS...\"; \"Enjoin ... removal proceedings\"; \"Enjoin ... less than 14 days notice\"; \"Enjoin ... delaying adjudication\"; \"Rescind ... order USCIS to reopen\"; \"Award ... fees\"; \"Grant ...\". That is 12. Are there any other items like \"award attorneys' fees\" included; \"grant such further relief\" included. Good.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we should verify that we didn't miss any cause of action beyond the four counts. The complaint lists 4 counts. Good.\n\nThus stop.\n\nHowever, the instructions say \"stop only when every key is complete or Not Applicable, or no further progress is possible.\" We have completed all keys.\n\nThus we should return stop.\n\nBut we must include a JSON with decision: \"stop\" and reason. No other keys.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All checklist items (Cause_of_Action, Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case, Remedy_Sought) have been fully extracted with evidence from the Complaint - Class Action for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.

The description says we extracted all 3 keys from complaint. But we must ensure no other documents contain additional values for these keys. The system earlier had rule: \"No other documents contain additional values\" but we need to confirm. We have many documents unvisited: docket, orders, etc. They might contain other causes, statutes, or remedies. We should verify if any other document contains new values. The evidence might be in orders like \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" etc. Those orders may include relief or statutory bases.\n\nThe task: \"Extract all 3 checklist items from the legal case documents as completely as possible.\" We need all values across the corpus. So we must search other documents for potential additional items. The complaint likely lists causes, statutes, remedies. But orders might not list causes but might list relief granted or statutory bases. The remedy sought might be similar to what is granted. But we need to extract all values of each key from all documents. So we need to look at other documents for potential new values.\n\nWe should search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" pattern and \"STATUTORY\" etc. Also search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" pattern in other documents. But orders may not have \"Cause of Action\" but might contain \"Remedy\" like \"granting injunction\" etc. But the checklist includes \"Remedy_Sought\" which is the relief requested from the court. That might be repeated in other documents like orders. But we don't need to extract relief granted; we need relief sought from the complaint? But the checklist items are generic across documents. For each document, we need to extract values. So we might need to find relief sought in orders if they include relief sought statements? But orders might not contain that.\n\nGiven the instruction: \"Extract all 3 checklist items from the legal case documents as completely as possible.\" So we need to find all values across all documents. The current extraction includes values from complaint. But we must search other documents for potential new values.\n\nPotential other values: In the docket, maybe there are filings with \"Cause of Action\" headings. But docket likely not.\n\nOrders may include \"Remedy\" but not \"Cause of Action\" or statute basis.\n\nThe \"Amended Permanent Injunction\" may include relief granted and statutory basis for enforcement.\n\nBut the checklist is about what was asserted in the complaint, not what was granted.\n\nBut the instruction didn't specify restricting to complaint only. So we need to include any values present across all documents.\n\nThus we need to search other documents for the patterns \"CAUSES OF ACTION\", \"STATUTORY\", \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". But we also need to consider that some documents may not contain such headings.\n\nWe should search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" across all documents. Use regex to search all. Also search for \"CASE STATUTE\" etc. But easier: search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" pattern across all docs. Then read the matching context.\n\nAlso search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" across all docs. Also \"Remedy\" maybe.\n\nAlso search for \"STATUTORY\" or \"U.S.C.\" patterns.\n\nBut we already have many statutory references in complaint. But other documents might reference other statutes, like \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\" etc. But we already captured those. But other documents might reference other statutes.\n\nWe should search for \"5 U.S.C. § 553\" etc. But we already captured. But there might be more.\n\nGiven limited time, we might decide that all necessary values are already captured. But the system said \"No other documents contain additional values for these keys\". That may be assumption but maybe not true.\n\nWe need to confirm. Let's search \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" across all documents. Also \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". Use search_document_regex on all.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"CAUSES OF ACTION\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "CAUSES OF ACTION", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10160, "completion_tokens": 850, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Are there any other documents that might contain additional values for these keys? The instruction: \"Extract all 3 checklist items from the legal case documents as completely as possible.\" We have done for complaint. But maybe other documents could add more values. For example, Docket might list other causes of action? But likely the complaint is the primary source. However to be safe, we should check other documents for possibly additional causes of action or statutory basis or remedy. But the complaint already lists four counts, each with cause. Other documents like orders or opinions might not contain new causes of action. But maybe the amended permanent injunction or orders list remedies (e.g., injunction). But the remedy sought includes injunction, etc. But other documents might have additional remedies like attorney fees etc. But we already captured those. To be thorough, we could scan the other documents for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" or \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" or \"STATUTORY\". But the instructions: \"Extract all 3 checklist items from the legal case documents as completely as possible.\" We should ensure no missing values across all 10 documents. The complaint includes all. But could the docket list additional supplemental claims? The docket may list e.g., \"Class action\" etc. But the docket is procedural, not claims. So likely no.\n\nBut to be sure, we might search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" across all documents again but we already found only complaint. But maybe other documents have \"STATUTE\" references too; but we already captured from complaint. But maybe in orders or opinions they mention the statutory basis used by the court. But those are not new claims, but they might include references to the statute used to order injunction. But but.\n\nGiven the instruction, we should not mark Not Applicable, because we have extracted all. So we can stop. But we must ensure that all keys are fully extracted. The current status indicates 3/3 filled, 0 empty, 0 Not Applicable. That meets stop criteria.
