We have partially visited Opinion. We saw matches with Judge Bea, Judge Graber, Judge Reiss, Judge Lasnik. But we need to extract first and last name of the presiding judge. That likely refers to the main judge of the opinion, not panel. In the Opinion, presiding judge: \"Robert S. Lasnik, District Judge, Presiding\" appears. Also \"Opinion by Judge Bea; Partial Dissent by Judge Graber\". But presiding judge is Lasnik. So we need to extract \"Robert S. Lasnik\" as full name. Also the judges with first and last name: Lasnik, Bea, Graber, Reiss. But the spec: \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge: The name of the presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided).\" So just one value: the presiding judge. So we need to confirm from document. We have matches showing that. We need to read more to capture the exact snippet. The snippet we have shows \"Robert S. Lasnik, District Judge, Presiding\". We need evidence. We have token ranges 274-474, 718-918 etc. The first match includes that. So we can use the existing snippet. But to ensure we have full context, maybe read the snippet around 274-474 fully to capture the exact text. We already have the snippet. We need to use read_document to get the text for evidence. We could also use search_document_regex to find \"Presiding\" or \"District Judge\" but we have already matches. We should just read that range to confirm. Or maybe we can use read_document on 274-474 tokens as in the snippet. Since we already have snippet, it's fine. But to produce evidence, we need the exact text snippet. We could use read_document to retrieve that part. That will give us the text. Then we can append the extracted value. So next action: read_document for Opinion, start 270, end 480 maybe. But we have start_token 274-474. We'll read that range.\n\nThus action: read_document doc_name: \"Opinion\", start_token: 270, end_token: 480.

We have read a section of Opinion showing \"Robert S. Lasnik, District Judge, Presiding\" and \"Opinion by Judge Bea\". We also saw \"Before: Susan P. Graber and Carlos T. Bea, Circuit Judges, and Christina Reiss, District Judge.\" Also partial \"Opinion by Judge Bea; Partial Dissent by Judge Graber\". So we need to extract distinct judge names. The list should include \"Robert S. Lasnik\", \"Carlos T. Bea\", \"Christina Reiss\", \"Judge Bea\" is same as Carlos T. Bea? But \"Opinion by Judge Bea\" refers to Carlos T. Bea? The pattern: \"Opinion by Judge Bea\" would refer to Judge Carlos T. Bea. So we should include \"Carlos T. Bea\" as judge. Also \"Judge Graber\" refers to Susan P. Graber. So we have at least three distinct judges: Robert S. Lasnik, Carlos T. Bea, Christina Reiss and Susan P. Graber? Actually Susan P. Graber is a Circuit Judge, but still a judge. The checklist is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\": name of presiding judge. The presiding judge is the one listed as Presiding, or \"Opinion by Judge Bea\". So maybe we should include the presiding judge(s). But the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" For judge names, we need first and last name. So we can extract all distinct judge names found.\n\nWe need to read more of Opinion to capture other judge names. Already we have some. We should search for \"Judge\" pattern further in the document. We could use search_document_regex on Opinion for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" or \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\". Already we did search and got matches. But we only read some tokens. We may need to read more tokens to capture all. We should read the Opinion fully? It has 19,868 tokens. We have seen tokens 270-480, 718-918, 1633-1993. That covers some. We need to find all judge names. The search results show 5 matches, all within Opinion. We have read the 3 matches partially? We read match 1 (tokens 274-474). That includes \"Robert S. Lasnik...\" and \"Opinion by Judge Bea\". We read match 2 (tokens 718-918) partially? We didn't read that yet, but search gave context. We need to read that part to confirm \"Christina Reiss\". We also need to confirm \"Judge Graber\" referring to Susan P. Graber.\n\nWe should read tokens around 718-918 to capture that section. Also maybe there are other judge names beyond that. Let's search again for \"Judge\" pattern to get all matches. We already did search and got 5 matches. The matches include tokens 274-474, 718-918, 1633-1833, 1711-1911, 1793-1993. But matches 1633-1833 and 1711-1911 and 1793-1993 seem overlapping. They might be same paragraph repeated? Actually they might be overlapping. But basically the judge names are: Robert S. Lasnik, Carlos T. Bea, Christina Reiss, Susan P. Graber. Possibly also \"Judge Graber\" appears as partial. Also \"Judge Bea\" we have. So we have 4 distinct judges.\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each.\n\nThus we need to read the relevant sections: 718-918 to capture \"Christina Reiss\" line. Also maybe 1633-1833 for \"Judge Graber\" and \"Judge Bea\"? But we already have \"Judge Graber\" in match 1? Actually match 1 includes partial \"Partial Dissent by Judge Graber\". Yes match 1 had that. So we have evidence for Judge Graber. For Christina Reiss, we need to read 718-918. For \"Carlos T. Bea\" we have evidence from match 1. For \"Robert S. Lasnik\" from match 1.\n\nBut we also might have \"Judge Bea\" as separate name? But \"Carlos T. Bea\" is his full name. The \"Judge Bea\" refers to him. So we can use \"Carlos T. Bea\" as extracted value.\n\nThus we need to read 718-918 for evidence of Christina Reiss. Let's call read_document. We should also read maybe 0-700 or 900-1200 to capture any other judge names? But likely only these four. But to be safe, we can read 700-1000 tokens.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Opinion tokens 700-950. Let's do 700-950. That covers 718-918 area.\n\nWe'll then append the extracted values for all four judges. But we should only append after reading. So next action: read_document.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Opinion\",\"start_token\":700,\"end_token\":950}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion", "start_token": 700, "end_token": 950}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4379, "completion_tokens": 1086, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have partial info from earlier reads: In Opinion tokens 270-480: \"Robert S. Lasnik, District Judge, Presiding\" and \"Opinion by Judge Bea; Partial Dissent by Judge Graber\". Also earlier snippet shows \"Before: Susan P. Graber and Carlos T. Bea, Circuit Judges, and Christina Reiss, District Judge.\" So judges: Robert S. Lasnik, Judge Bea (Carlos T. Bea), Judge Graber (Susan P. Graber), Judge Reiss (Christina Reiss). Also earlier search pattern: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" found 5 matches. We need all distinct judge names. We should search all documents for patterns \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]* [A-Z][a-z]*\" or \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]* [A-Z][a-z]*\" but also \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]*\" maybe. We have evidence in Opinion. But might also appear in other documents like orders. Should search all documents for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" etc. Use search_document_regex on all docs for pattern: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" with IGNORECASE? Actually judge names may have middle initials. Pattern: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z]\\.)?\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" maybe. But simpler: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" covers Bea and Graber, Reiss, Lasnik? But Lasnik has 3 parts: \"Robert S. Lasnik\" but that pattern would match \"Judge Bea\" etc. We also have \"Judge Bea\" etc. So we can search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z]\\.)?\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\".\n\nBut we also need first and last name only. For each judge we should extract \"Robert Lasnik\" maybe? But requirement: full name if available; first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion provided. So for Robert S. Lasnik, we have first=Robert, last=Lasnik, middle S. -> we can extract \"Robert Lasnik\" or \"Robert S. Lasnik\"? The definition says first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided. We can provide full name as [full name]. So we should provide \"Robert S. Lasnik\" maybe.\n\nBut we need to include evidence. We have evidence from Opinion snippet lines. We'll provide evidence for each judge.\n\nWe should also search other documents to ensure no other judges appear. For example, there may be \"Judge Mary P. Smith\" etc. Let's search all documents with pattern. Use search_document_regex on all documents.\n\nWe'll choose search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z]\\.)?\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" flags [\"IGNORECASE\",\"MULTILINE\",\"DOTALL\"], top_k maybe 20, context_tokens 200.\n\nBut we might want to capture \"Judge Bea\" which is \"Judge Bea\" missing last name? Actually it's \"Judge Bea\" but the name is Carlos T. Bea. So pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" would match \"Judge Bea\". But we want full name. We may need to capture \"Judge Carlos T. Bea\". But earlier snippet shows \"Before: Susan P. Graber and Carlos T. Bea, Circuit Judges\". That includes \"Carlos T. Bea\". So pattern \"Carlos T. Bea\" includes last name Bea. So we need to capture that separately.\n\nThus search pattern: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z]\\.)?\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" for judge titles. But for \"Judge Bea\" it may not match because missing last name. But \"Judge Bea\" is incomplete; but we can still capture by pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" could match \"Judge Bea\". But we need the full name. We can then manually parse \"Carlos T. Bea\" from preceding context. But easier: we can search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z]\\.)?\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" which will match \"Judge Bea\" if \"Bea\" is last name. Actually \"Bea\" is last name, so pattern matches \"Judge Bea\"? Wait pattern: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z]\\.)?\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" requires at least two words after Judge: one maybe first name? But \"Judge Bea\" would just be one word after Judge. So not matched. So we need capture both \"Judge Bea\" and also \"Judge Carlos T. Bea\". The earlier snippet \"Opinion by Judge Bea; Partial Dissent by Judge Graber\". So we have two names: Bea and Graber. For Bea, we know full name \"Carlos T. Bea\". For Graber: \"Susan P. Graber\". So we need to capture those names.\n\nThus search pattern could just capture \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" to get Bea and Graber. That covers \"Judge Bea\" because Bea is last name; but we still need first name. But we can get it from context. But easier: we can search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z]\\.)?\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" which will match \"Judge Carlos T. Bea\" if present. But not \"Judge Bea\". So we need two patterns.\n\nBetter: search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z]\\.)?\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" and also \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\".\n\nBut we can just search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" which will match both \"Judge Bea\", \"Judge Graber\", \"Judge Reiss\", \"Judge Lasnik\" (but Lasnik is preceded by \"Robert S. Lasnik, District Judge\" not \"Judge Lasnik\"). So we might miss Lasnik. But we can capture \"District Judge, Presiding\" pattern. But we have evidence of Robert S. Lasnik separately.\n\nThus to be safe, we can search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" and also pattern for \"District Judge, Presiding\" and \"District Judge\" preceded by name. But we already have evidence for Lasnik from earlier snippet.\n\nWe need to ensure we capture all judge names: Robert S. Lasnik, Carlos T. Bea, Susan P. Graber, Christina Reiss.\n\nLet's search all documents for pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\".\n\nWe'll also search for \"District Judge, Presiding\" maybe.\n\nBut we can rely on search pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\".\n\nLet's do search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\", flags [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k 20, context_tokens 200.\n\nWe will then parse results. But we also want to capture \"Robert S. Lasnik\" which appears before \"District Judge\". That pattern may not capture. But we have evidence from earlier snippet. So we already have Lasnik. But we may also find \"Robert S. Lasnik\" in other documents. Let's search for \"Robert S. Lasnik\" as well. But maybe not needed.\n\nLet's search for \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\".\n\nWe also might search for \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" to get full names.\n\nBut we can combine: we can search for pattern \"(Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z]\\\\.)?\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+|Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)\" with flags IGNORECASE.\n\nBut maybe easier: just search for \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" and then manually capture names.\n\nLet's proceed with search_document_regex on all docs.\n\nBut we also need to read extracted matches to confirm names. The evidence will include the snippet context.\n\nWe will then append each judge name to checklist.\n\nWe need to use append_checklist with patch containing key \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\" and extracted entries.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each name. We'll need to include the snippet text that contains the judge name. We'll use the search result context. We need to provide location: e.g., page or token offset. The search results may not include page numbers; but we can provide token offsets maybe. But we can approximate.\n\nWe need to extract unique names.

The definition: first and last name of judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion). Format [full name]. So we should extract the names:\n\n- Robert S. Lasnik (first and last name: Robert Lasnik? but includes middle initial S. Should we include it? \"first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion\". So we can include full \"Robert S.

The phrase \"first and last name if available\" could mean we should not include middle initial? But maybe include. The example: in earlier tasks they include middle initial. But unclear. I'll include full name as present.\n\n- Judge Bea (but full name? \"Carlos T. Bea\". So we should include Carlos T. Bea. Also \"Judge Bea\" earlier. Use full name.\n\n- Judge Graber: \"Susan P.

For location we can use page or token range. For evidence: we can use the snippet text. For each entry, we should provide at least one evidence. We can use same evidence for multiple names. But better each has separate evidence. We can include the excerpt snippet that contains the name.\n\nThus we need to call append_checklist.\n\nWe might need to specify token range? But location string could be \"tokens 270-480\" or \"page 2 of 43\". Use page.\n\nWe have snippet includes \"Page 2 of 43\". So location \"Page 2 of 43\".\n\nThus we will produce patch with key \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\" and extracted array with 5 entries.\n\nLet's prepare.\n\nEntry 1: value \"Robert S.

But the full name is Carlos T. Bea. So we already have.\n\nAlso \"Judge Graber\" is Susan P. Graber. Already.\n\nThus 4 names? Wait we counted 5: Robert S. Lasnik, Susan P. Graber, Carlos T. Bea, Christina Reiss. That's 4. Did we miscount? The initial list had 5 but we double counted maybe? Let's list:\n\n- Robert S. Lasnik\n- Susan P. Graber\n- Carlos T.

All values found? We should check if any other judge appears in other documents. The pattern search found matches in Opinion only. But maybe other documents have judges too. But the requirement is to extract every distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the definition. We need to check all documents for judge names. There may be other judges like in other orders, etc. Use search regex \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" or maybe \"Honorable\" etc. But we already captured four names: Robert S. Lasnik, Susan P. Graber, Carlos T. Bea, Christina Reiss. Are there any other judge names? Could be in other documents: e.g., Order Granting Joint Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement may list presiding judge. Also Docket may list. But the definition: \"The name of the presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided).\" That may refer to the presiding judge for the case overall? Usually the presiding judge is the one who writes the opinion. In the Opinion, the presiding judge is Robert S. Lasnik. But the extracted values included all judges. That might be beyond expectation. But the checklist is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\" singular? It might be the presiding judge only. But the sample extraction included four judges. The instruction says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" The definition says \"The name of the presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided).\" That implies only one judge. But we extracted four. We may need to refine: Only include presiding judge. Which is Robert S. Lasnik. The other judges are other judges, not presiding. But we may misinterpret. The sample extraction appended 4 values. That might be okay if the definition is ambiguous. But maybe the rule is to extract all judges, but the definition says presiding. But the sample shows multiple. The sample may be a mistake. But we need to follow the defined item: \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\". I think we should only capture the presiding judge. But we already appended four. Should we update to correct? The instruction at step 6 says we appended 4 values. That may be considered final. But the system messages: \"Current Status: Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning we have the key. But we might need to consider whether any other judge appears elsewhere. However, the instructions in the system say \"Your next action: choose ONE action based on current state.\" Since key is filled, we could stop. But we might need to verify if any judge names appear in other documents that might be relevant. But the definition only cares about presiding judge. We have recorded the presiding judge. So we can stop. But we need to ensure the extracted values are correct. The instruction says each extracted value must include evidence. We appended 4 entries with evidence. But we have not updated to confirm if the entire list is complete. But we might have appended more than needed. But the instruction says \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" We have explicit text for each. So we can consider that complete. We can stop.\n\nBut we need to be sure that no other judge appears in other documents that might be the presiding judge. The presiding judge is the one who wrote the opinion. In other orders, the judge may be the same. But we could search for \"Opinion by Judge\" in all documents. But we already found all judge names in Opinion. The other orders may not show new names. But it's fine.\n\nThus the next action is to stop. The final answer: JSON decision stop.\n\nHowever, we need to consider: The instructions say we should stop only when every key is either complete or Not Applicable. We have one key. We have extracted 4 values. But the definition says \"The name of the presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided).\" That might mean only one name. But we extracted multiple. Might be incorrectly over-extracted. But we cannot revert without new evidence. We could update the key to contain only the presiding judge. But we don't have evidence to choose which is presiding. We have \"Opinion by Judge Bea;\" \"Opinion by Judge Bea;\" \"Partial Dissent by Judge Graber\" etc. The presiding judge is likely the one who wrote the opinion, i.e., Judge Bea? Wait reading: In the excerpt:\n\n\"Opinion by Judge Bea; Partial Dissent by Judge Graber\". Also earlier: \"Robert S. Lasnik, District Judge, Presiding\". So presiding judge is Robert S. Lasnik. So the presiding judge is Robert S. Lasnik. So we should produce a single value \"Robert S. Lasnik\". But we have four values. We need to correct. We need to use update_checklist to replace list with only that one. But we must provide evidence. We already have evidence: \"Robert S. Lasnik, District Judge, Presiding\" from Opinion. So we can update to single entry.\n\nHowever, the sample extraction earlier included all four. But the instruction at the top: \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge: The name of the presiding judge\". So we should only capture presiding judge. So we need to update.\n\nThus we should issue an update_checklist with the single entry.\n\nThen after update, we can stop.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist. Provide patch: key First_and_Last_name_of_Judge, extracted array with single entry value \"Robert S. Lasnik\" and evidence location.\n\nWe need to include evidence: \"Robert S. Lasnik, District Judge, Presiding\" from Opinion, page 2 of 43. Provide location token range? We can use location: \"Page 2 of 43\" or token offset 270-480. We'll provide evidence text snippet.\n\nThus output function call update_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"patch\":[{\"key\":\"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\",\"extracted\":[{\"value\":\"Robert S.

We already extracted 4 values: Robert S. Lasnik, Susan P. Graber, Carlos T. Bea, Christina Reiss. Are there any more judges? We need to examine all documents for judge names. We saw earlier search regex for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" found 5 matches in Opinion. But maybe other documents contain judge names. We need to ensure all distinct judge names present across all documents. We need to search all documents for patterns like \"Judge [Name]\" or maybe \"Honorable [Name]\" etc. But we might rely on the earlier search. But better to search again for pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\". Step 5 found 0 matches. That might be due to pattern restrictions; maybe the names appear as \"Judge Bea\" (no first name?). We have \"Judge Bea\" but we captured \"Carlos T. Bea\". That pattern may not capture \"Judge Bea\" because missing first name; but we have the name earlier. We also have \"Judge Lasnik\". We captured. \"Judge Reiss\" captured. \"Judge Graber\" captured. So we have all four.\n\nBut maybe other documents have other judges like \"Honorable [Name]\" etc. We should search for \"Honorable\" pattern. But the item is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\". We need first and last names. The \"Honorable\" prefix is not needed. The names extracted are fine. However, we need to confirm if any other judge names appear in other documents that we haven't captured. Let's search across all documents for \"Judge\" occurrences. But the earlier search for \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" returned 0. That's odd because we saw many. Maybe the pattern didn't include token? Step 5: search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\") found 0 total matches. Possibly because the pattern didn't include dot? But we had \"Judge Bea\". That matches. Should have matched. Maybe the regex engine didn't process because of case? We used \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\"; should match \"Judge Bea\". Why zero? Might be due to not specifying flags? Should be fine. Might be due to the documents being scanned; but maybe the earlier search used doc_names? Step 3 used read_document on Opinion tokens 270-480. Step 4 read 700-950. Step 5 search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\") found 0 total matches. That is weird. Maybe the pattern didn't find because of tokenization? But we had \"Judge Bea;\" which matches. Could be escape issues. We might try a more general pattern: \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" but with \"IGNORECASE\" maybe? But we want case-sensitive. Let's try a new search for \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" with flags [\"IGNORECASE\"]? That might capture. But we also want \"Judge Bea;\" etc. Let's search again across all documents with pattern \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" or maybe \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" for two names. But we could also search for \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\\\.?\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\"? But we only captured names with first and last.\n\nBut we might also capture \"Judge Bea\" as \"Judge Bea\" which includes only last name. But we have the full name \"Carlos T. Bea\". Already captured.\n\nBetter approach: We should search for \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" to find first and last names. But \"Judge Bea\" won't match. But we already captured all.\n\nBut maybe other documents include judges like \"Honorable David W. Haggard\" etc. We need to search for \"Judge\" across all docs.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" with flags [\"IGNORECASE\"] maybe. But we need to capture names like \"Judge Bea\" as well. But we might then parse manually.\n\nAlternatively, we could read the remaining documents partially to find judge names. But that might be large.\n\nBetter to search for \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" using flags \"IGNORECASE\" to catch all. That will highlight matches. Then we can read those contexts to confirm names and add if new.\n\nThus next action: call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\", flags [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k maybe 10, context_tokens 200.
