We already read the Stipulation of Dismissal. That document is a settlement agreement? Actually it's a stipulation of dismissal, which is a settlement. It contains terms: dismissal without prejudice, parties to bear own attorney's fees and costs. Those are settlement terms. Also maybe other documents have settlement terms. Since we need all distinct values across all documents. We have 10 documents; only one visited. We should search the other documents for settlement terms. Likely the \"Memorandum Decision and Order\" but those are orders, not settlement. However sometimes settlement agreements appear in orders? But we need terms that are **not entered as a court order**. Those would be in settlement agreements. The Stipulation of Dismissal is a settlement. Terms are \"dismissal without prejudice of all claims\" and \"each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\" Need to extract each term as separate value with evidence.\n\nAlso maybe other documents contain settlement terms? Maybe the \"Order\" or \"SCOTUS Opinion\" may have settlement terms? But likely not. The \"Complaint\" may not. The \"Docket\" not. The orders may contain orders that enforce settlements. But we need purely contractual terms not incorporated into court orders. So we likely only need the terms from the settlement agreement (Stipulation of Dismissal). However we should double-check if any other documents include settlement terms. The Stipulation of Dismissal may have other terms? Let's scan it: It includes \"dismissal without prejudice of all claims\" and \"each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\" That may be all. We should confirm no other terms. The text shows only those two clauses. Let's re-read the snippet: \"Pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), Plaintiff the United States of America, along with Defendant the State of Idaho and Defendant-Intervenor the Idaho Legislature, hereby stipulate to the dismissal, without prejudice, of all of the United States’ claims in this action, each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\" That is the only clause.\n\nThus we have two terms: 1) dismissal without prejudice of all claims. 2) each party to bear their own attorney's fees and costs.\n\nWe need to create separate entries for each unique value with evidence.\n\nThus we need to call append_checklist with patch for key \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" and two extracted entries.\n\nWe need evidence: text snippet, source_document \"Stipulation of Dismissal\", location maybe \"Page 1\" or \"Document 182\" but location can be \"Page 1\". Use location \"Page 1\".\n\nLet's craft evidence entries.\n\nTerm 1: \"dismissal, without prejudice, of all of the United States’ claims in this action\". Provide snippet.\n\nTerm 2: \"each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\"\n\nWe need to provide evidence text exactly from the document. We'll quote from the snippet. Use the text from the snippet: \"hereto stipulate to the dismissal, without prejudice, of all of the United States’ claims in this action, each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\" We can split into two entries based on the clause. Provide the exact snippet for each.\n\nThus we will call append_checklist with patch:\n\n{\n key: \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\",\n extracted: [\n   { value: \"Dismissal, without prejudice, of all of the United States’ claims in this action\", evidence: [ { text: \"...\", source_document: \"Stipulation of Dismissal\", location: \"Page 1\" } ] },\n   { value: \"Each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs\", evidence: [ { text: \"...\", source_document: \"Stipulation of Dismissal\", location: \"Page 1\" } ] }\n ]\n}\n\nWe need to include the evidence text exactly as appears. Let's capture snippet exactly:\n\nFrom snippet: \"hereto stipulate to the dismissal, without prejudice, of all of the United States’ claims in this action, each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\"\n\nThus we can separate portions:\n\nTerm1: \"dismissal, without prejudice, of all of the United States’ claims in this action\"\n\nTerm2: \"each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs\"\n\nWe need to provide evidence text for each. Use the full snippet for each. Provide text as appears. We'll include the clause exactly: \"hereto stipulate to the dismissal, without prejudice, of all of the United States’ claims in this action, each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\" For Term1, evidence text could be that entire clause but we can highlight the part.

We have 10 documents, one fully visited: Stipulation of Dismissal (which is not a settlement agreement but a dismissal). The settlement terms likely in a Settlement Agreement document not listed. But maybe there are settlement agreements among other documents? The list shows \"Stipulation of Dismissal\" [Settlement Agreement], but that's the only settlement? Actually \"Settlement Agreement\" attribute. But the stipulation of dismissal likely is not a settlement but a dismissal. The instruction says extract settlement terms that are not court orders. So we need to search for settlement terms in any document. The search \"settlement\" returned zero. Maybe the settlement terms are in the Settlement Agreement? But the document is titled \"Stipulation of Dismissal\" which might be a settlement? But it's a dismissal. But maybe there is a settlement agreement document separate. The list shows only 10 documents; no \"Settlement Agreement\" except the Stipulation of Dismissal. Let's search for \"agreement\" or \"settlement\" in other docs.\n\nWe can search regex pattern \"settlement\" again but we already did and found none. Maybe the terms are in the \"Order\" or \"Memorandum Decision and Order\" documents. They might contain settlement terms. Without context, maybe we need to read the \"Order\" or \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\" etc.\n\nBut the checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\". These are obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order. So we need to find settlement agreements. The documents likely include a settlement agreement; maybe named \"Settlement Agreement\" but not displayed. But the list shows \"Stipulation of Dismissal\" [Settlement Agreement] which might be a settlement agreement. But the text we saw did not show any settlement obligations; it said parties stipulate to dismissal, each party to bear their own attorney's fees and costs. That is settlement terms. So we might extract that.\n\nBut we need to confirm if these are settlement terms. The stipulation includes: \"each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\" That is a settlement term. Also \"dismissal without prejudice\". That might be a settlement term. The settlement agreement is the stipulation of dismissal. So we need to extract those distinct settlement terms. The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to find all distinct settlement terms. In the Stipulation, we saw two terms: \"dismissal without prejudice\" and \"each party to bear their own attorneys' fees and costs.\" Are there other terms? The text also says \"the parties to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\" So we have that.\n\nWe should verify if any other documents contain settlement terms. We haven't read them. But we can search for \"fees\" maybe or \"settlement\" again. Let's search \"fees\" or \"settlement\" across all documents. But we already searched \"settlement\" and got none. Maybe the settlement terms are in the \"Settlement Agreement\" but not labeled \"settlement\". But likely the Stipulation of Dismissal is the settlement. So we might already have the settlement terms. But we need to be thorough.\n\nWe need to read the entire Stipulation of Dismissal. We already read it fully. Let's confirm if there are other settlement terms beyond those two. The snippet includes: \"each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\" That is one term. It also says \"the Court’s preliminary injunction ... is granted\". But that's not a settlement term. The other term \"dismissal without prejudice\" is a settlement term. So we have two distinct terms.\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each: text snippet, source document, location. For the snippet, we can use the text that says \"each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\" and \"dismissal without prejudice\" maybe from the sentence: \"the parties stipulate to the dismissal, without prejudice, of all of the United States’ claims in this action, each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\" We need to capture the phrase. Provide evidence.\n\nThus we should append these two entries to Significant_Terms_of_Settlement.\n\nWe should use append_checklist to add these two entries. We need to include evidence arrays: each entry includes text, source_document, location. We can include location as \"Page 1\" or \"Page 2\" etc. For the first term, \"dismissal without prejudice\" is in the sentence on Page 1. For the second term, \"each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs\" also on Page 1.\n\nWe should not set Not Applicable. So we just append.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.\n\nWe need to create patch array. We'll produce:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"dismissal without prejudice\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"dismissal, without prejudice, of all of the United States’ claims in this action, each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Dismissal\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Dismissal\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWe need to ensure text is exact snippet. The snippet from the document: \"each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\" And \"dismissal, without prejudice, of all of the United States’ claims in this action,\". So we can combine. Good.\n\nWe should verify that the text snippet is verbatim. The provided text snippet in the read shows: \"the parties stipulate to the dismissal, without prejudice, of all of the United States’ claims in this action, each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs.\" That is the full sentence.

Are there other terms? Let's re-read the Stipulation of Dismissal for other settlement terms. We might need to read more of the document beyond 0-1311 tokens if there were any. But we already read entire document (1311 tokens). Might include other terms like \"no liability\" etc. But we don't know. But we can search for settlement terms within the Stipulation of Dismissal. Let's search for patterns like \"settlement\", \"confidentiality\", \"non-disparagement\", \"indemnify\", \"payment\", etc. But we did a search for settlement and got 0 matches across all documents except SCOTUS. But we didn't search Stipulation of Dismissal? Wait earlier search step 5 was \"search_document_regex\" on all documents pattern: \"settlement\" found 0 matches. So the Stipulation of Dismissal did not have the word \"settlement\". But it had \"dismissal without prejudice\" and \"each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs\". So that's fine.\n\nBut there might be other settlement terms not containing the word \"settlement\" but still are settlement terms, e.g., \"release\", \"confidentiality\", \"non-disparagement\", \"no liability\", \"payment\". The search in step 7 with pattern \"payment|indemnify|confidentiality|non-disparagement|settlement\" found only matches in SCOTUS Opinion, none in other docs. So likely no other settlement terms in other docs.\n\nThus we can conclude we have extracted all settlement terms. So we can stop.\n\nBut we need to confirm that we have not missed any terms. Let's read the Stipulation of Dismissal again to see if there were other terms: We could re-read the document but we have already fully visited it. The read_document tokens 0-1311 captured entire doc. But we don't have the text. But we can trust that only those two terms were present. But maybe there were other terms like \"payment\" etc. But search found none. So safe.\n\nThus we must stop.\n\nWe need to return JSON with decision stop and reason.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All settlement terms extracted from the only settlement agreement document; no further settlement terms found in other documents.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All settlement terms extracted from the only settlement agreement document; no further settlement terms found in other documents.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3795, "completion_tokens": 871, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The checklist only has one key: Significant_Terms_of_Settlement. We already have 2 extracted values from Stipulation of Dismissal. But we may have missed other settlement terms in other documents. The system indicates that we have partially visited SCOTUS Opinion, but that is not a settlement agreement. But there might be settlement terms in other documents like Complaint, Docket, Mem. Decision orders, etc. However the instruction: \"The substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order. Do not include any terms the court ordered (such as those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions).\" So settlement terms are contractual. They are likely only in settlement agreements. So likely only Stipulation of Dismissal contains settlement terms. But we need to confirm if any other documents are settlement agreements. The document list: \"Stipulation of Dismissal\" is settlement agreement. Others are orders, opinions, complaint, docket, memorandum decisions. None are settlement agreements. So likely no further settlement terms. But we must ensure there aren't other settlement documents. Let's scan the document catalog: only one settlement agreement listed. So we can stop.\n\nBut we need to confirm that no other settlement terms exist in other documents. But we can search for \"settlement\" again in all documents to confirm. Step 5 already searched all documents for \"settlement\" and found no matches. But perhaps further matches exist beyond the 2 matches found for \"payment|indemnify|confidentiality|non-disparagement|settlement\" - that didn't find settlement. But maybe there are settlement terms like \"compensation\" etc. But the instruction says to extract settlement terms from legal documents. So we need to search for settlement terms in all documents.\n\nBut the only settlement agreement is Stipulation of Dismissal. So we have all settlement terms. We already extracted two terms: \"dismissal without prejudice\" and \"each party to bear their own attorney’s fees and costs\". Are there other settlement terms in Stipulation? Let's read the full doc to ensure we didn't miss any.\n\nWe read 1311 tokens of Stipulation of Dismissal earlier. But maybe there are other settlement clauses beyond those two. Let's search again for \"settlement\" or \"agreement\" within Stipulation. But we have entire doc read. Let's double-check. We can search for \"agreement\" pattern within Stipulation. But we already have the whole doc. We can open a new read_document to confirm all tokens. But we already read entire doc (0-1311). So no more tokens.\n\nThus we have all settlement terms. But we might need to double-check that there is no settlement agreement in other documents that we missed. The list shows only one settlement agreement. So we can stop.\n\nBut the system may want us to confirm that there are no other settlement terms. We can do a search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"dismissal|fees|costs|settlement|compensat\". But we already did \"payment|indemnify|confidentiality|non-disparagement|settlement\" and \"settlement\" alone. It found no matches. So we are good.\n\nThus we should stop. Let's produce stop JSON.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All settlement terms have been extracted from the only settlement agreement document.
