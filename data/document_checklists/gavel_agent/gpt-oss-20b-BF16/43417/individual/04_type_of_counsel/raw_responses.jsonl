We have some matches from search. We need to read more context to capture counsel types. The matches show \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\" and \"Counsel for Defendant\" with lawyer names. The type should be \"Plaintiff: Government Counsel (United States of America)\"? The instructions: brief category labels (private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and include specific organizations in parentheses when available. If both sides, separate entries \"Plaintiff: …\" and \"Defendant: …\". So we need to extract: Plaintiff: Government Counsel (United States of America). Defendant: Private Counsel (Morris Bower & Haws PLLC) maybe. Also other counsel like \"Counsel for Defendant-Intervenor\" maybe same. Also \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" appears.\n\nWe need to find all distinct values. We should read more of the documents to capture counsel types. We have partially visited Complaint (tokens 50-250 and 7932-8039). Those covers \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\". We need to confirm that \"United States of America\" is government counsel. Also we might want to capture \"Counsel for Defendant\" which lists names of private counsel. In the Stipulation of Dismissal, tokens 1099-1311 include \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" and \"Counsel for Defendant\" lines. We should read those tokens to capture. Also there might be \"Counsel for Defendant-Intervenor\" which might be same private counsel. We should confirm which side. Probably Defendant-Intervenor refers to the defendant. So we need to extract type for Plaintiff and Defendant.\n\nAlso might be other documents showing counsel types. Docket contains NOTICE of Appearance by various individuals on behalf of United States of America, State of Idaho, etc. Those might provide counsel types. But the primary documents for counsel are Complaint and Stipulation. Let's read more of Complaint around 50-250 and 7932-8039. We already have that content. It lists many DOJ attorneys. So that indicates Government Counsel (United States of America). We should produce entry: \"Plaintiff: Government Counsel (United States of America)\". Also could include \"Plaintiff: DOJ (U.S. Department of Justice)\"? But instructions say organization in parentheses. So maybe \"Government Counsel (United States of America)\". That covers.\n\nNow for Defendant: In Stipulation, token 1099-1299 snippet shows \"Counsel for Defendant\". It lists \"Daniel W. Bower\" from \"Morris Bower & Haws PLLC\". So that is private counsel. So entry: \"Defendant: Private Counsel (Morris Bower & Haws PLLC)\". Also \"Counsel for Defendant-Intervenor\" present in tokens 1108-1308 etc. That also is same private counsel. But we only need distinct values: so same. So only one entry for Defendant.\n\nAlso check if there is any other counsel for Defendant in other documents. In complaint, there is no defendant counsel listed. So only those.\n\nThus we need to produce two entries.\n\nWe need evidence. For Plaintiff: evidence from Complaint tokens 50-250 showing \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\". For Defendant: evidence from Stipulation tokens 1099-1299 showing \"Counsel for Defendant\" and the name and firm.\n\nWe should read those documents if not fully captured. We have snippet but maybe we need to read the exact tokens to confirm. We already have snippet. But we should confirm token ranges include the lines. The snippet shows the lines. We'll use those as evidence.\n\nBut we need to provide evidence: text, source_document, location. Use location like \"tokens 50-250\" or \"page 1\" etc. We can use token ranges.\n\nOk next action: we need to append_checklist for Type_of_Counsel. We'll include two entries.\n\nWe must not mistakenly include other entries.

We have two values: Plaintiff: Government Counsel (United States of America) and Defendant: Private Counsel (Morris Bower & Haws PLLC). Need to check if there are other counsel items e.g., other sides, or maybe more in other documents. The initial append had two values. But we might have missed other counsel like \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" in other documents? We saw matches in Complaint and Stipulation. The Complaint includes only Plaintiff counsel (US). The Stipulation includes Defendant counsel (private). But maybe there are other documents with counsel for defendant or plaintiff that we haven't read. But the search results included only these matches.\n\nWe searched earlier: \"Counsel for\" and \"Counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant)\" and \"Counsel for Defendant\". Those matches only found those lines. But maybe in other documents such as Memorandum Decision and Order there might be counsel for plaintiff or defendant. But likely not, such documents are internal orders. We might still search again for \"Counsel for\" in all documents to confirm. But the search earlier found 7 matches across documents. The matches were only in Complaint and Stipulation. No other matches. Thus likely only those two counsel entries exist.\n\nBut we need to ensure extraction includes both sides. The current extracted list has 2 values. But maybe we need to confirm that there's no other counsel for plaintiff in Stipulation? The Stipulation lists \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" and \"Counsel for Defendant\" lines. But we extracted only defendant. Maybe plaintiff counsel also appears in Stipulation. Let's examine the Stipulation matches.\n\nFrom match 2 (tokens 1099-1299) snippet: \n```\n... Counsel for Plaintiff   \n  Counsel for Defendant \n  2 \n...\n```\nSo there is a \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" line but we didn't extract it. The snippet shows \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" but no name. The following lines show \"Counsel for Defendant\" with the private counsel. Maybe plaintiff counsel is missing or not listed? The snippet shows \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" but no details; maybe the next tokens include some names but not captured. Let's examine the snippet around that. The snippet we have: \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" with no following text. Could be that the next token after \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" is the name but truncated. But the snippet only shows \"Counsel for Plaintiff\". It might be that the next lines in the document (beyond the snippet) include the name. But we didn't capture it.\n\nWe need to ensure we captured all unique values. So maybe we need to read more of the Stipulation to get the plaintiff counsel. Also maybe other documents have other counsel. Let's search again for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" in all documents. But we already had matches in Complaint with details. There's also \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" in Stipulation but details missing.\n\nWe can read the Stipulation document further to capture the plaintiff counsel. Let's read more of the Stipulation near tokens 1099-1299. Let's call read_document with that range but maybe extend to include more tokens after 1299, maybe up to 1400. But we need to read a new window. We haven't read that part fully. Let's read tokens 1099-1399 to capture the full context. We'll need to confirm the plaintiff counsel. Also we should confirm if there are other counsel in other documents. But likely not.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Stipulation of Dismissal from tokens 1099 to maybe 1399. That will give us the missing plaintiff counsel.\n\nAfter reading, we will append the new entry for Plaintiff: Private Counsel (if it's private) or Government Counsel? Actually the plaintiff is the United States of America? Wait: The Stipulation is between United States of America (plaintiff) and State of Idaho (defendant). Wait earlier lines show \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\" in the Stipulation? In the Stipulation match 1, it shows \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\". So there is a plaintiff counsel for the US. That is government counsel. The snippet we saw earlier for match 2 didn't include that; but match 1 already includes \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\". So we already captured Plaintiff: Government Counsel. So that's fine.\n\nBut we might need to capture defendant counsel again? Already captured. But maybe there is also other counsel for defendant-Intervenor. That might be a separate entry? The Stipulation shows \"Counsel for Defendant-Intervenor\" lines. That might be a separate counsel for defendant (intervenor). But the definition says if both sides are represented, extract each as separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. So we only need one entry for Defendant. The intervenor counsel might be a separate entity but still \"Defendant-Intervenor\" is still a defendant side. But maybe we need separate entries for each distinct counsel representation, including intervenors. But the instruction: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" It doesn't mention intervenors; but \"Defendant-Intervenor\" is a separate entity. But the category label could be \"Defendant: Private Counsel (Morris Bower & Haws PLLC)\" for the main defendant. The intervenor counsel might be separate but maybe not needed? The instruction is ambiguous; but to be safe, we might not include the intervenor if we already have defendant counsel. But we might consider adding a separate entry: \"Defendant-Intervenor: Private Counsel (Morris Bower & Haws PLLC)\" but it's the same firm. But it's a separate representation. The instruction says \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" It doesn't mention multiple representation for same side. So we keep only one per side.\n\nThus we have two values: Plaintiff: Government Counsel (United States of America) and Defendant: Private Counsel (Morris Bower & Haws PLLC). That seems complete.\n\nBut we need to double-check if any other documents might mention counsel for plaintiff or defendant. We can search again for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" across all docs. But we saw earlier matches in Complaint and Stipulation. The matches in other docs did not produce. The Docket shows \"NOTICE of Appearance by Christopher A. Eiswerth on behalf of United States of America\" etc. But those are appearances, not counsel lines. So not needed.\n\nThus we may have all. The next step: maybe we need to confirm that the Plaintiff counsel in Stipulation is indeed government counsel. Already extracted. We might need to confirm that the Defendant counsel is private counsel. Already.\n\nThus we might stop. But we should verify that all keys are complete. There's only one key: Type_of_Counsel. It has two values. That covers all distinct values. Are there any missing? Let's double-check if there is any mention of \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" in the Complaint that includes \"United States of America\" and maybe also \"Counsel for Defendant\" appears? The Complaint snippet only shows Plaintiff counsel; no Defendant counsel. So that's fine.\n\nThus we can stop. But we need to ensure that the extracted values are correctly appended. We did append 2 values earlier. But we should confirm that no missing values exist. The current extracted list: 2 values. That seems complete.\n\nThus we should issue stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct counsel representations have been extracted: Plaintiff: Government Counsel (United States of America) and Defendant: Private Counsel (Morris Bower & Haws PLLC).

We saw Complaint and Stipulation of Dismissal. But there are other documents: Docket, Memorandum Decisions, Order, SCOTUS Opinion. Could have counsel info.\n\nWe need to search for \"Counsel for\" or \"Counsel\" patterns in other documents. Perhaps docket contains case docket info; might list counsel. Also order documents may contain counsel. Let's search for \"Counsel for\" in all documents again. But we already did earlier, only found 7 matches. But we might need to search for \"Counsel\" or \"Attorney\" or \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" etc. The earlier search results only returned 7 matches; but maybe there are more matches we haven't yet read? The search in step 3 found 6 matches. Step 4 found 2 matches for \"Counsel for Defendant\". So likely all counsel entries captured. However, there could be other types: e.g., \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" etc. But maybe the docket lists counsel names. The docket might have \"Counsel\" or \"Counsel for\". Let's perform a search for \"Counsel\" in docket. But we can search all documents for \"Counsel\" or \"Counsel for\". But we already did search on all docs for \"Counsel for\" and only found 7 matches. But maybe docket has \"Counsel\" but not \"Counsel for\". Let's search for \"Counsel\" alone, but that might be many. But we need to identify any counsel representation that hasn't been captured. For example, maybe there is counsel for the state of Idaho as Defendant? In the Stipulation of Dismissal, we saw \"Counsel for Defendant\". That was Morris Bower & Haws. The Plaintiff counsel is United States of America. So both sides captured.\n\nBut maybe there is additional counsel: e.g., for \"Defendant-Intervenor\" or \"Defendant-Intervenor\" might be a different counsel. In Stipulation of Dismissal, we saw \"Counsel for Defendant-Intervenor\" (defendant intervenor). That might be a separate entity? But the text shows only the same \"Morris Bower & Haws PLLC\". It might be the same counsel. But the entry \"Defendant-Intervenor\" might be considered a separate side? The requirement: extract each side's counsel as separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. It says \"Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So we can ignore the \"Defendant-Intervenor\" if it is not clearly a side? But it is a side though. However, the extracted key likely expects just Plaintiff and Defendant. The \"Defendant-Intervenor\" might not be considered a side. But to be safe, we might not include it.\n\nAlso, there may be counsel for \"State of Idaho\" as Defendant? In the Stipulation, the defendant is \"State of Idaho\". The counsel for Defendant is Morris Bower & Haws. So we captured that.\n\nThus likely all counsel entries captured.\n\nBut we might also need to capture the type of counsel for each side: Government Counsel (United States of America) and Private Counsel (Morris Bower & Haws PLLC). We already have those.\n\nBut maybe there are other counsel entries in the docket or orders, e.g., referencing \"Counsel for Plaintiff: ...\" or \"Counsel for Defendant: ...\". But search found only 7 matches total. That likely covers all.\n\nLet's confirm by performing a search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" again, but we might check docket.\n\nWe can run search_document_regex on all documents again for pattern \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" to see if any more matches. Also maybe \"Counsel for Defendant\" we already saw. But maybe docket has \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" but search didn't capture? Search earlier did \"Counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant)\" and got 6 matches. So docket had zero matches. So docket does not have counsel info.\n\nThus all counsel entries captured.\n\nHowever, we might need to check if there is any \"Counsel\" for \"Intervenor\" or \"Intervenor\" that might be considered a side. But requirement says separate entries for each side. If there is a separate intervenor side, maybe we should include it. But I'm not sure if \"Defendant-Intervenor\" is considered a separate side. The document is a \"Stipulation of Dismissal\". The \"Defendant-Intervenor\" indicates a separate party. The counsel for \"Defendant-Intervenor\" is also Morris Bower & Haws. But it's the same counsel. Should we include it? The requirement: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" It doesn't mention intervenors. So we likely ignore.\n\nThus the extraction is complete.\n\nBut we must ensure we didn't miss any \"Government Counsel\" for the state of Idaho (Defendant). That is the same. So done.\n\nBut we might need to double-check if there is any \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" in other documents like orders or SCOTUS opinion. But search didn't find any.
