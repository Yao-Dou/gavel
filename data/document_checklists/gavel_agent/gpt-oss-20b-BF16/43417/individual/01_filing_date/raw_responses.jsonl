Also other documents likely have dates. We should capture each distinct filing date.\n\nWe should search all documents for pattern \"Filed\" with date format. We already did search on all documents and found many matches, but only partial coverage. We might need to read more to capture all. But we can use search_document_regex on all documents again but with pattern for dates. We already did match 58 total matches. That likely captured all \"Filed\" lines. Let's examine the matches: They are in Complaint (10 matches), Memorandum Decision and Order (001) (10 matches), and others. However, we didn't see Order (the order document) match? There's one match in Order (1). Also Stipulation of Dismissal maybe? Might have \"Filed\" as well. Docket may have filing dates too.\n\nWe need distinct filing dates. Likely: 08/02/22, 08/13/22, 09/28/23 (from Order). Also maybe other dates like 08/02/2022 \"Filed 08/02/22\" appears multiple times in complaint. Also possible \"Filed 08/02/22\" appears in complaint. Also there may be \"Filed 08/02/22\" in other documents like Order. Let's search again for \"Filed\" pattern but we need to ensure we capture all. We already have matches but maybe some matches are missing due to token coverage. But search_document_regex returns matches with context. We should review matches for each document. We saw matches for Complaint, Memorandum Decision and Order (001), and Order (1). There were also matches in other documents but not listed; but the search result said \"Remaining matches: 4 in Memorandum Decision and Order (002), 10 in Memorandum Decision and Order (003), 10 in Memorandum Decision and Order (004), 10 in Memorandum Decision and Order (005), 1 in Order\" plus 1 more documents with matches. So there are many matches across documents. To capture all filing dates, we should get all these matches. Instead of reading each, we can use search_document_regex again to capture all matches across all documents; the previous search had top_k 5 by default, but we can set top_k high to get all matches. But we still need to get evidence snippets. The search function returns context around each match. We can set top_k maybe 20 per doc? But we want all matches. We could set top_k to 20 and context 200, but still might miss if more than 20 per doc. We can call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"Filed\\s+(?:on\\s+)?(?:(?:[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4})|(?:\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}))\" flags IGNORECASE MULTILINE DOTALL, top_k maybe 50. That should return all matches across all documents. Then we can extract dates from each match snippet. We need distinct dates. So we should run search_document_regex again with larger top_k.\n\nWe must ensure that we don't exceed 10,000 tokens per call; search returns matches with context tokens. That should be fine.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern. We'll set top_k maybe 50.

We have matches list but we need to read the text to extract the date. We can use read_document on the token ranges of the matches to see the date. For each match, we need to identify the date in the text. But the regex pattern captured the date but we didn't capture the date string.

Not sure.\n\nWe should search each doc.\n\nWe can call search_document_regex on each of the remaining docs. But we have to choose only one action per turn. So we must decide which doc to read next. We need to gather all filing dates. I think the docs have distinct filing dates: Complaint, MD&O 001, MD&O 002, MD&O 003, MD&O 004, MD&O 005, Order. Some might have same date. But we need unique values.\n\nWe should read MD&O 002 first. Then MD&O 003. Then MD&O 004. Then MD&O 005. But we can batch multiple? The next action must be one of the allowed functions. We can do search_document_regex on MD&O 002 with pattern. That will return matches with dates.

We have many matches from search_document_regex earlier. Need to parse unique dates. We saw in Complaint: \"Filed 08/02/22\". Also in Memorandum Decision and Order (001): \"Filed 08/13/22\". In (002): \"Filed 08/17/22\". (003): \"Filed 08/24/22\". (004): \"Filed 02/03/23\". (005): likely another. Also Order: \"Filed September 28, 2023\". Stipulation of Dismissal: maybe a date. Docket: maybe. SCOTUS Opinion: maybe.\n\nWe need to extract every distinct filing date from any document. Use search_document_regex? We already have many matches. But we need to read the parts to get evidence. We can use search_document_regex for each document to get all \"Filed\" patterns. But we already have matches from earlier search. We can now gather unique dates: 08/02/22, 08/13/22, 08/17/22, 08/24/22, 02/03/23, September 28, 2023, etc. The matches also include \"Filed 08/02/22\" appears multiple times in Complaint. Also \"Filed 08/02/22\" appears in Complaint lines. Also \"Filed 08/02/22\" appears in the final lines of Complaint. The order \"Filed September 28, 2023\" appears. Stipulation of Dismissal may have \"Filed\" but not sure. Docket may have \"Filed\" but not shown. SCOTUS Opinion maybe not.\n\nThus we need to append all distinct filing dates with evidence. We must ensure each entry has evidence snippet and source_document and location.\n\nWe have evidence snippets from the search results. For each date, we can use the snippet that includes the date. Provide location like \"Page 1\" or token offsets? We can use the snippet shown.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't duplicate values. Distinct values: 08/02/22, 08/13/22, 08/17/22, 08/24/22, 02/03/23, September 28, 2023. Also maybe \"08/02/22\" appears multiple times but same date.\n\nWe need to verify if any other dates appear: maybe \"Filed 08/02/22\" is same date. \"Filed 08/13/22\" etc. Also \"Filed 08/17/22\". \"Filed 08/24/22\". \"Filed 02/03/23\". \"Filed September 28, 2023\". Also \"Filed 08/02/22\" appears in Complaint again. Also \"Filed 08/02/22\" appears in Complaint page 1. Good.\n\nWe should also check if \"Filed 08/02/22\" appears in any other doc? But we can put evidence from Complaint. For each date, we must provide at least one evidence snippet. We can use the earlier match for Complaint for 08/02/22. For 08/13/22 from Memorandum Decision and Order (001) snippet. For 08/17/22 from (002). For 08/24/22 from (003). For 02/03/23 from (004). For September 28, 2023 from Order.\n\nAlso might have \"Filed 08/02/22\" in Complaint again but we only need one evidence.\n\nAlso there may be \"Filed 08/02/22\" in the final lines of Complaint. But okay.\n\nAlso Stipulation of Dismissal may have a filing date; but not sure. We might search. But we can use search_document_regex again to find \"Filed\". Or we can read Stipulation of Dismissal to see.\n\nWe should also search Docket for \"Filed\". But Docket is large. But maybe not needed.\n\nWe should consider that Filing_Date refers to the date lawsuit was first filed/initiated. Usually the complaint filing date is 08/02/22. But other documents have later dates. But we need to extract all filing dates found.\n\nThus we will append six entries.\n\nWe will use append_checklist with patch key Filing_Date, extracted array of entries.\n\nEach entry: evidence array with text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe need location: maybe \"Page 1 of 17\" or \"Page 1\" etc. Use snippet provided earlier.\n\nLet's gather evidence:\n\n- For 08/02/22: snippet from Complaint: \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 1   Filed 08/02/22   Page 1 of 17\". Source_document: Complaint. Location: Page 1 of 17.\n\n- For 08/13/22: snippet from Memorandum Decision and Order (001): \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 27   Filed 08/13/22   Page 1 of 20\". Source_document: Memorandum Decision and Order (001). Location: Page 1 of 20.\n\n- For 08/17/22: snippet from Memorandum Decision and Order (002): \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 73   Filed 08/17/22   Page 1 of 4\". Source_document: Memorandum Decision and Order (002). Location: Page 1 of 4.\n\n- For 08/24/22: snippet from Memorandum Decision and Order (003): \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 95   Filed 08/24/22   Page 1 of 39\". Source_document: Memorandum Decision and Order (003). Location: Page 1 of 39.\n\n- For 02/03/23: snippet from Memorandum Decision and Order (004): \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 125   Filed 02/03/23   Page 1 of 11\". Source_document: Memorandum Decision and Order (004). Location: Page 1 of 11.\n\n- For September 28, 2023: snippet from Order: \"Filed September 28, 2023\". Source_document: Order. Location: near top, maybe before \"Filed September 28, 2023\". Use snippet.\n\nAlso maybe Stipulation of Dismissal has date: not shown. But we can search. But not necessary for extraction? We should capture all \"Filed\" dates. But maybe there is a \"Filed\" in Stipulation. Let's quickly search if Stipulation of Dismissal snippet includes \"Filed\". The snippet shows only parts, but not. Could search. But we can call search_document_regex on Stipulation of Dismissal for \"Filed\". But it might show. Let's do that.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex for Stipulation of Dismissal with pattern \"Filed\\s+(?:on\\s+)?(?:(?:[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4})|(?:\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}))\".

For 08/13/22 in MD&O 001 match 1. 08/17/22 in MD&O 002 match 1. 08/24/22 in MD&O 003 match 1. 02/03/23 in MD&O 004 match 1. 05/04/23 in MD&O 005 match 0-200 snippet. 03/05/25 in Stipulation match 1.\n\nThus we can create append_checklist for Filing_Date with each entry. We need evidence with text, source_document, location.\n\nWe need location: e.g., \"Complaint, Page 1\" etc. The snippet includes tokens but we can approximate. Use page numbers from snippet.\n\nLet's craft evidence:\n\n1. Filing date 08/02/22: evidence snippet from Complaint: \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 1   Filed 08/02/22   Page 1 of 17\". source_document: \"Complaint\". location: \"Page 1\".\n\n2. 08/13/22: evidence snippet from MD&O 001: \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 27   Filed 08/13/22   Page 1 of 20\". source_document: \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\". location: \"Page 1\".\n\n3. 08/17/22: evidence snippet from MD&O 002: \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 73   Filed 08/17/22   Page 1 of 4\". source_document: \"Memorandum Decision and Order (002)\". location: \"Page 1\".\n\n4. 08/24/22: evidence snippet from MD&O 003: \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 95   Filed 08/24/22   Page 1 of 39\". source_document: \"Memorandum Decision and Order (003)\". location: \"Page 1\".\n\n5. 02/03/23: evidence snippet from MD&O 004: \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 125   Filed 02/03/23   Page 1 of 11\". source_document: \"Memorandum Decision and Order (004)\". location: \"Page 1\".\n\n6. 05/04/23: evidence snippet from MD&O 005: snippet includes \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 135   Filed 05/04/23   Page 1 of 12\". source_document: \"Memorandum Decision and Order (005)\". location: \"Page 1\".\n\n7. 03/05/25: evidence snippet from Stipulation of Dismissal: \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW     Document 182     Filed 03/05/25     Page 1 of 3\". source_document: \"Stipulation of Dismissal\". location: \"Page 1\".\n\nWe should also consider \"Order\" document maybe also has 08/13/22, but that's duplicate. Not needed.\n\nThus we create append_checklist with patch key Filing_Date, extracted array with 7 entries.\n\nWe need to ensure evidence includes text exactly as snippet. Provide text string.\n\nLet's craft the JSON.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"08/02/22\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 1   Filed 08/02/22   Page 1 of 17\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"08/13/22\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 27   Filed 08/13/22   Page 1 of 20\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"08/17/22\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 73   Filed 08/17/22   Page 1 of 4\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Memorandum Decision and Order (002)\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"08/24/22\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 95   Filed 08/24/22   Page 1 of 39\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Memorandum Decision and Order (003)\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"02/03/23\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 125   Filed 02/03/23   Page 1 of 11\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Memorandum Decision and Order (004)\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"05/04/23\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 135   Filed 05/04/23   Page 1 of 12\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Memorandum Decision and Order (005)\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"03/05/25\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW     Document 182     Filed 03/05/25     Page 1 of 3\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Stipulation of Dismissal\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "08/02/22", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 1   Filed 08/02/22   Page 1 of 17", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 1"}]}, {"value": "08/13/22", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 27   Filed 08/13/22   Page 1 of 20", "source_document": "Memorandum Decision and Order (001)", "location": "Page 1"}]}, {"value": "08/17/22", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 73   Filed 08/17/22   Page 1 of 4", "source_document": "Memorandum Decision and Order (002)", "location": "Page 1"}]}, {"value": "08/24/22", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 95   Filed 08/24/22   Page 1 of 39", "source_document": "Memorandum Decision and Order (003)", "location": "Page 1"}]}, {"value": "02/03/23", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 125   Filed 02/03/23   Page 1 of 11", "source_document": "Memorandum Decision and Order (004)", "location": "Page 1"}]}, {"value": "05/04/23", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 135   Filed 05/04/23   Page 1 of 12", "source_document": "Memorandum Decision and Order (005)", "location": "Page 1"}]}, {"value": "03/05/25", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW     Document 182     Filed 03/05/25     Page 1 of 3", "source_document": "Stipulation of Dismissal", "location": "Page 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13948, "completion_tokens": 1904, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have extracted dates from Complaint, MD and O 001-005, Stipulation. But not from Order, Docket, SCOTUS Opinion. Need to check if those documents have filing dates. The Order document likely has a filing date. Docket may have dates. SCOTUS Opinion likely has a date of filing. But maybe not needed? Filing date refers to when lawsuit first filed. That is likely the complaint filing date (08/02/22). But we might need to extract filing dates for each docket entry? The task says extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So include any date that indicates filing. The Order might have a \"Filed\" label. We should search for \"Filed\" in Order. The Docket might have \"Filed\" entries. The SCOTUS Opinion might have a date but maybe not \"Filed\". But could include \"Filed\" in the docket entry. Let's search Order for \"Filed\". We have partial view 89-289. We need to read more of Order. Let's read from Order tokens 0-2000 maybe. Also search regex \"Filed\".

The current status says keys with values: 1/1, empty keys 0/1, not applicable 0/1, total values 7. So we already have all possible filing dates? But need to ensure completeness: Are there other documents (Docket, SCOTUS Opinion) that might contain filing dates? The filing date is of lawsuit first filed. Usually the complaint contains filing date. The docket might list filing date. SCOTUS Opinion might not. But we should check Docket for potential additional filing dates? But docket may contain docket entries with dates; but filing date is likely same as complaint. But maybe there are multiple filings? The filing date of lawsuit is the earliest date the complaint was filed. All other documents are subsequent. So filing date appears once: 08/02/22 in Complaint. The other dates correspond to other documents' filing dates. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct values: we found 8 distinct dates? Actually list shows 08/02/22, 08/13/22, 08/17/22, 08/24/22, 02/03/23, 05/04/23, 03/05/25, 09/28/23 (from Order). Wait 09/28/23 is also a filing date of the \"Order\" (appeals). That is a filing date of the order. But the filing date of the lawsuit is 08/02/22. But the requirement is ambiguous: \"Filing_Date: The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" That should be only one date. However extraction already includes many dates for other documents. So we have over-extracted. We need to decide: the correct filing date is the earliest date. The other dates are not relevant. But the instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" That suggests if you find any date that matches pattern, you should record it. But the definition clarifies it's the first filing. So we should only record that date. But the prior actions appended 7 values, which is incorrect. We need to correct the checklist: set Filing_Date to only 08/02/22. So we need to do an update_checklist to replace the entire list with one entry: 08/02/22, with evidence from Complaint. Ensure we also have evidence for the date.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist for Filing_Date.\n\nWe need evidence: from Complaint, at page 1: \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW Document 1 Filed 08/02/22 Page 1 of 17\". Provide that snippet. Provide source_document: \"Complaint\". location: maybe \"Page 1\". So we will update.\n\nWe should also check if any other documents contain the same date: maybe the complaint appears in other documents? But we only need one evidence. Use the snippet from Complaint. So do update_checklist.\n\nBut before that, we should verify that we have extracted all filing dates? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Technically there may be only one distinct filing date value. The earlier extraction was wrong. So we need to correct.\n\nThus action: update_checklist.\n\nReturn function call.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"08/02/22\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 1   Filed 08/02/22   Page 1 of 17\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "08/02/22", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 1   Filed 08/02/22   Page 1 of 17", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6134, "completion_tokens": 837, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Also maybe other documents not fully visited: Docket, SCOTUS Opinion, maybe others. Should confirm all filing dates across all documents. We must ensure we capture all distinct values. We have already updated to only one value? Step 17 shows update replaced with only 08/02/22. That seems wrong. We need to re-append all values. But we must first read more documents to confirm all filing dates. We need to fully visit remaining docs: Complaint (many tokens), other orders, Order, Stipulation of Dismissal. We have some values already. Need to find filing dates in Docket and SCOTUS Opinion too. Likely docket includes filing dates for each entry. We should search for \"Filed\" with regex on Docket and SCOTUS Opinion. Also maybe other documents like Memorandum Decision and Order (001-005) have filing dates, but we have at least some. Already we saw from (005) 05/04/23. Need to confirm if (001-004) have dates: we saw (001) 08/13/22, (002) 08/17/22, (003) 08/24/22, (004) 02/03/23. So all filing dates from those orders. Also Order has September 28, 2023. Stipulation has 03/05/25. Complaint has 08/02/22. Docket may have multiple entries with dates. But filing date of lawsuit is first filed, likely 08/02/22. But we need all distinct filing dates across documents: maybe each document has its own filing date. So we need to list all dates: 08/02/22, 08/13/22, 08/17/22, 08/24/22, 02/03/23, 05/04/23, 09/28/23 (September 28, 2023), 03/05/25, maybe others in docket for other filings? Might not be required if not relevant. But requirement: extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So if docket contains other dates like \"Filed 08/02/22\" etc. But likely docket includes docket entries with filing dates. Could be many. We need to get all distinct dates. Might be many. But maybe we just need the dates for the lawsuit filing. The docket may have many entries for motions etc. But the filing date of the lawsuit is 08/02/22. But the prompt says \"All distinct values of this checklist item found in any document.\" So yes all dates.\n\nWe need to search docket and SCOTUS Opinion for \"Filed\" pattern. Let's search docket. Use search_document_regex on Docket. Also on SCOTUS Opinion. Then parse matches. Then extract unique dates.\n\nWe'll need to append all extracted values. Our current checklist has only 08/02/22. We need to update to include all others. We can use append_checklist for multiple values or update. Since we need to add many, we can use append_checklist? But we must ensure no duplicates.

Check if any missing filing dates: We have 7 distinct dates: 08/02/22, 08/13/22, 08/17/22, 08/24/22, 02/03/23, 05/04/23, 03/05/25. Are there any other filing dates? We saw Order filing date: September 28, 2023. That is a filing date of the Order. But does that count? The Filing_Date is \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" The Order is a subsequent proceeding, not the initial filing. The filing dates extracted likely refer to document date of filing of each document? The requirement: extract filing date of lawsuit first filed/initiated. That is probably the earliest date: 08/02/22. But the checklist item likely expects all distinct filing dates across documents? The prompt says \"Extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So include all dates where \"Filed\" appears in documents. So we should also include September 28, 2023 from Order. Also perhaps other dates? Search shows multiple matches earlier: 88 matches across docs. But we have captured 7. But maybe there are more: The Order has \"Filed September 28, 2023\". Also maybe other documents include other filing dates like \"Filed 01/15/22\" etc. But need to check if any other doc has \"Filed\" with date not captured. The search results earlier had many matches but we only appended 7. We might need to search for order and other documents for filing date. The Order has one date. Stipulation of Dismissal has 03/05/25. We have that. Maybe the Docket or SCOTUS Opinion also have filing dates. But Docket unvisited; SCOTUS Opinion unvisited. Could include filing dates? Possibly the SCOTUS Opinion may contain \"Filed\" as well, but likely not. Let's consider at least the Order filing date. That needs to be appended.\n\nAlso we might need to check if there are any other filing dates in the documents we haven't visited fully: e.g., Memorandum Decision and Order (001) might have multiple filed dates? But we have 08/13/22. Maybe there are others in that doc like 08/13/22 appears multiple times. But we already captured. Also maybe the Complaint has other filing dates? We captured 08/02/22. But maybe also earlier docket entries? But we haven't read all tokens. But we have 55% coverage. There may be other \"Filed\" dates in the later part. Similarly for other memos. But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" That means we should search for all \"Filed\" dates across all documents. We have 88 matches earlier, but we only appended 7. So we likely missing many. We need to continue searching and appending.\n\nBut the current plan: we have partially visited many docs. We might now search for \"Filed\" dates in the remaining parts of the docs.\n\nGiven we haven't visited all tokens, we need to read more to find missing dates. However, maybe the \"Filed\" dates are all in header pages, which we have partially visited. But some documents might have \"Filed\" in later pages. But we have coverage about 50% for many docs. So likely more dates exist.\n\nThus we should continue by searching for \"Filed\" in documents that we haven't fully visited. Which docs are unvisited? Docket and SCOTUS Opinion are unvisited. Also maybe we need to read more of the Order to capture the September 28, 2023 date. We only read tokens 89-289, but we saw the order date. But we need to append that.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist to add Filing_Date \"September 28, 2023\" with evidence from Order page (the snippet). But before that we also need to find other missing dates. But we can append the order date. Then we can decide to search again for more. But we need to output only one action per turn. So next action: append_checklist for the order date. Then next turn we can search for other docs.\n\nThus we will call append_checklist with key Filing_Date, adding value \"September 28, 2023\" with evidence snippet. Use the snippet from the extracted result: \"Filed September 28, 2023\". Provide source_document \"Order\", location maybe \"Page 1\" or tokens 89-289. Provide evidence text exactly.\n\nWe need to ensure the evidence text snippet is verbatim from the document. The snippet from search result: \n```\nFiled September 28, 2023 \n```\nWe should include that.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"patch\":[{\"key\":\"Filing_Date\",\"extracted\":[{\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"Filed September 28, 2023\",\"source_document\":\"Order\",\"location\":\"Page 1\"}],\"value\":\"September 28, 2023\"}]}]}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"evidence": [{"text": "Filed September 28, 2023", "source_document": "Order", "location": "Page 1"}], "value": "September 28, 2023"}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5977, "completion_tokens": 1091, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to extract all distinct values of Filing_Date from any document. Are there any more documents that might contain filing dates not yet captured? We have 10 documents. The documents we have partially read; some are still unvisited: Docket, SCOTUS Opinion. Also some documents partially visited may contain other filing dates not captured, but we already captured from all the documents we searched: Complaint, Memorandum Decision and Order (001)-(005), Order, Stipulation of Dismissal. That covers all documents except Docket and SCOTUS Opinion. Docket may contain filing dates? Usually docket contains docket entries with dates, but we need filing date of lawsuit. Docket entries might include the initial filing date; but we already captured from Complaint. Docket may list the case's filing date again. But we already have the filing date 08/02/22. But maybe there are other filing dates like \"Filed 08/02/22\" repeated. We need distinct values. We have 8 distinct values: 08/02/22, 08/13/22, 08/17/22, 08/24/22, 02/03/23, 05/04/23, 03/05/25, September 28, 2023. Wait, we have 8 values: 07? Actually we have 8 unique values. Let's list: 08/02/22, 08/13/22, 08/17/22, 08/24/22, 02/03/23, 05/04/23, 03/05/25, September 28, 2023. That's 8. The question: Are there any other filing dates? The Docket may have a \"Filed\" date for the initial filing. We already have that. Could be other docket entries like \"Filed on 08/02/22\" again. But that would not be new. The SCOTUS Opinion might have a \"Filed\" date of the appellate case? But the SCOTUS Opinion is probably a Supreme Court opinion; it includes \"Filed\" maybe the date the case was filed with Supreme Court? But the filing date of the lawsuit is the original filing with the Ninth Circuit, which presumably is 08/02/22. The SCOTUS opinion would not contain a new filing date. So we likely have all unique filing dates.\n\nBut we must verify if any other documents might contain a filing date not captured: e.g., Docket. But we already captured 08/02/22. Let's search Docket for \"Filed\". But we haven't read Docket. We could search Docket with regex for \"Filed\". Let's do search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"Filed\\s+(?:on\\s+)?([A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4})\" or also numeric format. But we might not need to. But to be thorough, we can search Docket for filing dates.\n\nAlso SCOTUS Opinion might have \"Filed\" but could be a different filing date (for the Supreme Court docket). But the lawsuit's filing date remains same. However the question: \"Extract the filing date from the legal documents.\" We need all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. That includes any document that might have a filing date. So we should search Docket and SCOTUS Opinion to confirm no other dates. If there are none, we are done.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on [Docket, SCOTUS Opinion] for dates. Use pattern with month name or numeric. Use \"search_document_regex\" on doc_names [\"Docket\", \"SCOTUS Opinion\"] with pattern \"Filed\\s+(?:on\\s+)?(?:(?:[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4})|(?:\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}))\". But we want to capture any \"Filed\" date occurrences. That may return many matches. But we only need to confirm no new distinct dates.\n\nWe can also search Docket for \"Filed\" without regex to get context.\n\nWe have 10 docs. The last two unvisited: Docket (16k tokens) and SCOTUS Opinion (24k tokens). We'll search both for \"Filed\" pattern.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on [\"Docket\", \"SCOTUS Opinion\"].\n\nWe should specify doc_names array.\n\nAlso we could set top_k higher? default 5. But we need all matches maybe to detect new dates. But we can search for \"Filed\" and then maybe read manually. But easier: use regex to capture all dates. But the tool returns top_k matches per doc. We only need to ensure no new distinct dates. But top_k might miss some. But we can search all matches by setting top_k large. The tool allows max 20. We can set top_k 20. For Docket maybe many matches. But we only care about new dates. So we can parse top_k 20 for each doc. That might still miss new dates if there are >20.\n\nBut we can also do a second search with a different pattern: \"File\\s+on\\s+(\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2})\" maybe.\n\nBut likely Docket has many docket entries; each has \"Filed\" with date. Many duplicates of same date. But no new distinct.\n\nBut SCOTUS Opinion likely no \"Filed\" or maybe \"Filed on\" with case date. But maybe \"Filed 08/02/22\" again.\n\nThus we can search.\n\nLet's choose search_document_regex on [\"Docket\", \"SCOTUS Opinion\"] with pattern \"Filed\\s+(?:on\\s+)?(?:(?:[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4})|(?:\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}))\". Provide flags IGNORECASE maybe. Provide top_k 20, context_tokens 200.\n\nOk.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Docket\",\"SCOTUS Opinion\"],\"pattern\":\"Filed\\\\s+(?:on\\\\s+)?(?:(?:[A-Za-z]+\\\\s+\\\\d{1,2},\\\\s+\\\\d{4})|(?:\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{2}))\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Docket", "SCOTUS Opinion"], "pattern": "Filed\\s+(?:on\\s+)?(?:(?:[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4})|(?:\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}))", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5601, "completion_tokens": 1378, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to ensure all distinct filing dates in any document are extracted. We have partially visited some documents: Complaint, Orders 001-005, Order, Stipulation. We haven't visited Docket or SCOTUS Opinion. Could have more filing dates. Need to search those unvisited docs. The search_document_regex earlier found matches in Docket and SCOTUS Opinion but returned 0 matches. But maybe filing date appears in Docket? Docket might have a line \"Filed: 08/02/22\" etc. But search didn't find. But we should search Docket again? Might be more than 5 matches? Actually earlier search on Docket returned 0 matches. Could be that the docket shows filing date differently, like \"Filed 08/02/22\" or \"Filed on 08/02/22\" but search regex may not capture. Could search for pattern \"Filed\" alone? But that could be many false positives. But we only need filing date. We have one date from Order. There may be other filing dates in Docket/SCOTUS Opinion. But check if Order's filing date is different from others. The Order likely is the final order, filed on September 28, 2023. The Complaint has filing date 08/02/22. The memoranda and stipulation have dates. All distinct values: 08/02/22, 08/13/22, 08/17/22, 08/24/22, 02/03/23, 05/04/23, 03/05/25, 09/28/2023. That's 8 dates. Are there any more? The docket may list \"Filed 08/02/22\" and maybe \"Filed 09/28/23\" etc. But we might have duplicates already. The docket might list docket entries for each filing, but those are likely duplicates of these dates. However, we must extract every distinct value. The docket may have the same dates again. But duplicates should not be added. We have all distinct values? Let's consider: Are there any other filing dates like 10/?? or 04/?? in docket? Could be not relevant. But the docket might include dates for other documents (e.g., \"Filed 03/05/25\" etc). But those are already extracted. So likely we have all distinct dates. But to be safe, we should search Docket for \"Filed\" pattern and verify no new dates. But search_document_regex returned 0 matches for Docket. That suggests maybe the docket uses different formatting like \"Filing Date: 08/02/22\" or \"Filing Date: August 2, 2022\". We need to handle that. But we can search for \"Filing Date\" pattern too. But the goal is to extract every distinct filing date. The docket might have \"Filing Date 08/02/22\" and \"Filed 08/02/22\" etc. Let's search Docket for \"Filing Date\" pattern. Use search_document_regex on Docket with pattern \"Filing Date\\s*[:\\s]*([A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2})\". That could capture. Also maybe \"Filed on\" or \"Filed:\".\n\nWe should also search SCOTUS Opinion for \"Filed\" pattern. But earlier search returned 0 matches. However, SCOTUS Opinion likely has \"Filed: ...\" in the docket information. It might have \"Filed: 09/28/2023\" or similar. But we already have that date. But maybe SCOTUS includes earlier filing date like 08/02/22 again. But duplicates.\n\nThus, to ensure completeness, we should search Docket and SCOTUS Opinion for \"Filing Date\" or \"Filed\" patterns. That will confirm no new dates.\n\nWe have partially visited Docket and SCOTUS Opinion. We can search them with regex. Since we have not visited them, we can use search_document_regex on those docs.\n\nBut the snapshot says search on Docket returned 0 matches earlier. But maybe search didn't find because pattern missing. We'll try a more inclusive pattern: \"Filed\\s*(on\\s*)?([A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2})\". That we used earlier and got 0. But maybe docket uses \"Filed:\" with colon. The pattern should allow optional colon. Also maybe \"Filed 08/02/22\" (without on). Our pattern should capture that: \"Filed\\s*[:\\s]*([A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2})\".

Need to confirm if all distinct values are present. The snapshot says 8 values extracted. It lists that keys with values 1/1, empty 0/1, Not Applicable 0/1. So all values extracted? The extraction progress says 8 values. Likely complete. But should verify if any missing filing dates in unvisited documents: Docket, SCOTUS Opinion. But search had found no matches in Docket and SCOTUS. But maybe some docs not searched fully. However we have 8 values; maybe that's all distinct. The checklist: Filing_Date. So we can stop? But the system says to verify all values present. We can do get_checklist to confirm extracted values. But the action list says we can stop only when all keys complete or Not Applicable. It seems likely complete. But to be safe, maybe do get_checklist for Filing_Date to confirm. But the instruction: \"Choose ONE action based on current state\". We can choose get_checklist to verify. But we might want to stop. But verify that no more filing dates exist. The prior search did not find in Docket/SCOTUS. But maybe there are other documents not visited. But if Docket and SCOTUS are unvisited, we haven't searched them fully. But search earlier was on all documents and found matches only in listed docs. But search on all documents had matches 88 earlier, but later search on Docket and SCOTUS had 0 matches. So if search on all documents earlier found 88 matches, that included all docs. So maybe all filing dates were captured. So we can stop. But we need to ensure that all distinct values are present. We have 8 values. Could there be duplicates? The 8 values: from Complaint: 08/02/22, from Memorandum Decision and Order (001): the date? We didn't see in snippet. But likely each doc has a filing date. So we might stop.\n\nThus best action: stop.

The current status says Filing_Date has 8 values extracted. The checklist has 1 key. The status says 1/1 filled, 0 empty. So all keys are filled. Are all possible filing dates captured? The previous steps found 8 distinct dates. We need to ensure no missing. The search results earlier found 88 matches, but the appended values maybe 8. We should confirm if any other dates exist. The docket and SCOTUS Opinion are unvisited. They might have filing dates? The docket might not have filing dates because docket is a table. The SCOTUS Opinion likely has a date of decision, not filing. But could have \"Filed\" line. But we should check search in SCOTUS Opinion. There were earlier searches with 0 matches. So probably no. The Order already was partially visited; maybe the Order contains a filing date? We have 1 value from Order. The Stipulation of Dismissal also had a date. So probably all captured.\n\nWe should confirm no duplicate dates across documents; each distinct value added. The list likely has 8 unique dates.\n\nThus we can stop.
