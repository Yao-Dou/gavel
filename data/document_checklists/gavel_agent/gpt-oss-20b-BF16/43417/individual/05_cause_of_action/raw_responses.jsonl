We have 10 documents. Likely the Complaint will list causes of action. Also maybe the Docket or orders mention cause of action. Best is to search all documents for patterns like \"cause of action\", \"claims\", \"statute\", \"under\" etc. But we only need the legal vehicles used to bring claims: e.g., \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. So we need to find statutes or case law vehicles, not remedies or doctrines. So likely in Complaint, there will be a list of claims: e.g., \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"Title II of the ADA\", etc.\n\nThus we should search the Complaint for patterns like \"42 U.S.C. §\", \"Title II of the ADA\", \"FTCA\", \"Bivens\", \"14th Amendment\" (but that's an amendment; we should not include that). But the instruction says do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments or statutory rights). So \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is a cause of action, \"Title II of the ADA\" is a cause of action. We should avoid \"14th Amendment\" alone. So we need to search for specific statutes. Let's just search all documents for \"§\" and \"U.S.C.\" maybe. But maybe the Complaint includes typical cause of action phrases like \"under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"under the ADA\", etc.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex with pattern like \"(42 U.S.C. § [0-9]+)|(Title [I-V]+ of the ADA)|(FTCA)|(Bivens)\" etc. But the regex may find matches across documents. We can search all documents.\n\nSince we need to get evidence, we will read the context around matches. The search function returns matches with context. We can then parse the returned matches to extract cause of action.\n\nThus our next action: search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" and pattern capturing relevant phrases. Let's create a pattern: \"(42 U.S.C. § [0-9]+)|(?:Title (?:II|III|IV) of the ADA)|(FTCA)|(Bivens)\".

We need to extract distinct causes of action: likely EMTALA (42 U.S.C. § 1395dd), maybe Title II of ADA? But not present. Also FTCA? Not present. Bivens? Not present. So only EMTALA.\n\nWe need to locate all mentions of EMTALA or 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd. We have some matches in complaint. But we should verify that EMTALA is indeed the cause of action. The complaint says \"the United States of America brings this civil action for declaratory and injunctive relief, and alleges ... Under federal law, hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds are required to provide necessary stabilizing treatment ... Under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\". That indicates the cause of action is EMTALA. Also in orders, they discuss preemption under EMTALA. So we need to extract the cause of action as \"Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\". Also could mention \"Title II of the ADA\" etc but not present. So just EMTALA.\n\nWe need to provide evidence snippet with source document and location. We have token ranges for Complaint: 257-457 contains mention of EMTALA. Let's read that portion to get exact text. We'll use read_document on Complaint start 257 end 457. Then we will append to checklist.\n\nAlso we may want to check if any other documents mention EMTALA. But could include same text. But duplicate values not needed. So we need one entry. We must include evidence. The snippet would include \"Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\".

We need to extract distinct causes of action: each legal vehicle used to bring claims. In Complaint, there are claims under EMTALA as cause. Also maybe Title II of ADA? Let's search for \"Title II of the ADA\" etc. We need to search documents for those patterns to capture other causes. The search_regex already found matches. But we should read those matches to confirm context, and then append to checklist.\n\nWe currently have only read a portion of Complaint that includes EMTALA. We need to capture cause: \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act)\". Next we should find other causes like Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. § 1983? That's not Title II). Title II of the ADA is 42 U.S.C. § 1981? Actually Title II of ADA is 42 U.S.C. § 1981? Wait, Title II of ADA is 42 U.S.C. § 1981? Actually Title II of ADA is 42 U.S.C. § 1981? No, Title II of ADA is 42 U.S.C. § 1981? Not sure. But we should search for \"Title II of the ADA\" in documents. Also for FTCA (Federal Tort Claims Act). Also Bivens maybe. But the search regex found 14 matches across documents. We should read those matches to confirm each cause. Let's use search_document_regex again to get matches for those patterns with context. But we already did search and got matches. But we need to read the specific matches for each pattern to capture evidence. We could call search_document_regex again for each doc or for all, but we might want to drill down each match. The matches include token ranges. For example, Complaint had 5 matches. We read part of Complaint 257-457. We need to read other ranges for Complaint that contain other matches: 1047-1247, 1773-1973, 1985-2185, 2372-2572. We need to read those to capture any causes.

Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc? But that's also EMTALA related. The regex pattern included 42 U.S.C. § [0-9]+. So we need to gather distinct values: \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\" (EMTALA). Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\" appears. Are we to include each statute as a cause? Yes.\n\nAlso \"Title II of the ADA\" not present. \"FTCA\" not present. \"Bivens\" not present. So we need to extract EMTALA (42 U.S.C. § 1395dd) and possibly 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f), (e), (b)(1). But the cause is the statute itself, not the subsection. So we should list unique statute citations: 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd, 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(a)(1)(I)\" but same.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(e)(1)\" etc. But still same statute.\n\nThus we need to extract those two.\n\nWe have evidence from Complaint tokens 257-457: EMTALA, 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd. Also from other parts: tokens 1047-1247 show 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f). This also indicates EMTALA. Also from other matches: 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc appears in Complaint tokens 1985-2185. So we should read that portion.\n\nWe also have from other documents: e.g., Memorandum Decision and Order (001) tokens 1138-1338 mention EMTALA, 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd. Also others mention 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd, 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(a)(1)(I). So we need to read those parts to gather evidence.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex to find all matches again but we already have. But we need to read the actual text around each match to get evidence. We might need to read multiple documents.\n\nWe can also use search_document_regex again to find all matches for \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\" or \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\". But the previous search already gave matches. But we can get context for each match by reading the token ranges.\n\nWe may need to read the specific token ranges for each match. Already we have some ranges: Complaint tokens 257-457 (contains 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd). Complaint tokens 1047-1247 (contains 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f)). Complaint tokens 1985-2185 (contains 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc). Also maybe Complaint tokens 2372-2572 includes 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd. Also other documents: Memorandum Decision and Order (001) tokens 1138-1338 includes 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd. Memorandum Decision and Order (003) tokens 1346-1850 includes 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd and 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc. Also Order tokens 3471-3671 includes 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd.\n\nThus we should read those token ranges to gather evidence.\n\nWe should decide next action: use read_document to read more of Complaint: tokens 1985-2185. Also maybe 2372-2572. But we can also read the other documents. Let's do read_document on Complaint tokens 1985-2185. That suffices to capture 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc.\n\nAlso we may need evidence for 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd from other docs, but we already have evidence from Complaint tokens 257-457 and 1047-1247, etc. We can use those. But better to get from other docs too.\n\nBut we are limited to one action per turn. We can read one document range. So pick a document with an uncovered match for a statute we haven't captured yet: Complaint tokens 1985-2185 for 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Complaint start 1985 end 2185.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint\",\"start_token\":1985,\"end_token\":2185}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 1985, "end_token": 2185}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6836, "completion_tokens": 1074, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Likely there are: (1) 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd (EMTALA) (2) Title II of the ADA (civil rights law) (3) FTCA (Federal Tort Claims Act) (4) Bivens (constitutional cause). Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f)\" is a sub-section, but same act. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\" is the cause. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\" may be separate cause? But the regex didn't include that.

We have seen many matches with 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd etc. The cause of action is the cause-of-action vehicle: e.g., EMTALA (42 U.S.C. § 1395dd). Also maybe Title II of ADA? Not present. FTCA? Not present. Bivens? Not present. So the cause of action is EMTALA (42 U.S.C. § 1395dd). Also maybe Title II of ADA? Not in matches. So likely only EMTALA.\n\nBut we need to confirm if any other cause-of-action is used: there might be \"Supremacy Clause\" but that's not a cause of action vehicle. The cause of action is the legal basis: EMTALA. So we need to extract the value \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\" (the EMTALA statute). Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\" is also part of EMTALA but the cause of action is EMTALA. But the requirement says: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens).\" So EMTALA is a statute. So we need to extract \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\" as EMTALA cause of action. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\" is part of EMTALA but not the cause of action.\n\nAlso, maybe Title II of the ADA? Not present. The search didn't find Title II. The pattern didn't match Title II of ADA.\n\nSo we need to identify cause of action entries from the documents: maybe \"EMTALA\" appears multiple times. But we need distinct values. So \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\" is one. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\" but that's not the cause of action. The cause of action is EMTALA. However, the text also mentions \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\" but that's a subsection of EMTALA. But the cause of action refers to EMTALA as a whole. So we might only record one entry: \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\" (EMTALA). Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\" might be considered a cause of action? But it's a statutory provision that provides a specific requirement under EMTALA. But the cause of action could be EMTALA as a whole, but the question might want the specific statutory provision. The example says e.g., \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is a cause of action. So each statutory provision that creates a private right of action is a cause of action. EMTALA is a statute that creates a private right of action for preemption. So we can record \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\" as cause of action.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\" is a statute that creates a private right of action? Actually EMTALA's preemption can be brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd. § 1395cc is about Medicare participation, not a private right of action. So exclude.\n\nThus only one cause-of-action: \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd.\"\n\nWe need evidence from the documents. We have multiple matches: the Complaint (tokens 257-457) includes \"EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\". Also other matches. We need to provide evidence for extraction. We need to call append_checklist for key Cause_of_Action with extracted value \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\" and evidence from at least one document.\n\nWe should choose a document that contains the full text: Complaint has the snippet. Also maybe Memorandum Decision and Order (001) has same. But we already read Complaint tokens 257-457, which contains \"EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\". We can use that evidence.\n\nThus we need to do append_checklist.\n\nWe must not mark Not Applicable. So we will append.\n\nWe need to provide evidence as array with text, source_document, location.\n\nLocation: we can give page or token range. The snippet is from Complaint page 2. We can say \"page 2\" or token offset 257-457. Use location \"page 2\" or token offset.\n\nBetter to use token offsets: \"257-457\".\n\nSo we will call append_checklist with patch for key Cause_of_Action, extracted array with one entry: value \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\", evidence: text snippet, source_document \"Complaint\", location \"tokens 257-457\" or \"page 2\".\n\nWe should also note that we may want to ensure we include all distinct values.

The search found 14 matches, all 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd. So likely only that one cause. But check other documents: The Memorandum Decision and Order (001) might mention \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\". Also (002) might mention. (003) many matches. We may need to confirm if any other cause of action appears. Search pattern for 42 U.S.C. § 1983? Not seen. Title II ADA? Not present. FTCA? No. Bivens? No.\n\nThus only cause: \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\" (EMTALA). But maybe also \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\" but that's a statutory provision, not a cause of action. The cause is the statutory provision that gives right to sue. EMTALA gives a private right of action? Actually EMTALA is a federal law providing a right to sue for violations. So yes. The cause of action is EMTALA.\n\nBut we must ensure we capture distinct values. Only one value. We already appended one. But we need evidence for all occurrences? We only need one entry per unique value. So we can stop after confirming no other causes. To be safe, we might search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" to confirm none. But the search pattern didn't find those. However, the search pattern could have missed if not in the regex. But we can do a search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1\" or \"42 U.S.C. §\" generic? Might be too broad. But we can search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" specifically. Let's do a search_document_regex for that pattern across all docs.\n\nWe must not read entire docs. Use search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"42 U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. § 1983\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1983", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8778, "completion_tokens": 693, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But maybe other statutes like Title II ADA, FTCA, Bivens. We did initial search earlier but limited to those patterns. That search found 14 matches across documents. We read some. We saw 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd, maybe also 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc, § 1395dd(f), etc. Those are subparts of EMTALA. Are they separate causes? The requirement: cause of action is the legal vehicle used to bring claims. EMTALA itself is the cause. Subparts may be considered part of EMTALA. But the cause is the statute, not the subparts. Might be considered separate cause? Usually the underlying statute is the cause. So maybe we only need 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd. However, there might be also Title II ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act).

We have one: 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd. There may be others: maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc, 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(e). But the checklist definition says we should extract the legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims – statutes creating a private or enforcement right of action. For example, EMTALA (42 U.S.C. § 1395dd) is a cause of action. Also 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc (Medicare? but does that create a private right? Maybe not). Also 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f) is part of EMTALA. Should we include subsections? The instruction: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens). Do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments or statutory rights), remedies (injunction, damages, declaratory relief), or procedural doctrines/rules.\" So we should list each distinct cause of action that the complaint claims. The complaint says \"for declaratory and injunctive relief, and alleges as follows: ... Under federal law, hospitals... Under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd...\" So cause of action: EMTALA (42 U.S.C. § 1395dd). Also maybe \"Title II of the ADA\" not present. \"FTCA\" not present. \"Bivens\" not present. So only one.\n\nHowever there might be \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\" but that's a Medicare provider agreement, not a cause of action. The complaint might also use \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f)\" but that's a subsection of EMTALA. The cause of action is EMTALA. So we keep one.\n\nBut we need to check if there is mention of \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\" elsewhere, like in orders etc. We already captured from complaint. We should also capture from other documents to ensure completeness. But we already have all causes of action identified. Could there be \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b)(1)\" etc. But those are sub-sections of EMTALA. They are not separate vehicles. So we keep one.\n\nWe need to verify if any other cause of action appears: maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\" also is a cause? But it's a Medicare provider agreement. The complaint might rely on this? Let's search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1395cc\" in the complaint snippet: yes, line: \"See 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc.\" But that is not a cause of action. It's a statute that sets a requirement for provider agreements. But it's not the basis for a claim. The cause of action is EMTALA. So we should not include §1395cc.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f)\" appears as part of EMTALA. Not separate.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b)(1)\" etc. Not separate.\n\nThus we only need one cause of action.\n\nBut we need to double-check if there is any mention of \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"Title II of the ADA\" or FTCA. None found.\n\nThus checklist is complete.\n\nBut we must ensure that we have evidence for the single value. We already have evidence from complaint tokens 257-457. That snippet includes \"Under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd,\". That is evidence. We might also provide an evidence from memorandum decision etc. But not necessary.\n\nWe should verify we are not missing any other cause of action like \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(e)(1)\" etc. But those are still EMTALA. The definition says we only list distinct cause of action; duplicates should be deduped. So only one.\n\nThus we can stop. But we need to call get_checklist? No, we already have the value appended. Are there any remaining keys? Only one key. It is filled. So we can stop.\n\nWe should respond with stop decision JSON.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All required checklist items (Cause_of_Action) have been extracted and completed with supporting evidence.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All required checklist items (Cause_of_Action) have been extracted and completed with supporting evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8411, "completion_tokens": 1010, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Might be in other docs. But we need to extract distinct causes.\n\nWe should search for all matches again with pattern capturing all relevant codes. The search already captured 24 matches across docs. We need to parse to identify distinct causes: codes like 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd, 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc, 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f), maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b)(1), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(e), etc. But the requirement says: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens).\" So we should list the statutes that provide cause of action: 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd (EMTALA right of action). 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc? That is a requirement, not a cause. But the complaint may invoke EMTALA preemption. The cause of action is EMTALA preemption. So the cause is EMTALA. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1983?
