But we might need to extract the entire paragraph? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition. When multiple values exist for a checklist item, create separate extracted entries for each value.\" So for Factual_Basis_of_Case, we might have multiple facts: e.g., \"Hospitals receiving Medicare funds must provide EMTALA treatment.\" But maybe each distinct fact is a sentence. But might be too many. But maybe just need to extract the main facts: 1) The Idaho law prohibits abortion, conflicting with EMTALA. 2) The case is about preemption. 3) The United States seeks declaratory judgment. But unclear.\n\nMaybe the Factual_Basis_of_Case includes specific factual statements: e.g., \"The State of Idaho passed a near-absolute ban on abortion on August 25, 2022.\" \"Idaho Code § 18-622 makes it a felony to perform an abortion.\" \"Hospitals must provide EMTALA treatment.\" \"The United States seeks declaratory judgment that Idaho's law is invalid.\" etc.\n\nWe need to extract all facts. But maybe we can capture relevant facts as separate entries. The instructions: \"When multiple values exist for a checklist item, create separate extracted entries for each value.\" So we can split each distinct factual statement into separate entries. But we must provide evidence snippet for each.\n\nWe need to use append_checklist with patch for key \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" with multiple extracted entries. Each entry has evidence array with text, source_document, location.\n\nWe have many sentences. Let's plan a few key facts:\n\nFrom Complaint:\n\n1. \"Hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds are required to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency.\" (Paragraph 1.1)\n\n2. \"Under EMTALA, if a person with an 'emergency medical condition' seeks treatment at an emergency department at a hospital that accepts Medicare funds, the hospital must provide medical treatment necessary to stabilize that condition before transferring or discharging the patient.\" (Paragraph 1.1)\n\n3. \"Such circumstances may include ectopic pregnancy, severe preeclampsia, or a pregnancy complication threatening septic infection or hemorrhage.\" (Paragraph 1.2)\n\n4. \"The State of Idaho has passed a near-absolute ban on abortion; effective August 25, 2022; Idaho Code § 18-622 makes it a felony to perform an abortion in all but extremely narrow circumstances.\" (Paragraph 1.3)\n\n5. \"Under the Idaho law, any state or local prosecutor can subject a physician to indictment, arrest, and prosecution merely by showing that an abortion has been performed.\" (Paragraph 1.4)\n\n6. \"The law then puts the burden on the physician to prove an affirmative defense at trial.\" (Paragraph 1.4)\n\n7. \"Idaho's abortion law will prevent doctors from performing abortions even when a doctor determines that abortion is the medically necessary treatment to prevent severe risk to the patient's health and even in cases where denial of care will likely result in death.\" (Paragraph 1.5)\n\n8. \"The United States seeks a declaratory judgment that Idaho's law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause and is preempted by federal law to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA.\" (Paragraph 6.6? Actually point 6.6 in the Complaint.)\n\n9. \"The United States also seeks an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining Idaho’s restrictive abortion law to the extent it conflicts with EMTALA.\" (Same point.)\n\n10. \"The United States is also seeking relief that Idaho may not initiate a prosecution against, seek to impose any form of liability on, or attempt to revoke the professional license of any medical provider based on that provider’s performance of an abortion that is authorized under EMTALA.\" (Prayer for relief.)\n\nBut these are more legal claims. But the Factual_Basis_of_Case likely includes the facts about the law, EMTALA, and the conflict. We should extract them.\n\nHowever, the prompt may want the factual basis: e.g., \"The State of Idaho passed a near-absolute ban on abortion effective August 25, 2022.\" That is a fact. Also \"Hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds are required to provide EMTALA treatment.\" etc.\n\nGiven the length, we may extract a limited set of key facts. But the instructions say \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" So we need to be exhaustive. But we can't extract entire paragraphs as separate facts? Might be too many. But maybe they expect each factual statement that is a separate sentence. We might need to split the paragraphs into individual facts.\n\nGiven the time, maybe we can extract the main facts as separate entries. Let's identify distinct factual statements in the Complaint.\n\nLet's locate the factual statements:\n\nAfter the header \"PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\" the Complaint lists numbered points 1-6.\n\n1. Under federal law, hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds are required to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency. (Fact)\n\n2. Under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), if a person with an “emergency medical condition” seeks treatment at an emergency department at a hospital that accepts Medicare funds, the hospital must provide medical treatment necessary to stabilize that condition before transferring or discharging the patient. (Fact)\n\n3. Crucially, “emergency medical conditions” under the statute include not just conditions that present risks to life but also those that place a patient’s “health” in “serious jeopardy” or risk “serious impairment to bodily functions” or “serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.” (Fact)\n\n4. In some circumstances, medical care that a state may characterize as an “abortion” is necessary emergency stabilizing care that hospitals are required to provide under EMTALA. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, ectopic pregnancy, severe preeclampsia, or a pregnancy complication threatening septic infection or hemorrhage. (Fact)\n\n5. The State of Idaho, however, has passed a near-absolute ban on abortion. Once the Idaho law takes effect on August 25, 2022, Idaho Code § 18-622 will make it a felony to perform an abortion in all but extremely narrow circumstances. (Fact)\n\n6. Idaho Code § 18-622(3) (2022). Nothing protects a physician from arrest or criminal prosecution under Idaho’s law. (Fact)\n\n7. Idaho's abortion law will therefore prevent doctors from performing abortions even when a doctor determines that abortion is the medically necessary treatment to prevent severe risk to the patient’s health and even in cases where denial of care will likely result in death. (Fact)\n\n8. The United States seeks a declaratory judgment that Idaho’s law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause and is preempted by federal law to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA. (Fact) Actually this is a claim, but still fact: The United States is seeking declaratory judgment. But maybe it's a claim.\n\n9. The United States also seeks an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining Idaho’s restrictive abortion law to the extent it conflicts with EMTALA. (Fact)\n\nWe may also include that the United States sent a letter to the State of Idaho on July 29, 2022 expressing view that § 18-622 was contrary to federal law. (Fact)\n\nAlso mention that the law takes effect August 25, 2022. (Fact)\n\nSo we can extract these.\n\nAlso we may include the fact that \"The United States has an interest in protecting the integrity of the Medicare program and ensuring hospitals receiving Medicare funding provide stabilizing treatment.\" But maybe that's claim.\n\nBetter to keep to facts.\n\nWe need evidence snippets. We need source_document \"Complaint\". Location: page and maybe token range or section. We can specify \"Page 2\" etc.\n\nLet's get the tokens for each fact. We can roughly locate them: the Complaint text shows the numbered points. We can provide evidence snippet from lines.\n\nWe need to provide at least one snippet per fact.\n\nWe'll create patch with key \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" and extracted array with entries.\n\nLet's craft evidence for each:\n\n1. Fact: Hospitals receiving federal Medicare funds must provide EMTALA treatment. Evidence snippet: from Complaint lines 2-4. Provide text: \"Under federal law, hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds are required to provide necessary stabilizing treatment to patients who arrive at their emergency departments while experiencing a medical emergency.\" Source_document: \"Complaint\". Location: \"Page 2, Preliminary Statement, point 1\". Token range approximate: we don't have tokens, but we can provide page.\n\n2. Fact: EMTALA requirement. Evidence: \"Under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), if a person with an “emergency medical condition” seeks treatment at an emergency department at a hospital that accepts Medicare funds, the hospital must provide medical treatment necessary to stabilize that condition before transferring or discharging the patient.\" Source_document: Complaint, Page 2, Preliminary Statement, point 1.\n\n3. Fact: EMTALA definition. Evidence: \"Crucially, “emergency medical conditions” under the statute include not just conditions that present risks to life but also those that place a patient’s “health” in “serious jeopardy” or risk “serious impairment to bodily functions” or “serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.”\" Source_document: Complaint, Page 2, Preliminary Statement, point 1.\n\n4. Fact: Circumstances where abortion is considered EMTALA care. Evidence: \"Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, ectopic pregnancy, severe preeclampsia, or a pregnancy complication threatening septic infection or hemorrhage.\" Source_document: Complaint, Page 2, Preliminary Statement, point 2.\n\n5. Fact: Idaho ban effective Aug 25 2022. Evidence: \"The State of Idaho, however, has passed a near-absolute ban on abortion. Once the Idaho law takes effect on August 25, 2022, Idaho Code § 18-622 will make it a felony to perform an abortion in all but extremely narrow circumstances.\" Source_document: Complaint, Page 2-3, Preliminary Statement, point 3.\n\n6. Fact: Idaho law allows prosecution for abortion. Evidence: \"Under the Idaho law, once effective, any state or local prosecutor can subject a physician to indictment, arrest, and prosecution merely by showing that an abortion has been performed, without regard to the circumstances.\" Source_document: Complaint, Page 3, Preliminary Statement, point 4.\n\n7. Fact: Idaho law burden on physician. Evidence: \"The law then puts the burden on the physician to prove an “affirmative defense” at trial.\" Source_document: Complaint, Page 3, Preliminary Statement, point 4.\n\n8. Fact: Idaho law will prevent doctors from performing abortions even when medically necessary. Evidence: \"Idaho’s abortion law will therefore prevent doctors from performing abortions even when a doctor determines that abortion is the medically necessary treatment to prevent severe risk to the patient’s health and even in cases where denial of care will likely result in death.\" Source_document: Complaint, Page 3, Preliminary Statement, point 5.\n\n9. Fact: Letter sent July 29 2022. Evidence: \"Before filing this lawsuit, on July 29, 2022, the United States sent a letter to the State of Idaho, expressing the United States’ view that § 18-622 was contrary to federal law.\" Source_document: Complaint, Page 4, Preliminary Statement, point 41.\n\n10. Fact: United States seeking declaratory judgment and injunction.

We need to ensure all checklist items: only one key Factual_Basis_of_Case. We need to verify whether other documents have additional factual basis, e.g., Memorandum decisions, Order, SCOTUS opinion may contain facts. We should search for \"facts\" or \"factual\" to find them. We already did a search across all documents for \"(?i)facts\". That found many matches in many documents, but we only extracted from Complaint. But we might need to extract all distinct factual basis from all documents, not just Complaint. The checklist item definition: \"facts or evidence upon which the case is built\". That could include facts presented in the case itself, not just Complaint. The complaint lists facts, but the decisions might restate facts. We should search for \"statement of facts\" or \"facts\" in other documents. We might need to read sections that contain factual basis. Let's search in each partially visited document for \"facts\" sections. We can use search_document_regex on each doc for \"(?i)fact(s|ful)\"? Probably \"facts\" is fine. But we already did a global search. It returned many matches. But we need to read more of these documents to extract facts. We should pick a doc with high coverage of facts. For example, Memorandum Decision and Order (001) is 7,637 tokens, we saw only 3% coverage. It likely contains facts. Let's read larger portion. But we should systematically go through each document.\n\nGoal: gather all factual basis from all documents. The current extracted values are from Complaint only. We need to find other facts in other documents. The search results show many matches across different docs, e.g., in Memorandum Decision and Order (001), (002), (003), etc.\n\nThus next action: read more of Memorandum Decision and Order (001). We need to read a portion that includes facts. Let's read from start to maybe 2000 tokens? The doc is 7,637 tokens; we saw 233-433 match. Let's read 0-2000. That would include early sections.

We need to find all distinct values of Factual_Basis_of_Case across all documents. We already have 10 from Complaint. Maybe other documents contain additional facts not yet captured. We should search other documents for \"facts\" or \"factual\". But we need to confirm if Factual_Basis_of_Case includes all facts presented. We need to examine other documents for additional factual statements. The previous searches found many matches across many documents. But the earlier step 9 appended 10 values from Complaint. But maybe there are more facts in other documents like Memorandum Decision and Order etc. We should search for \"facts\" in other documents and extract distinct factual statements. However, the instructions: \"extract every distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition\" meaning we should capture all distinct factual statements across all documents. We should not duplicate ones already captured. So we need to scan remaining documents for factual statements not already captured.\n\nThe checklist item is \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\". Typically includes facts, evidence, background. In Complaint, many statements. But other documents may restate same facts. We need distinct values that are new.\n\nFrom the search results, we saw many matches in Memorandum Decision and Order (001) with phrase \"the holes in the ‘factual’ foundation\". But that's about facts. That might be a factual statement? But it's referring to facts. We might extract facts from that document as well.\n\nBut the definition: \"Refers to the facts or evidence upon which the case is built. These facts are essential in the legal process and are used to support legal claims or decisions. It typically includes: Details of the relevant events—what happened, when it happened, where it happened, and who was involved. Evidence – Physical evidence, documentary records, witness testimonies, etc., that support these facts. Background information—Context or explanatory facts that provide additional understanding.\"\n\nSo we need to find factual statements describing events, evidence, background. The Complaint already contains many such facts. The other documents likely restate the same facts. We need to check if any new facts not in Complaint. For example, the Memorandum Decision and Order (001) might provide factual background about the law, the trigger, the effective date, etc. The Complaint may also contain some of that. But maybe the Memorandum Decision and Order includes facts about the legislative history, governor statements, etc. Those could be additional facts.\n\nWe should search for patterns like \"On June 24, 2022\" etc. We can search for \"On June 24, 2022\" in document 001. But maybe we already captured some from Complaint. Let's check Complaint for that. Did Complaint mention the date? The Complaint may not mention that detail. So we might need to capture new facts.\n\nWe must avoid duplicates. We should check what facts are already extracted. The 10 values: They are about EMTALA, Idaho law, effective date, etc. Let's list them:\n\n1. Hospitals that receive Medicare funds must provide EMTALA treatment to patients who arrive with a medical emergency.\n2. Under EMTALA, if a person with an emergency medical condition seeks treatment at an emergency department at a hospital that accepts Medicare funds, the hospital must provide medical treatment necessary to stabilize that condition before transferring or discharging the patient.\n3. EMTALA’s definition of an emergency medical condition includes conditions that place a patient’s health in serious jeopardy, risk serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n4. Circumstances where abortion is required under EMTALA include ectopic pregnancy, severe preeclampsia, or a pregnancy complication threatening septic infection or hemorrhage.\n5. The State of Idaho passed a near‑absolute ban on abortion effective August 25, 2022; Idaho Code § 18‑622 makes it a felony to perform an abortion in all but extremely narrow circumstances.\n6. After the Idaho law takes effect, any state or local prosecutor can indict, arrest, and prosecute a physician solely for performing an abortion, regardless of circumstances.\n7. The Idaho law places the burden on the physician to prove an affirmative defense at trial.\n8. Idaho’s abortion law will prevent doctors from performing abortions even when a doctor determines it is medically necessary to prevent severe risk to the patient’s health or likely death.\n9. On July 29, 2022, the United States sent a letter to the State of Idaho expressing that § 18‑622 was contrary to federal law.\n10. The United States seeks a declaratory judgment that Idaho’s law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause and is preempted by federal law where it conflicts with EMTALA, and also seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction against Idaho’s restrictive abortion law.\n\nThese 10 are from Complaint.\n\nNow check if other documents contain facts not captured. For example, Memorandum Decision and Order (001) includes facts about the law's trigger, effective date, governor statements, etc. Those might be new facts: e.g., \"The Idaho Legislature passed a law making it a felony for anyone to perform or attempt to perform or assist with an abortion. Idaho Code § 18-622(2).\" This is a fact. Also \"The law allows for affirmative defenses to prosecution where the abortion is necessary to prevent the death of a pregnant woman, or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest that was reported to law enforcement.\" Also \"Governor Brad Little signed the bill, but the Total Abortion Ban did not become law when signed.\" Also \"On June 24, 2022, the United States Supreme Court handed down Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 142 S. Ct. 2228 (June 24, 2022), overruling Roe and holding that the Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion.\" Also \"The Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs triggered the Total Abortion Ban, which is now set to go into effect on August 25, 2022.\" Also \"Governor Little has consistently offered his full-throated support for Roe’s overruling and for Idaho’s Total Abortion Ban. In July 2021, he joined ten other governors submitting an amicus brief in Dobbs.\" etc.\n\nAlso \"The United States filed this case against the State of Idaho on August 2, 2022.\" etc.\n\nThese facts are not in Complaint. So we must extract them.\n\nAlso other documents like Memorandum Decision and Order (002) etc may contain additional facts. But likely restate earlier facts.\n\nAlso the Docket could contain facts like dates of filings, etc.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct facts. Possibly many.\n\nGiven time constraints, we should focus on extracting a comprehensive set. But we must decide next action: we should read more of Memorandum Decision and Order (001). We have 0-2000 tokens read. We need to read the rest of that doc to capture other facts. The doc has 7637 tokens. We read 0-2000. We need to read 2000-4000, 4000-6000, 6000-8000, etc. But we need to limit to ≤10000 tokens per call. So we can read 2000-4000 next.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Memorandum Decision and Order (001) tokens 2000-4000. That will get more facts.\n\nAfter reading, we will append new facts to checklist.\n\nSo call read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\",\"start_token\":2000,\"end_token\":4000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Decision and Order (001)", "start_token": 2000, "end_token": 4000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13814, "completion_tokens": 1621, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The Factual_Basis_of_Case likely includes statements like \"The United States filed this case on August 2, 2022.\" or \"The Idaho law effective August 25, 2022\" etc. Also facts about the law, the EMTALA, etc.\n\nWe should read more of Memorandum Decision and Order (001) beyond token 4000. The current read covers 0-4000. We should read 4000-7000 to capture more facts. Also the other documents may contain more facts.\n\nAlso the Complaint already covers many facts. But maybe other documents include same facts but we shouldn't duplicate. We only need distinct values. The Complaint already has many, but maybe some facts like \"The United States filed this case on August 2, 2022.\" are not in the Complaint? Let's check the Complaint snippet: we saw \"The United States seeks to enjoin the statute’s taking effect on August 25, 2022.\" but not the filing date? The Complaint likely has the filing date. But we can search for \"filed\" or \"filing date\". But the key is Factual_Basis_of_Case: could include many facts. We should ensure we capture all distinct facts from all documents. The Complaint likely has most of them. The Memorandum Decision and Order (001) may restate facts. We need to avoid duplicates.\n\nThus, we should read more of Memorandum Decision and Order (001) to capture any factual basis not already captured. We'll need to track which facts we already extracted. Our current list includes 10 items: from Complaint. Let's list them:\n\n1. Hospitals that receive federal Medicare funds must provide EMTALA treatment to patients arriving with medical emergency.\n2. Under EMTALA, if a person with emergency medical condition seeks treatment at emergency department at hospital that accepts Medicare, hospital must provide treatment necessary to stabilize before transfer/discharge.\n3. EMTALA's definition of emergency medical condition includes serious jeopardy, serious impairment, serious dysfunction.\n4. Circumstances where abortion is required under EMTALA include ectopic pregnancy, severe preeclampsia, pregnancy complication threatening septic infection or hemorrhage.\n5. Idaho passed near-absolute ban effective Aug 25, 2022; Idaho Code § 18-622 makes it felony to perform abortion except narrow circumstances.\n6. After Idaho law effective, any state/local prosecutor can indict, arrest, prosecute physician for performing abortion.\n7. Idaho law places burden on physician to prove affirmative defense at trial.\n8. Idaho law will prevent doctors from performing abortions even when medically necessary to prevent severe risk to patient’s health or likely death.\n9. On July 29, 2022, US sent letter to Idaho expressing that §18-622 contrary to federal law.\n10. US seeks declaratory judgment that Idaho’s law invalid under Supremacy Clause and preempted by EMTALA; seeks preliminary and permanent injunction.\n\nNow, other documents may have similar facts: e.g., \"The United States filed this case on August 2, 2022.\" That fact not in list. Also \"The United States sought to enjoin the statute's taking effect on Aug 25, 2022.\" Already included? That is fact #10 includes that. But maybe other facts about the law effective date, the trigger mechanism, etc. The Memorandum Decision and Order (001) includes details about the trigger, the Dobbs decision, the effective date, etc. These may be distinct facts.\n\nWe should read more of that document.\n\nAlso the Docket may include facts like \"Filed: Aug 2, 2022\" etc.\n\nThe Stipulation of Dismissal likely not relevant.\n\nThus, next action: read_document for Memorandum Decision and Order (001) tokens 4000-7000. Let's do that.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\",\"start_token\":4000,\"end_token\":7000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Decision and Order (001)", "start_token": 4000, "end_token": 7000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 15486, "completion_tokens": 1019, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Are there more? The Factual_Basis_of_Case may also appear in other documents, such as Memorandum Decision and Order (001) etc. But the key definition: facts or evidence upon which case is built. So we need to extract all distinct values across all documents. We have already extracted 10 from Complaint. Need to search other documents for additional factual basis statements. Likely the Complaint includes all facts. However, other documents may restate facts, like Memorandum Decision and Order may include a \"Facts\" section. But those are restatements, may be considered part of factual basis.\n\nWe should search for \"Facts\" or \"facts\" in other documents, but we should also avoid duplicates. We must extract every distinct value. The extracted values from Complaint already include many factual statements. We should search other documents for any other unique factual statements not already in those 10.\n\nSearch for \"facts\" in all documents. But we already did search for \"facts\" in all docs earlier, found many matches. But those matches may be from other documents with factual statements. We can search again but maybe refine pattern to \"fact\" or \"facts\" preceded by numeric bullet? We could search for \"Facts\" section headings. For example, \"C. Facts\" in Memorandum Decision and Order (003). That likely contains facts. Let's read that portion.\n\nWe saw a snippet in Search results for Memorandum Decision and Order (003) match 2 which had \"C. Facts\". Let's read that part of that document: tokens 2299-2499 include some facts. We need to read that range: we already have read some, but not fully. We need to read tokens 2299-2499 of MDO (003). But we haven't read those tokens. The catalog shows we have read only 2123-2578 and 5603-5803 and 11765-11965. So we need to read tokens 2299-2499 (within 2123-2578 already partially visited). Wait 2299-2499 is within 2123-2578? Yes 2123-2578 covers 2123 to 2578. So we have that range. So we have the text we saw earlier. Let's capture the facts from that snippet. We saw:\n\n```\nC.  Facts \nIdaho has roughly 22,000 births per year. Not surprisingly then, some \npatients will experience serious, pregnancy-related complications that qualify as an \n“emergency medical condition” under EMTALA. See generally Fleisher Dec. \n¶ 12, Dkt. 17-3; Corrigan Dec.\n```\n\nAlso earlier snippet: \"One relatively straightforward example is a patient who presents at an emergency department with an ectopic pregnancy. Id. ¶ 13\". So there are facts beyond the Complaint.\n\nAlso maybe in Memorandum Decision and Order (002) there are facts. Search results show match 1 etc. Let's read those ranges: 404-604 and 638-838. Those are within 404-604 and 638-838. We have partly visited those. But we need to read them to capture facts. Let's read 404-604 of MDO (002). That snippet:\n\n```\ndeclarations (which, at that point, had not been fully submitted to the Court). The \nCourt has now reviewed all the declarations.  \nDISCUSSION \nA district court does not need to hold an evidentiary hearing before ruling on \na preliminary injunction. In fact, the Ninth Circuit has “rejected any presumption \nin favor of evidentiary hearings, especially if the facts are complicated.” Kenneally \nv. Lungren, 967 F.2d 329, 335 (9th Cir. 1992) (quoting United States v. \nOregon, 913 F.2d 576, 582 (9th Cir. 1990)). Even more, the Ninth Circuit \nexplicitly declined to follow a rule that would require a “presenting oral testimony \nwhen the pleadings and affidavits are conflicting.” Int’l Molders’ & Allied \nWorkers’ Local Union No. 164 v. Nelson, 799 F.\n```\n\nThis includes some facts about evidentiary hearing. Not exactly facts of case; it's discussion. But perhaps still part of factual basis? Maybe not. The factual basis includes facts plaintiffs assert. In the decision, the judge may summarize facts. So we should capture.\n\nAlso MDO (002) match 2 snippet: \n\n```\n22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 73   Filed 08/17/22   Page 3 of 4\nalso Stanley v. Univ. of S. Cal., 13 F.3d 1313, 1326 (9th Cir. 1994) (“[T]he refusal \nto hear oral testimony at a preliminary injunction hearing is a ...). \n```\n\nNot facts.\n\nThus only MDO (003) contains \"C. Facts\" section.\n\nAlso maybe the Complaint is the main factual basis. The other documents may restate facts. But we should extract all distinct values; duplicates should be avoided. The 10 values from Complaint are comprehensive. But we should check if there are additional unique factual statements not in those 10. For example, the MDO (003) says \"Idaho has roughly 22,000 births per year.\" This is not in the Complaint's facts. The Complaint had \"The State of Idaho passed a near‑absolute ban on abortion effective August 25, 2022; Idaho Code § 18‑622 makes it a felony...\" etc. But not the births per year. So we need to add this fact.\n\nAlso MDO (003) says \"some patients will experience serious, pregnancy-related complications that qualify as an “emergency medical condition” under EMTALA.\" This is also not in Complaint. So we need to add.\n\nAlso \"One relatively straightforward example is a patient who presents at an emergency department with an ectopic pregnancy.\" This also not in Complaint.\n\nThus we need to extract these new facts.\n\nAlso maybe MDO (004) has \"BACKGROUND\" but not explicit facts.\n\nThus we need to read MDO (003) tokens 2299-2499 again to capture the facts text. We have that snippet already partially. But we should read that range fully to capture all text. The tokens 2299-2499 we saw includes the snippet. Let's read that again but maybe more context. We'll request read_document for MDO (003) tokens 2299-2600 to capture all. But we must avoid reading overlapping with previously read. We have not read that region? We saw part of it but not the full snippet. So we will read 2299-2600.\n\nAlso check MDO (003) tokens 2123-2578 which we already read. The snippet we saw is part of that. So we may just need to read 2299-2600.\n\nLet's plan: read MDO (003) tokens 2299-2600.\n\nAfter reading, we will parse for facts and append to checklist.\n\nWe also might need to check other documents for any other factual basis not yet captured. For example, \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\" likely has a \"Background\" or \"Facts\" section. But we already captured the Complaint's facts. But maybe there are additional facts about the law effective date etc. But those are also in Complaint. But the decision may restate them; duplicates not needed.\n\nThus main additional facts: births per year, pregnancy complications, ectopic pregnancy example.\n\nLet's read MDO (003) tokens 2299-2600.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Memorandum Decision and Order (003)\",\"start_token\":2299,\"end_token\":2600}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Decision and Order (003)", "start_token": 2299, "end_token": 2600}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 16541, "completion_tokens": 1653, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The question: does the checklist require all distinct values of each checklist item that directly matches the definition. \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" refers to facts or evidence upon which the case is built. It's likely from Complaint. Already extracted 10 values. We need to ensure completeness: Are there additional facts in other documents? The Complaint probably contains the statement of facts; other documents like orders may discuss facts but not necessarily new facts. The extraction might already be complete.

But check if any other documents might add more facts. But the key is \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" - likely all facts are in the Complaint. The extraction already includes 10 values.

The task: extract \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" items. The prior steps have extracted 10 values from the Complaint. The system reported 10 values, but may not be complete. We need to ensure all distinct values for Factual_Basis_of_Case across all documents, not just complaint.\n\nThe checklist: only one item: Factual_Basis_of_Case. The system currently has 10 values, all from Complaint. There may be additional facts in other documents: Memorandum Decision and Order (001) may contain facts. The Complaint likely contains facts; but other documents (orders, opinions, etc.) may also contain facts (e.g., case background, statutory facts). The instructions say \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" For Factual_Basis_of_Case, we need to capture the facts or evidence that support the case. The Complaint probably has the statement of facts. The other documents may include facts, but are they part of the factual basis? The decision might restate facts. But if we find additional distinct facts not in the Complaint, we must extract them. Also the Complaint might have more facts beyond the 10 extracted; maybe the 10 were just from a portion. We need to confirm if more facts exist in Complaint beyond tokens 0-8000; the complaint is 8,039 tokens and we have visited 0-8000, so all complaint tokens read. So we have full complaint. The 10 values may or may not be all facts. We must double-check the complaint for any other factual statements.\n\nWe also have Memorandum Decision and Order (001) which is partially viewed 0-7000 tokens (92% coverage). There could be facts in that document as part of the factual basis (e.g., background, legal analysis). But the instruction: \"Factual_Basis_of_Case: Refers to the facts or evidence upon which the case is built.\" That includes facts in the complaint and could include facts restated in decisions. But typically, the factual basis is the facts asserted in the complaint. But the court's decision may also restate facts that are part of the factual basis. The instruction says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" So any distinct facts in any documents that are part of the factual basis should be extracted. So we need to search all documents for factual statements.\n\nBut we need to gather all distinct factual statements from all documents. That could be many. But maybe the complaint alone contains all facts; the other documents might repeat them. The system only extracted 10 values. Possibly there are more facts in the complaint not captured. We need to ensure completeness.\n\nLet's look at the complaint text: we don't have the full text, but we can search for \"facts\" or \"statement of facts\" etc. The prior search found 2 matches in Complaint. That's likely the section. We need to read that section fully. The complaint tokens 0-8000 were read; we saw 10 values extracted. But the excerpt provided in step 13 was not from complaint; it's from Memorandum Decision and Order. The complaint text was not shown.\n\nWe need to read the complaint's facts section. We can search for \"Statement of Facts\" pattern or \"Fact\" etc. Use search_document_regex on Complaint for \"Statement of Facts\" or \"Facts\" maybe. The system earlier did search_document_regex on Complaint (pattern: \"(?i)facts\") and found 2 matches. We should examine those matches. But we don't have the results output. We need to read the complaint's facts section via read_document. We have already read the entire complaint (0-8000 tokens). But we didn't get the text of the facts section. We need to locate the fact statements and extract.\n\nWe might need to read the complaint again focusing on the facts section. Let's search for \"Statement of Facts\" in Complaint.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex on Complaint for pattern \"(?i)Statement of facts\". Then read the returned matches. We'll then extract all distinct facts.\n\nBut we have to be mindful of token limits.

We already searched all documents for \"facts\" and found 21 matches, but only 3 in Complaint, 1 in Order (001), 2 in Order (002), plus 4 more docs. We haven't read those docs fully. So we need to read those remaining docs to capture more facts. The current status says keys: 1/1 filled, empty keys: 0/1. Actually empty keys: 0/1? That seems odd: only 1 key total. So we need to fill all facts across all docs. We should read other docs where facts appear. We have partial coverage: Order (001) 0-7000 (92% coverage) but we didn't read tokens 7000-7637 (7% coverage). Also Order (002) 404-604, 638-838 only partial. Order (003) only 2123-2600, 5603-5803, 11765-11965. Others partially visited. We need to read relevant parts containing \"facts\" in those docs. We could use search_document_regex on those specific docs for \"facts\" to get contexts, then read those matched ranges.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex on remaining docs for pattern \"(?i)facts\" but maybe limit to docs with unvisited ranges: Order (001) remaining tokens 7000-7637, Order (002) rest, Order (003) rest, Order (004), Order, SCOTUS Opinion, etc.\n\nBut we may find many matches. We can search all documents for \"facts\" again, but we will read only new ranges. We already did search on all docs and found matches but not listed the specifics. We need to read the matches.\n\nThus step: search_document_regex on all documents for \"(?i)facts\" with context tokens maybe 200, top_k 5? But we need all matches. We can set top_k 20. We'll get matches per doc. Then we need to read the matched ranges. That may be many.

So we need to read all orders.\n\nThus action: search_document_regex on documents: Order (001), Order (002), Order (003), Order (004), Order, SCOTUS Opinion for \"facts\".
