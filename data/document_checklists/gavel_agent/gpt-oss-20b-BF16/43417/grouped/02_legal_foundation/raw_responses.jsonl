We can search for \"claims\" or \"cause of action\" maybe in other documents. We should search in the Complaint for \"cause\" or \"claims\". Better to search for pattern \"cause\" but that's too broad. The complaint has \"The United States seeks a declaratory judgment that Idaho’s law is invalid ... and also seeks an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining Idaho’s restrictive abortion law\". That is the remedy. The cause of action: \"to preempt Idaho's law under EMTALA and Supremacy Clause\".

The United States also seeks an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining Idaho’s restrictive abortion law to the extent it conflicts with EMTALA.\" So remedy: declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. Also maybe monetary damages? Not mentioned.\n\nStatutory basis: EMTALA 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd, Supremacy Clause U.S. Const. art. VI, clause 2, and maybe 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1345 for jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) for venue. But the basis for case: EMTALA, Supremacy Clause. Also Idaho law: Idaho Code § 18-622. But the claim is that state law conflicts with federal law. So statutory basis: EMTALA 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f). Also maybe 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1345 (federal jurisdiction). But the main basis: EMTALA and Supremacy Clause.\n\nCause of Action: The cause of action is: preemption of Idaho's abortion law under EMTALA and Supremacy Clause; declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.\n\nWe need to capture all distinct values. For Cause_of_Action, perhaps we need separate entries: \"Preemption of Idaho's abortion law under EMTALA\" and \"Declaratory judgment of invalidity under Supremacy Clause\" and \"Injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of Idaho's law.\" Might combine but list each.\n\nStatutory basis: \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\" (EMTALA), \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f)\", \"U.S. Const. art.

But question defines statutory basis of the case: governing statutes or constitutional provisions underlying the claims. So include EMTALA and Supremacy Clause. Also maybe Idaho law is not basis but the claim is about conflict. So include those.\n\nRemedy sought: declaratory judgment, injunctive relief.\n\nWe need evidence.\n\nWe need to read more of the Complaint to get all content. The current read includes up to page 5.

We have read enough of Complaint to see the cause of action? The complaint says: \"The United States seeks a declaratory judgment that Idaho’s law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause and is preempted by federal law to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA. The United States also seeks an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining Idaho’s restrictive abortion law to the extent it conflicts with EMTALA.\" That's the remedy sought. The cause of action: preemption under Supremacy Clause and EMTALA; the legal claim: preemption of state law by federal law. Statutory basis: EMTALA (42 U.S.C. § 1395dd), Supremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2). So we need to extract these items. Need evidence.\n\nWe have Complaint text covering the relevant parts. We should do search for \"preemption\" to capture the relevant cause of action. But we already have search matches. We could also search for \"cause of action\" but none found. The cause of action may be described in the complaint's introductory sections or paragraphs 1-5. The text includes \"The United States seeks a declaratory judgment...\" but that is remedy, not cause. The cause might be \"preemption under the Supremacy Clause and EMTALA\". So we need to capture that.\n\nWe need to identify evidence for each key:\n\n- Cause_of_Action: \"preemption under the Supremacy Clause and EMTALA\" or \"preemption under the Supremacy Clause\" or \"preemption of Idaho law by federal law\" etc. The complaint text includes that. Also \"The United States seeks a declaratory judgment that Idaho Code § 18-622 violates the Supremacy Clause and is preempted under federal law to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA.\" So cause of action is that Idaho law is preempted. Also earlier mention: \"In this action, the United States seeks a declaratory judgment that Idaho’s law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause and is preempted by federal law to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA. The United States also seeks an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining Idaho’s restrictive abortion law to the extent it conflicts with EMTALA.\" That is remedy.\n\nAlso earlier \"preemption under the Supremacy Clause and EMTALA\" is likely the claim.\n\nWe should also check for statutory basis: EMTALA 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd; Supremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2). Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f)\" etc.\n\nThe remedy sought: declaratory judgment, injunctive relief (preliminary and permanent injunction), costs, etc. That is in the Prayer for Relief.\n\nSo we need to capture these items with evidence.\n\nWe should fetch the relevant sections with read_document tokens around where these appear. The complaint has several relevant paragraphs: e.g., tokens 7364-8000 include the Prayer for Relief (remedy). Also earlier tokens 0-2000 include the intro and cause? Actually tokens 0-2000 include the preamble and some claims. Token 2000-3024 includes the EMTALA discussion. But we need the cause of action: likely before the Prayer.\n\nWe might search for \"preemption\" again to get multiple matches. But we already saw match tokens 7164-7364 includes the \"preemption\" section. That includes the cause of action? That match snippet includes \"Claim for Relief Preemption Under the Supremacy Clause and EMTALA\". That may contain the cause of action text.\n\nLet's examine that match snippet: tokens 7164-7364 snippet: includes:\n\n```\n CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n Preemption Under the Supremacy Clause and EMTALA \n 55.  Plaintiff hereby incorporates paragraphs 1 through 54 as if fully set forth herein. \n 56.  The Supremacy Clause provides that “[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the United \n States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any \n Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”  U.S. Const. art. VI, \n cl. 2.   \n 57.  EMTALA expressly preempts State laws “to the extent that the requirement directly \n conflicts with a requirement of this section.” 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f).  Idaho Code § 18-622 violates \n the Supremacy Clause and is\n```\n\nThus the cause of action is the preemption under Supremacy Clause and EMTALA. That is captured.\n\nAlso earlier tokens 0-2000 include \"The United States seeks a declaratory and injunctive relief, and alleges as follows:\" and then the paragraphs 1-5. That includes the cause of action: The claim that Idaho law conflicts with EMTALA, preemption, etc. We might need to capture that as well. But we can capture the summary: cause_of_action: \"preemption under the Supremacy Clause and EMTALA\" is enough.\n\nStatutory or constitutional basis: \"Supremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2)\" and \"EMTALA (42 U.S.C. § 1395dd)\" and maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f)\".\n\nRemedy sought: \"declaratory judgment that Idaho Code § 18-622 violates the Supremacy Clause and is preempted\" ; \"preliminary and permanent injunction\" ; \"costs\" ; \"any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.\"\n\nWe should extract each separately: each distinct remedy. So we will need multiple entries under Remedy_Sought: declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunction, costs, other relief.\n\nWe need evidence: we have the prayer for relief text in tokens 7364-8000. That snippet includes the remedy. Will need to use read_document to get the prayer portion with evidence.\n\nBut we also need evidence for cause_of_action and statutory basis. Those are earlier parts, maybe tokens 0-2000 and 7164-7364. We already have read_document of those ranges. So we have evidence.\n\nWe need to append_checklist entries for each key.\n\nWe must not read documents unnecessary. We have coverage of Complaint. We have tokens that include all needed text. So we can append.\n\nWe should create three patch entries: one for Cause_of_Action, one for Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case, one for Remedy_Sought. Each with extracted entries.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each. Use the verbatim snippet from the text.\n\nBut we need to ensure that evidence is precise. Let's copy relevant text excerpts:\n\nCause_of_Action: from tokens 0-2000 paragraph: \"The United States seeks a declaratory and injunctive relief, and alleges as follows:\" Then the list of paragraphs 1-5. But the cause is the preemption claim. We can extract \"preemption under the Supremacy Clause and EMTALA\" from the text. The text includes: \"In this action, the United States seeks a declaratory judgment that Idaho’s law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause and is preempted by federal law to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA.\" That's explicit. So we can use that sentence as evidence.\n\nStatutory basis: \"Supremacy Clause provides that ... U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.\" And \"EMTALA expressly preempts State laws ... 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f).\" So we need to capture those.\n\nRemedy sought: from prayer: \"a declaratory judgment stating that Idaho Code § 18-622 violates the Supremacy Clause and is preempted and therefore invalid to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA; a declaratory judgment stating that Idaho may not initiate a prosecution ...; a preliminary and permanent injunction ...; any and all other relief necessary ...; the United States’ costs ...; any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.\" So we will extract each as separate entries.\n\nWe need to ensure we capture each distinct remedy. The prayer includes 6 items labeled a-f. So we need 6 entries under Remedy_Sought.\n\nWe must include evidence for each. For each, we can quote the relevant portion from the prayer.\n\nWe have the prayer snippet: tokens 7364-8000. We can include the snippet for each remedy. We might need to extract each remedy separately. We can use the same snippet for each, but we need to specify the text for each remedy.\n\nWe might also include the cause_of_action from snippet 0-2000: \"In this action, the United States seeks a declaratory judgment that Idaho’s law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause and is preempted by federal law to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA.\" That sentence is evidence.\n\nStatutory basis: snippet from tokens 7164-7364: \"The Supremacy Clause provides that “[t]his Constitution, ... U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.\" and \"EMTALA expressly preempts State laws “to the extent that the requirement directly conflicts with a requirement of this section.” 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f).\"\n\nThus we can create entries.\n\nCheck that we have not previously appended anything. Yes none.\n\nSo next action: append_checklist with patches for the three keys.\n\nWe must provide each entry with evidence: an array of evidence objects.\n\nWe need to include source_document \"Complaint\" and location: maybe page number or token range. We can use page numbers present in the text snippet: For cause_of_action snippet, page 2? The snippet shows \"Page 2 of 17\" before the paragraph. But we can use \"Page 2 of 17\" or the token range. We'll use \"Page 2 of 17\" for cause. For statutory basis we can use \"Page 13 of 17\" or \"Page 13\" for the snippet. For remedy we can use \"Page 16 of 17\" as prayer appears on page 16.\n\nWe must get exact snippet text. Let's capture exact text segments:\n\nFrom tokens 0-2000, we have snippet:\n\n```\nThe United States seeks a declaratory and injunctive relief, and alleges as follows:\n...\nIn this action, the United States seeks a declaratory judgment that Idaho’s law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause and is preempted by federal law to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA. The United States also seeks an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining Idaho’s restrictive abortion law to the extent it conflicts with EMTALA.\n```\n\nBut we need to extract the cause_of_action. The sentence \"In this action, the United States seeks a declaratory judgment that Idaho’s law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause and is preempted by federal law to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA.\" That is the cause. So we can use that.\n\nStatutory basis: snippet from tokens 7164-7364:\n\n```\nThe Supremacy Clause provides that “[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.   \nEMTALA expressly preempts State laws “to the extent that the requirement directly conflicts with a requirement of this section.” 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f).  \n```\n\nWe can extract two entries: \"Supremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2)\" and \"EMTALA (42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f))\". Also there might be \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd\" but that's the statute itself. The snippet includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f)\" which is the specific preemption clause. So we include that.\n\nRemedy: from prayer snippet tokens 7364-8000:\n\n```\nWHEREFORE, the United States respectfully requests the following relief:\na.  A declaratory judgment stating that Idaho Code § 18-622 violates the Supremacy Clause and is preempted and therefore invalid to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA; \nb.  A declaratory judgment stating that Idaho may not initiate a prosecution against, seek to impose any form of liability on, or attempt to revoke the professional license of any medical provider based on that provider’s performance of an abortion that is authorized under EMTALA; \nc.  A preliminary and permanent injunction against the State of Idaho—including all of its officers, employees, and agents—prohibiting enforcement of Idaho Code § 18-622(2)-(3) to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA; \nd.  Any and all other relief necessary to fully effectuate the injunction against Idaho Code § 18-622’s enforcement to the extent it conflicts with EMTALA; \ne.  The United States’ costs in this action; and \nf.  Any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.\n```\n\nThus we can extract 6 entries.\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each: same snippet but we can provide the specific line for each.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't exceed token limit. But it's fine.\n\nThus we will call append_checklist with patch array for 3 keys. Each key has multiple extracted entries.\n\nLet's build JSON.\n\nNeed to include for each entry:\n\n```\n{\n  \"key\": \"Cause_of_Action\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"...\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"...\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n          \"location\": \"Page 2 of 17\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet's write value exactly: \"preemption under the Supremacy Clause and EMTALA\". For statutory basis: two values: \"Supremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2)\" and \"EMTALA (42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f))\".\n\nFor remedy: values: \"declaratory judgment that Idaho Code § 18-622 violates the Supremacy Clause and is preempted\" ; \"declaratory judgment that Idaho may not initiate a prosecution ... based on abortion authorized under EMTALA\" ; \"preliminary and permanent injunction against the State of Idaho\" ; \"any and all other relief necessary to fully effectuate the injunction\" ; \"United States’ costs in this action\" ; \"any other relief that the Court deems just and proper\".\n\nWe need to include these as separate entries.\n\nEvidence: we can use same snippet for each, but we need to provide the exact text for each. We'll copy each bullet a-f.\n\nWe need to ensure evidence text exactly matches snippet. Let's copy.\n\nFor remedy a: text: \"A declaratory judgment stating that Idaho Code § 18-622 violates the Supremacy Clause and is preempted and therefore invalid to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA;\" (including the trailing semicolon). We'll include as evidence.\n\nFor remedy b: text: \"A declaratory judgment stating that Idaho may not initiate a prosecution against, seek to impose any form of liability on, or attempt to revoke the professional license of any medical provider based on that provider’s performance of an abortion that is authorized under EMTALA;\" etc.\n\nInclude each.\n\nLocation: \"Page 16 of 17\" for all.\n\nAlso for cause_of_action we need to provide the snippet.\n\nLet's extract cause_of_action sentence:\n\n\"In this action, the United States seeks a declaratory judgment that Idaho’s law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause and is preempted by federal law to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA.\"\n\nWe'll include that as evidence.\n\nLocation: \"Page 2 of 17\".\n\nFor statutory basis, we need two evidence snippets.\n\nSnippet 1: \"The Supremacy Clause provides that “[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” U.S. Const. art.

Are there other documents that might contain additional Cause_of_Action, Statutory basis, or Remedy? Could be in other documents like Docket, Orders, etc. But we need to extract all checklist items from the legal case documents. We have 10 documents. We have extracted from Complaint. Are there more values in other docs? For Cause_of_Action, could be \"preemption under the Supremacy Clause and EMTALA\" only. Might also have \"preemption under the Supremacy Clause\" separately? But we captured that. Statutory basis includes Supremacy Clause and EMTALA. Maybe also 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(f) is included. Could also have other statutes like 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd (general EMTALA). Might include that. The complaint references only 1395dd(f). But other documents may mention 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd. Remedy also includes costs, etc. Could be additional remedies in other documents like orders. But the checklist likely only requires info from complaint. However, to be thorough, we might search all documents for \"preemption\" or \"cause of action\" or \"remedy\" patterns. But we already found all in complaint. Let's scan other documents quickly? The docket might list filings but not necessarily cause. But we could search for \"Cause of Action\" in all docs. But likely not needed.\n\nGiven the instructions: we need to extract all 3 checklist items from the legal case documents as completely as possible. We have extracted from Complaint. Are there any additional values? Let's consider other documents: Docket may have docket entries like \"Complaint filed\" etc. But not necessarily cause of action. Orders may include remedies, but the remedies may be from orders (like injunctions). But the checklist item \"Remedy_Sought\" is what is sought by plaintiff, not granted. So should come from complaint. So our extraction is probably complete.\n\nThus we can stop. But to be safe, maybe we should verify that no other documents mention additional causes of action or statutory basis. The complaint might have more than one cause; we captured one. Could there be a second cause of action like \"constitutional rights\" etc. Let's scan complaint again for \"cause\" maybe earlier. But we saw \"preemption under the Supremacy Clause and EMTALA\". That might be the only cause.
