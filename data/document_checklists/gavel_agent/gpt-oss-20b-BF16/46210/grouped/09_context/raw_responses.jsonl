The Complaint likely contains the factual basis. We have read tokens 0-5000 of Complaint. We should scan for facts: the narrative in the Complaint. We need to extract distinct factual statements. The definition: details of relevant events, evidence, background. So many facts present. But we need to extract every distinct value. That's many. But maybe we can use regex search to find \"the United States seeks injunctive relief\" etc. However, the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" That might be huge. But maybe we only need to extract a few key facts? But the system expects we produce all. However, we can use search_document_regex to find patterns like \"The United States seeks injunctive relief\" etc. But still many facts.\n\nGiven time, maybe we can extract a subset? But the spec says all. But we can approximate: the Complaint contains many facts. We may not need to capture each sentence; maybe we can capture each paragraph as a fact. But that's many. The system likely expects that we cannot fully extract all due to huge content. But we can attempt to extract key facts: e.g., \"Denka began manufacturing neoprene at the Facility on approximately November 1, 2015.\" That is a fact. Also \"The Facility’s address is in LaPlace, Louisiana, but its chloroprene emissions also travel into other nearby communities in the Parish, such as Reserve and Edgard, Louisiana.\" etc.\n\nGiven the requirement, we should search for all factual statements. Perhaps we can use regex to find sentences ending with period? That's too many.\n\nMaybe the expectation is that we identify the factual basis as the entire narrative, but we can extract multiple facts as separate entries.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe we can just capture the main factual basis: the facts that the complaint alleges. So maybe we can extract a single entry summarizing the factual basis. But that would not meet \"extract EVERY distinct value\". But maybe the system is okay with summarizing? But the spec says \"Each extracted value should be self-contained and easy to read, so you can include important context\".\n\nThus we need to extract multiple facts. We can proceed to read the rest of the Complaint to capture all facts. But that's a long document. We can read next tokens 5000-10000. Then parse.\n\nLet's read next chunk.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint\",\"start_token\":5000,\"end_token\":10000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 5000, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8479, "completion_tokens": 541, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Already read Complaint fully. We need to identify factual basis items. Likely multiple facts: emissions, dates, locations, numbers, risk estimates, etc. We should search for pattern like \"facts\" maybe \"Factual basis\" but not. Use search_document_regex across all documents for key terms: \"chloroprene\", \"emissions\", \"exposure\", \"risk\", \"average\". But we need to extract distinct facts. Might need to read relevant sections from Complaint. We have entire Complaint already read. We can extract many facts. But we need to ensure not missing any. The complaint contains many facts. We should parse the complaint for factual basis: key facts include:\n\n- The facility location: Pontchartrain Works Site, LaPlace, Louisiana, 586 Highway 44, etc.\n- Dates: started manufacturing November 1, 2015; Denka began manufacturing; earlier 2014 purchase; 2016 monitoring; 2017 order; 2018 RTO; 2018-2023 monitoring; etc.\n- Emissions: approximate 18 tons per year; 1.46 µg/m3 etc.\n- Exposure: communities, populations; risk estimates 1-in-10,000 etc.\n\nWe need to create entries for each distinct fact. Likely many. The task might require exhaustive extraction. Could be huge. But perhaps we only need to extract the main factual basis items. The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" So we must capture all facts. That could be many. But maybe the expected answer: list of facts extracted from Complaint. We can use append_checklist with many entries.\n\nLet's identify key facts:\n\nFrom Complaint: \n\n- Fact: The case is a civil action alleging carcinogenic chloroprene emissions from Denka's neoprene manufacturing operations at Pontchartrain Works Site in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana (Facility).\n- Fact: Facility address: LaPlace, Louisiana; 586 Highway 44; 70068.\n- Fact: Emissions of chloroprene from the Facility present imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and welfare.\n- Fact: Denka's emissions cause unacceptably high lifetime excess cancer risk.\n- Fact: The EPA's Clean Air Act Section 303 requires action.\n- Fact: Denka's emissions exceed 0.2 µg/m3; average 1.46 µg/m3; worst 2.89 µg/m3; etc.\n- Fact: Emissions started 2015; Denka purchased in 2014; earlier operations from 1968.\n- Fact: EPA monitoring data: 2016-2023; 1.46 µg/m3; etc.\n- Fact: Diffusion tube monitors measure >0.2 µg/m3.\n- Fact: Population: 15k-17k within 2.5 miles; 20% under 18; 800-1000 under 5.\n- Fact: Risk estimates: 1-in-10,000 risk at 0.2 µg/m3; 1.2 µg/m3 for child; etc.\n- Fact: EPA IRIS assessment 2010 concluded chloroprene likely carcinogenic.\n- Fact: EPA regulation: 42 U.S.C. § 7603; etc.\n- Fact: EPA administrative order 2017 to reduce emissions.\n- Fact: RTO installed March 2018.\n- Fact: Emissions remain 18 tons per year despite RTO.\n- Fact: Monitoring data: 2018-2023; 1.43 µg/m3 for EPA; 1.46 µg/m3 for Denka; etc.\n- Fact: Population exposure to >0.2 µg/m3 for years.\n- Fact: \"Ground Lease effective date: ~Oct 30, 2015; 99-year term.\"\n- Fact: Denka's Neoprene manufacturing comprises three units: Chloroprene Unit, Neoprene Unit, HCl Recovery Unit.\n- Fact: Denka is a joint venture between Denka Company Limited and Mitsui & Co. Ltd.\n- Fact: Denka is incorporated in Delaware.\n\nWe also have facts about the legal basis: jurisdiction, venue, etc. But factual basis is about facts, not jurisdiction.\n\nThus we need to append these facts.\n\nWe need to provide evidence snippet for each fact: location, source_document, location. We'll need to reference pages and token ranges. For each fact, we need snippet text. We can use snippet from Complaint. For example: \"The Facility’s address is in LaPlace, Louisiana, but its chloroprene emissions also travel into other nearby communities in the Parish, such as Reserve and Edgard, Louisiana.\" That's a fact.\n\nThe documents are large, but we can provide evidence text. We need to provide evidence for each fact. This is a lot. But maybe a subset is sufficient.\n\nGiven the time, we can extract a few key facts but likely not all. But the requirement is all distinct values. That may be too many.\n\nGiven constraints, we can perhaps read Docket to find any facts not in Complaint. But maybe Complaint covers all. But we should search for any other factual items in other documents not in Complaint. The complaint likely contains all facts. But maybe other documents contain additional facts like dates of motions, etc. But those are legal actions not facts about case. But could be factual.\n\nThus we have to extract all facts from Complaint. That might be many, but we can attempt.\n\nWe need to produce append_checklist with key \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" and multiple extracted entries. Each entry with evidence array.\n\nWe need to provide snippet text. We can choose a short excerpt for each fact. Provide location: page number.\n\nLet's compile entries:\n\n1.

We need to see if there are any other checklist items besides Factual_Basis_of_Case? The snapshot says \"Checklist Items to Extract: - Factual_Basis_of_Case\". So only this key. It's fully extracted. No other keys. So we can stop. However we should consider if any other documents might contain additional facts? But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" Factual_Basis_of_Case defined as facts or evidence directly supporting case. The Complaint is the primary source. There may be additional factual basis in other documents (e.g., Docket, Answer). But the requirement is to get all distinct values that match definition. Might be more facts in other documents like Answer or Motion. But we already have many facts. But we might have missed some facts in other documents that are not in Complaint. To be thorough, we could search other documents for other facts. But the technology: we can search regex for key patterns like \"chloroprene\", \"emissions\", \"EPA\", \"Denka\", etc. But we have extracted many facts. But maybe there are facts in other documents like Docket that are not in Complaint. But the goal is to extract all distinct values for Factual_Basis_of_Case across all documents. We have extracted 25 from Complaint. There might be more from other documents. But we haven't yet searched others. But maybe we can search for \"chloroprene\" across all documents to see if other facts exist. But the instruction says to choose one action. We could stop if we think we have all. But risk missing. Better to search all documents for additional facts. But the rule: we must choose exactly one action per turn. So we could perform a search_document_regex across all documents for \"chloroprene\" with context. That would return matches, then we can append new facts if any not already captured. But we need to ensure we don't double count. We could also search for \"EPA\" or \"Regulatory\" etc. But maybe easier to search for \"chloroprene\" or \"emissions\" as they capture many facts.\n\nBut we have 14 documents, some large. We can do search_document_regex across all documents. Use pattern like \"chloroprene\" or \"emissions\" or \"EPA\". But better to search for \"chloroprene\" as it's specific. But we might get many matches, but we can filter manually. But we need to extract new facts not already in 25. But we might find duplicates. We should check.\n\nAlternatively, we could stop if we believe these 25 capture all factual basis. But is that exhaustive? The Complaint includes many facts; but other documents might contain additional facts like more details on emissions, or other facts about legal basis, etc. But the Factual_Basis_of_Case includes facts or evidence that support case. The Complaint is likely to include all. But maybe the Docket or other documents contain additional factual statements not in Complaint. But we need to extract all distinct values. So we should search.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on \"chloroprene\" across all documents. That will return matches. But we might get many. But we just need to capture distinct facts. Let's do that.\n\nWe should use pattern: \"chloroprene\" with flags IGNORECASE. Maybe we want to get up to 5 matches per doc. Use context_tokens 200.\n\nWe can search across all docs: doc_name=\"all\". top_k 5. That will return 5 matches per doc. We may have many.

We currently have 25 values from Complaint. We need to check other documents for additional factual basis items.\n\nWe should read Amended Counterclaim for facts. Also Docket might have docket entries referencing facts. But the Factual basis likely includes facts about the case, not docket entries. The Amended Counterclaim includes facts about the facility, emissions, etc. So need to read more of it.\n\nWe have partially visited Amended Counterclaim tokens 172-5525. We need to read more beyond 5525 up to 17470? We should read remaining unviewed parts. Let's read from token 5525-10k maybe. But first check that we haven't missed any facts earlier. The Complaint had many facts; we captured 25 items. However, Amended Counterclaim also has facts like facility location, history, emissions, etc. Those may overlap with Complaint but still provide distinct facts.\n\nThus we need to read additional sections of Amended Counterclaim to extract more factual basis. Also possibly Docket entries may provide facts like docket numbers, dates, etc. But those may not be considered factual basis; but maybe the docket contains background details like \"Case docket ID 2:23-cv-00735-CJB-MBN\".

The 25 values may be from Complaint only. But there may be facts in other documents not captured. The requirement: \"Extract the checklist item from the legal case documents as completely as possible.\" The item is Factual_Basis_of_Case. We need all distinct values that directly match definition. We might have missed facts in other documents like Docket, Amended Counterclaim, etc. But the extracted 25 are from Complaint. We need to check if other documents contain additional facts.\n\nThe instructions: \"You must extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" So we need to include facts from all documents, not just Complaint. So we need to search other documents for factual basis. Likely many facts in the Complaint, Counterclaim, etc. But the current extraction only from Complaint. We need to verify if other documents contain additional facts.\n\nWe should search for key phrases like \"The Facility was\" or \"chloroprene emissions\" etc. But maybe the Complaint contains all facts. But other documents may include additional facts like dates, events, evidence.\n\nTo be safe, we should search for \"chloroprene\" or \"Facility\" across documents. But we already did search and got many matches. But those matches are in multiple documents. We should read those to capture additional factual items.\n\nBut the current extraction has 25 items; we don't know if it's complete. The last step says \"stop\" but the system says we can stop if satisfied. But we suspect more facts exist. The instruction: \"Your Decision now: ... Call stop if satisfied with current extraction state.\" We are not satisfied because maybe we haven't extracted all facts. We should search documents for further facts. The next action likely search_document_regex to find more facts.\n\nHowever, the checklist may only require facts directly from the Complaint? But the definition indicates \"facts or evidence upon which the case is built, including details of events, evidence, background.\" Those are likely across all documents, but the Complaint may contain the core facts. But other documents may contain additional facts like \"In 2015, DPE acquired the facility\" etc. But that was in the Complaint too.\n\nLet's examine step 5 search results: many matches in Amended Counterclaim, etc. But those contain facts too. But we might have missed them.\n\nBetter to read the Amended Counterclaim sections where facts are described. The read_document steps already read 525-10000 tokens of Amended Counterclaim. That includes many factual statements. But we didn't extract them. We only appended 25 facts from Complaint. So we need to parse the Amended Counterclaim facts.\n\nThus we should read more from Amended Counterclaim, maybe the earlier part (172-525) was already read partially? We read 172-5525 earlier. That covered the earlier portion. But we didn't extract facts from it. We need to extract factual basis from that.\n\nThus next action: read_document from Amended Counterclaim maybe 0-172? but no, the earlier portion 0-172 maybe header. But the factual basis might be in the section \"FACTUAL BACKGROUND\" etc. We saw in read_document starting at 525-10000. That includes many facts: e.g., \"The Facility was in St. John the Baptist Parish in Louisiana.\" etc.\n\nWe should read more of the document to capture all facts. But we already read 525-10000. That's a big chunk. We need to parse all facts in that text.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps we should search for specific patterns like \"In [Year], ...\" \"The Facility was\" etc. But we can just read the document again to capture all facts. But we cannot reread fully visited tokens. But Amended Counterclaim has been partially visited: 172-10000. We have read up to 10000 (the entire part we read). That covers large portion. But maybe we didn't capture all facts because we only appended 25 from Complaint. We didn't append any from Amended Counterclaim. So we need to append those.\n\nThus we need to identify facts from Amended Counterclaim. The text includes many facts: e.g., \"EPA has historically recognized that IUR values should be used only as a starting point...\" That's a fact about EPA policy. Also \"In 2022, EPA abruptly began imposing 0.2 µg/m3\" etc. Those are facts. Also the history of facility ownership, emissions, etc. Many facts.\n\nWe need to parse all distinct factual statements.\n\nGiven the time, maybe we can produce a partial extraction: just append some facts. But the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value\" - we need completeness. But maybe we can stop because the user step 8 indicated stop. But the system says we might need to continue. However, the system gave us status that 0 empty keys. So maybe the extraction is considered complete. But the user may want all facts. But the instruction from the system: \"You are ChatGPT, a legal document extraction specialist, your task is to extract all checklist items.\" We need to follow the policy: we should not stop prematurely if we suspect missing facts.\n\nThus we need to further extract facts from other documents. So next action: search_document_regex for \"The Facility\" across all docs? But we already saw many matches. But we need to read them.\n\nBut maybe simpler: use search_document_regex to find pattern \"Facility\" in Amended Counterclaim to capture facts. But we need to read the matched contexts.\n\nLet's perform search_document_regex on Amended Counterclaim for \"Facility\". That will return matches. Then we can read those to extract facts.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that we might have already read most of the document, but reading again will produce overlapping tokens. But we can read the specific ranges around matches. That's allowed.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Amended Counterclaim for \"Facility\". Use context_tokens 200. That will give us matches. Then we can parse.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Amended Counterclaim\",\"pattern\":\"Facility\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Amended Counterclaim", "pattern": "Facility", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 18388, "completion_tokens": 1337, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The task is to extract all checklist items. The only checklist item is Factual_Basis_of_Case. They have 25 values already extracted.\n\nWe need to verify if all factual basis entries from all documents are captured. The Complaint has 25 values. But there may be more factual basis in other documents. We should scan other documents for factual basis. The user earlier step 10 search for \"Facility\" gave many matches in Amended Counterclaim. The Factual_Basis_of_Case may include facts from other pleadings like Amended Counterclaim, Answer, etc.\n\nWe need to ensure we have extracted all distinct factual basis items across all documents. We currently have only Complaint's 25. We must search other documents for factual basis items. The definition: \"facts or evidence upon which the case is built. These facts are essential in the legal process and are used to support legal claims or decisions. It typically includes: 1. Details of the relevant events—For example, what happened, when it happened, where it happened, and who was involved. 2. Evidence – Physical evidence, documentary records, witness testimonies, etc., that support these facts. 3. Background information—Context or explanatory facts that provide additional understanding.\"\n\nIn pleadings, factual basis likely appears as numbered items describing facts. We should search for patterns like \"1.\" or bullet lists. But we need to confirm.\n\nWe can search for \"1.\" in other documents. But we need to gather all items. Let's search for \"1.\" in the Amended Counterclaim. Use search_document_regex for pattern \"\\b1\\.\"? But we need to include context. The search function requires pattern and may include flags. Let's do search_document_regex on Amended Counterclaim for pattern \"1\\\\.\" with context 200 tokens. That will return matches of lines starting with \"1.\" which likely are factual items. Then we can read those token ranges to capture the factual basis items. But we need to ensure we capture the entire factual basis items; maybe they are in numbered paragraphs. Let's search for \"1.  \" in the Amended Counterclaim. We'll do pattern \"1\\\\.\\\\s+\".\n\nWe need to ensure we don't overextract. We'll get many matches maybe.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"Factual\" or \"FACTUAL\" headings. The Amended Counterclaim has \"FACTUAL BACKGROUND\". But within that there are numbered items starting at 15, 16, etc. These are factual items.\n\nWe must extract each fact as separate value. There may be many facts across documents. But we need to extract all distinct fact items across all documents. This will be large.\n\nBut maybe the user expects only one key, and we must gather all facts. The initial extraction of 25 values from Complaint may be incomplete. We need to extract additional facts from other documents.\n\nWe might need to read the Amended Counterclaim's factual background section. The snippet shows items 15-17 etc. We need to capture those. Also, Answer, etc.\n\nBut the user hasn't indicated further action. The system says \"Your Next Action: Choose ONE action.\" So we need to continue extraction.\n\nWe should search for \"Factual\" or \"FACTUAL\" in other documents. Let's search for pattern \"\\bFactual\\b\" or \"FACTUAL\". But maybe better to search for \"FACTUAL BACKGROUND\" heading.\n\nLet's use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"FACTUAL BACKGROUND\". That might return the heading and context.\n\nBut we want to capture all facts. We might need to parse the sub-items. The best approach: search for \"1\\\\.\" pattern across all documents to find numbered items. But that could be many matches including procedural steps.\n\nBut we can search for \"1.  \" with two spaces after period to capture specific. But many legal documents have \"1.\" as paragraph numbering.\n\nHowever, the factual items are often numbered within paragraphs. For example, \"15. The Facility is in St. John the Baptist Parish in Louisiana.\" That's a factual item. So we need to extract all such items.\n\nBut the Complaint already had 25 items; those might cover many facts. But other documents may have additional facts, such as the Amended Counterclaim's facts (#15-17). The Complaint may have similar facts but likely duplicates. But duplicates may be considered separate values? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" Distinct values: if same fact appears in multiple documents, maybe considered same value; but we might treat as separate if different source? The instruction says \"Every distinct value\" not duplicates. But duplicates across documents may not be distinct. We should avoid duplicate entries.\n\nWe need to identify facts from other documents that are not already captured in Complaint. But we don't have the list of Complaint facts; we only know there are 25 values extracted. We don't know which ones. So we might need to check if there is any new facts. But we can't compare. We may risk duplication.\n\nGiven that the user said \"All checklist items have been fully extracted\" earlier, maybe the assistant had concluded all facts were extracted from Complaint and no other docs contain additional facts. The assistant had a stop earlier. But now we are being asked again. The snapshot shows that only Complaint has 25 values, but maybe other documents have more.\n\nBut the snapshot indicates \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Empty Keys: 0/1\" meaning all keys filled.\n\nThus the next action might be to stop. However, the conversation is continuing: The assistant had earlier decided to stop but maybe we need to confirm. The snapshot shows current status: 25 values extracted from Complaint. No other values. The system instruction: Stop only when every key is either complete or Not Applicable. It seems we have only one key, and we have 25 values. Are we sure that's complete? We don't know if other documents have more facts. But maybe the 25 values were extracted from Complaint only, but other documents may contain additional facts. The snapshot shows that only Complaint has 25 values. The other documents are partially visited; maybe they also contain facts. But the user didn't mention to extract from them.\n\nThe assistant earlier step 10 search for \"Facility\" returned many matches in Amended Counterclaim. That suggests there are facts there.\n\nThus the assistant might need to continue extracting facts from Amended Counterclaim. So we need to search for \"1.\" pattern in Amended Counterclaim to capture factual items.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on Amended Counterclaim for pattern \"1\\\\.\\\\s+\" with context 200 tokens. That will return matches for items starting with \"1.\" maybe including \"1. DPE operates a manufacturing facility...\". That is a factual item.\n\nWe then need to read the token ranges to capture full text of that fact. But the search result already includes context snippet; we can use that as evidence.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex.\n\nBut we might also need to check other documents like Answer. But step 10 only searched Facility in Amended Counterclaim. That may capture many facts. So likely we should proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, next action: search_document_regex on Amended Counterclaim for pattern \"1\\\\.\\\\s+\".\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Amended Counterclaim\",\"pattern\":\"1\\\\.\\\\s+\",\"flags\":[\"MULTILINE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Amended Counterclaim", "pattern": "1\\.\\s+", "flags": ["MULTILINE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 18195, "completion_tokens": 1569, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to continue extracting facts from other documents.\n\nThus next action: search for key facts using regex patterns like \"Facility\", \"chloroprene\", \"neoprene\", \"DPE\", etc. But we already have many matches. We need to read unviewed portions of other documents to extract more facts. Let's examine document catalog: many partially visited docs. We need to read more. The easiest: search for \"Factual\" or \"FACTUAL\" heading. But we can read more of Amended Counterclaim beyond already read. We have up to 13188 tokens. But the doc is 17,470 tokens long. So need to read from 13188 to 17470. So we can read that range to capture further facts. Also other docs: Answer, etc. But maybe we can search for patterns like \"Factual\" or \"Facts\" or \"Background\". But maybe easier: search for \"facility\" in all documents to get more facts. But many matches. Maybe limit to Amended Counterclaim. Let's read the rest of Amended Counterclaim from 13188 to end. That will provide more facts.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Amended Counterclaim tokens 13188-17470.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Amended Counterclaim\",\"start_token\":13188,\"end_token\":17470}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Amended Counterclaim", "start_token": 13188, "end_token": 17470}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11643, "completion_tokens": 708, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
