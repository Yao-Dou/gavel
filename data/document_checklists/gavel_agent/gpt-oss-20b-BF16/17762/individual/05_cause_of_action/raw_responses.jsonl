Also likely the Agreement, the Docket, etc. We need to identify all distinct causes of action from any document. So far we have seen the Complaint has two. Also the Docket indicates \"Cause: 42 USC 1997 CRIPA\". Also the Order Approving and Entering Consent Decree references Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997, and Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134. Also the Agreement description includes CRIPA and ADA. Also \"Investigation\" mentions \"42 U.S.C. § 1997b\" but that's not a cause of action? It's a statutory provision. But cause of action is the legal vehicle used to bring claims: statutes that create a private or enforcement right. So we want the statutes: CRIPA (42 U.S.C. § 1997), ADA (Title II § 12131-12134). Also possibly 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is a cause of action, but search earlier found none. So we need to list distinct values: \"Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (42 U.S.C. § 1997)\" and \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134)\". Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1997b\" is a subsection but still part of CRIPA. But maybe the cause of action includes the statutory provision \"42 U.S.C. § 1997\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1997b\" both? But the cause of action is the statute that creates the right. CRIPA is 42 U.S.C. § 1997. The subprovisions 1997b, 1997a are amendments but still part of CRIPA. But we should capture the main statute. The cause of action might be \"Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act\" and \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\". So two distinct.\n\nWe need evidence from documents: Complaint text snippet with those. Also the Order Approving shows same. Also Docket shows cause: \"42 USC 1997 CRIPA\". We should gather at least one snippet for each. We should use append_checklist for Cause_of_Action with two entries.\n\nWe have already read Complaint. We have read part of Order Approving. But not yet read Docket or Agreement fully. But we can use search_document_regex to find \"42 U.S.C. § 1997\" or \"ADA\" etc. But we have seen search on \"42 U.S.C. § 1997\" not find? Because pattern with special character maybe not. But we can search for \"1997\" or \"ADA\". But we already saw matches in Agreement and Complaint. But we need evidence from documents beyond Complaint we already visited. But we can still append the values using evidence from Complaint only? The instruction: \"Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So we need evidence for each entry. We can use Complaint evidence for both. But maybe we should also include evidence from Order Approving for cross-check. But we can only read each doc once. We have partially visited Order Approving. We saw match 1 tokens 115-315 includes the statutory references. We can extract evidence from there. Let's read more of Order Approving to capture the references fully. We might need to read more tokens beyond 315 up to 849 to capture all. Let's read from 300-800. But we might already have snippet showing both statutes. But we can read 300-800 to capture. Let's use read_document for Order Approving, start 300 end 800.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order Approving and Entering Consent Decree\",\"start_token\":300,\"end_token\":800}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Approving and Entering Consent Decree", "start_token": 300, "end_token": 800}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10682, "completion_tokens": 888, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1997\" and \"42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134\". But the requirement: \"the legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens).\" So we should list cause of action: CRIPA (42 U.S.C. § 1997) and ADA (Title II, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134). We might also need to include CRIPA itself and ADA. Maybe also the 42 U.S.C. § 1997b? But that's a procedural requirement. The cause is the statutes giving right.\n\nThus we need to append two entries. We should gather evidence from Complaint and Order Approving and maybe Docket. Already we have read Complaint tokens 0-2542 which contains the opening: \"Complaint (Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Americans with Disabilities Act)\" and line: \"The United States files this Complaint pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA), to enjoin...\" That gives both.

The investigation documents mention CRIPA and ADA. Also the agreement might have cause of action? Actually the agreement is a settlement agreement; but might include cause of action? Usually settlement agreement doesn't contain cause of action. But we need to extract distinct causes of action. Likely: Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) 42 U.S.C. § 1997, and Americans with Disabilities Act Title II (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134). Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1997a\" but that's a related part of CRIPA. The complaint also says \"pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA)\". So we should capture those two causes of action.\n\nAdditionally, the docket lists \"Cause: 42 USC 1997 CRIPA\". That might be sufficient.\n\nWe need to use evidence. We have the Complaint text read already. We can use that. We need to identify the cause of action text. In the Complaint excerpt, the first paragraph says: \"COMPLAINT (Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Americans with Disabilities Act)\". Also the narrative: \"The United States files this Complaint pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA), to enjoin the Defendant\". So we can extract two causes: 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA) and 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA). Also maybe \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" is part of ADA. We just need distinct values.\n\nAlso the investigation documents mention CRIPA and ADA. But we can rely on complaint.\n\nWe should do append_checklist with two entries, each with evidence.\n\nWe need to recall the evidence format: For each extracted entry, evidence array with text, source_document, location. The location can be page or section. For Complaint, page 1. We can use location \"Page 1\".\n\nWe have to reference the exact text snippet. Let's capture snippet: from complaint: \"The United States files this Complaint pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA), to enjoin the Defendant\". That covers both.\n\nThus we create two entries: value \"42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA)\" and value \"42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA)\". Provide evidence each from same snippet.\n\nWe need to use append_checklist. Let's prepare JSON patch.\n\nAlso we might need to specify location string.

We saw in search results: \"Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Americans with Disabilities Act\". Also in Investigation doc: mentions \"42 U.S.C. § 1997b\" and ADA. Also Order Approving and Entering Consent Decree references CRIPA and ADA. The Complaint already includes CRIPA and ADA. There may also be \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" but search found none. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" not present. Could be \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" but no. Also maybe \"Section 1983\" not present. So likely the only causes are CRIPA and ADA. But check other docs: Docket shows \"Cause: 42 USC 1997 CRIPA\". Agreement may mention Title II ADA. Yes. So no new cause beyond CRIPA and ADA. But we should confirm no other cause, e.g., \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" not found. Could be \"Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act\" and \"Americans with Disabilities Act\". Also \"Title II of the ADA\". The ADA cause is Title II of ADA. So we have two distinct causes: CRIPA and Title II ADA. But we need to list the cause codes. The Complaint list includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA)\" and \"42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA)\". That covers both. But maybe there is also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" not present. So maybe we are done.\n\nHowever, caution: The Investigation doc includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1997b\". That's a different section: CRIPA §1997b. That might be considered a cause? The cause is still CRIPA but different subsection. The definition: \"the legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action.\" So \"42 U.S.C. § 1997b\" also is a cause. The Investigation doc includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1997b\" but also \"42 U.S.C. § 1997\" maybe. Let's check snippet: In Investigation doc snippet: \"42 U.S.C. § 1997b, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12132\". So that indicates cause of action: 42 U.S.C. § 1997b (CRIPA) and 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (ADA). But the Complaint used §12131-12134 (ADA). So we may need to include both the specific sections. Might need to list unique values: 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997b (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA). Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 12132 alone? But the ADA cause can be represented as Title II of ADA. We should capture the actual bracketed sections. The extraction requirement: \"Distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So each unique value string. In Complaint we have \"42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA)\" and \"42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA)\". In Investigation doc we have \"42 U.S.C. § 1997b\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 12132 (ADA)\". These are distinct. We should include these four? But the Investigation doc uses \"42 U.S.C. § 12132 (ADA)\" which is one section, but the Complaint covers a range. The distinct values are each. So we should add \"42 U.S.C. § 1997b (CRIPA)\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 12132 (ADA)\". But do we need to separate? It's still ADA but a different section. So yes distinct.\n\nAlso the Complaint also mentions Title II of the ADA of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA). So we have that.\n\nAlso maybe the order approving includes the same. So we have at least these four distinct values.\n\nWe need to append these new values with evidence from Investigation doc. So we need to read the Investigation document for the matches. We have partial view 678-997. So we can read more tokens to capture the full context. Let's read from 650-1100 maybe. But we must stay within 10k. So let's read tokens 600-1100 of Investigation doc.\n\nWe need to identify the exact text for each value. Let's read.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Investigation of the Hampton Roads Regional Jail (Portsmouth, Virginia)\",\"start_token\":600,\"end_token\":1100}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Investigation of the Hampton Roads Regional Jail (Portsmouth, Virginia)", "start_token": 600, "end_token": 1100}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8815, "completion_tokens": 1095, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But we need to ensure all distinct values from any document. There might be other causes of action in other documents like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" was searched and found 0 matches, but maybe in Agreement or other documents? Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" might appear in other docs. We need to search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" again? Already searched all documents and found 0 matches. But maybe pattern didn't catch due to formatting? Might be \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" with different spacing. Could search again with regex pattern that covers variations: e.g., \"42 U.S.C. §\\s*1983\". But the earlier search had 0 results. Might still be not present.\n\nAlso \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\" is not a cause of action. The ADA itself is the cause: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA)\". So we have that.\n\nBut there might be other causes such as \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" not found. Also perhaps \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" etc. But likely not.\n\nAlso might be \"Federal Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a) & (c)\" but that's statute for PLRA, but it's not a cause of action? That might be a cause of action for prison litigation? But the PLRA is a procedural statute restricting claims, not a cause of action. So not included.\n\nAlso \"Uniform Code of Military Justice\" not present.\n\nThe Agreement may contain causes of action references. Let's search within Agreement for \"42 U.S.C.\" patterns. Could search for \"42 U.S.C.\" across all documents. Let's use regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"42\\\\s+U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\.\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "42\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\.", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4705, "completion_tokens": 488, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to find all distinct causes of action across documents. The documents not fully visited: many. We need to search for other causes of action. The earlier search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" gave no matches. Other possible causes: \"Title II of the ADA\" maybe included, but that's same as ADA. \"Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act\" is same. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1997a\" and \"1997b\". But those are amendments to CRIPA. Are they distinct causes? The cause of action is the legal vehicle to bring claims: statutes that create a private or enforcement right. So CRIPA and ADA. Also \"Title II of the ADA\" is part of ADA. \"Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act\" is the same. \"42 U.S.C. § 12133\" appears in complaint regarding jurisdiction. But it's not a cause of action; it's a jurisdiction statute. So likely only the two. But maybe there are additional claims like \"Title II of the ADA\" already included. In the Complaint, they mention \"42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA), Title II of ADA\" and \"42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA)\". That's both names. So we already extracted those. Are there any other cause of action references? Look at the Agreement: it may mention \"42 U.S.C. § 1997\" etc. But it's same. Search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" none. \"Bivens\" none. \"Ex parte Young\" none. So only those two.\n\nBut we must ensure we have all distinct values. Check other docs: Agreement, Order, etc. They might also mention \"42 U.S.C. § 1997\" etc. But those are same. The requirement: deduplicate repeats; each cause of action appears only once. So we have two unique values.\n\nWe need to confirm that no other cause of action appears in other documents. Let's search across all documents for \"42 U.S.C.\" we already did and got many matches but they all refer to CRIPA and ADA. Maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1997\" appears. \"42 U.S.C. § 12133\" appears. But that is jurisdiction. \"42 U.S.C. § 1997a\" maybe. But 1997a also part of CRIPA. Should we list 1997a? The cause of action is \"CRIPA\" (the act). The mention of 1997a may be relevant but still part of CRIPA. The requirement: \"statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA)\". So \"42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA)\" covers it. The statute 1997a and 1997b are parts of it. So we don't need separate.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 12133\" is a jurisdiction statute; not cause.\n\nThus only two.\n\nWe already appended 2 values. Are there any other causes in other documents we might have missed? Let's search for \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\" which is same. But that's same cause.\n\nWe need to check if there is any other cause of action like \"United States v. something\" not. So likely done.\n\nThus we should stop. But make sure the checklist has only one key: Cause_of_Action. Values 2. All good. We must ensure no other key empty. The status shows empty keys 0/1? Wait: empty keys 0/1? Means one key empty? Actually they said keys with values: 1/1, empty keys 0/1? That seems contradictory. Probably means 1 key in total, 1 key has values. So all done.\n\nThus we can stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct cause of action values have been extracted and the checklist key is complete.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct cause of action values have been extracted and the checklist key is complete.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9181, "completion_tokens": 902, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
{"step": 14, "run_id": "857e7aae-717e-4b9b-b321-d471b76ae828", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T12:53:25.111334-05:00", "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have a situation: The user gave a long description of previous steps. The system says that after step 12, they stopped, but there might be gaps. We need to determine whether all distinct cause of action values have been extracted. The user earlier extracted two values: \"42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA)\" and \"42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA)\". But looking at the search results, there are other mentions of other statutes: e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1997a, § 1997b, § 12133, etc. Also 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1345, 1391. But those are jurisdiction, not cause of action. The cause of action is the vehicle used to bring claims, typically a statute. So we need to identify all distinct cause of action vehicles.\n\nFrom the documents: The Complaint used CRIPA (42 U.S.C. § 1997) and ADA (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134). The Agreement also references CRIPA and ADA. The Investigation document references CRIPA and ADA. The Consent Decree references CRIPA and ADA. Possibly also 42 U.S.C. § 1997a and 1997b are subparts of CRIPA, but are they distinct causes? The pattern: The complaint says \"42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA)\". That covers the whole statute, not just subdivisions. The \"42 U.S.C. § 1997a(a)\" appears in the complaint, but that is a sub-section of CRIPA. Are there other causes like \"42 U.S.C. § 12133\" (the ADA right to sue). The Complaint's jurisdiction section says \"42 U.S.C. § 12133\" but that's a jurisdictional basis, not cause. So we might not include that. The cause of action is the vehicle used to bring claims: e.g., CRIPA and ADA. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1997b\" is a sub-section but the cause is still CRIPA.\n\nAdditionally, the Complaint might have also used \"42 U.S.C. § 1997a(a)\" as a cause? But that is a sub-section of CRIPA. Usually the cause of action is considered the statute as a whole. But the user earlier extracted two values: \"42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA)\" and \"42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA)\". That seems correct.\n\nBut we should check if any other causes appear in other documents: The investigation includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1997b\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 12132\". But those are sub-sections. The agreements mention \"42 U.S.C. § 1997\" and \"42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134\". So only two causes of action. Are there any other cause of action like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\"? No matches earlier. So maybe only two distinct causes.\n\nBut the user had earlier appended two values. The checklist status shows 1/1 filled, 0 empty. So maybe the extraction is complete. But the system says we are at the first stop attempt. We could decide to stop if we believe all distinct causes have been captured. But we need to be sure. Let's verify if any other documents mention other causes. The \"Memorandum of Law\" might mention other causes. But we haven't read it. But we can search for \"42 U.S.C. § \" across all documents again, maybe there's other causes. They already did search for \"42\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\.\" and found 19 matches across documents. Those matches include the Complaint, Agreement, Investigation, etc. Many of those are mentions of CRIPA and ADA. But some matches mention \"42 U.S.C. § 1997a(a)\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 12133\". But those are not distinct vehicles; they are sub-sections or jurisdictional. The requirement: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens). Do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments or statutory rights), remedies (injunction, damages, declaratory relief), or procedural doctrines/rules (e.g., Rule 23, Ex parte Young, standing, immunity). Deduplicate repeats so that each cause of action appears only once.\" So we must list distinct legal vehicles. That would include CRIPA (42 U.S.C. § 1997) and ADA (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134). There's also \"42 U.S.C. § 1997b\" but that's part of CRIPA. So not separate. There's \"42 U.S.C. § 1997a\" but part of CRIPA. There's \"42 U.S.C. § 12133\" but that is a jurisdictional clause, not a cause of action. However, sometimes \"42 U.S.C. § 12133\" is a cause of action for ADA? It's the right to sue. But the cause of action is the ADA itself (Title II) not the specific sub-section. The user earlier used \"42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA)\" which covers the ADA. So that's correct.\n\nThus, we have two values. The earlier appended values are correct. We need to ensure no other distinct cause of action appears. Let's search for \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" maybe that is also a separate cause. The user earlier combined ADA with Title II; that is the same. So we might not need separate.\n\nThus, the checklist is complete. The user had a stop attempt. We need to decide whether to stop or continue. Since the extraction is complete, we should stop. The system says \"stop attempt 1/2\". We can call stop again. But we must provide the final JSON with decision: stop.\n\nThus answer: {\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All distinct cause of action values have been extracted and checklist is complete.\"}<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct cause of action values (42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA) and 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA)) have been extracted with evidence and the checklist is complete.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct cause of action values (42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA) and 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA)) have been extracted with evidence and the checklist is complete.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8798, "completion_tokens": 1399, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
