The extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\"\n\nWe already have a value from Complaint. But we need to check other documents: Agreement (Settlement Agreement) might contain \"Plaintiffs\" description. Also other documents may mention class action status.\n\nWe need to decide whether to stop or continue. The system indicates step 10 was a stop but then step 11 got checklist status: 1/1 filled, 0 empty. Which implies only one key exists and it's filled. So maybe only Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs is the key, and it's already filled. But we must double-check if other documents might add additional distinct values. The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if there are multiple values, we need all. If only one found, we are done. But we need to confirm that no other documents contain other values. The search for \"class action\" returned 0 matches for all documents. But maybe the phrase \"class action\" appears in other documents with different case like \"Class Action\" or \"class-action\". Search regex didn't find. But maybe the agreement says \"the plaintiffs are a class of prisoners\" but not using phrase \"class action\". Let's search for \"Plaintiffs:\" pattern again? They already searched but 0 matches. But maybe the agreement uses \"plaintiffs\" or \"class\" but not \"class action\". We might need to search for \"class\" or \"plaintiff\" patterns. But we only care about the status as class action or individual. The agreement might say \"the parties agree that the plaintiffs are a class of incarcerated persons\" etc.\n\nBut the prior steps: Step 4 read first 2000 tokens of Complaint, appended 1 value. Step 6 read first 2000 tokens of Agreement (not yet searched). Step 9 read remaining tokens of Complaint. So Agreement remains partially visited 0-2000 tokens. We didn't read rest of Agreement. So there could be additional classification.\n\nThus we should read the next portion of Agreement to check for class action status. Let's read tokens 2000-4000 of Agreement. That is 2000 tokens. Then we will search for relevant text.\n\nWe need to decide to read or search. Since we have not fully processed Agreement, we should read more to see if it contains class action status. Also we could use search regex on all documents to find \"class action\" but earlier search returned 0 matches. That suggests maybe no \"class action\" in any document. But maybe the Agreement uses \"class\" but not \"class action\". But the requirement: we need to extract whether plaintiffs proceed as class action or individual. If the Agreement says \"the plaintiffs are a class of prisoners\" but maybe not explicitly class action. But we might extract that they are a class of plaintiffs. But the classification is whether it's a class action. That may come from a \"class action status\" in the complaint: Usually the complaint states \"Plaintiffs are a class of prisoners\" or \"the plaintiffs constitute a class\". That is the status.\n\nThus likely the Complaint is the only source. But we should confirm the Agreement may not have a different view. But if the Agreement is a settlement agreement, it may refer to \"the plaintiffs, as a class\", but that wouldn't change class action status. So no new distinct value.\n\nThus we could stop. But we need to double-check that there is no other distinct value. If the earlier search of all documents \"class action\" returned 0 matches, but maybe the phrase \"class action\" appears but earlier search didn't find due to token limit? It searched all documents with default context 200 tokens. It should find anywhere. So likely no more.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we need to confirm that the extracted value from Complaint is correct. The prior step 5 append_checklist added 1 value.
