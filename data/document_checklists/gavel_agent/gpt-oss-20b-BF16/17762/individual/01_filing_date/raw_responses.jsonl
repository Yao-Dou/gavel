The complaint might include date filed. Let's search for \"Date Filed\" or \"Filed\" in Complaint. Also \"Filed\" could appear in other docs. We need to extract all distinct filing dates. Likely only one. But need to verify no other date appears. We should search all documents for \"Filed\" pattern.

But to be safe, we could search the remaining unvisited documents for any other \"Date Filed\" or \"Filed\" with date. But we saw search didn't find.

That's the same date. So only one filing date. Should we confirm if any other document indicates filing date? The docket shows date filed: 08/05/2020. The docket shows many entries but filing date only once. So we have complete. Need to check if there are multiple filing dates? Perhaps there were separate filings? But likely just one. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Only one. So we have complete. We should ensure not missing any \"Filed\" statements in other documents. Search for \"Filed\" pattern again? The earlier search included \"Filed\" but only matched that.

Also docket shows many entries with \"Entered: 08/05/2020\" etc. But filing date refers to initial filing of lawsuit. That is typically the date the complaint was filed.

The docket shows many entries all 08/05/2020 for various motions. The docket shows \"Entered: 08/11/2020\" etc but those are later.

The requirement: Every distinct value. Only one. So we can stop.\n\nBut check if the system's get_checklist shows Filing_Date filled with 1 value. It says 1 value. So we have extracted it. Are we sure it's complete? Should we check other documents for potential other filing dates? For example, the \"Memorandum of Law in Support of Joint Motion to Dismiss\" might have a date of filing of that motion, but that is not initial filing of lawsuit. The initial filing is the complaint. So only that date.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we should confirm that the \"date filed\" from Docket [PACER] is indeed the filing date.
