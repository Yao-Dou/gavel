Already have many matches via regex. We need to identify all distinct judge names. The pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" found many matches. We need to collect all distinct names. Which documents? Docket, Opinion, Opinion and Order (001), Opinion and Order (002), Order and Amended Opinion (001), (002), SCOTUS Opinion, etc. We have partial coverage; likely more names exist in unviewed parts. But we should search for pattern across all documents. We currently have partial coverage but we can use search_document_regex again with pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" on all documents. But we already did that and got 23 matches, but only 20 shown. We need to get all matches. We can call search_document_regex on all documents again to get the full list of matches. The last search result shows 23 matches total, with 20 shown, 3 remaining. But still only shows partial coverage. But maybe there are more names beyond those 23? There might be many more judge names. But the regex pattern might not capture all, e.g., \"Honorable Roslyn O. Silver\" includes middle initial. But the pattern only matches two words. So we might need to also capture other patterns like \"Judge Silver\" or \"Judge O’Scannlain\". But we need first and last name of judge, so we can capture last name only? Actually we need full name of presiding judge. Could be \"Roslyn O. Silver\" or \"Daniel P. Collins\". Might need to capture names with middle initial.\n\nBut the requirement: First_and_Last_name_of_Judge: The name of the presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided). So we can include middle initial or not. So we need to extract names of presiding judge(s). The presiding judge could be \"Judge Silver\" (but we want full name). The text includes \"Opinion by Judge Silver; Dissent by Judge Collins\". Also \"Opinion By Judge Silver\" etc. So we need to capture full names: Roslyn O. Silver, Ronald M. Gould, Daniel P. Collins, Judith? Actually \"Judge Silver\" refers to Roslyn O. Silver. But the text may use \"Judge Silver\" instead of full name. But we need first and last. So we need to locate full names. We may need to parse the docket. The docket might include the judge's full name.\n\nWe can search for patterns like \"Honorable [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\" or \"Honorable [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+, *\". But there might be a pattern \"Honorable Roslyn O. Silver\". So maybe we need to search for \"Honorable [A-Z][a-z]+\" and then after that capture last name.\n\nAlternatively, we could read the docket and find the presiding judge. The docket might have line like \"Presiding Judge: Roslyn O. Silver\".\n\nWe need to extract all distinct.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex with pattern \"Presiding Judge: ([^\\\\n]+)\" or \"Presiding Judge: ([A-Za-z .']+)\" but we need to capture the judge's name. Let's search for \"Presiding Judge\" across all documents. Also \"Judge Silver\" etc.\n\nBut maybe easier: We can search for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" and capture the name. But we want first and last. We can capture \"Judge Silver\" but that gives only last. But we might want the full name. But maybe the documents include the full names somewhere else. For example, the \"Opinion by Judge Silver\" might refer to \"Roslyn O. Silver\". But the text snippet includes: \"* The Honorable Roslyn O. Silver, United States District Judge for the District of Arizona, sitting by designation.\" So we can capture Roslyn O. Silver.\n\nThus we need to extract names: Roslyn O. Silver, Ronald M. Gould, Daniel P. Collins, ... Also maybe \"Judge Bennett\" etc. But the presiding judge might be only one: the judge who presided over the case. In these documents, the presiding judge is Roslyn O. Silver. But we should check other documents.\n\nThe \"Order and Amended Opinion (001)\" shows \"Opinion by Judge Silver; Dissent by Judge Collins\". So presiding judge is Judge Silver (Roslyn O. Silver). There's also \"Opinion by Judge Silver; Dissent by Judge M. Smith\" etc. So the presiding judge is the one who wrote the opinion: Judge Silver. So we should extract Roslyn O. Silver. Also maybe \"Judge Silver\" appears in other documents, but that's the same judge.\n\nAdditionally, \"Order and Amended Opinion (001)\" includes \"Opinion By Judge Silver; Dissent by Judge Collins\". So we might also capture \"Judge Silver\" but we will use the full name.\n\nThus we need to extract first and last name of presiding judge: Roslyn O. Silver. But to be thorough, we should search for \"Roslyn O. Silver\" across all documents. We can search for \"Roslyn O. Silver\" pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"Judge Silver\" but we need to confirm the full name. We can read relevant snippet.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the snippet that contains the full name. The snippet we saw in the search result: \"* The Honorable Roslyn O. Silver, United States District Judge for the District of Arizona, sitting by designation.\" That snippet appears in the \"Opinion\" at tokens 167-267. So we can read that portion to capture the name.\n\nThus we need to read a window around tokens 167-267 to capture the full name. The snippet we saw earlier includes the name. So we can read that range again to confirm. But we already have that snippet in the search result. But we need to have evidence. We can read the snippet again to capture the text and location. So we should call read_document on \"Opinion\" with start_token 150 maybe to include the snippet. But we can use the snippet from search result: tokens 167-267. That is within coverage. So we can read again to capture evidence.\n\nThus we should call read_document on \"Opinion\" tokens 150-300 to capture the snippet. That will give evidence. Then we can append the extracted value \"Roslyn O. Silver\" to the checklist.\n\nSo next action: read_document on \"Opinion\", start_token maybe 150, end_token 300. That covers the snippet. Then we can append.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Opinion\",\"start_token\":150,\"end_token\":300}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion", "start_token": 150, "end_token": 300}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5719, "completion_tokens": 1440, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Also in Order and Amended Opinion, \"Presiding Magistrate Judge\" but name? In that snippet, \"Presiding Magistrate Judge\" but not name. Let's search for \"Presiding\" with context. But earlier search failed due to context_tokens min 100. We can try search_document_regex with pattern \"Presiding.*?Judge\" but need to provide context_tokens >=100. Let's attempt search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Presiding.*?Judge\" maybe. But we need to set context_tokens to 200? default is 200. So that's fine. The earlier error happened because we passed context_tokens 50. We'll not. So let's call search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Presiding.*?Judge\". That should find the phrase \"Presiding Magistrate Judge\" but maybe also \"Presiding Judge\". We'll get matches with context. Then we can read the surrounding tokens to capture the judge name. In the snippet for Opinion, we saw \"Mark D. Clarke, Magistrate Judge, Presiding\". The order shows \"Presiding Magistrate Judge\" but no name?
