We have seen many matches in Docket. Also other documents. We need to read more to get full list. We should search more specifically for patterns: \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"Appeal\". But we have matches already. But we need to capture all appeals: each unique value: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" In matches, we see \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit from Judgment 114\" filed by City of Grants Pass. Also \"Case Appealed to 9TH Circuit Court of Appeals\". So we need to extract entries like:\n\nAppeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nAlso maybe other appeals in other documents (Opinion, etc). Let's search in Opinion for \"appeal\" pattern. Search all documents again? We already did search_document_regex on all documents. But we saw only matches in Docket? The search results list shows matches in Docket only, but there may be matches in Opinion but not shown due to display limit? The search result shows 109 total matches, first 20 shown. They all appear to be in Docket? The snippet shows docket entries. But maybe other documents contain \"appeal\" too. Let's search in Opinion specifically for \"appeal to\". We'll search regex \"appeal\" across all documents but we already did. The matches might not have been displayed for other docs? But the search output shows matches only for Docket? It lists \"Remaining matches: 20 in Opinion, 19 in Opinion and Order (002), 2 in Order Granting Fees and Costs to Plaintiffs', 20 in Order and Amended Opinion (001), 20 in Order and Amended Opinion (002)\". So there are matches in other docs. The search output only displayed first 20 matches but they all from Docket. We need to fetch all matches in other docs to get all appeals. We could search again for \"appeal\" with top_k large to get matches from other docs. Let's search again with doc_names list? But we can just read relevant parts of other docs. Maybe easier: read documents partially. For each doc, we need to identify all appeals.\n\nWhich documents likely contain appeals? Docket has many. Opinion may include \"Appeal\" in the opinion text? But maybe not. The \"Appeal\" might be just a docket entry for appeal. We need to find all distinct appeals across all documents. They may be in docket entries. But could also appear in other documents as \"appeal\" (like \"appeal\" in an opinion). But the checklist expects a value like 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So we need to list each unique appeal. The parties are the appealing party. The appellate court is the court. We need to capture all distinct values.\n\nLet's search in Docket for \"Appeal\" and capture. We have many docket entries with \"Notice of Appeal\" and \"Case Appealed to 9TH Circuit Court of Appeals\". The parties: City of Grants Pass (appealing party). Also the \"All Plaintiffs\" appears in some docket entries but those are not appeals? For example, \"Motion for Attorney Fees\" filed by All Plaintiffs. That's not an appeal. So only entries with \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"Case Appealed to\" likely indicate appeals.\n\nLet's read the Docket around token ranges 8708-9112 which we saw. We might need to read additional ranges for other docket entries. The Docket has 12,354 tokens, we have seen 11% coverage. We might want to read full docket to ensure all appeal entries. But we could search again for \"Notice of Appeal\" pattern to capture all. But we already have matches for many. Let's search for \"Appeal\" again but maybe with broader context and get matches from other docs.\n\nWe can do search_document_regex with doc_names indicating all except Docket? But easier: call search_document_regex again with pattern \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"Appeal\" and top_k maybe 50 per doc. That will return matches from all docs.\n\nBut we need to be efficient. We can search for \"Appeal to\" which appears in docket entries. Let's call search_document_regex with pattern \"Appeal to\" and doc_name=\"all\". That will return matches from all docs.

We have already seen search results. We need to read sections to capture each distinct appeal information: parties and appellate court. The search results show many matches. We need to capture each unique appeal. Likely there are appeals by City of Grants Pass to 9th Circuit. Also possibly other parties. We need to read the contexts to confirm parties and court.\n\nBut to minimize reading, we can use search_document_regex again for pattern \"Notice of Appeal to\" or \"Appeal to\" which we did. We have matches covering 20 tokens ranges etc. We may need to read those token ranges to get full text.\n\nAlready we have some coverage for Docket: we have token ranges 8708-9112 etc. But these were from search results; they likely contain the text. We can read those token ranges to capture the evidence.\n\nWe should read Docket token ranges 8708-9112 (already partially covered). But we need evidence for each appeal.\n\nWe should also read the other token ranges: 10171-10520, 10659-10866, 11043-11254, 11271-11478. Those already partially visited, but we might need to read them again? But they are partially visited; we should read any unviewed ranges. For each range, we must capture the text that contains the appeal info. Let's check coverage: for Docket, viewed tokens include 8708-9112, 10171-10520, 10659-10866, 11043-11254, 11271-11478. So all those ranges have been viewed. So we have evidence for appeals within those ranges. But we haven't appended any values yet. We need to read the content to extract the values.\n\nWe might need to read Opinion documents for appeals that may appear in those documents. But the search results only for Docket. But we might also need to check Opinion, etc. The search regex for \"Appeal to\" found only in Docket. But maybe other documents contain appeals but not with that phrase. We should search for \"Appeal:\" pattern? But the requirement says \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\". We need to capture any appeals. Could be in other documents like Opinion, but likely the docket has the notice of appeal. But there might be appeals in other documents like \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" in other documents. We can search for \"appeal to the\" or \"appeal to\" again across all documents. But we already did. 2 matches in Docket. But maybe we missed some because the pattern may be different. Could be \"appeal to the 9th Circuit\" or \"appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\" etc. We can search for \"9th Circuit\" maybe. But we should focus on unique appeals.\n\nLet's examine the content of the Docket matches to extract:\n\nMatch 1 tokens 8708-8908: snippet shows \"2020-08-26 | Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit from Judgment 114 Filing fee $505 collected; Agency Tracking ID AORDC-7159474: . Filed by City of Grants Pass. (Warren, Gerald) (Entered: 08/26/2020)\". So this is an appeal by City of Grants Pass to 9th Circuit. That's one.\n\nMatch 2 tokens 8783-8983: snippet includes \"Case Appealed to 9TH Circuit Court of Appeals Case Number 20-35752 assigned.\" This might refer to appeal of case 115. The parties? It's a \"Notice of Appeal 115\". It says \"Case Appealed to 9TH Circuit Court of Appeals\". The parties likely City of Grants Pass? Probably same. The snippet didn't include parties. But maybe earlier or later context includes parties. We might need to read more.\n\nMatch 8 tokens 10171-10371: snippet about \"Amended Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" etc. So same.\n\nThus appears multiple appeal entries, all by City of Grants Pass to 9th Circuit.\n\nWe need each unique appeal. Are there distinct case numbers? Yes: 114, 115, 133 perhaps. We need distinct values: \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit.\" But we need to include parties and court. The parties may be City of Grants Pass. We might need to specify \"City of Grants Pass\" as the appealing party.\n\nBut check snippet: \"Filed by City of Grants Pass. (Warren, Gerald)\" indicates the appellant. So we can extract parties: City of Grants Pass.\n\nThus we might have multiple appeals: Notice of Appeal 114, 115, 133 etc., all by City of Grants Pass to 9th Circuit. But the value may be same \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit.\" But we need distinct values; maybe each case number is a distinct appeal. The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So each distinct value: we might want to include case number? The format requirement: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' It does not mention case number. So if multiple appeals to same court by same party, the value is same. But they may be considered distinct? It says distinct values; if the value string is same, it's not distinct; but if we treat each case separately, we might capture duplicates. Probably we should capture each unique combination of parties and court. So only one unique value: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit.\n\nBut maybe other parties appear. Let's search for \"appeal\" in other documents. The search for \"appeal\" returned many matches in many documents. But we didn't look at those. But we might need to read some of those matches to see if other appeals are mentioned.\n\nGiven time, we can search for \"appeal\" in Opinion and Order documents. But we have many tokens. We can use search_document_regex with pattern \"appeal\" across all documents but we used earlier and got 109 matches. Many of those likely include other contexts. But we need to inspect those matches to see if any appeals from other parties.\n\nMaybe there are appeals by plaintiffs (All Plaintiffs). The snippet shows \"Motion for Attorney Fees . Filed by All Plaintiffs.\" That is not an appeal.\n\nBut maybe there is an appeal by the \"City of Grants Pass\" and also by \"All Plaintiffs\" or others.\n\nSearch for \"appeal to\" may catch only the ones with that phrase.\n\nLet's search for \"appeal\" pattern \"Appeal:\" maybe. But that may not match.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the Docket matches fully to capture evidence.\n\nWe need to read the Docket token ranges 8708-9112 (already viewed) but need to confirm content. We can read again with read_document to get full snippet for evidence.\n\nSimilarly for 10171-10520, 10659-10866, 11043-11254, 11271-11478.\n\nWe can read Docket fully for those ranges. They are likely under 10k tokens each. Let's read each token range to capture the text.\n\nWe can read 8708-9112. Then we will append the value.\n\nSimilarly for 10171-10520 etc.\n\nBut maybe we can combine them into one read? They are separate ranges.\n\nWe also need to check other documents for appeals. Let's search for \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" across all documents. Use search_document_regex.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Appeal to the 9th Circuit", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8491, "completion_tokens": 1639, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to extract Appeal items. We have found appeals in Docket. We have evidence for City of Grants Pass appealing to 9th Circuit. Also there was Amended Notice of Appeal to 9th Circuit by City of Grants Pass. Possibly also other appeals? Search results show 109 matches with \"appeal\" but we only got 109 matches earlier. We need to read more to capture all appeals. The docket has two appeals: Notice 115 and Amended Notice 133. Probably also there may be other appeals in other documents, maybe in Opinion or Order. But we can search for \"Notice of Appeal\" pattern across documents to capture all. We already used search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"Notice of Appeal\". It returned 0 matches in Opinion and Order (002). But we should check other documents that are unvisited, like Complaint, etc. But those are likely not appeals. The docket likely contains all appeals. But to be thorough, we can search \"Notice of Appeal\" across all documents again to confirm any missing. We can also search \"Appeal to the\" again? We already did that, found 2 matches in Docket. Perhaps other documents include \"Appeal to the\" in other contexts. We also might search for \"Appeal to the\" across all. But we saw 2 matches in Docket only. So likely only those appeals.\n\nBut the docket includes two entries: Notice of Appeal 115 and Amended Notice of Appeal 133. There might also be \"Notice of Appeal 115\" and \"Notice of Appeal 133\" referencing the same appeal. But both are same appeal party: City of Grants Pass. The second is amended. So we have two distinct values? They might be considered same appeal, but we need distinct values. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We should produce separate entries for each unique value. Distinct values: If both are \"City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit\", but one is amended. Do we treat them distinct? The value string includes the parties and court. It may be identical. But we could treat them as separate entries: \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit.\" But we might combine them? The instructions say create separate entries for each unique value. If identical, we don't create duplicate. So we have one unique value: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit. But maybe there are other appeals in other documents? Let's search again \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" across all documents. Already found 2 matches. Both in Docket. So likely only that appeal.\n\nThus we need to append that single extracted value with evidence. But we must ensure evidence includes each unique value. We have evidence in Docket from tokens 8700-9120, showing the notice. Also the amended notice at tokens 10245-10445.\n\nWe should read both portions to provide evidence. We already read 8700-9120. The second portion 10245-10445 not yet read. We should read that to capture evidence. We have partial view of that portion but not full. Let's read 10245-10445 from Docket. That will provide the amended notice. Then we can append the extracted value.\n\nBut we also need to check if there are other appeals in other documents. Search \"Notice of Appeal\" across all documents again? Already did, found 0 in Opinion and Order (002). But maybe other documents like \"Opinion\" have \"Notice of Appeal\"? The earlier search \"appeal\" found many matches in Opinion. But those might be references to appeals but not necessarily new appeals. We need to ensure we capture all appeals. The docket likely contains all docketing entries, which includes all appeal notices. So that should be comprehensive. But maybe there is an appeal in \"Opinion\" such as \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" not in docket? Usually the docket lists all appeals. So we can assume docket covers.\n\nThus next action: read Docket tokens 10245-10445. Then append the extracted value. But we need to confirm we haven't already appended. The key \"Appeal\" currently has 0/1 values. So we can append. But we need to identify the extracted value: \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit.\" We may need to include court name: \"9th Circuit Court of Appeals\". The pattern: \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" Let's check the text for exactly \"9th Circuit Court of Appeals\". In the excerpt from Docket, it says \"Case Appealed to 9TH Circuit Court of Appeals Case Number 20-35752 assigned.\" So the phrase is \"9TH Circuit Court of Appeals\". We'll use that.\n\nAlso we have \"Amended Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit\". That same phrase. So we can use \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9TH Circuit Court of Appeals.\" Provide evidence from both tokens.\n\nThus next action: read_document Docket tokens 10245-10445.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":10245,\"end_token\":10445}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 10245, "end_token": 10445}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5242, "completion_tokens": 1108, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Court: 9th Circuit.\n\nAlso \"Amended Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" again City of Grants Pass. Also maybe other appeals? Let's search for \"Notice of Appeal\" in other documents. We have many matches. We already looked at Docket. There might be appeals in Opinion and Order (002) etc. But likely the only appeal is City of Grants Pass vs. etc.\n\nCheck for \"Appeal\" in other docs: maybe \"Appeal\" appears in opinions about the appeal decision. But those are opinions on the appeal, not the initial appeal.\n\nSo we need to extract all distinct appeals. That includes all distinct values of \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nWe have at least two entries: same parties and court but maybe distinct docket numbers? Should we treat them as separate? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the same parties and same court but different appeal docket numbers, is that distinct? The value string is same, so not distinct. But they might want each appeal instance. But the format includes parties and court only.

So one value.\n\nBut let's also check for \"Appeal\" word in other contexts: maybe \"The Appeal is: AFFIRMED...\" but that's opinion on appeal, not initial appeal.

Are there other parties? Maybe other parties appear in other docs. Search pattern \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" already found two. Also maybe other appeals to other circuits? Search regex \"Appeal to the ([A-Z][a-z]+ Circuit)\" found none. But maybe other circuits like 5th, 7th etc. Need to search all docs for \"Appeal to the\". Already did earlier, only found in Docket. But maybe other documents have \"Notice of Appeal\" but not \"to the\". Let's search all docs for \"Notice of Appeal\". Already many matches. They may all be in Docket. But check other docs for \"Notice of Appeal\". The search results show only Docket matches. So likely only Docket contains Appeal notices. But check if there are appeals in other documents: maybe \"Order Granting Fees and Costs to Plaintiffs'\". But not likely.\n\nWe need to ensure we capture all distinct appeals. There are two: 115 and 133. Both by City of Grants Pass, to 9th Circuit. But maybe there are appellate filings by other parties? The docket shows \"Filed by City of Grants Pass.\" and \"Appellees Debra Blake, Gloria\" etc. So only City of Grants Pass is appealing. So two distinct appeals but same parties and same court. But distinct values? According to definition: distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. We might list each appeal separately: maybe with case number. But the format \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" So we can produce two entries: one for each Notice of Appeal (115, 133). But they are same parties and court, but distinct entries. Should we duplicate? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the same value appears multiple times, it's not distinct. But we have two distinct notices but same parties and court. Are they considered distinct? They are distinct citations with different case numbers, but value is same string. So maybe we should not duplicate. But \"distinct\" refers to distinct value strings. So only one unique value: \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit\". But we might also note that there are two appeals. But maybe the second one might be \"Amended Notice of Appeal\". But still same parties and court. So the value string is same. So only one unique value. So we are done? But we need to check if there are appeals in other documents with other parties. Let's search all docs for \"Appeal to the\" again but maybe a different circuit. Already found only Docket. But maybe \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" appears in other docs? Let's search for \"9th Circuit\" across all docs. But that may produce many. But we need appeals. Could be \"appeal to the 9th Circuit\" in other documents like \"Opinion\" or \"Order\". But we saw many matches, but maybe they are part of the same docket. Let's search for \"Appeal:\" pattern. But might not. Let's search for \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" in all docs; maybe only Docket. But earlier we searched \"Appeal to the\" and found only Docket. That indicates no other appeal notices in other documents.\n\nThus we have all appeals.\n\nBut we need to ensure we didn't miss any appeals in other documents like \"Opinion and Order (002)\" which might have appeals. But search for \"Notice of Appeal\" in that doc? The matches earlier were in Docket, not in that doc. But maybe \"Opinion and Order (002)\" has a \"Notice of Appeal\" in the content. But the search results for \"Notice of Appeal\" included only Docket. So not.\n\nThus we have only one unique appeal value.\n\nBut the instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we have one distinct value. Already appended. But we need to confirm that there are no other appeals. Let's search for \"appeal\" with lower case. But earlier \"search_document_regex\" on all docs (pattern: \"appeal\") found 109 matches. Many \"appeal\" words likely appear in other contexts. But not all are actual appeals. But we should confirm there aren't other appeal notices. But given we have multiple matches, maybe some in \"Opinion and Order (002)\" have \"Appeal\" text referring to the case. But the content of opinions may reference \"appeal\" in the context of the case. But not necessarily a new appeal filing.\n\nThus we may be done.\n\nBut we need to ensure the appended value is correct. We appended earlier. Should we verify that the docket contains two distinct notice of appeals but same value string. But the format \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" So we might produce the same string twice? The instruction says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\". So duplicate values not needed. So we keep one.\n\nBut maybe we need to include the case numbers: \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit (Case 20-35752)\"? The format didn't mention case number. But maybe we should include. But the example: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So we don't include case numbers.\n\nThus we have one unique value. It is already appended. So the checklist is complete. But we need to ensure no other keys remain. There is only one key: Appeal. It's extracted. So we should stop.\n\nBut we must verify the checklist summary: It says keys with values: 1/1. Keys empty: 0/1. Not applicable: 0/1. So we have all. So we can stop.

The step 10 got 19 matches. But we haven't gotten evidence for each. We need to extract all unique appeals.\n\nLet's search again with pattern \"Notice of Appeal\" across Docket, maybe more. But we also need to consider other documents like Opinion, etc. But likely appeals are only in docket. But maybe also in other documents. Let's search across all documents for pattern \"Notice of Appeal\". Use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\". That will give token ranges. Then we can read those ranges. We have coverage. But we should choose token ranges not yet read. The Docket has many ranges partially visited; but we haven't covered all 19 matches. We need to read them.\n\nWe could use search_document_regex again to get matches. Then we need to read token ranges for each match. But we can also use read_document with the token ranges provided by search. But we don't have the exact token numbers. We can request search_document_regex again. That will give top_k matches, but we need to set top_k large enough to get all matches. The default top_k is 5. We need to set top_k=20 to get all 19 matches. So we can request search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"Notice of Appeal\" with top_k 20. That will return matches with context. Then we can read token ranges for each match. We might only need to read the token ranges for each match to confirm the parties and court. But we can also read the token ranges directly. Let's do search_document_regex to get the matches.\n\nBut we might also need to search for \"appealed to\" etc. But we can get all appeals.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Docket pattern \"Notice of Appeal\" top_k 20. Let's do that.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"pattern\":\"Notice of Appeal\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "Notice of Appeal", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5532, "completion_tokens": 596, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But there might be others in other documents.\n\nWe need to read more of Docket to collect more appeals. The Docket has many matches for \"Notice of Appeal\" etc. We need to extract unique appeals: parties and court. The pattern is \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" etc. Also other circuits? Possibly other appeals.\n\nWe can search for \"Notice of Appeal\" again? Already many matches. But we need to read more windows to extract all unique appeals.\n\nWe should read the Docket segments that contain appeals but not yet read. The current coverage shows partially visited tokens: 8700-9120, 10171-10520, 10656-10866, 11040-11254, 11269-11612, 11858-12064.\n\nBut there are many matches beyond 12064? The docket is 12,354 tokens. We have coverage up to 12064. The remaining tokens 12065-12354? Wait docket length 12,354 tokens. We have coverage up to 12064? Actually 12064 is beyond total tokens. The docket length maybe 12,354, but tokens are 0-12353. The coverage shows 11858-12064 maybe mis-? Possibly part of docket after 12064 is not visited. But we may need to read further.\n\nBut we also need to examine other documents for appeals. The search results show many matches in other documents: Opinion, Opinion and Order, etc. But those might not contain \"Notice of Appeal\" but maybe other appeals like \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" etc. But we need to capture all distinct appeals. So we should search again for \"Notice of Appeal\" across all documents. But we already did earlier; but we may need to read additional windows for each match.\n\nThe search results for \"Notice of Appeal\" in Docket gave 19 matches. We read some windows: 8705-8905, 8786-8986, 8848-9048, 8909-9109, 10177-10377, 10243-10443, 10317-10517, 10656-10856, 10663-10863, 11040-11240, 11047-11247, 11269-11469, 11275-11475, 11341-11541, 11347-11547, 11405-11605, 11412-11612, 11858-12058, 11864-12064.\n\nWe have read most of them? Our coverage includes 8700-9120, 10171-10520, 10656-10866, 11040-11254, 11269-11612, 11858-12064. That covers many windows but not all. We might have missed some. But we can see many matches, but the values likely repeat: all are appeals to 9th Circuit, parties: City of Grants Pass etc. Might be duplicates. But we want distinct values. Unique values: maybe \"City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit\" and \"City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit\" duplicates. Might be same value repeated. So maybe only one unique appeal.\n\nBut there might be other appeals in other documents, like \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" maybe from other parties? Let's search for \"appeal to the\" maybe earlier. We did search earlier. But we might need to check other documents like \"Opinion\" or \"Opinion and Order (002)\" etc for appeals. Those documents might have \"Appeal to the\" but we saw some partial matches.\n\nLet's search for \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" again? Already did earlier; no matches beyond docket. But maybe there are appeals to other circuits. Search for \"Appeal to the\" pattern with capture group. Already did pattern \"Appeal to the ([A-Z][a-z]+ Circuit)\". No matches. So maybe only 9th Circuit.\n\nSearch for \"Appeal to the\" ignoring case? But earlier we did \"appeal to the\" pattern. That found only docket. So likely only docket has appeals.\n\nTherefore only one unique appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit. Also maybe \"City of Grants Pass\" appears multiple times, but same parties. But also \"All Plaintiffs\" filed appeals? The docket lines show \"Filed by All Plaintiffs\" for certain docket entries but not necessarily appeal. Those are motions, not appeals.\n\nThus likely only one unique appeal.\n\nBut the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" If only one unique appeal, we already filled 1 value. So we have 1/1 keys, 1 value.\n\nBut check if there might be other appeals like \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" in \"Opinion\" documents? Search pattern \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" in all docs.

But there might be other appeals: maybe other parties, other circuits, other appeals in other documents. We need to search for other matches.\n\nWe have many search results showing \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" etc. But we need to confirm distinct values across documents. We saw matches in Docket tokens 8708-8908 and 10245-10445. These may represent different appeals: one for Notice of Appeal 115 and another for Notice of Appeal 133. Both are City of Grants Pass as appellant. But they are distinct appeals: maybe same case but different docket numbers? But they are distinct entries: \"Notice of Appeal 115\" and \"Notice of Appeal 133\". Both are to 9th Circuit. So we need two values: \"City of Grants Pass\" appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (for Notice of Appeal 115) and same for Notice of Appeal 133. But are they considered distinct? The checklist may want each appeal instance. But the format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]'. So maybe combine parties and court. But if multiple appeals by same parties to same court, could be separate entries but same text. But distinct values: maybe each docket number is a distinct appeal. But the format does not include docket number. So the extracted value may be same. But need to extract distinct values across documents. If the same parties and court appears twice, that might be duplicate; we could consider only one. The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if identical string appears multiple times, it's not distinct; we need unique values. So if only City of Grants Pass to 9th Circuit appears, we already have that. But there might be other appeals by other parties to other courts. Check other documents.\n\nSearch for \"Notice of Appeal\" in other documents. The search results for Docket show many matches. But we should inspect other documents for appeals.\n\nWe saw \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" in Docket only. But maybe other documents have \"Appeal to the 5th Circuit\" or others. Let's search for \"appeal to\" in other documents. Use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"appeal to the\" maybe. But the search already did pattern \"Appeal to the\" and found matches only in Docket. But could be other circuits like \"Appeal to the 5th Circuit\" etc. Let's search for \"appeal to the [0-9]th Circuit\" regex with case-insensitive. Use search_document_regex on all documents. We'll search pattern: \"Appeal to the [0-9]+th Circuit\". Also maybe \"appeal to the\" to capture different.

Already extracted 1 value from Docket. But maybe more appeals exist. The search results show many matches, but maybe not all extracted. We might have missed other appeals. The dataset has other documents (Opinion, etc.). We need to extract all distinct values of Appeal. Already extracted one: \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit.\" But there may be other appeals by other parties or to other courts. We need to scan other documents for appeals. The search regex earlier didn't find new ones except in Docket matches. But maybe in other documents there are appeals to other circuits (e.g., 9th, 5th, etc.) or appellate decisions. We should search for patterns like \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"Appeal to\" across all docs. We already did regex search for \"appeal\" and \"Appeal to the\" and found matches only in Docket. But other documents may have appeals like \"appealed to the 9th Circuit\" or \"appeal to the 5th Circuit\" etc. Let's inspect other documents. The \"Opinion\" documents may have decisions regarding appeals. But those might be appellate opinions, not notices of appeal. The \"Order and Amended Opinion\" might contain \"Appeal\" but maybe not. The \"SCOTUS Opinion\" may not have a notice of appeal. The \"Class Action Complaint\" might not. The \"Judgment\" might be the lower court judgment; appeals may be in docket. So maybe only one appeal exists. But we need to be sure we haven't missed any. We should inspect other documents for \"Appeal\" occurrences. Let's do a regex search across all documents for \"Appeal\" again or \"Appeal to\". But we have already done step 2: search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \"appeal\") and found 109 matches: 20 in Docket, 20 in Opinion, 19 in Opinion and Order (002), plus others. But we didn't read all of those. Some matches may be in other documents. The earlier search for \"Appeal to\" found only 2 matches in Docket. So maybe other matches are in other documents but not \"Appeal to\". They could be \"appeal\" in other contexts, e.g., \"The appeal is denied\". But those might be appellate decisions. We might need to extract \"Appeal\" values for each, but the requirement is to provide \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\". That implies we need to capture the parties and court for each appeal. If the document contains appellate decisions, it might not specify parties. But for the docket, it lists \"Filed by City of Grants Pass\". That is good. For other instances, we might have \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\" but also the parties. The \"Notice of Appeal\" may appear in the docket. So maybe the only appeal is the one from the city. But there might be other appeals by other parties: e.g., \"appeal\" in the docket for \"All Plaintiffs\" or \"Debra Blake\" etc. Let's scan the Docket matches for other \"Notice of Appeal\" entries.\n\nFrom step 17, we saw many matches. Each match is a docket entry. We saw matches with \"Notice of Appeal\" for docket numbers. For each, we should see the parties: \"Filed by City of Grants Pass\" or \"Filed by All Plaintiffs\". Also we need the court: \"9th Circuit Court of Appeals\". So we need to extract each unique appeal. There might be multiple appeals: one for City of Grants Pass (the city). Another for All Plaintiffs. Another for Debra Blake etc. But we need to see if those are separate appeals or part of same appeal. Let's examine the docket entries. For example, in match 1, we saw docket number 115, Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit from Judgment 114, Filing fee, etc. Filed by City of Grants Pass. That is the appeal.\n\nIn match 1, also docket number 116: \"Transcript Designation and Order Form regarding Notice of Appeal 115. Filed by City of Grants Pass.\" Not a new appeal, just transcript for the same appeal.\n\nLater, docket number 118: \"Motion for Attorney Fees. Filed by All Plaintiffs.\" Not an appeal.\n\nBut maybe there are other \"Notice of Appeal\" entries. Let's scroll through the matches in step 17:\n\n- Match 1 includes Notice of Appeal 115. That's the appeal.\n\n- Match 2 is \"Notice confirming Docketing Record on Appeal re Notice of Appeal 115. Case Appealed to 9TH Circuit Court of Appeals Case Number 20-35752 assigned.\" This is still the same.\n\n- Match 3 includes \"Transcript Designation and Order Form regarding Notice of Appeal 115.\" Not new.\n\n- Match 4 is about \"Time Schedule Order from USCA for the 9th Circuit, USCA # 20-35752 re Notice of Appeal 115.\" Not new.\n\n- Match 5: \"Notice confirming Docketing Record on Appeal re (Amended) Notice of Appeal 133. Case Appealed to 9TH Circuit Court of Appeals Case Number 20-35881 assigned.\" That's a new appeal: Notice of Appeal 133. Filed by City of Grants Pass. So second appeal.\n\n- Match 6: \"Amended Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit. Filed by City of Grants Pass.\" Also part of same appeal 133.\n\n- Match 7: \"Time Schedule Order from USCA for the 9th Circuit, USCA # 20-35881 re Notice of Appeal 133.\" Not new.\n\n- Match 8: \"USCA Opinion for the 9th Circuit... re Notice of Appeal 133, Notice of Appeal 115.\" That's an opinion after the appeals. Not a new appeal.\n\n- Match 9: similar.\n\n- Match 10: \"USCA Opinion for the 9th Circuit, USCA #20-35752, 20-35881, re Notice of Appeal 133, Notice of Appeal 115. The APPEAL is: AFFIRMED...\" Not new.\n\n- Matches 11- etc. might be further docket entries.\n\nSo we have at least two distinct appeals: Notice of Appeal 115 and Notice of Appeal 133. Both are filed by City of Grants Pass, appealed to 9th Circuit. But we might also have any other appeals by other parties? Let's search within Docket for \"Filed by All Plaintiffs\" and \"Notice of Appeal\". In the matches, there is no \"Notice of Appeal\" with \"All Plaintiffs\". So likely only City of Grants Pass filed appeals.\n\nBut there could be other appeals in other documents. For example, maybe the \"Opinion\" documents are appellate opinions of these appeals. But the requirement is to extract all distinct values of Appeal from the documents. That would include the appellate opinions? But the pattern \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\" indicates we need to identify from the docket.\n\nSo we need to extract two entries:\n\n1. \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" (for Notice of Appeal 115)\n\n2. \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" (for Notice of Appeal 133)\n\nBut they are identical. But they are distinct appeals (different docket numbers). The extracted value may be identical but maybe we need to list both separately? The spec says \"EVERY distinct value\". If they are identical, maybe we include one unique value. But they are distinct appeals but same parties and court. The value string would be identical, but we might need to include both? The spec says \"EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct value meaning unique extracted string. So if the same string appears twice, we only need one. But we need to capture each unique value. So we can provide one entry: \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" But we might also include docket numbers? No, the format is specified: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So just that. So we can provide one.\n\nBut the earlier append_checklist already added one value. The current extraction progress shows 1 value extracted. Maybe that value was from Notice of Appeal 115. But we haven't extracted 133 yet. So we need to append the second value. But it's identical to the first, so maybe not needed. However, the spec says distinct value; if identical, maybe duplicate not needed. But we might still need to include both if they are distinct appeals? But the extracted value string would be the same; we might not need duplicates. But the spec might require capturing each distinct value, so duplicates not needed. So maybe the extraction is complete. But we should verify if any other appeals exist.\n\nLet's search for \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\" in other documents. The search earlier found only in Docket. So likely only two appeals. But we can confirm by scanning \"Opinion\" documents for \"Notice of Appeal\" but those might not be present.\n\nBut the \"Opinion\" docs might contain the final appellate decision; they may not include a \"Notice of Appeal\" but might mention \"appeal\" in the context of a court decision. But those are appellate opinions, not a notice of appeal. The requirement might include those as well, but the format expects parties. So we likely only need docket.\n\nThus we may be done. But to be safe, we can search for \"Notice of Appeal\" across all documents again to ensure we didn't miss any. Let's do search_document_regex for \"Notice of Appeal\" across all documents. That may return many matches, but we only need to see if any are not already captured. But we have already seen many matches in Docket. The others may be in other documents but might be within the \"Opinion\" docs. But those might be reused. Let's check.\n\nLet's run search_document_regex for \"Notice of Appeal\" across all documents. However, we might exceed token limit? But search_document_regex returns matches with context. We can do it.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Notice of Appeal\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Notice of Appeal", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10800, "completion_tokens": 2181, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have 1 value extracted earlier. Need to find all distinct appeals. Likely multiple appeals in docket. Need to search for all \"Notice of Appeal\" entries, each with parties and court. Already some matches.\n\nWe should search for pattern \"Notice of Appeal\" and extract each. We need to list distinct appeals: parties and appellate court. The docket shows multiple Notice of Appeal entries: 115, 133, 114? Let's examine matches.\n\nMatches 1-5 from step 17 show various notices. Each contains \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit\". Parties: \"Filed by City of Grants Pass\" etc. Also earlier match 1 tokens 8705-8905 shows Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit from Judgment 114. So parties: City of Grants Pass. Another Notice of Appeal 115. Another 133. Also maybe other appeals? Let's search other docs. But extraction may be limited to docket. Could be other documents like \"Opinion and Order (002)\" with notices? But maybe only docket has notices.\n\nGoal: extract all distinct Appeal values. So we need to gather each unique combination of parties and court. Possibly multiple appear with same parties but different case numbers. But we should treat each unique value. Let's list:\n\n1. \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" (for Notice of Appeal 115, 133, 114? Actually 115 and 133 are separate appeals but same parties. But distinct values? The value format is 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So same parties and court would be same value; but maybe each appeal is separate case. But the requirement: extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Distinct by text string. So duplicates are not repeated. So we might only list once: \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" However, we might also include \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" only once.\n\nBut there might be other parties like \"All Plaintiffs\" etc. In some entries, the appellant is \"All Plaintiffs\" e.g., motion for attorney fees? But that's not an appeal. The Notice of Appeal entries show \"Filed by City of Grants Pass\" (appellant). Also maybe \"Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\" appears multiple times.\n\nLet's check other documents: maybe \"Opinion and Order (001)\" contains \"Appeal\" statements. The content might include \"Appeal is: ...\" but that's the opinion, not the appeal. But the requirement is \"Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court.\" So we should focus on appeal filings. The docket entries are the primary.\n\nWe'll need to read the docket. We have certain ranges already read. But we need to read the other matches to confirm distinct values. We saw matches 1-5. All show same parties. Let's confirm if there are any other parties. Search again for \"Filed by\" within those matches. For match 1 tokens 8705-8905 shows \"Filed by City of Grants Pass.\" match 2 tokens 8786-8986 also \"Filed by City of Grants Pass.\" match 3 tokens 8848-9048 also \"Filed by City of Grants Pass.\" match 4 tokens 8909-9109 also \"Filed by City of Grants Pass.\" match 5 tokens 10177-10377 also \"Filed by City of Grants Pass.\" So all same.\n\nThus only one distinct appeal value. But maybe also \"Appeal: All Plaintiffs appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" Not found.\n\nTherefore we have 1 value already extracted. So checklist is complete. But we need to confirm that we have extracted all distinct values. Need to check other documents for any additional appeals. Let's search across all docs for \"Notice of Appeal\" again to ensure no other matches outside docket. The previous search step 20 found 5 matches all in docket. So only docket. So 1 value.\n\nThus we have complete. So we should stop. But we need to ensure the extracted value is correct. We need evidence: text snippet, source_document, location. We have earlier appended 1 value. But we haven't seen the evidence snippet. We need to confirm we have evidence for value. But earlier, step 11 appended 1 value. We need to see if that value had evidence. It likely had evidence from step 5 read_document. That read included tokens 8700-9120. That contained the Notice of Appeal 115 with text snippet. So value should be appended. If we trust that it's correct, we can stop. But we need to verify that the value is indeed extracted. We could use get_checklist to confirm. But we can just stop.\n\nHowever, to be safe, maybe we should read the docket tokens 10171-10520 to capture the second notice of appeal 133 as evidence. But we already have evidence for first notice. But maybe the value is the same. Duplicate values may be okay but not needed. But to be thorough, we could update the checklist with the second notice to confirm. But the requirement: extract every distinct value. So duplicates not needed. So we can stop.\n\nBut we should double-check that the extracted value is indeed 'Appeal: City of Grants Pass appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.' The format: parties: \"City of Grants Pass\" (or \"City of Grants Pass\" is the appellant). Court: \"9th Circuit Court of Appeals\". So we can produce that as extracted value.\n\nThus we should stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct Appeal values have been extracted and are present in the checklist.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct Appeal values have been extracted and are present in the checklist.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11507, "completion_tokens": 1230, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
