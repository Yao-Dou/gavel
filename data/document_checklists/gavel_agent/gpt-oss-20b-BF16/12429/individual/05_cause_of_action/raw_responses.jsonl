We already have some matches from search_document_regex; but need to confirm precise causes. The search found many matches. But we need to read full context for each cause. The search results show “Section 1983 claim” and “common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights”, etc. Also there may be other causes like violation of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act (AACWA). Also potential cause: \"substantive due process rights\" but that's not a cause of action? The cause of action is a legal vehicle: e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, AACWA, etc. The search results show \"Section 1983 claim\", \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights\", \"statutory violation of AACWA\" maybe.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values: each cause of action appears only once. So we need to list: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA)\", \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights arising from the AACWA\". Also maybe \"statutory violation of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" That is same as AACWA. So maybe just \"Section 1983\" and \"common law breach of third party beneficiary rights under AACWA\". Also maybe \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\" but that is an underlying right, not cause of action. So exclude.\n\nAlso \"Title II of the ADA\"? Not present. Also \"FTCA\"? Not present.\n\nThus we need to extract these two causes.\n\nWe also need to search for any other cause of action like \"Section 1983 claim arising from violations of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA)\". That is same as Section 1983, but the claim is a Section 1983 claim. That's the cause of action: \"Section 1983 claim\". The second cause: \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights arising from the AACWA\". That is a distinct cause of action.\n\nWe should confirm in documents. Search results for \"Section 1983 claim\" in Opinion and Order (012) and (016). Also maybe in Complaint. The search results show \"Section 1983 claim\" in Opinion and Order (012). Also in Complaint? The search results for \"cause of action\" didn't show a match for \"Section 1983\" in Complaint because complaint text didn't mention Section 1983; it mentions substantive due process rights. So we need to read Opinion and Order (012) and (016) to capture the cause of action text. We already saw matches in Opinion and Order (012) that include the claim type. We saw the matches in the search result. We need to read those sections to capture exact phrase. For example:\n\nMatch 1 (tokens 158-358) has text: \"Plaintiffs’ third cause of action is a Section 1983 claim arising from alleged violations of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”), 42 U.S.C. §621 et seq. Plaintiffs’ fifth cause of action is a common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights arising from the AACWA.\"\n\nWe need to capture that as two causes: \"Section 1983 claim arising from violations of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA), 42 U.S.C. §621 et seq.\" and \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights arising from the AACWA\".\n\nAlso in Opinion and Order (016), there were mention of Section 1983 claims: \"Three Section 1983 claims remain in this lawsuit: 1. Plaintiffs’ first cause of action for violation of plaintiff children’s substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from harm and risk of harm; ... 2. ...\" Wait that seems different. But there may be other causes: \"Section 1983 claims remain\" but those are the same? Actually those are different: might be \"Section 1983 claim for violation of substantive due process rights\". That seems like a cause of action: \"Section 1983 claim for violation of substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\". That is a cause of action. It's a Section 1983 claim, but the cause of action is \"Section 1983 claim for violation of substantive due process rights\". But is that distinct from the Section 1983 claim for violations of AACWA? Both are Section 1983 claims, but they are distinct causes (different underlying statutory violations). According to definition, cause of action is the legal vehicle used to bring the claim, e.g., Section 1983. But I think they want distinct vehicles: e.g., Section 1983, common law breach of third party beneficiary rights, etc. So we should list each unique vehicle: \"Section 1983\" and \"common law breach of third party beneficiary rights\". But maybe also \"Section 1983 claim for violation of substantive due process rights\" is still Section 1983, same vehicle. So we list only \"Section 1983\" once. But we need to include the statutory reference? The definition says \"legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens). Do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments or statutory rights), remedies, or procedural doctrines/rules.\" So we should list the statute or vehicle. So \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is the vehicle; \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights\" is a judge-made or common law cause of action. We should not list the specific underlying statutory violation (AACWA). So we list \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights under the AACWA\". So we should capture evidence for each.\n\nThus we need to read Opinion and Order (012) to capture \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and the common law claim. We also need to read Opinion and Order (016) to confirm Section 1983 claim for substantive due process rights. But that is still Section 1983. So we don't need separate record. But we should include evidence for Section 1983 claim from both documents? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in multiple documents, we only need it once. So we can just use evidence from the first doc we read that contains that. But we need to provide evidence. So we should read one doc that has Section 1983. We can use Opinion and Order (012) match 1. That includes \"Section 1983 claim\". We should read that portion to capture the exact text. We'll also read Opinion and Order (016) to capture \"Section 1983 claim\" maybe for due process rights. But we might not need to include separate entry. But providing evidence from one doc is enough. But we might want to show evidence from multiple docs to be safe. But we must not duplicate. So we will just use one doc.\n\nThus plan: read Opinion and Order (012) tokens around match 1 or read entire doc to capture the Section 1983 claim phrase. The search already gave tokens 158-358. We can read that range. That is within 10k tokens, so call read_document. We also need to read the part for common law claim. That is in the same match. So we can read 158-455 maybe to capture both. We'll read 150-500 tokens to capture both. That is within limit.\n\nThus action: read_document on Opinion and Order (012) doc_name, start_token maybe 150, end_token maybe 500. But we need to use token numbers from search. The search gave tokens 158-358 for match 1, 158-455 for extra. Let's read 150-500. Provide evidence.\n\nWe might also want to read Complaint? But not needed.\n\nThus choose read_document.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Opinion and Order (012)\",\"start_token\":150,\"end_token\":500}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion and Order (012)", "start_token": 150, "end_token": 500}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7928, "completion_tokens": 1797, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need distinct values: e.g., Section 1983, common law breach of third party beneficiary rights, maybe other causes like statutory violations of Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, etc.\n\nWe need to read more documents to capture all causes. Likely the Complaint lists multiple causes. We should search for patterns like \"cause of action\" or \"claims\" or \"Section 1983\" etc. We already did search for \"cause of action\" but might not capture all. We may need to read entire Complaint.\n\nLet's read Complaint fully? 37k tokens, but we can read relevant sections. We can search for \"cause of action\" within Complaint. The earlier search matched 5 matches in Complaint but those were not the actual cause list; they were other text. Maybe there are other sections listing claims.\n\nBetter to search for \"Section 1983\" within Complaint. Use search_document_regex on Complaint.

We have already read from Opinion and Order (012) and found Section 1983 claim and common law breach of third party beneficiary rights. Also Complaint shows statutory references like Adoption Assistance Act etc. But we need to extract every distinct cause of action used: e.g., Section 1983 claim, common law claim for breach of third-party beneficiary rights, perhaps statutory claims under 42 U.S.C. § 621, etc. We need to identify from documents.\n\nWe have not yet read Complaint fully. We saw earlier search for \"cause of action\" and \"Section 1983\" didn't find. But we found in Opinion/Order (012) the specific causes: third cause is Section 1983 claim, fifth cause is common law claim for breach of third-party beneficiary rights. Also earlier \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief...\" likely lists causes: substantive due process claim, Section 1983 claim, claim under Adoption Assistance Act, breach of contract claim, etc. We need to search for \"cause\" or \"claim\" but better to search for \"§\" or \"42 U.S.C.\" maybe get lines.\n\nWe have not read Complaint fully. We can search for \"42 U.S.C.\" in Complaint. The search step 4 did 0 matches for \"Section 1983\" in Complaint. But maybe we need to search for \"Section 1983\" in all documents. We can use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern=\"Section 1983\". That will return matches across all docs. That could give us more causes.\n\nAlternatively, we can read more of Complaint near earlier tokens for \"cause of action\". Already we saw matches at many token ranges. Those were in Complaint for Injunctive... The matches show text about substantive due process rights, but not explicitly the cause of action. However the complaint likely lists causes: \"First cause of action: violation of substantive due process rights...\", \"Second cause: violation of 42 U.S.C. § 621\", etc. The search earlier on \"cause of action\" returned 18 matches, but we only looked at some. We need to parse those matches for causes.\n\nBut maybe easier: search for \"claim\" or \"cause\" but we might get many.\n\nBetter: search for \"Section 1983 claim\" across all docs. Also search for \"common law claim\" etc.\n\nWe also saw from Opinion and Order (016) that there are four causes: first cause: violation of Fourteenth Amendment, second: violation of First, Ninth and Fourth Amendments, third: maybe something else? Actually we saw third cause not displayed. But we saw \"fourth cause\" violation of procedural due process rights under Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nAlso earlier in Opinion and Order (016) we saw mention of \"Section 1983 claims remain in this lawsuit: 1. Plaintiffs’ first cause of action for violation of plaintiff children’s substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from harm and risk of harm; 2. Plaintiff’s second cause of action for violation of plaintiff children’s liberty and privacy rights guaranteed by the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments; 3. Plaintiffs’ fourth cause of action...\" So we see cause list.\n\nThus we need to extract all distinct causes: Section 1983 claim (under AACWA), common law breach of third-party beneficiary rights, violation of substantive due process rights under Fourteenth Amendment, violation of liberty and privacy rights under First, Ninth, Fourteenth Amendments, violation of procedural due process rights under Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, etc. Also maybe violation of state law entitlements (but that might be included within procedural due process). Also maybe cause for breach of statutory duties under Adoption Assistance Act etc.\n\nWe need to read relevant parts to capture evidence.\n\nWe have already read some parts of Opinion and Order (012) and (016). We can read more of (016) to capture the cause list. Also we need to capture the statutory claim: Section 1983 claim arising from violation of AACWA (42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.). That is a cause. Also common law claim for breach of third-party beneficiary rights arising from AACWA. Also maybe other claims like \"statutory right\" etc.\n\nWe need to collect distinct causes. We should read the part of Complaint where causes enumerated. The search earlier \"cause of action\" matched tokens 33318-33518 etc. Those were parts of complaint but we didn't see the cause list. We might further read those ranges.\n\nBetter approach: search for pattern \"cause of action\" again but maybe we need to capture more context. The earlier search returned 18 matches across 34 docs. We saw five matches in Complaint. We can read those ranges fully to capture cause list.\n\nBut reading these ranges might be large. However we can read each range. We saw those ranges: 33318-33518, 34073-34273, 34370-34570, 34975-35175, 36060-36260. These are 2000 tokens each. We can read each. That covers 5*2000=10k tokens. We can read them. That will provide evidence for causes in complaint.\n\nSimilarly, we can read more of Opinion and Order (016) for cause list: we saw 231-636, 13667-13867, 15213-15413. We should read 231-636 is 400 tokens. That's fine. But we need the cause list: the first part of 231-636 shows 1-4 causes? Actually the snippet shows first cause: violation of substantive due process rights (Section 1983 claim). It also shows 2. Plaintiff’s second cause etc. It also might show 3. (not captured). But we may need to read further.\n\nWe should read from 2000-5000 maybe to capture additional causes.\n\nAlso maybe other documents like Opinion and Order (001) etc. But likely the causes are enumerated in Complaint and in some orders.\n\nThus our next action: read more of Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief and Request for Class Action for those ranges.\n\nWe have not read those ranges yet. So we should call read_document for Complaint for Injunctive... specifying start and end tokens for each range. We should read each range separately, or we can batch with multiple ranges? The tool only supports one range per call. So we need multiple calls. But we can read 33318-33518 now, then 34073-34273, etc. We need to choose one next. We have not read any of these ranges yet.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief and Request for Class Action, tokens 33318-33518. That will give evidence.\n\nBut before that, we should consider we have already read 150-500 and 821-1021 of Opinion and Order (012). We might also read more of that to capture causes. But the next step could be to read more of the Complaint.\n\nThus I will call read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief and Request for Class Action\",\"start_token\":33318,\"end_token\":33518}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief and Request for Class Action", "start_token": 33318, "end_token": 33518}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8382, "completion_tokens": 1527, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Also possibly other causes: maybe \"Violation of substantive due process rights under 14th Amendment\" but that's not a cause of action vehicle? The instructions: \"legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens). Do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments or statutory rights), remedies, or procedural doctrines.\" So we should capture statutory or judicially created cause of action vehicles: Section 1983, common law claim? Common law claim for breach of third party beneficiary rights is a cause of action but maybe not a vehicle? The vehicle is \"common law claim\" I think. Also maybe \"Section 1983 claim\" is a vehicle. So we need to extract distinct cause of action items: \"Section 1983 claim\" and \"common law claim for breach of third party beneficiary rights\". Also maybe \"Section 1983 claim arising from AACWA\" is same as Section 1983. So distinct: \"Section 1983 claim\" and \"common law claim for breach of third party beneficiary rights\". Also maybe \"Section 1983 claim arising from alleged violations of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA)\" is more specific but still the vehicle is Section 1983. But maybe we should include the full phrase capturing that it's Section 1983 claim arising from AACWA. But the instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we might need to capture each distinct value; if documents mention \"Section 1983 claim\" and \"Section 1983 claim arising from AACWA\", those are distinct? They include different text. But they refer to same vehicle. But maybe they want each distinct value string. I think we should record each distinct substring as it appears, but avoid duplicates. But we should gather all distinct vehicle mentions: \"Section 1983 claim\" and \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights arising from the AACWA.\" Also maybe \"Section 1983 claim arising from alleged violations of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA), 42 U.S.C. §621 et seq.\" That's a distinct phrase. So we should include that as separate value.\n\nAlso earlier complaint might list causes: but our search didn't find Section 1983 in complaint. So maybe only in Opinion and Order (012) and (016) etc. We need to read more of those documents to capture all. We have already read part of Opinion and Order (012) tokens 150-500, which includes the third and fifth cause lines. Also read tokens 821-1021. Let's see content of that part? It was not fully displayed. We might need to read that portion to capture the full fifth cause phrase.\n\nAlso in Opinion and Order (016) maybe there are other causes. We should search for \"cause of action\" phrase again maybe in other documents. We already used search_document_regex on all documents for \"cause of action\" and got 18 matches, many in complaint, but maybe those are description of rights. Might not include cause of action vehicles. We might need to search for \"Section 1983\" across all documents. We did search on complaint and found none. We should search all documents for \"Section 1983\" to capture all instances. That will give us all vehicles. Also search for \"common law claim\" maybe.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Section 1983\" or \"Section 1983 claim\". Use pattern: \"(Section 1983|common law claim)\". But maybe better to search for \"Section 1983\" first.\n\nWe also might need to capture \"Section 1983 claim arising from\" phrase.

Let's read more.\n\nWe need to capture all distinct causes of action: e.g., Section 1983 claim arising from AACWA; common law claim for breach of third-party beneficiary rights arising from AACWA; Section 1983 claim for substantive due process rights (Fourteenth Amendment); Section 1983 claim for violation of First, Ninth, Fourteenth Amendments? Wait that's constitutional rights but not Section 1983? The text says \"Plaintiffs’ second cause of action for violation of plaintiff children’s liberty and privacy rights guaranteed by the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments\" - that is likely a Section 1983 claim too (constitutional rights). So we need to extract each cause as a cause of action: e.g., \"Section 1983 claim under the Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.)\" and \"Common law claim for breach of alleged third-party beneficiary rights arising from the AACWA.\" Also \"Section 1983 claim for violation of substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Also \"Section 1983 claim for violation of liberty and privacy rights guaranteed by the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\" Also maybe \"Section 1983 claim for procedural due process rights under Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\".

In Opinion and Order (016) claims: Section 1983 claims, violation of 4th Amendment, violation of AACWA, etc. Also Complaint maybe has claims. We need to extract every distinct value of this checklist item from any document. So we need all causes of action: e.g., Section 1983 claim arising from violations of the Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act (AACWA). Also common law claim for breach of third party beneficiary rights arising from AACWA. Also claim for violation of substantive due process rights under 4th Amendment. Also violation of liberty and privacy rights guaranteed by First, Ninth, Fourteenth Amendments. Also violation of procedural due process rights under Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments based on deprivation of state law entitlements. Also common law claim for breach of federal contractual obligations to third party beneficiaries. Also Section 1983 claim for violation of substantive due process rights. Also maybe others in Complaint. We need to search further. Let's search for \"claim\" or \"cause of action\" pattern that indicates cause of action types. But we have limited tokens visited. We could search all documents for \"Section 1983\" again but we already saw. But we may need to search for \"civ. 1983\" or \"Section 1983 claim\" etc. Let's search for \"Section 1983 claim\" again but maybe we need to get more context. We saw matches in Opinion and Order (012) and (016). Need to read those sections in more detail to capture each claim. Let's search for \"Section 1983 claim\" in Opinion and Order (016) to read around. Already read tokens 200-700; includes 3 Section 1983 claims: first cause of action for violation of substantive due process rights under 4th Amendment; second cause of action for violation of liberty and privacy rights guaranteed by 1st, 9th, 14th; third cause of action for violation of procedural due process rights under 5th and 14th. Also mention \"violation of the Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., and breach of federal contractual obligations to third party beneficiaries.\" That is a separate claim. Also \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights arising from AACWA.\" So we need to capture each distinct cause. Also \"Section 1983 claim arising from violations of the AACWA\" from Opinion and Order (012). Also maybe \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights arising from the AACWA.\" So we need to gather all.\n\nWe should also inspect Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief and Request for Class Action for causes of action. Let's search there. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"cause of action\" maybe. But we saw earlier in complaint we searched pattern \"Section 1983\" and got 0 matches. But we need to find cause of action claims. Let's search for \"Section 1983 claim\" again but in complaint. Use search_document_regex on complaint. Also search for \"claim\" maybe. Let's search for \"Section 1983\" in complaint. Use search_document_regex with doc_name \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief and Request for Class Action\" pattern \"Section 1983\".

We have partial readings. We need to find all distinct causes of action. The search results show \"Section 1983\" and \"Section 1983 claim\". The Complaint might have other causes like \"Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act\" (AACWA) violation, common law breach of contract. Also, \"violation of Fourteenth Amendment\" etc. But note: The instruction says: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens). Do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments or statutory rights), remedies, or procedural doctrines.\" So we need to extract the statutes or judicial causes: e.g., Section 1983 claims; Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq.); maybe \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights\" is a cause of action? But common law breach of contract is a cause of action vehicle. We should include that too. Also maybe \"violation of state law entitlements\" could be a cause of action? But that's just procedural due process rights. We need to read more to get all distinct causes.\n\nWe saw in Opinion and Order (012): \"Plaintiffs’ third cause of action is a Section 1983 claim arising from alleged violations of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA), 42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" \"Plaintiffs’ fifth cause of action is a common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights arising from the AACWA.\" That gives two causes: Section 1983 claim; common law breach of contract claim.\n\nIn Opinion and Order (016): list of Section 1983 claims: \"Plaintiffs’ first cause of action for violation of plaintiff children’s substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\" etc. That is a Section 1983 claim. The second cause is violations of liberty and privacy rights under First, Ninth, Fourteenth Amendments: also Section 1983 claim. Third cause: violation of procedural due process rights under Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments based on deprivation of state law entitlements: also Section 1983 claim. So all three are Section 1983 claims. So cause of action: Section 1983.\n\nAlso maybe the Complaint includes \"Violation of the Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq.\" That's also Section 1983, but we might capture that separately? But the cause is Section 1983. But we need distinct values: Source: \"Section 1983 claim\". Also \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights arising from the AACWA\". Also \"Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq.\" That's a statute, but the cause is Section 1983? Actually Section 1983 is the vehicle; the statute provides the private right of action. The cause: Section 1983 claim. So we might have duplicate.\n\nBut the instruction says: \"Extract EVERY distinct value... such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens).\" So we should include the statutes: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., maybe the Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act. Also maybe \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights\" is a cause of action.\n\nThus distinct values: 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq. (AACWA); common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights; maybe \"Section 1983 claim\" is a description.\n\nBut the key might be \"Cause_of_Action\". So each entry should include the extracted value and evidence. We should gather evidence from the documents. We have read some parts. We need to capture the text for each cause. For 42 U.S.C. § 1983: evidence from Opinion and Order (016) and (012). For 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq.: evidence from Opinion and Order (012). For common law breach claim: evidence from Opinion and Order (012). For Section 1983 claim: evidence from Opinion and Order (016) and (012). But maybe we should include \"Section 1983 claim\" as a cause? But maybe we should list the statutory cause: 42 U.S.C. § 1983. We can also list \"42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq.\" as a cause. And \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights\". That should suffice.\n\nWe need to read more parts to capture evidence for 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq. The text we saw: \"Plaintiffs’ third cause of action is a Section 1983 claim arising from alleged violations of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”), 42 U.S.C. §621 et seq.\" So we need to include that snippet for evidence.\n\nAlso for common law claim: \"Plaintiffs’ fifth cause of action is a common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights arising from the AACWA.\" We'll extract that.\n\nWe also need to capture Section 1983 claim evidence: \"Three Section 1983 claims remain in this lawsuit: 1. Plaintiffs’ first cause of action for violation ... Fourteenth Amendment ...; 2 ...; 3 ...\"\n\nThus we should read more of Opinion and Order (016) to capture the phrase \"Section 1983 claims remain\". We already saw that snippet.\n\nWe might also read more of the Complaint to confirm other causes. But we have enough.\n\nWe need to use read_document or search_document_regex. We already have matches. We should read more of Opinion and Order (016) around tokens 200-700. Already we have that snippet. We might need more for the Section 1983 claim list. The snippet includes the list. We can use that as evidence. We might want to capture the exact phrase \"Three Section 1983 claims remain in this lawsuit\". That is evidence.\n\nAlso for 42 U.S.C. § 1983, we can use the snippet \"Section 1983 claim\" itself.\n\nWe might also want to capture the phrase \"Section 1983 claim arising from alleged violations of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”), 42 U.S.C. §621 et seq.\" That covers both cause.\n\nThus we can use append_checklist with three entries: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq.\", \"common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights\".\n\nBut we also need to differentiate between the cause of action and the underlying statute. The cause of action is the vehicle: Section 1983, common law claim. So we should list those two. But the instruction says include statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action. So include 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq. So we have four distinct values: 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq.; common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights; Section 1983 claim (maybe same as 42 U.S.C. § 1983). But we can treat \"Section 1983 claim\" as the same. But we might still include it? It might be redundant.\n\nWe can just include the distinct vehicles: Section 1983 claim (i.e., 42 U.S.C. § 1983), 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq. (AACWA), common law breach claim. That is three. But \"Section 1983 claim\" is not a vehicle but a description. But the example \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is the vehicle. So we should not include \"Section 1983 claim\" as separate.\n\nThus we include:\n\n- 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n- 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq. (AACWA)\n- common law claim for breach of alleged third party beneficiary rights\n\nWe need evidence for each.\n\nFor 42 U.S.C. § 1983: evidence from Opinion and Order (016) with \"Section 1983 claims remain\". Also from Opinion and Order (012) with \"Section 1983 claim arising from alleged violations of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”), 42 U.S.C. §621 et seq.\" The snippet includes \"Section 1983 claim\". But we need to show the statute. Maybe we need to find the phrase \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". But we haven't seen that exact phrase. But we can use the \"Section 1983\" context. The question: Do we need to provide the exact statutory citation? The instruction: \"such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA)\". So we should provide the statutory citation. We have \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" not explicitly found in snippet. We might need to read more to find that. In the Complaint maybe. But we can use other documents like the Complaint. Let's search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" in the Complaint. But we haven't searched. We can use search_document_regex for pattern \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"1983\". Let's do that.\n\nWe should call search_document_regex for doc_names: maybe we can search all. Pattern: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". Use IGNORECASE maybe. Let's call.\n\nAlso we might search for \"42 U.S.C. § 621\" or \"§ 621\". But we already have. But to provide evidence for 42 U.S.C. § 1983, we need a snippet from a document. We can search for \"1983\" or \"42 U.S.C.\" pattern. We'll search all documents.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"§ 1983\". Let's do pattern \"§ 1983\". That might catch. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". We'll use both maybe. But we can just search for \"§ 1983\". Let's do that.\n\nWe'll issue search_document_regex for doc_name=\"all\", pattern \"§ 1983\", flags [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k maybe 5, context_tokens 200.\n\nLet's call that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"§ 1983\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "§ 1983", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5239, "completion_tokens": 2378, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have seen many matches. We need distinct values: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.), possibly common law breach of contract? But that is not a cause of action vehicle; it's a claim type. Only statutes and judge-made vehicles. So the cause of action vehicles: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.). Also possibly \"Section 1983 claim\" is same as 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Also \"Section 1983\" appears repeatedly. Also maybe \"Section 1983 claims\" as cause of action. Also \"section 1983\" is the vehicle. Also maybe \"Section 1983\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" are same. We should list each distinct value: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" (the AACWA). Are there any other statutes? We saw \"Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" Also maybe \"Section 1983 claims remain\" but that's same.\n\nAlso we might need \"Common law claim for breach of contract\" but that is not a cause of action vehicle, but it's a claim type. The instruction says: do not include underlying rights, remedies, procedural doctrines. So we don't include \"breach of contract\" as cause of action. So only statutory vehicles.\n\nAlso maybe \"Section 1983\" appears as cause of action for due process rights. So we should capture that.\n\nWe might need to check if there's any other statutes like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears multiple times. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 621\" appears. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1391\" but that's venue. So ignore.\n\nThus two distinct causes: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. (AACWA). Also maybe \"Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980\" itself is the cause of action (statutory name). But we should include the statutory reference: \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" That covers AACWA.\n\nAlso maybe \"Section 1983 claim\" is the same as 42 U.S.C. § 1983. So no new.\n\nThus we need to extract two items.\n\nWe have evidence from multiple documents. We need to provide evidence for each.\n\nWe can use the earlier read_document or search_document_regex results. We have evidence:\n\nFrom Step 6: In Opinion and Order (012) we saw: \"Plaintiffs’ third cause of action is a Section 1983 claim arising from alleged violations of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”), 42 U.S.C. §621 et seq.\"\n\nAlso from Step 9: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief and Request for Class Action: \"This civil rights class action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\".\n\nAlso from Opinion and Order (016) matches: \"This class action was filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and also \"Three Section 1983 claims remain\".\n\nThus evidence for 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nAlso evidence for 42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. from Opinion and Order (012) and maybe others.\n\nThus we need to append two entries.\n\nWe can batch in one append_checklist call.\n\nNeed to include evidence with text verbatim snippets.\n\nUse the evidence from the earlier results. For 42 U.S.C. § 1983: we can use snippet from Complaint for Injunctive ...: \"brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\". Also from Opinion and Order (016): \"filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\".\n\nFor 42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.: snippet from Opinion and Order (012): \"Plaintiffs’ third cause of action is a Section 1983 claim arising from alleged violations of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”), 42 U.S.C. §621 et seq.\"\n\nMake sure to include location text: e.g., \"Complaint for Injunctive ...

No.\n\nThus we have 2 distinct values and they are already appended. But we might need to confirm if any other cause of action like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in other documents maybe not yet visited, like \"Opinion and Order (001)\" etc. But maybe the cause of action is same. But maybe other statutes like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears elsewhere but same.\n\nBut check for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears many times. But no new distinct ones.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is one cause. \"42 U.S.C. § 621\" is another.

No Not Applicable. So we can stop.\n\nBut double-check if any other cause of action like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 621\" are the only two. Are there any other statutes like \"42 U.S.C. § 621\" but we already captured that.

The search results show patterns like \"§ 1983\" and \"§ 621\" appears. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 621\" appears. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 621\" appears. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 621\" appears repeated.

The previous step claimed extracted 2 values: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. But we saw other mentions: there were additional cause of actions possibly: maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" repeated, also \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" which is the AACWA. Also there may be other statutes like \"42 U.S.C. § 623?\" etc. Let's scan the earlier search results: In step 9, we saw matches for § 1983. In step 10, we appended 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. But we may have missed other statutes like \"42 U.S.C. § 622\" or \"42 U.S.C. § 629\" etc. But those are not causes of action; they are remedies? Actually 42 U.S.C. § 629 is about child welfare; but it might be also a cause of action? Let's check the context: In the Complaint, there's mention: \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" The cause of action is for violations of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act (AACWA). That is a cause of action.\n\nBut there might be other causes: For example, \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is used. Also there may be \"42 U.S.C. § 623\" etc. But it's not a cause of action; it's part of the AACWA. The cause of action is presumably the statutory right: \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" is the cause of action for violations of AACWA. Are there any other statutes causing action? Let's search for \"Section 1983\" in all documents beyond the ones already searched. We already looked at many. But we might have missed \"42 U.S.C. § 1360\" or \"42 U.S.C. § 1412\" etc. But those are not likely. Let's search again.\n\nWe need to examine if other causes of action exist. The text in the Complaint may include \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" multiple times. But that is the same cause.\n\nWe also saw maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 621\" repeated. There might be \"42 U.S.C. § 431\" etc. Not relevant.\n\nAlso we saw \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" repeated. Maybe also \"42 U.S.C. § 621, 623, 629\" etc. But cause of action might be the AACWA as a whole: 42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. But there might also be \"42 U.S.C. § 629\" as cause of action for child welfare. But the cause of action is the entire AACWA.\n\nBut the checklist definition: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles ... Deduplicate repeats.\"\n\nThus 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is a cause of action. 42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. is the AACWA. Those are two distinct causes. Are there any other causes? The documents might mention \"42 U.S.C. § 629\" but that is part of AACWA but not separate cause. But some claims might be for \"42 U.S.C. § 621\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 629\" separately. But the cause of action is still AACWA. But if the claim is specifically for 629, it might be considered separate? But the document may not mention separate.\n\nLet's search again: Use search_document_regex for pattern \"§ 629\" or \"§ 623\". But we haven't done that. The risk is missing a cause of action. But the evidence search earlier found \"§ 621\" matches. We saw also \"§ 621 et seq.\" but not \"§ 629\". In the Complaint, there was \"42 U.S.c. §§ 622(b)(8)(A)(ii)-(iii), 622(b)(15), 629a(a)(l)(A)(i)-(ii), 629a(a)(7)-(8), 671(a)(l), 671(a)(II)\". Those are not causes of action—they are statutory references to specific provisions of AACWA. But the cause of action is the AACWA as a whole. So we don't need to extract each sub-section.\n\nThus we likely have all distinct causes: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\".\n\nBut we should double-check if any other cause appears: \"42 U.S.C. § 623\" is not referenced. But maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 623\" is also a cause of action for child welfare. But maybe not used.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" covers the entire AACWA. But there may be \"42 U.S.C. § 623\" as a separate cause of action. But I'm not sure if the documents mention that.\n\nLet's search for \"§ 623\" across all documents. But we can also search for \"§ 629\" or \" § 629a\". But those are subparts of AACWA, not separate cause. But if the cause is \"42 U.S.C. § 629\", maybe it's considered a separate cause.\n\nBut the checklist definition: \"statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA)\". The AACWA is a statute that creates a private right of action. The cause is \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" because the plaintiff is suing under that statute. So that is fine.\n\nThus we have 2 distinct cause of action values. Are there any other causes? Maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 621\" is the same as \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\"; we would not duplicate. So we are done.\n\nBut what about \"42 U.S.C. § 431\"? Not relevant.\n\nWe might also have \"42 U.S.C. § 1360\" for child welfare. But not present.\n\nThus likely complete.\n\nHowever, check if any other cause of action appears in any other documents not yet read: maybe the \"Opinion and Order from the U.S. Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit\" might contain other cause of action references like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" repeated. But that's duplicate.\n\nBut we might have missed \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" in other documents like \"Opinion and Order (012)\" we already captured. We also saw \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" in \"Opinion and Order (016)\" we captured. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" appears in \"Opinion and Order (008)\" we captured.\n\nThus we have all distinct.\n\nBut check if any other cause of action appears: maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 621\" only. But we captured \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\" which includes all sub-sections. Good.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut before stopping, we need to ensure that the extracted entries have evidence. In the previous step, we appended two values. But did we include evidence for 42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. from Opinion and Order (012)? Yes, we did. We also included evidence for 42 U.S.C. § 1983 from Complaint and Opinion and Order (016). So we have evidence for each.\n\nHowever, we need to verify that for 42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq., we have not used duplicate evidence from the same doc. We used Opinion and Order (012) and maybe also Opinion and Order (016). We may have duplicate but it's fine.\n\nBut we might still have missing evidence for 42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. from Complaint (maybe earlier). But we already have evidence from Opinion and Order (012). That should suffice.\n\nNow check: Did we include the value \"42 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.\"? Yes. Did we include \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\"? Yes.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we must check that the keys are complete: we have only one key. The checklist summary shows 1/1 filled. So all done. We should call stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct Cause_of_Action values have been extracted and documented with evidence.
