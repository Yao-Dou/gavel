Likely each complaint has a FACTS section. We should search for \"FACTS\" or \"FACT\" in each complaint. We have some matches from search_document_regex earlier. We should read those. The last search was only for FACTS in Complaint, but there are also FACTS in the amended complaints. We should read the FACTS sections of the First Amended Complaint and Second Amended Complaint. The earlier search_document_regex found matches in those complaints (the 5 matches from First Amended, 5 from Second). Those matches are the FACTS sections? The matches show the FACTS heading, e.g., in the first match of First Amended: tokens 1799-1999 shows \"FACTS\" heading. But the snippet didn't show the heading; it started with the content. Actually the snippet for First Amended shows \"ES and its Centers\" etc. but maybe the heading was earlier. But we can search for \"FACTS\" in the complaints.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on the Complaint, First Amended, Second Amended for pattern \"^FACTS\" or \"FACTS\". Use doc_names list to search only those three. Use flags IGNORECASE? The pattern maybe \"FACTS\". We want to get all matches. Use top_k maybe large. Let's call search_document_regex with doc_names list. We'll get top matches. Then we would read each matched region fully to capture facts. But we can use search_document_regex to get context. That might provide enough? The pattern may match within the text; we need to capture entire facts section. Might need to read more tokens beyond the match. The search returns context 200 tokens. That probably covers entire facts section. So we can use search_document_regex to gather facts.\n\nWe need to extract the facts: details of relevant events, evidence, background info. Each factual statement can be considered a fact. We need to collect distinct values. Likely each paragraph or bullet might be a fact. We'll extract each distinct factual claim.\n\nWe need to read the matched text from the search and append to checklist. So we do search_document_regex first. Then next turn we would process.

So next action: search_document_regex with doc_names: [\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"] and pattern \"FACTS\" maybe with IGNORECASE.

We have read a lot of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, but we haven't extracted any facts. We need to identify facts.

We need to locate factual statements about events, dates, parties, etc. Likely the Complaint has a \"FACTS\" section that outlines the facts of the case. We have seen the header \"FACTS\" and then the text about Congress reorganizing ED etc. That is legal background, not facts. But maybe the facts are earlier or later. We need to search for \"facts\" again or find factual statements.\n\nThe \"FACTS\" section might include facts about the defendants' actions, like \"the defendants terminated contracts\", etc. Those are facts. We saw in later part: \"On February 10, 2025, IES employees were informed that employees of the so-called 'Department of Government Efficiency' had made the decision to cancel most of IES's contracts\". That's a factual statement. Also earlier: \"Defendants have taken a series of actions to terminate IES's performance of statutorily required functions.\"\n\nWe need to extract all distinct factual basis items. Likely each factual claim is a separate value. The definition says: details of relevant events, evidence, background. So we need to extract each fact: e.g., \"Defendants have taken a series of actions to terminate IES’s performance of statutorily required functions.\" But maybe we need to extract more granular facts: the termination of contracts, dates, etc.\n\nWe should search for \"terminated\" or \"terminated contracts\" and capture the facts. But we need to find all facts. Perhaps the \"FACTS\" section contains multiple paragraphs each detailing different facts. The large text we saw includes many facts about IES, but also background about Congress. That may be part of facts. But we need to capture all distinct facts.\n\nWe could search for \"FACTS\" again to capture further context. The search earlier gave only one match per document. But maybe there are multiple \"FACTS\" sections? Likely only one.\n\nWe need to read the \"FACTS\" section fully. We have read tokens 1823-6023 of Complaint. That's the entire FACTS section? It seems large. But there may be other facts outside this section. But the \"facts\" are usually in the \"FACTS\" section. Let's identify distinct factual statements:\n\nFrom text:\n\n- \"Defendants have taken a series of actions to terminate IES’s performance of statutorily required functions.\" (fact)\n- \"Since February 2025, Defendants have taken a series of actions to terminate IES’s performance of statutorily required functions.\" (fact)\n- \"On February 10, 2025, IES employees were informed that employees of the so‑called “Department of Government Efficiency” had made the decision to cancel most of IES contracts and begun the process to do so.\" (fact)\n- \"DOGE subsequently announced this decision on its X account, and has since posted on its “Wall of Receipts” website that approximately 90 IES contracts were canceled on February 10 or 11, 2025—including contracts for research activities and contracts that allowed for the basic functioning of IES.\" (fact)\n- \"Defendants have taken a series of actions to terminate IES’s performance...\" repeated.\n\nAlso earlier: \"The Defendants' Termination of IES’s Activities\" heading.\n\nAlso facts about the contracts: \"ED terminated the contract for the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 2020, which was shifted to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and had already begun to produce valuable data for researchers.\" (fact)\n- \"ED terminated the contract for the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study- Kindergarten (ECLS-K:2024), which had already begun to produce useful data for researchers and policymakers after several years of planning.\" (fact)\n- etc. These are facts too.\n\nWe could extract each of these as separate facts.\n\nThe documents also contain \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" but maybe facts there too. But we focus on Complaint's facts.\n\nWe need to produce append_checklist with multiple entries for Factual_Basis_of_Case, each with evidence (text, source_document, location). We need to include evidence for each value. We need to provide location as page numbers maybe. The read_document gives page numbers. For each fact, we can include location \"Page 11 of 28\" etc.\n\nWe need to make sure we don't miss any facts. But the instructions: extract every distinct value. We might capture all facts we find. For brevity, maybe we can capture a few key facts. But the requirement is thorough. However, we cannot read entire 13k tokens again; we already read large portion. But we might need to read other documents like First Amended Complaint for more facts. But we might just extract from Complaint.\n\nGiven limited time, we can extract a reasonable set of factual claims from the Complaint. Let's extract e.g., 10 facts.\n\nWe need to produce evidence entries. Let's pick the text excerpts from the read_document snippet.\n\nWe must also include the \"source_document\" and \"location\" fields.\n\nWe have page numbers in snippet: e.g., \"Case 1:25-cv-00999 Document 1 Filed 04/04/25 Page 11 of 28\" etc.\n\nWe can use location \"Page 11 of 28\" etc.\n\nLet's identify facts and corresponding text:\n\nFrom snippet:\n\n- \"Defendants have taken a series of actions to terminate IES’s performance of statutorily required functions.\" (source: Complaint, page 11 of 28). That is in paragraph 30.\n\n- \"Since February 2025, Defendants have taken a series of actions to terminate IES’s performance of statutorily required functions.\" (source: Complaint, page 11).\n\n- \"On February 10, 2025, IES employees were informed that employees of the so‑called “Department of Government Efficiency” had made the decision to cancel most of IES’s contracts and begun the process to do so.\" (page 11).\n\n- \"DOGE subsequently announced this decision on its X account, and has since posted on its “Wall of Receipts” website that approximately 90 IES contracts were canceled on February 10 or 11, 2025—including contracts for research activities and contracts that allowed for the basic functioning of IES.\" (page 11).\n\n- \"ED terminated the contract for the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 2020, which was shifted to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and had already begun to produce valuable data for researchers.\" (page 12).\n\n- \"ED terminated the contract for the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study- Kindergarten (ECLS-K:2024), which had already begun to produce useful data for researchers and policymakers after several years of planning.\" (page 12).\n\n- \"ED terminated contracts for the National Teacher and Principal Survey, which collects data every two to three years on core topics including teacher and principal preparation, classes taught, school characteristics, and demographics of the teacher and principal labor force—a version of which has been conducted since 1987.\" (page 12).\n\n- \"ED also terminated contracts necessary to the Common Core of Data and the Private School Survey.\" (page 12).\n\n- \"ED also terminated the contract for the National Assessment of Adult Education.\" (page 12).\n\n- \"ED terminated contracts necessary for the Condition of Education, a report produced annually by NCES.\" (page 12).\n\n- \"ED terminated the contracts by which the agency was complying with the public dissemination and performance management requirements of the Education Sciences Reform Act, including the contract for its “DATALAB” web platform and contracts for its What Works Clearinghouse.\" (page 12).\n\n- \"ED terminated the contract for NCES’s mail center.\" (page 12).\n\nWe might include all those as facts.\n\nAlso earlier: \"Defendants have taken a series of actions to terminate IES’s performance of statutorily required functions.\" repeated.\n\nWe also have earlier facts: \"Since February 2025\" etc.\n\nWe should also include facts earlier about the statute but that might be background rather than factual claims about the parties. But could be considered facts: e.g., \"Congress reorganized ED's research centers into four separate National Education Centers within IES.\" That's a factual statement about the law. Might be considered part of factual basis. But the case facts usually include events relevant to the lawsuit. The law background might not be considered facts for the case. But maybe the complaint includes background facts about IES structure. That might be included. But we can include at least the key factual claims about the defendants' actions.\n\nThus we will append all these facts.\n\nWe need to use append_checklist with patch key Factual_Basis_of_Case and multiple extracted entries.\n\nLet's create the JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\":

We have partially read tokens 2023-3023, 3023-5023, 5023-6023. Not yet read earlier part of complaint (0-1823). Also other complaints have not been fully read. So likely there are more factual basis items. We should read earlier part of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, maybe tokens 0-1823. Also maybe read First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief entire, but that might be large. We might search for \"FACTS\" pattern in those documents to locate relevant sections.

Factual_Basis_of_Case could also appear in other documents: First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Declaration, Motion.

The first amended complaint likely contains similar facts. But we only have 12 values from Complaint. We want to extract all distinct values from all documents. We have not visited other docs fully. We need to search for \"facts\" or \"FACTS\" or maybe \"the facts\" or \"statements\" etc. The search result shows matches in first, second amended complaints, etc. We saw those matches earlier but not read full.\n\nWe need to read those sections in first and second amended complaints to capture facts. Also docket may have statements of facts. Memorandum opinion may not have facts. Declaration of Abigail Doe may contain facts. Motion for preliminary injunction may also.\n\nThus we need to read relevant sections. We have partial views of first amended complaint: tokens 1799-1999 (the FACTS section). We also have partial views of second amended complaint: tokens 1893-2093 (FACTS). We need to read those matches fully. Probably we need to read more tokens around those to capture full facts. Let's retrieve full FACTS sections.\n\nWe can use read_document to read broader range for each complaint. For first amended complaint tokens 1799-2099 maybe? We saw 1799-1999; maybe there is more beyond 1999. Let's read 1799-2199. Similarly second amended complaint 1893-2093 maybe covers entire.

We need to add values from other docs.\n\nThus next action: read_document on First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 1799-2199. Also read second amended complaint tokens 1893-2193. Also read Declaration of Abigail Doe.\n\nWe can do one read_document per turn. But we should only call one function. We can batch? No, we can only call one function per turn. We need to decide which to read next. We could read Declaration of Abigail Doe because unvisited. That might yield facts. But we might miss facts in amended complaints. But maybe the 12 values from Complaint already cover all facts? But likely not. So we need to extract more.\n\nThus we need to read first amended complaint to capture facts. Let's read tokens 1799-2199 (400 tokens). That should capture the FACTS section.\n\nPlan: call read_document with doc_name \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", start 1799, end 2199.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":1799,\"end_token\":2199}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 1799, "end_token": 2199}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11235, "completion_tokens": 737, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But need to confirm if all distinct values are captured. The key has only 12 values. But maybe there are more facts in other documents? The checklist item \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" might require extracting all facts from all documents? The instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" The only key is Factual_Basis_of_Case. We have 12 values from Complaint. But maybe other documents contain additional facts, e.g., First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Declaration, Motion. The earlier steps extracted 12 values from Complaint, but we might need to also extract facts from other documents. The prior steps didn't extract from other documents. So we need to continue to search other documents for facts. Use search_document_regex for \"FACTS\" in all documents again? Already did; found matches in Complaint, First Amended, Second Amended, Memorandum. But we haven't read those full sections; only partially visited. We need to read the facts sections in those documents.\n\nWe should read the facts from First Amended Complaint (we partially read tokens 1799-2199, but maybe more facts beyond that). Also Second Amended Complaint (we partially read 1893-2093). Also maybe the Docket has facts? The Docket might not have facts but maybe statements.\n\nAlso Declaration of Abigail Doe may contain facts. Also Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction may contain facts. Also Memorandum Opinion may contain facts.\n\nWe need to extract all factual basis values. We already have 12 from Complaint. We need to check other documents for additional facts. Likely the facts sections are similar across complaints. So we should read the facts section in the First Amended Complaint and Second Amended Complaint.\n\nWe should read from First Amended Complaint from tokens 1799-2199 (already did). That snippet contains facts about ESRA. But there might be more facts earlier or later. The snippet started with \"ES and its Centers\" and then enumerated facts. That is likely the facts section.\n\nBut maybe the First Amended Complaint has a \"FACTS\" heading earlier; we should read around that heading. The search_document_regex earlier matched tokens 1799-1999; that's the same section. We need to capture all facts from that section. We may need to read more tokens maybe until the end of the facts section. Usually the facts section ends before the \"WHEREFORE\" or \"PRAYER\" etc. We don't know where it ends. But maybe the first 400-500 tokens of that section contain all facts. Since we already captured 12 facts from Complaint, maybe the same facts repeated. But we should read the entire facts section to ensure we capture any additional facts not in Complaint.\n\nSimilarly for Second Amended Complaint. Let's read a larger range: tokens 1893-2300 maybe.\n\nAlso Docket maybe not relevant.\n\nDeclaration of Abigail Doe: likely contains facts about her involvement.\n\nMotion for Preliminary Injunction likely contains facts.\n\nThus we need to extract all facts across all documents.\n\nWe should proceed to read First Amended Complaint from tokens 1799-3000 maybe.\n\nAlso read Second Amended Complaint from tokens 1893-2500.\n\nAlso read Declaration of Abigail Doe (full doc).\n\nAlso read Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.\n\nWe need to append new facts found.\n\nWe already have 12 facts. Let's identify them: from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, the 12 facts likely include items like:\n\n1. In 2002, Congress enacted the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (ESRA).\n2. As then-Secretary of Education Rod Paige remarked ...\n3. Congress reorganized existing research initiatives at the Department of Education (ED).\n4. Created the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) and four National Centers.\n5. Congress charged IES with duty to compile statistics...\n6. The statute transferred duties to IES.\n7. Congress added new mandatory tasks for IES.\n8. Congress continued appropriating funds to IES.\n9. Defendants terminated IES's work.\n10. Defendants canceled contracts, reduced staff, terminated remote access.\n11. Defendants' actions halted IES-sponsored research.\n12. Plaintiffs rely on IES's performance.\n\nBut we need to verify each fact extracted. We should read the Complaint to confirm.\n\nHowever, we might not need to re-read the Complaint; we already have 12 values. The instructions: \"After each read_document or search_document_regex action: ... After each append_checklist or update_checklist action: ... Verify whether all extractable values from the preceding text were included.\" So we need to read new text, extract facts, then append.\n\nThus next action: read First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 1799-5000 maybe. But we must keep within 10,000 tokens. Let's read 1799-5000 which is 3201 tokens, within limit.\n\nBut we need to ensure we don't re-read already visited tokens. The document currently has viewed tokens 1799-2199, 8089-8289, etc. We'll read a new range 2200-5000 to capture remaining facts.\n\nLet's do read_document for First Amended Complaint tokens 2200-5000.\n\nThen we will parse for facts and append.\n\nAlternatively, we could read the entire First Amended Complaint (all tokens) but it's 14,528 tokens, but we can read in chunks. We'll read 2200-5000 first.\n\nAlso read Second Amended Complaint maybe later.\n\nSo next action: read_document on First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 2200-5000.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":2200,\"end_token\":5000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 2200, "end_token": 5000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11483, "completion_tokens": 1258, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Currently 12 values from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. But we also have first amended complaint etc. The Factual_Basis_of_Case may include facts from all complaints and other documents. We need to extract all facts from all relevant documents. We have 12 from Complaint. But likely more facts in First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Declaration, Motion. So we still need to extract more facts. We must read more documents: maybe read the First Amended Complaint fully for facts. Also maybe the Declaration of Abigail Doe contains facts. The Motion may have facts. Docket maybe has facts. Memorandum Opinion may also have facts. So we need to read these documents.\n\nWe currently have partially visited First Amended Complaint (tokens 1799-5000, etc.). We need to read more to capture all facts sections. The portion with FACTS is at tokens 1799-2199. We saw that. But there may be more facts in earlier part? The first part of First Amended Complaint may have facts earlier, but we haven't seen. The initial part (tokens 0-1799) may contain some facts. We haven't visited that. We need to read tokens 0-1799. Also maybe later part after 5000 contains more facts. So we should read from 0-1799. That is <10k tokens, ok. Also we may need to read the Second Amended Complaint fully for facts. We have some tokens 1893-2093. The FACTS section likely starts around 1893. We need to read that portion. Also maybe earlier part before 1893 has facts? But the search shows FACTS at 1893-2093, so that is likely the facts section. We might need to read that entire section, maybe 1893-2093 is 200 tokens; we already have that. But maybe there are more facts later? The claims may be repeated. But we should read more to capture all facts. The First Amended Complaint has facts. The Second Amended Complaint also. Also Declaration of Abigail Doe may contain facts. The Motion for preliminary injunction may also contain facts. Docket may have facts like docket entry descriptions. The Memorandum Opinion may contain facts, but not sure.\n\nThus we need to read the Declaration of Abigail Doe (2,023 tokens). Also read Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (685 tokens). And read Docket entries maybe. Also read Memorandum Opinion for facts.\n\nWe have 12 facts from Complaint. We need to append additional facts from other documents.\n\nThus next action: read_document for Declaration of Abigail Doe tokens 0-2023. Then read_document for Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction tokens 0-685.\n\nAlso read_document for Docket tokens 0-3591 maybe to capture facts. But the Docket may have a list of docket entries; each entry may contain some facts. We might want to read entire Docket to capture facts. But maybe too many tokens? Docket 3,591 tokens. It's less than 10k, can read all.\n\nAlso read_document for Memorandum Opinion tokens 0-14049? That's 14k >10k. We can read in chunks. But maybe the facts are in earlier part. The search found FACTS at 7001-7201. So we could read that region. But we might need earlier facts too. Let's search for \"FACTS\" in Memorandum Opinion. But we have already. We might read 7001-7201 region. But maybe also earlier facts. But likely the MEMO contains discussion of facts. But the case facts may be in the complaint, not the memo. But the memo may include a summary of facts. But we might still capture.\n\nThus to be safe, read the Docket fully, Declaration, Motion, and maybe the first part of First Amended Complaint 0-1799. Also maybe the Second Amended Complaint 0-5627? But we have 1893-2093. But maybe earlier part includes facts? But the FACTS section likely only once. But earlier part may include \"Summary of facts\" or \"Statement of facts\". But our search shows only one FACTS match per document. So likely the facts are in that section. For Second Amended Complaint, we have 1893-2093 as FACTS. For First Amended Complaint, 1799-2199. For Complaint, 1823-2023. So we need to read those sections. We have already read the Complaint and First Amended Complaint FACTS. The Second Amended Complaint FACTS we haven't read fully: we have 1893-2093 tokens, but not the text. We need to read that region.\n\nThus next step: read_document for Second Amended Complaint tokens 1893-2093.\n\nAlso read_document for Declaration of Abigail Doe 0-2023, Motion for Preliminary Injunction 0-685, Docket 0-3591.\n\nAfter reading those, we will append findings.\n\nThus next action: read_document for Declaration of Abigail Doe tokens 0-2023.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Declaration of Abigail Doe\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":2023}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Declaration of Abigail Doe", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 2023}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12518, "completion_tokens": 1123, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Need to read first amended complaint's facts section fully. Also second amended complaint facts. Also maybe Docket or Memorandum Opinion might have facts? But likely not. So we need to append additional facts from those documents.\n\nWe need to read the first amended complaint \"FACTS\" section. That is around tokens 1799-1999 but we read 1799-2199 earlier. But we didn't capture all facts; we captured some statutes. The facts section likely earlier. The search found match at 1799-1999. We read 1799-2199, which includes part of \"FACTS\" header and the statutes. That might be the facts? The first amended complaint's facts likely similar to first complaint but maybe additional facts. We need to read earlier tokens maybe 1700-2000? But we already read 1799-2199. Maybe we need to read 1700-1800? But we can read again but we must avoid reading already read portion. We have read 1799-2199, so unviewed tokens are 0-1799? Actually partially visited ranges: 1799-5000, 8089-8289, etc. So 0-1799 not read. The facts section may be earlier than 1799. We need to read 0-1799 to capture facts. Let's search for \"FACTS\" pattern again but we know match at 1799-1999. But that region includes the header and first line of facts? Let's read 1700-1900 maybe. But we should read tokens 1700-1900. Let's do read_document on First Amended Complaint, tokens 1700-1900. That will capture facts header and initial facts.\n\nAlso need to read second amended complaint's facts. Search shows match at 1893-2093. We have partially visited 1893-2093 already. Did we read? We didn't read that range yet. We need to read it.\n\nAlso maybe the Docket or Memorandum Opinion have facts?

According to current status, 12 values extracted from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. But we need to ensure all distinct values are extracted. We have partial coverage of other documents: First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, etc. The Factual_Basis_of_Case might have additional facts in those documents. We need to extract all distinct factual bases across all documents. We already extracted 12 from Complaint. Need to check other documents for more facts that might not have been captured.\n\nWe also have Declaration of Abigail Doe, which contains facts. That might be separate fact basis. It's likely part of Factual_Basis_of_Case. We need to extract facts from that too. Also Docket? Not likely. Memorandum Opinion may contain facts. So we need to read more.\n\nCurrently, we have partial coverage of First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, Declaration (full). The Declaration has many facts. They likely need to be extracted. The Complaint already had 12 facts. But maybe Declaration has more.\n\nWe need to identify distinct facts. But we must be careful: the Factual_Basis_of_Case may require each distinct fact as a separate entry. The Declaration is about contract cancellations etc. That is factual basis. So we need to extract those.\n\nWe should read more of Declaration? It's fully visited, but we didn't extract facts. We need to extract all facts from Declaration. But we might have missed some earlier. Let's scan. In the Declaration, there are many statements about contract cancellations, dates, etc. Those are facts. We should list them. But we need to ensure not to double count.\n\nLet's identify facts from Declaration: \n1. Author is Abigail Doe, employee of U.S. Department of Education, concerned about retaliation. \n2. She was placed on administrative leave on March 21, 2025. \n3. She worked at National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE) until that leave. \n4. She was familiar with RELs and WWC. \n5. REL program created by 20 U.S.C. § 9564; there are ten RELs. \n6. RELs work with state/local education departments; provides services: applied research, training, technical assistance, dissemination. \n7. Services through five-year contracts; separate contract for peer review. \n8. Topics of REL research come from local partners. \n9. On February 10, 2025, she attended emergency meeting where told all contracts being canceled by DOGE except REL contracts. \n10. No copies of termination notices. \n11. On February 13, a colleague received email from Contracts and Acquisitions Management about REL contract canceled after all. \n12. Press release on Feb 13 stating REL contracts canceled as \"woke spending\". \n13. February 10 meeting said REL contracts would not be terminated but would be recompeted. \n14. Contracts were cancelled without bidding process; statutorily mandated work halted. \n15. The cancellation caused waste of taxpayer money; nine of ten RELs had completed toolkits and were conducting efficacy studies. \n16. The efficacy studies would never be completed. \n17. Toolkits may never be released; data may not be released; uncertain impact. \n18. Staff were working on three practice guides; two not peer-reviewed; peer review contract canceled. \n19. IES leadership tried internal peer reviews; but staff got RIF notices and stopped as of March 21. \n20. No one tasked with re-establishing REL program. \n21. Confusion about reductions; no one left at NCEE to manage. \n22. The cancellation of REL contracts led to lost research.\n\nAlso might include some dates: Feb 10, Feb 13, March 21.\n\nAlso the Declaration includes specific details: \"DOGE\" (Department of General Education?), \"Contracts and Acquisitions Management office\". So many facts.\n\nWe also have the First Amended Complaint and Second Amended Complaint have facts about the establishment of IES, etc. Those facts may be duplicates of Complaint facts. But we need to capture all distinct facts? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" So the Factual_Basis_of_Case includes all facts or evidence that support the case. The facts in the Complaint are likely the core. But Declaration adds further facts. So we need to add those.\n\nThus we need to append checklist entries for Factual_Basis_of_Case from Declaration. We should also consider that some facts might appear in other documents like Memorandum Opinion or Docket. But let's focus on Declaration.\n\nWe need to read the entire Declaration? It's fully visited, but we didn't extract. We need to extract all facts. We should identify distinct facts and provide evidence snippet. We can extract multiple entries in one append_checklist call.\n\nWe should list each fact as separate extracted value.\n\nWe must provide evidence: text snippet, source_document, location. The location can be page number or token range. We can approximate with page. For Declaration, page numbers available: Page 1-5. We can give page numbers.\n\nWe need to extract maybe 20 facts. Let's count distinct facts.\n\nWe can group similar facts into separate entries: e.g., \"She attended emergency meeting on February 10, 2025\" is one fact. \"She was told all contracts canceled by DOGE except REL contracts\" is another. \"No copies of termination notices\" is another. \"On February 13 a colleague received email from Contracts and Acquisitions Management about REL contract cancellation\" is another. \"Press release on February 13 stating REL contracts canceled as 'woke spending'\" is another. \"Contracts were canceled without bidding process; statutorily mandated work halted\" is another. \"Nine of ten RELs had completed toolkits and were conducting efficacy studies\" is another. \"Efficacy studies would never be completed\" is another. \"Toolkits may never be released; data may not be released; uncertain impact\" is another. \"Staff working on three practice guides; two not peer-reviewed; peer review contract canceled\" is another. \"IES leadership tried internal peer reviews; staff got RIF notices and stopped as of March 21\" is another. \"No one tasked with re-establishing REL program\" is another. \"Only one staff member left at NCEE\" is another. \"She was placed on administrative leave on March 21, 2025\" is another. \"She worked at NCEE until leave\" is another. \"She is a pseudonym; employee of Department, concerned about retaliation\" is another. \"She is familiar with RELs and WWC\" is another. \"REL program created by 20 U.S.C. § 9564; ten RELs\" is another. \"RELs work with state/local education departments; services: applied research, training, technical assistance, dissemination\" is another. \"Services through five-year contracts; separate contract for peer review\" is another. \"Topics of REL research come from local partners\" is another.\n\nCount: about 20-22 facts.\n\nWe also might include early facts: \"She is over age 18 and competent to testify\" but that's a statement of competency, not factual basis. But may be less relevant. But it's part of declaration; but Factual_Basis_of_Case likely requires factual basis of case, not declarant's competency. So we may skip that.\n\nBetter to include the facts that support the case: the contract cancellations, etc.\n\nWe need to provide evidence snippet that includes the fact.\n\nWe need to include location: for each, we can give page number or token offset. We can approximate with page numbers: Declaration has 5 pages. We can mention page number in location.\n\nGiven the length, we can extract key facts from pages 2-5. Provide evidence.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with many entries.\n\nWe must ensure we don't exceed token limit? Each entry small.\n\nLet's prepare append_checklist patch.\n\nWe will add entries in one call. Provide patch with key \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" and extracted list.\n\nLet's craft entries.\n\nExample entry:\n\n{\n  \"value\": \"Abigail Doe was placed on administrative leave on March 21, 2025.\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Until I was placed on administrative leave on March 21, 2025, I worked in the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE)...\",\n      \"source_document\": \"Declaration of Abigail Doe\",\n      \"location\": \"Page 2\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nWe need to list all facts. Let's list 20 facts.\n\nWe need to keep within limit. Provide each as separate extracted entry.\n\nLet's list:\n\n1. Abigail Doe was placed on administrative leave on March 21, 2025.\n2. She worked at NCEE until that leave.\n3. She is familiar with the REL program and What Works Clearinghouse.\n4. The REL program was created by 20 U.S.C. § 9564 and has ten RELs.\n5. RELs provide applied research, training, technical assistance, and dissemination to state/local education departments.\n6. REL services are provided through five-year contracts; a separate contract provides peer review.\n7. Topics of REL research are dictated by local partners.\n8. On February 10, 2025, Abigail attended an emergency meeting where she was told all contracts were being canceled by DOGE except REL contracts.\n9. No copies of termination notices were provided.\n10. On February 13, a colleague received an email from Contracts and Acquisitions Management stating the REL contract was being canceled after all.\n11. A press release on February 13 stated REL contracts were canceled as “woke spending.”\n12. The emergency meeting said REL contracts would not be terminated but would be recompeted.\n13. Contracts were canceled without a new bidding process; statutorily mandated work was halted.\n14. Nine of ten RELs had completed toolkits and were conducting efficacy studies when contracts were canceled.\n15. The efficacy studies would never be completed.\n16. The toolkits may never be released; data may not be released; uncertain impact on student outcomes.\n17. Staff were working on three practice guides; two had not been peer-reviewed; the peer review contract was canceled.\n18. IES leadership attempted internal peer reviews, but staff received RIF notices and stopped as of March 21.\n19. No one was tasked with re-establishing the REL program.\n20.

We already did earlier: we found 1 match. That might be the only \"FACTS\" header. So we may need to read all around that header. We already read 1700-5000 which likely includes that. But maybe there are more fact sections later. Maybe \"FACTS\" appears again. We can search for \"FACTS\" again.\n\nBetter to search for \"FACTS\" pattern again in First Amended Complaint. Use search_document_regex on that doc.\n\nWe could also search for \"In 2002\" etc. But we want all facts. Likely the Complaint contains all facts.\n\nGiven time, we should read remaining ranges of First Amended Complaint to capture any facts not already extracted. But we have 32 values, maybe many. But there could be more. Let's search for \"facts\" in the remaining ranges.\n\nSearch for \"facts\" in the unvisited ranges of First Amended Complaint.\n\nAlso we may need to read Second Amended Complaint.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on First Amended Complaint for \"FACTS\" again.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"pattern\":\"FACTS\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "pattern": "FACTS", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13087, "completion_tokens": 687, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

All keys? There is only one key. It's complete? We must confirm that we have all relevant facts. There may be more facts in remaining partially visited documents (First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiff's Motion). The current extraction says 32 values. But maybe there are more facts in other documents. The rule: extract all distinct values that directly match the definition of Factual_Basis_of_Case. The definition says facts or evidence upon which the case is built: details of events, evidence, background. So it includes statements in Complaint and in Declaration of Abigail Doe, etc. We should check if other documents contain facts relevant to the case. Likely other complaints contain facts too, but we may have not fully extracted them. In Step 18, they appended 12 values from Complaint. Those 12 are presumably from Complaint (maybe the first 12?). The Declaration had 20 values. But there may be facts in other complaints (First Amended, Second Amended). We need to read those to capture additional facts. Since we have not fully visited those documents, there may be more Factual_Basis_of_Case items. The current status says 1/1 keys with values, but we need to verify completeness. The instruction: \"Stop only when every key is either complete: all relevant values present.\" We need to be sure we captured all facts across all documents. We haven't read all parts of the other complaints. The document catalog shows those are partially visited. So we should read the remaining token ranges to capture any additional facts. We need to identify which tokens remain unviewed in those documents. For First Amended Complaint: viewed 1700-5000, 8089-8289, 11345-11545, 11608-11996. Not viewed: 0-1700, 5000-8089, 8289-11345, 11996-end (14,528 tokens total). So we still need to read those. But maybe the facts are only in the earlier parts. In the complaint, the \"FACTS\" section starts around token 1100? The search matched at 1799-1999. That likely covers facts. But we may need to read earlier tokens 0-1700 to verify if there are additional facts. Possibly the \"FACTS\" section is earlier. Let's read 0-1700 of First Amended Complaint. Also read 5000-8089, 8289-11345, 11996-end. But we may not need all; we can search for \"FACTS\" again to locate any other matches. We already saw matches only at 1799-1999. So maybe the rest of the complaint does not contain \"FACTS\" section. But other documents like Second Amended Complaint might also have facts. Let's search for \"FACTS\" again in second amended. We saw match at 1893-2093. So maybe only that section. So we need to read at least that section to capture facts. But we already read 1893-2093 (the match). But we might need to read more context around that to capture all facts. But we already read that section. For First Amended Complaint, we might need to read 1799-1999 to capture facts. But we might have partially read that. We have not read that range. Wait we read 1799-1999? Yes Step 17 read 1700-1900, and Step 14 read 1799-2199, Step 15 read 2200-5000, Step 9 read 1799-1999. So we have read the 1799-1999. So we have captured facts from that section.\n\nBut the \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" might also include facts from the Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiff's Motion. But those may not have facts; they might be procedural. But we should check.\n\nGiven the current extraction has 32 values, but perhaps incomplete because we didn't capture all facts in other documents. The safe approach: read remaining unviewed token ranges of First Amended Complaint to ensure we catch any missing facts. Also read Second Amended Complaint remaining ranges. Also read Docket (2239-2439 is visited; but maybe earlier tokens contain facts). Let's read 0-2239 of Docket. Also read remaining ranges of Memorandum Opinion not visited.\n\nBut we need to decide what to do next: we must choose a single action. The best immediate next step is to read another token range from an unvisited document to potentially find new facts. Since we have partially visited First Amended Complaint and Second Amended Complaint, we can read the first part of each. But we can only read 10k tokens per call. We could read First Amended Complaint 0-1700 (1700 tokens). That's within limit. That will let us capture any facts earlier. Then we can append any new facts found.\n\nBut we might also need to read Docket and Memorandum Opinion. But maybe the facts are only in the complaints and declaration. The Docket may contain docket entries, not facts. So we could skip.\n\nLet's read First Amended Complaint 0-1700. That seems appropriate.\n\nWe will call read_document on First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (doc_name: \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\") tokens 0-1700.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":1700}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1700}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11788, "completion_tokens": 1201, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But maybe there are more facts in other documents (First Amended Complaint, Second, etc). So we need to continue reading those to extract all facts. The Factual_Basis_of_Case key likely includes all facts across all documents. We have 32 values from Complaint and Declaration. We need to extract more from First Amended Complaint and Second and maybe Docket, etc.\n\nThus next action: read more of First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief beyond token 5000. We have visited 0-5000, 8089-8289, 11345-11545, 11608-11996. We need to cover rest maybe 0-1700 already visited? Wait 0-1700 visited? The First Amended Complaint tokens 0-1700 are partially visited? Actually the first read was 0-1700, so that is visited. We have 0-5000 visited. So remaining unvisited ranges: 5000-8089, 8289-11345, 11545-11608, 11996-14528.\n\nAlso partially visited ranges of Second Amended Complaint: 1893-2093 visited, 5628-5828, 7083-7283, 9748-10145.

The snapshot shows 32 values. The system says keys with extracted values: 32 values (12 from Complaint, 20 from Declaration). But Declaration of Abigail Doe is a declaration, not a complaint; maybe Factual_Basis includes facts from any document. The question: Are there more facts in other documents? Possibly in the First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, etc. The current extracted list may not include facts from those. The system says 32 values extracted, but we need to verify if all facts present. The snapshot: The \"First Amended Complaint\" is partially visited. We haven't extracted facts from it. The \"Second Amended Complaint\" partially visited. The \"Docket\" partially visited. The \"Memorandum Opinion\" partially visited. The \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" unvisited.\n\nThe Factual_Basis likely includes facts from pleadings (complaints, amended complaints, declarations). The system seems to have extracted facts from the Complaint and Declaration. But there are also facts in the amended complaints. The earlier append actions added 12 values from Complaint and 20 from Declaration. But not from the Amended Complaints. So we need to extract facts from First Amended Complaint and Second Amended Complaint. Also maybe from Declaration? Already done. Also maybe from Docket? Dockets rarely contain facts. Memorandum Opinion may contain analysis but may not contain factual basis. But could include facts. But likely not required.\n\nThus we need to read the First Amended Complaint to extract the facts. The partial coverage shows tokens 0-8289, 11345-11545, 11608-11996. But maybe we need to read the \"FACTS\" section. We saw earlier search results: \"FACTS\" match at tokens 1799-1999. We have read those tokens? We read 0-1700 earlier, tokens 1799-1999? Step 23 read 0-1700. Did we read 1799-1999? Step 9 read 1799-1999. Step 14 read 1799-2199. Step 15 read 2200-5000. So we have read 1799-5000. That likely includes the FACTS section. But maybe we didn't parse all facts? The earlier append had 20 values from Declaration; 12 from Complaint. Perhaps we need to extract facts from First Amended Complaint, maybe more than 12. But we haven't appended these yet. So we need to read the First Amended Complaint's FACTS section fully, identify facts. The section likely contains a list of facts. There's a heading \"FACTS\" at the beginning of the complaint. We need to extract each distinct fact. The earlier append of 12 values likely derived from the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. But the First Amended Complaint likely has its own facts. So we need to extract.\n\nLet's open the document again maybe from tokens 2000-4000 to see the FACTS section. We need to read a new window. Let's read from tokens 2000-4000 of First Amended Complaint. But we need to ensure we don't re-read tokens already visited. We have visited 0-1700, 1799-1999, 2200-5000, so we have tokens up to 5000. Actually we have read 0-1700, 1799-1999, 2200-5000. So tokens 1700-1799 not read? We didn't read tokens 1700-1799. But likely trivial. But we need to read 2000-4000. We have read 2200-5000, so 2000-2100 maybe not read. But we can read 2000-2500. Let's read 2000-4000. But we have 2200-5000 read, which includes 2000-5000? Wait 2200-5000 includes 2000-2200? No; 2200-5000 starts at 2200. So 2000-2199 not read. So read 2000-4000 to capture the \"FACTS\" section. Let's do that.\n\nWe need to read tokens 2000-4000. That should be within 10k limit.

The prior steps read parts of First Amended Complaint up to token 8289, 11345-11545, 11608-11996. That covers some. But the Factual_Basis_of_Case might include facts from after 11996? We haven't read beyond 11996 for First Amended Complaint. Also missing from Second Amended Complaint, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Motion. Thus need more reading.\n\nWe need to append more facts.

We have partially visited first amended complaint, second amended complaint, docket, memorandum opinion, motion. Maybe they contain more facts. But the Factual_Basis_of_Case is about facts of case. The complaint and declaration likely contain the main facts; other documents may not add new factual basis beyond those already captured.

The question: do we need to ensure we captured all distinct values? The function get_checklist shows 32 values. That matches. But maybe we haven't captured facts from other documents that might be relevant. But if the earlier steps appended 12 and 20, maybe those are all from complaint and declaration.

It says keys with values: 32 values (12 from Complaint, 20 from Declaration of Abigail Doe). The current status says Keys with Values: 1/1, empty 0, not applicable 0, total values 32. That means we already have extracted all 32 values? But maybe we still need to verify if any other documents have more facts? The documents list: we partially visited First Amended, Second Amended, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiff's Motion. The Factual_Basis_of_Case may also appear in those. The current extraction says 32 values. But maybe incomplete? We need to determine if all facts are captured. The snapshot shows 32 values extracted. But we haven't read Full First Amended Complaint; we only looked at some parts. There might be more facts not yet captured. But the system says 32 values extracted. But we need to confirm if there are more. We should search for \"FACTS\" again in remaining unvisited documents. Search regex \"FACTS\" in First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for remaining ranges not visited: we have 0-8289, 11345-11545, 11608-11996, 12000-14528. So unvisited ranges: 8289-11345, 11545-11608, 11996-12000. We could search there. Also Second Amended Complaint: only small portions visited; likely many facts. So we need to extract more facts from those documents. So we need to read more. Let's search for \"FACTS\" in second amended and other docs. Use search_document_regex on Second Amended Complaint and maybe Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiff's Motion. Let's call search_document_regex on those documents: doc_names: ['Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief', 'Docket', 'Memorandum Opinion', \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\"] pattern \"FACTS\". That will give matches and context, then we can read those parts. So next action: search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"Docket\",\"Memorandum Opinion\",\"Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\"],\"pattern\":\"FACTS\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "Docket", "Memorandum Opinion", "Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction"], "pattern": "FACTS", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9415, "completion_tokens": 524, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
