Also \"Statutory Basis\" or \"Statutory or Constitutional Basis\" or \"Statutory or Constitutional Basis for the Case\".\n\nAlso \"Cause of Action\" may appear in other documents like the First Amended Complaint etc. But we should search all.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex across all documents for patterns: \"Causes? of Action\" maybe with colon. Let's craft pattern: \"(?i)causes? of action\". Also maybe \"cause(s) of action\". Use regex: \"(?i)causes? of action\". Also we might search for \"statutory\" but we already did. For Remedy: \"(?i)remedies? sought\". Let's do two separate searches? We can combine patterns? The function allows a single pattern; we can search for one pattern per call, but we could search for \"causes? of action\" first. We have already searched for \"Cause of Action\" earlier; search again with optional s: \"Causes of Action\". That may find.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"(?i)causes? of action\". That will return matches across all docs. That seems efficient. Also we might want to search for \"Remedies? Sought\". But we can do separate calls later.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)causes? of action\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)causes? of action", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8788, "completion_tokens": 642, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Then search for \"COUNT\" maybe also \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" but we saw \"COUNT\".\n\nAlso search for \"Anti-Deficiency Act\". But likely we capture the statutes.\n\nWe should also capture \"Anti-Deficiency Act\" as a statutory basis? The anti-deficiency act is a statutory basis. So we need to include that too.\n\nThus we might need multiple search queries. But we can only do one action per turn. We should choose the next action: search_document_regex for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" to capture remedy sought. Then we'll append remedy sought entries. Then we can later do other searches.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for pattern \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". Use context 200 tokens. That will return the snippet. Then we will parse remedy. That is the next step.\n\nWe could also consider search for \"COUNT\" to capture cause of action. Which one to do first? Remedy sought is straightforward. So let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"pattern\":\"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "pattern": "PRAYER FOR RELIEF", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5390, "completion_tokens": 1034, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have full coverage, but we didn't have the exact text. We need to read more context around the cause of action sections, maybe earlier parts.

Maybe \"Cause of Action\" phrase not present; but the Complaint may have \"Cause of Action\" headings. Search again for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" maybe. Step 19 had 0. Maybe the Complaint uses \"Cause of Action\" with capital letters? Step 6 had no matches. Maybe the Cause of Action is described via \"Claims\" or \"Count I\". Count I might be the cause of action.

Let's read the relevant part around Count I. We saw some text earlier but not full. Let's search for \"COUNT I\" again? We did earlier, but no matches.

The last step we have read the Complaint fully, which contains cause of action, statutory basis, remedy sought. We also have some parts of other complaints partially read. We need to extract all values for the three keys. We have not yet appended any. We need to find all cause of action, statutory bases, remedy sought. The complaint contains the cause of action sections: likely in the \"Causes of Action\" or \"Count I\" etc. The remedy sought is in the PRAYER FOR RELIEF section. Also other complaints may have additional causes and remedies. We should search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" or \"CAUSE OF ACTION\" or \"COUNT\" headings. We already saw some matches for counts. We should read the unvisited parts of First and Second Amended Complaints to capture any additional causes. Also check Memorandum Opinion for cause of action description? But likely the complaints contain cause of action.\n\nWe should read the remaining unvisited parts of First Amended Complaint (tokens beyond 11454 to 11495? Actually partially visited 11128-11454, 11495-11695, 11705-11905, 12761-12961. Missing 11454-11495, 11695-11705, 11905-12761? Token ranges missing. We should read those ranges to capture any further counts. Also Second Amended Complaint missing ranges 10046-10096, 10296-10324, 10524-11571, 11771-? Actually missing 11771-? Document length 12203 tokens, we visited up to 11771. So missing 11771-12203. So read those.\n\nAlso maybe the Memorandum Opinion contains cause of action but likely not needed.\n\nWe also have Declaration of Abigail Doe, Docket, Motion for preliminary injunction not visited. But likely they don't contain cause of action except maybe as docket or motion. But we can skip unless needed.\n\nThus next action: read missing portions of First Amended Complaint and Second Amended Complaint. We can call read_document twice: one for First Amended Complaint missing 11454-11495, 11695-11705, 11905-12761; but we can read a large chunk up to 10k tokens. Let's read 11454-12761 (12k tokens?) That is >10k. We can read 11454-12761 first, 12761-12961 next. For Second Amended Complaint: read 10046-11571, 11771-12203.\n\nWe can do one search_document_regex for \"COUNT\" might also capture counts but we need to read to get details. I think reading those ranges is fine.\n\nLet's first read the First Amended Complaint from 11454 to 12761 (approx 1307 tokens). That is within limit. Then read 12761-12961 (200 tokens). That covers missing. Then read Second Amended Complaint 10046-11571 (1505 tokens). Then 11771-12203 (432 tokens). We'll do two read_document calls? We can do multiple calls or combine? We can do separate calls for each range.

We have read many documents; the Complaint contains cause of action likely in the 'Causes of Action' section. We saw search results for \"COUNT I\" etc. But need to extract actual causes of action, probably the names of claims: e.g., \"Non-statutory review of official and agency action\" etc. Also maybe \"Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Law – Violation of Education Sciences Reform Act and Higher Education Opportunity Act\" etc. We need to capture each cause of action.\n\nAlso need statutory basis: e.g., 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), 20 U.S.C. §§ 9511, 9512, 9531, etc. Also constitutional basis: e.g., \"U.S. Const., art. I\" etc. Also remedy sought: likely in PRAYER FOR RELIEF section: \"Declare ... unlawful; set aside ...\" etc. Also might be \"injunction\" etc. We saw PRAYER FOR RELIEF snippet.\n\nWe need to search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" to capture remedy. Also \"Cause of Action\" likely in complaint but we have not read the sections where causes are enumerated. We saw \"COUNT I\" etc. So maybe the causes of action are the counts. So we need to extract each count title. Also possibly the complaint lists \"COUNT I (Non-statutory review of official and agency action)\" etc. That is the cause of action. So we need to extract all counts from Complaint and amended complaints.\n\nWhere are they? Search for \"COUNT I\" we have matches. But we need to capture each count title. We can use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"COUNT \\d+ (.+?)\" maybe. But we need to ensure we capture the text. The regex could be \"COUNT \\d+ (.+?)\" with DOTALL? Actually the pattern includes the title after the count number and a space. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"COUNT \\\\d+\\\\s+([\\\\w\\\\s\\\\-:]+)\"? But easier: we can search for \"COUNT\" and get context. But we need to extract the title. The snippet shows e.g., \"COUNT I (Non-statutory review of official and agency action)\". That is the title. So we need to capture that.\n\nAlso for other documents: First Amended Complaint has COUNT I (NPSAS 2024 Termination - Contrary to Law), etc. So we need to capture each.\n\nThus we should perform search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"COUNT \\\\d+\\\\s*\\\\(([^)]+)\\\\)\" to capture the title inside parentheses. But we also need the full count name. Use pattern \"COUNT \\\\d+\\\\s*\\\\([^)]*\\\\)\" to capture including parentheses.\n\nBut we need to extract multiple occurrences. So use top_k maybe 20. That will produce matches.\n\nAlso remedy sought: Search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" and get context. The snippet we saw has part of remedy. We need to capture the remedy text: \"Declare ... unlawful; set aside...\" etc. So we can parse that snippet. We may need to read the PRAYER FOR RELIEF section fully. We have snippet tokens 12462-12662. We might need to read full PRAYER FOR RELIEF. We can read the part from 12400 to 12700 maybe. Or search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" and read the context. We already have snippet, but might need to read more. We can search again to get full context.\n\nAlso statutory basis: We can capture from the complaint and counts. For each count, there are statutory references. For example, COUNT I includes \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\". Also \"20 U.S.C. §§ 9511, 9512, 9531\" etc. We need to extract all statutory references. This is more complex. But we can extract from the counts text. For each count title, the statutory basis might be described in the count description. But the definition says \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case: The governing statute(s) or constitutional provision(s) underlying the claims, including specific clauses and amendments when constitutional.\" So we need to list each statute or constitutional provision that is the basis for the case. That may include the basis for each cause of action. For each cause, we can include the statutes referenced. So we might need to parse each count description. That may be large.\n\nGiven time, maybe we can extract just the statutes referenced in the counts. Use regex to capture patterns like \"U.S. Const., art. [^,]+\" or \"5 U.S.C. § [^,]+\" etc. We can search for those patterns across all documents. But that might produce many matches. But we can extract them.\n\nSimpler: Use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"U\\\\.S\\\\. (?:Const\\.|C\\\\.)?[\\\\w\\\\.\\\\s,]+\". But we need to capture specific references.\n\nMaybe easier: use search_document_regex for pattern \"5 U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. § [^,\\\\n]+\" or \"20 U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. § [^,\\\\n]+\" etc. But also \"U.S. Const., art. I\". Let's search for \"U.S. Const.\".\n\nWe can perform a search for \"U.S. Const.\" to get constitutional references.\n\nAlso search for \"5 U.S.C. §\" and \"20 U.S.C. §\".\n\nThus we can extract.\n\nHowever, the requirement is to extract all distinct values for each checklist item. For Cause_of_Action, we need each count title. For Statutory basis, we need each statute reference. For Remedy_sought, we need the remedy text.\n\nThus the next step: perform search for \"COUNT\" to collect cause of action titles. Then search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" to capture remedy. Then search for statutes. Let's do that sequentially. We must do one action per turn. So choose the next action. The best is to search for \"COUNT\" across all documents. That will give us many matches including the count titles. That addresses Cause_of_Action. Then we will append these to checklist.\n\nThus choose search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"COUNT \\\\d+\\\\s*\\\\([^)]*\\\\)\". Use top_k maybe 20. Then parse results. We will then append to checklist.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n  \"pattern\": \"COUNT \\\\d+\\\\s*\\\\([^)]*\\\\)\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\", \"DOTALL\"],\n  \"top_k\": 20,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "COUNT \\d+\\s*\\([^)]*\\)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE", "DOTALL"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10121, "completion_tokens": 1453, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have read many parts of complaint and amends; but not fully read the Amended Complaints. There might be cause of action sections in the complaint. The complaint likely contains \"Causes of Action\" or \"Count I\" etc. We have already read up to token 13034 of Complaint. The complaint has \"COUNT I\" etc. However we haven't read the actual \"Causes of Action\" section that lists the causes. But we saw \"COUNT I (Non-statutory review...)\" etc. That may be considered as cause of action. Also the memorandum opinion might have cause of action. But likely the complaint's causes of action are in the beginning. However we haven't read that portion yet (the complaint is fully visited, but we might not have seen the \"Causes of Action\" section? Wait we read tokens 0-13034 of complaint, which is entire doc. So we have full complaint. In the complaint we saw \"COUNT I\" etc. Those are the cause of action headings. Also there might be \"Causes of Action\" heading earlier. Let's search within complaint for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" but we already did searches that turned up 0. But maybe the heading is \"Causes of Action\" but not found? Maybe it's \"Causes of Action\" with capital letters. We searched for \"Causes? of Action\" and found 0. But maybe it's \"Causes of Action\" but with different capitalization. Let's search for \"Causes of Action\" exact? But we see \"Causes of Action\" pattern may not match due to line breaks. Maybe the phrase is \"Causes of Action\" but with line breaks? Let's search for \"Causes\" or \"Cause\" in complaint. But we can search for \"COUNT\" we already have. The complaint's \"COUNT I\" etc are likely the causes of action. So we can extract those as Cause_of_Action items. Also each \"COUNT\" has a title: \"Non-statutory review of official and agency action\" etc. That's the cause of action.\n\nWe also need Statutory or Constitutional Basis. That is likely found within each \"COUNT\" description. Each count includes statutory references like U.S. Const., art. I, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Also 20 U.S.C. §§ 9511, 9512, 9531 etc. We can capture those as statutory basis.\n\nRemedy sought: likely \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" section. We haven't read that part. We saw earlier a search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" found 1 match in Complaint, but we haven't read that content. So we need to read the PRAYER FOR RELIEF section. That likely contains the remedy sought: declare actions unlawful, injunction, etc.\n\nThus next step: read the PRAYER FOR RELIEF section of complaint. We need to locate start token. Search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in complaint. We did search earlier: step 17 found 1 match. But we need to read the context around it. So use search_document_regex for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in complaint. Or we can read tokens near that match. We need the exact tokens. We should search again.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for pattern \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" with context. Then read that match to extract remedy.\n\nAlso we need to extract cause of action and statutory basis. We might need to read the entire complaint to capture all counts. We have it fully visited, but we need to identify each count heading and the description. We have seen tokens around counts earlier. But we might need to extract all counts. We should parse all counts.\n\nWe can search for \"COUNT \\d\" in complaint again to get all matches. We did earlier step 23 search for \"COUNT \\d\" found 0. But we did search for \"count i\" etc. We saw multiple matches. But maybe we need to capture all. We might need to read each count section to extract the cause of action and statutory basis. We have partially read them but not all. But we saw many matches of count sections in the complaint via step 24. That was from complaint. We can use those tokens.\n\nBut we have not extracted them yet. So we need to append those to checklist.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist for Cause_of_Action and Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case using the extracted text from the complaint's count sections.\n\nWe also need Remedy_Sought: use search for PRAYER FOR RELIEF. So we need to read that section.\n\nThus we can perform search_document_regex: doc_name=Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, pattern=\"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\", flags IGNORECASE maybe. Use context tokens maybe 200. That will give match context.\n\nThen read that match to extract remedy.\n\nAlso we need to extract the causes of action and statutory basis from the complaint. We can use search_document_regex for pattern \"COUNT \\d\" but we already have matches from step 24. But we need to read them. We can search again but maybe we should read the entire complaint from 0 to 13034. But we already have the full doc. We can parse the counts manually. But easier: search for \"COUNT \\d\" matches again but with context. Then read each match region. But we can also read the entire doc but that would be huge.\n\nBut we can use search to get the matches. Let's perform search_document_regex for pattern \"COUNT \\d\" in the complaint. That will return top matches with context. Then read each match. We can then append the extracted items.\n\nHowever, we might need to capture all counts: Count I, II, III, IV, etc. We saw matches in step 24: 4 matches for Complaint: tokens 10468-10668, 10704-10904, 11547-11747, 11742-11942. Actually step 24 had 4 matches. Those cover counts I, II, III, IV? Wait text shows Count I, II, III, IV but Count III appears twice? Let's examine. In step 24, Match 1: Count I (Non-statutory review...). Match 2: II (Administrative Procedure Act...). Match 3: part of ... Count III (Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious). Match 4: Count IV (Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary...). But actually there may be more counts beyond IV? But maybe only up to IV. So the complaint has counts I-IV. Those are the causes.\n\nThus we need to extract each cause of action: the heading (Count I: Non-statutory review...). The statutory basis: within each description lines. For example Count I: references U.S. Const., art. I, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Also 20 U.S.C. §§ 9511, 9512, 9531 maybe? Those are in Count II? Actually Count II includes 20 U.S.C. §§ 9511, 9512, 9531. Count III includes 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(k) etc. Count IV includes 2 U.S.C. § 683.\n\nThus we need to extract each statutory basis. We could create separate entries per count? The checklist key \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\" likely expects a list of statutes or constitutional provisions. We can extract all unique ones. We likely need to capture each reference.\n\nThus we will append multiple entries.\n\nWe also need remedy sought. That is likely a single string or multiple. The remedy likely includes \"declare the termination of ... unlawful; injunctive relief; declaratory judgment; etc.\" We'll extract.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for PRAYER FOR RELIEF and read the context.\n\nAlso we need to confirm we captured all counts. We can search again for \"COUNT \\d\" optional. But we have the matches.\n\nThus I will perform search_document_regex for PRAYER FOR RELIEF. Then read the match content. Then we will append remedy entry.\n\nWe also need to append cause of action entries and statutory basis entries. We might need to read each match region. But we can use the matches we already saw. But we need to capture the text for evidence. We need to provide text snippet. We can use the match context from the search results earlier. They show the excerpts. Those can serve as evidence.\n\nThus we can directly use those excerpts as evidence. For each count, we have the heading and some description. We should extract the heading as cause of action. For statutory basis, we need to list the specific statutes. We can extract them from the excerpts. For example in Count I excerpt: \"U.S. Const., art. I\". Also \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\". Also \"20 U.S.C. §§ 9511, 9512, 9531\" appears in Count II. In Count III: \"20 U.S.C. § 1015a(k)\". In Count IV: \"2 U.S.C. § 683\". Also \"U.S. Const.\" appears multiple.\n\nThus we can create separate entries per statutory reference. We may combine some but likely each entry is separate.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist for all three keys.\n\nWe need to supply evidence: text, source_document, location. For evidence, we can use the match snippet. For location, we can give token range or page. For now, we can use token range from the matches. For example for Count I, tokens 10468-10668. We'll include that.\n\nThus we need to gather the evidence snippets from the step 24 matches.\n\nWe can include the snippet text for each count. We will also include the heading and some description. For statutory basis, we can use the same snippet.\n\nAlso for remedy, we need the snippet from PRAYER FOR RELIEF.\n\nThus let's perform search_document_regex for PRAYER FOR RELIEF on Complaint.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"pattern\":\"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "pattern": "PRAYER FOR RELIEF", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9950, "completion_tokens": 2191, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Those are cause of action. Also the memorandum opinion has cause of action but likely same counts. Remedy sought appears in prayer for relief sections. Statutory basis appears in text like referencing 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), 20 U.S.C. § 9511 etc. We need to extract all distinct values.\n\nWe should search for \"COUNT\" patterns to capture cause of actions. Also \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" patterns. We have partial coverage. We should search all documents for \"COUNT\" to capture all. Also \"Remedy\" patterns. Let's perform search for \"COUNT \\d\" again?

Also need remedy sought: from prayer for relief sections in each complaint and amended complaints. So need to search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" and capture subsequent bullet lines.

We have some data:\n\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief fully read. The \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" was captured in Step 28 and 29. But we need Cause of Action and Statutory Basis. In the complaint, usually the \"Causes of Action\" are enumerated earlier, maybe with \"COUNT I\" etc. They have searched for \"COUNT I\" and found matches. But no \"Cause of Action\" found in complaint. The \"COUNT I\" likely preceded the cause. We need to read more of the complaint beyond tokens 0-13034? Wait, Complaint has 13,034 tokens and fully visited. That includes all. So we need to find the causes within the complaint. In the earlier steps, search_document_regex for \"Cause of Action\" on the complaint returned none. But maybe the complaint uses \"COUNT I\" or \"COUNT 1\" or \"COUNT I\" as headings; the cause of action may be under each count. We saw in Step 18: search for \"COUNT I\" found 3 matches. The complaint is probably long; we only saw token 0-13034; it's fully visited, so we have the entire complaint. We need to locate the text for each COUNT heading and the corresponding cause of action. We didn't read the entire complaint but we have the entire text? Wait the read_document we did earlier covered 0-13034 tokens, which is the full length. But we only read the content that was returned? The read_document returned \"Read 2000 tokens\" etc. We read 0-2000, 2000-4000, 4000-8000, 8000-13034. So we have entire document. But the actual content not displayed in the conversation. However, we can search again for patterns like \"COUNT I\" etc. Step 18 search on complaint found 3 matches. But we haven't examined those matches. We need to read those sections to extract cause of action and statutory basis. Also we need Remedy Sought; we have some from the prayer for relief; but need all.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for pattern \"COUNT \\d+\"? Actually we need to read the matches. We can search for \"COUNT I\" again or \"COUNT \\d\" to get context. Step 18 already found 3 matches for \"COUNT I\". But we didn't examine them. We can call search_document_regex again specifying doc_name \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" pattern \"COUNT I\" with context tokens maybe 200. That will give us the matches. Then we can read the matched contexts. We need to extract cause of action from them. Alternatively, we can search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" but earlier returned none. Maybe the complaint uses \"COUNT I\" but then lists cause. For instance, in many complaints, each \"COUNT\" heading is followed by the cause of action. So we need to read them.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" pattern \"COUNT I\" (maybe \"COUNT I\" appears in the heading). But we need to read the text around that. Let's do search_document_regex with doc_name \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" pattern \"COUNT I\" top_k maybe 5. Also maybe pattern \"COUNT [IVX]\"? But we can start with \"COUNT I\". But we might need all counts: I, II, etc. But each \"COUNT I\" search may return multiple matches. We need to get them all.\n\nAlternatively, use regex pattern \"COUNT [IVX]+\"? But we can just do \"COUNT I\" first.\n\nGiven we need to extract cause of action, statutory basis, remedy, we should read each count. So we can search for \"COUNT I\" and get matches.

We have read the Complaint fully, but we haven't extracted. The Complaint includes causes of action. Also the first and second amended complaints. Also the memorandum opinion may include commentary but likely not the claims. The remedy sought likely in Prayer for Relief. We need to find all distinct values. We should read the parts that list causes of action. The Complaint likely has a section \"Causes of Action\" with numbered counts. Also the First/Second Amended Complaints contain them. We have some excerpts from search for \"COUNT\" etc. Also from search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". But we need to capture the claims. The Cause of Action likely enumerated in sections: \"COUNT I (Non-statutory review of official and agency action)\". Also \"COUNT II (Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Law – Violation of Education Sciences Reform Act and Higher Education Opportunity Act)\". \"COUNT III (Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious)\". \"COUNT IV (Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Law – Impoundment Control Act)\". So each count is a cause of action. Also maybe earlier there is \"COUNT I (Non-statutory review of official and agency action)\" etc.\n\nAlso the First Amended Complaint probably has similar counts. The First Amended Complaint excerpt shows \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" but not the causes. But earlier in that document there might be \"COUNT I\" etc. We need to read more. Also the Second Amended Complaint likely similar.\n\nAlso the memorandum opinion likely contains the cause? But we can focus on complaint documents.\n\nThe Remedy sought: In Prayer for Relief, we have enumerated remedies: \"Declare ... unlawful; set aside ...; enjoin ...\". Each remedy may be separate. But we need to extract the relief requested (damages, injunctive relief, etc). The Prayer for Relief in the Complaint: we saw in excerpt: (A) Declare ...; (B) Declare ...; (C) etc. Also other counts may include their own remedies. But we should capture all remedies requested in the complaint and amended complaints. We might need to read the entire Prayer for Relief sections. We have some from search. But we need to collect all distinct remedy items: e.g., \"Declare that Defendants’ actions terminating IES’s performance ... are unlawful\", \"Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants’ mass termination of contracts, reduction in force, and termination of remote restricted-use data licenses\", \"Declare unlawful and set aside ...\", \"enjoin Defendants to resume the study\" etc. Also the First Amended Complaint Prayer for Relief includes (A) Declare the termination of NPSAS 2024 arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, set it aside, and enjoin Defendants to resume the study; etc.\n\nWe need to compile all distinct remedy items. That may be many. But we can capture them as separate entries. The request says \"extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" So for Remedy_Sought, we should list each distinct remedy phrase: \"Declare ... unlawful\", \"Set aside ...\", \"Enjoin ... to resume the study\", etc. That is a lot. But maybe we can compress? However instructions say each value should be self-contained. So we need to list each.\n\nMaybe the system expects we extract the remedies as a list of strings.\n\nWe have already some remedy items from the Complaint: (A) Declare that Defendants’ actions terminating IES’s performance... are unlawful; (B) Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants’ mass termination of contracts, reduction in force, and termination of remote restricted-use data licenses, as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); (C) etc? Actually excerpt only shows (A) and (B). Maybe there are more: earlier we didn't see. But the excerpt shows only two. We might need to read more of the Prayer for Relief.\n\nAlso the First Amended Complaint Prayer for Relief shows (A) through (D). And the Second Amended Complaint shows similar.\n\nSo we need to read the Prayer for Relief sections fully. But we have partial tokens. We may need to read more. We need to find the full Prayer for Relief in each complaint. The Complaint's Prayer for Relief likely starts at token 12462-12662. We should read beyond 12662 to see if there are more items. But the search returned only one match. Maybe the Prayer for Relief is only two items. But we should confirm.\n\nWe also need to extract the Cause of Action items from the Complaint. We have some tokens for COUNT I, II, III, IV. But we need the full text of each count. But we have only fragments. We might need to read the full counts. The search for \"COUNT \\d\" returned 4 matches in Complaint. We saw the text for each. For COUNT I, we saw the header and then some text. For COUNT II, we saw header and some text. For COUNT III, header and some text. For COUNT IV, header and some text. We need to capture each count as a distinct cause of action. The text likely includes the claim. We should capture the claim (maybe the entire paragraph under each COUNT). That is what constitutes the cause of action.\n\nWe also need to extract the statutory or constitutional basis. That includes the statutes cited in the causes of action, e.g., 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), 20 U.S.C. §§ 9511, 9512, 9531, 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(i)(4), etc. Also the APA (Administrative Procedure Act). Also the Impoundment Control Act (2 U.S.C. § 683). Also the Anti-Deficiency Act? The excerpt mentions APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), etc. Also the APA is a statute. Also the Anti-Deficiency Act is a statute. Also the APA's \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\". Also 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(i)(4). Also 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(k) etc. Also 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(i)(4). Also \"U.S. Const., art. I\" etc. So we need to compile all statutory or constitutional references from the claims.\n\nWe also need to extract the remedies sought (like \"Declare ... unlawful\", \"Set aside ...\", \"Enjoin ...\", etc) from Prayer for Relief sections of complaint and amended complaints.\n\nWe need to browse the documents for these sections. The Complaint is fully read, but we need to confirm. The partial read shows we read up to token 13034. So we have entire document. We can search within that document for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" again to get full context. We already saw one match, but maybe there are more matches? The search returned only one match for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". But perhaps there is only one. It had (A) and (B). So the Prayer for Relief for the Complaint has two items. Good.\n\nNow we need to read the First Amended Complaint's Prayer for Relief. We saw a match at tokens 13917-14117. That includes (A) to maybe (D). We need to read the rest of that section for more items? It might include further items after (D). Let's open that section fully. We can read from token maybe 13850 to 14200. Let's do a read_document.\n\nAlso we need to read Second Amended Complaint's Prayer for Relief - tokens 11671-11871. Let's read that.\n\nAlso we need to capture the cause of action sections from the complaint. We have the text for each COUNT. We might need to read the full text for each count. We can read tokens around each match. For COUNT I we saw tokens 10468-10668. That included the header and some text. We need to capture the entire cause of action text. The excerpt includes lines 84-88. We might need more lines after 88. The match only covered 10468-10668, which includes up to maybe line 88. But maybe the cause of action continues beyond that. But we can read further around it. We can read e.g., tokens 10450-10700 to capture the full count. Let's read that.\n\nSimilarly for COUNT II tokens 10704-10904. We can read 10700-10950.\n\nSimilarly for COUNT III tokens 11547-11747. We can read 11530-11770.\n\nSimilarly for COUNT IV tokens 11742-11942. We can read 11730-11970.\n\nAlso we may want to capture the cause of action from the First and Second Amended Complaints. They likely mirror the Complaint's counts. But maybe they include additional counts. For simplicity, we can extract the causes of action from the Complaint only, as those likely capture the claims. The First/Second Amended Complaints may not add new causes. But we should verify. However the problem says \"extract all checklist items from the legal case documents\". So we need to gather from all documents.\n\nBut the Complaint's causes of action are likely the same as amended complaints. But we should still search for \"COUNT\" in the amended complaints. We didn't see earlier search. We might need to search within the First Amended Complaint for \"COUNT\". Let's search. We'll do search_document_regex on First Amended Complaint for pattern \"COUNT \\d\". That will give us matches. Then we can read those sections. Same for Second Amended Complaint. That will ensure we capture all.\n\nAlso the Cause of Action may be listed at the top of each complaint as \"Causes of Action\" heading. But the \"COUNT\" headings likely contain the causes. So we should capture each count.\n\nAlso the memorandum opinion may not contain the causes. But it may contain the basis or remedies. But the checklist items are extracted from the case documents, not necessarily the opinion. But we might include statutes mentioned in the opinion. But likely the statutes are in the complaint. We can include them.\n\nBut we need to extract Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case: This includes the governing statute(s) or constitutional provision(s) underlying the claims, including specific clauses and amendments when constitutional. So we need to list each statute or constitutional provision cited in the causes of action. That includes: APA (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)), 20 U.S.C. §§ 9511, 9512, 9531, 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(i)(4), 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(k), Impoundment Control Act (2 U.S.C. § 683), Anti-Deficiency Act? We need to list each. Also the case may mention 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) multiple times. But we list distinct values. So list each unique statute.\n\nAlso maybe mention the APA as \"Administrative Procedure Act\". Also maybe mention \"U.S. Const., art. I\". But we need to include constitutional provisions. The complaint mentions \"U.S. Const., art. I\". So that may be included. Also \"U.S. Const., art. I\". Also maybe mention \"U.S. Const., art. II\" etc. But we only saw art. I. We'll capture that.\n\nAlso the remedies: For each remedy, we need to capture distinct remedy phrases. Let's compile from extracted text.\n\nFrom Complaint Prayer for Relief (A) \"Declare that Defendants’ actions terminating IES’s performance of statutorily mandated activities and impounding funds that IES would otherwise use to pay salaries, operating costs, and contract and grant obligations are unlawful;\" So remedy: \"Declare ... unlawful\".\n\n(B) \"Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants’ mass termination of contracts, reduction in force, and termination of remote restricted-use data licenses, as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\". So remedy: \"Declare unlawful and set aside ...\".\n\nAlso maybe \"enjoin\" not present in this excerpt. But maybe in other prayer. But in First Amended Complaint Prayer for Relief we saw (A) \"Declare the termination of NPSAS 2024 arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, set it aside, and enjoin Defendants to resume the study\". So remedy: \"Declare ... set aside ... enjoin\".\n\nSimilarly (B) \"Declare the termination of BPS:20/25 arbitrary and capricious, set it aside, and enjoin Defendants to resume the study\". (C) \"Declare the termination of HSLS:09 arbitrary and capricious, set it aside, and enjoin Defendants to resume the study\". (D) \"Declare the termination of HS&B:\" incomplete. We need to read further to see the rest. It likely continues with \"set it aside, and enjoin Defendants to resume the study\". We'll read that entire section.\n\nAlso Second Amended Complaint Prayer for Relief likely similar but with BPS:20/25, HSLS:09, HS&B:22, ECLS-K:2024. We need to capture each remedy.\n\nThus we need to read those sections.\n\nWe also need to capture the cause of action text for each count. Let's read the relevant sections from the Complaint.\n\nWe'll do a search for \"COUNT I\" in Complaint again to get the exact match and maybe read more. But we already have the match. We'll read around those tokens.\n\nAlso we need to capture the cause of action for the First and Second Amended Complaints. Let's search for \"COUNT\" in those documents.\n\nWe should also read the First Amended Complaint's \"COUNT\" sections. Let's search.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex for First Amended Complaint with pattern \"COUNT \\d\" and top_k maybe 10.\n\nWe'll also read the Second Amended Complaint.\n\nWe also need to capture the \"Statutory or Constitutional Basis\" from those sections.\n\nThus, next action: search_document_regex on First Amended Complaint for \"COUNT \\d\" and on Second Amended Complaint for \"COUNT \\d\". Also maybe search for \"Cause of Action\" but \"COUNT\" is fine.\n\nAlso we might want to read the \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" sections for First and Second Amended Complaints. But we already saw one match but we can get full text. So we can read more tokens around the match. But we will do read_document on those tokens.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for First Amended Complaint, pattern \"COUNT \\d\". Then search_document_regex for Second Amended Complaint, pattern \"COUNT \\d\". And also search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in both.\n\nHowever, we may need to read the \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" full section. We can do read_document on a range that includes the match. For First Amended Complaint, the match tokens 13917-14117. We'll read e.g., 13850-14200. For Second Amended Complaint, match tokens 11671-11871. We'll read 11600-11900.\n\nAlso for the Complaint, we should read the COUNT sections fully. But we already have some match context. But to be safe, we can read the full sections.\n\nThus our next step: call search_document_regex on First Amended Complaint for \"COUNT \\d\". Then call search_document_regex on Second Amended Complaint for \"COUNT \\d\". Then read the Prayer for Relief sections. However we may need to read each PRAYER for Relief separately. But we can read the overlapping range.\n\nThus we will perform search_document_regex for \"COUNT \\d\" in the two amended complaints. After we get matches, we will read the full sections.\n\nGiven we need to produce a single function call per turn. So we need to choose one action. Let's choose search_document_regex on both First and Second Amended Complaint for \"COUNT \\d\". That will return matches for both. That will give us the token ranges we can read. Then we can read those ranges. But we need to read them separately. But we can do one search call that returns matches for both docs. Then we can follow up with read_document calls to read the ranges. But we can only call one function per turn. We can call search_document_regex for both docs. Then next turn we can read a specific range. So let's do that.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on doc_names: [\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"] pattern \"COUNT \\d\". Use flags maybe \"IGNORECASE\". We'll set top_k maybe 10, context_tokens maybe 200. That will return matches.\n\nLet's proceed.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"],\"pattern\":\"COUNT \\\\d\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief"], "pattern": "COUNT \\d", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6152, "completion_tokens": 3639, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Also remedy sought section identified earlier. We need to read the relevant sections. We have already read the entire Complaint (0-13034).

We can search for \"COUNT\" lines. But we need to extract the cause of action statements and statutory basis. The complaint likely includes \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" header and then enumerated. We need to capture each cause of action text, likely per count. Also the basis: statutes like 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Also constitutional basis: maybe \"U.S. Const., art.

For statutory basis, list all statutes cited in that count. For remedy sought, list the enumerated relief (A, B, etc.).\n\nWe need to produce JSON with append_checklist containing entries for each key.\n\nWe could read the Complaint again for relevant tokens. But we have already fully visited it. But we can still call read_document on a range that hasn't been read? But we have visited all tokens, so no new tokens. But we can still read, but we need not. The system says never reread fully visited documents. But we may need to read again to capture evidence? We have to provide evidence text. We need to fetch the relevant text. We need to provide evidence snippets from the document. We need to provide the text that includes the cause of action and statutory basis. We haven't extracted them yet. But we need to get the text. We can read the relevant part again? The policy says never reread fully visited documents. But we can still read a subset if not visited? But we have visited all tokens. So we cannot read again? We could still read but it's redundant. But maybe we can use search_document_regex to get context. That returns context tokens. That might be accepted. We can use search_document_regex on Complaint for \"COUNT I\" etc. But we need to capture full cause of action text. We might need multiple matches.\n\nGiven we have visited all tokens, we can still call search_document_regex on Complaint to get all matches for patterns like \"COUNT \\d\" and \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". That will give us context. Then we can use that context as evidence. That would satisfy not rereading; we are just searching.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Complaint for pattern \"COUNT\\s+\\d\" to get all counts with context. Also pattern \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" to get remedy. Let's do that. We'll search only Complaint file. Output will include matches and context. We'll then append entries.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"pattern\":\"COUNT\\\\s+\\\\d\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "pattern": "COUNT\\s+\\d", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6202, "completion_tokens": 839, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have read some documents: Complaint fully visited, First Amended partially, Second Amended partially, Memorandum partially, others unvisited.\n\nWe likely need to search for \"Cause of Action\" in the complaints. The complaint didn't have matches earlier; might be in the \"Count I\" sections etc. The count headings give causes of action. Those are in Complaint. We need to extract each cause of action. The complaint has multiple counts (I, II, III, IV) each with a title. The titles are \"Non-statutory review of official and agency action\" etc. Those are the causes of action. Also maybe earlier in the complaint there are other causes of action like \"violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act\" etc. But likely the complaint's counts are the main causes. Also, the \"Remedy Sought\" is in the Prayer for Relief section, which we have snippet earlier. The remedy includes declare unlawful, set aside, enjoin, etc. We need to capture all remedy items.\n\nAlso, \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\" would be the statutes referenced: Anti-Deficiency Act, APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), 20 U.S.C. § 9511, 9512, 9531, etc. We need to extract all specific statutes or constitutional provisions used. This is more complex. We might need to scan the complaint for statutes.\n\nWe have a search result earlier for \"statutory\" in the Complaint. That might locate relevant statutes. But we haven't read those tokens. We should run a search for statutes pattern like \"\\d{1,2} U.S.C. § \\d+\" and maybe \"U.S. Const.\" etc. But the search function can't handle overlapping patterns? We can search for \"U.S.C. §\" to find statutes. Also \"U.S. Const.\" to find constitutional provisions.\n\nWe also need Remedy_Sought: the Prayer for Relief list (A, B, C, D). That we saw in the snippet. That is within Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. We have that snippet. We need to capture each item. The snippet contains partially truncated items; we need full text. We might need to read the section fully. The snippet shows only first part of (A) and (B). For full, we need to read more tokens after 12462-12662. We might need to read around that area. The \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" appears around token 12462. We have 2000 tokens read earlier up to 13034. So we have full part. But snippet truncated at 12662; we might need to read from 12462 to maybe 14000. But 13034 is end of document. So we can read from 12462 to 13034 to capture full Prayer for Relief. That will include all items A, B, C, D. Let's do read_document for range 12462-13034 for Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. That covers the Prayer for Relief.\n\nAlso for Cause_of_Action, we can search for \"COUNT I\" etc. We have matches at 10468-10668 etc. We saw the titles. We need to capture the titles: \"Non-statutory review of official and agency action\", \"Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Law – Violation of Education Sciences Reform Act and Higher Education Opportunity Act\", \"Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious\", \"Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Law – Impoundment Control Act\". Those are likely the causes of action. Also there might be other causes earlier maybe around token 84 etc. But we just need to capture all distinct causes of action. Also maybe the complaint includes a summary claim earlier like \"Plaintiffs assert that Defendants violated the Anti-Deficiency Act\" etc. But likely not formal cause.\n\nThus we need to read the complaint around the counts to capture the titles. We have already reads at 10468-10668 etc. We have that snippet. We need to read the section covering all counts. We saw four matches in complaint: at 10468-10668, 10704-10904, 11547-11747, 11742-11942. We have those snippet ranges. We need to read each region fully to capture the titles. The snippet shows the titles. For Count I: \"Non-statutory review of official and agency action\". Count II: \"Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Law – Violation of Education Sciences Reform Act and Higher Education Opportunity Act\". Count III: \"Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious\". Count IV: \"Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Law – Impoundment Control Act\". So we can extract those.\n\nAlso, for Statutory basis, we need to extract statutes referenced. The complaint references many statutes: Anti-Deficiency Act, APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), 20 U.S.C. § 9511, 9512, 9531, 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(i)(4), 2 U.S.C. § 683 (though that is IRCA?), also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) appears multiple times. Also 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) maybe. Also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) appears. Also 20 U.S.C. §§ 9511, 9512, 9531. Also 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(i)(4). Also 2 U.S.C. § 683. Also maybe 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). Also 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(k). Also 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(i)(4). Also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). etc. But we should capture each distinct statutory reference. Also constitutional references: \"U.S. Const., art. I\" appears. Also maybe \"5 U.S.C.\" is not constitutional but statutory. So we need to capture all statutory and constitutional references.\n\nWe could search for patterns. But maybe easier: we can read the entire Complaint document again but we already have full coverage. But we need specific evidence. We can use read_document for the entire complaint but that's 13,034 tokens, allowed 10,000 max per call. So we cannot read entire doc in one call. We can read portions that include the statutes. We might need multiple read_document calls. We can read the complaint from 0 to 5000 (covering earlier part where statutes referenced). But we likely already have read 0-13034 earlier. The entire complaint is fully visited, so we have all tokens. But we didn't capture evidence.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex to search for patterns across document, but we need evidence context. It returns matches with context. So we can search for \"5 U.S.C. § 706\" etc. But we need to capture all unique statutes. Better search for \"U.S.C. §\" to get all. Also \"U.S. Const.\" for constitutional. Let's search for \"U.S.C. §\" in Complaint. Also \"U.S. Const.\".\n\nAlso for cause of action, we can use the earlier snippet's context as evidence.\n\nAlso remedy sought: we need the full prayer. We should read the Prayer for Relief section fully. That might be from token 12462 to 13034. We can read that segment.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for \"U.S.C. §\" in Complaint. That will return context. Also search for \"U.S. Const.\" maybe.\n\nAlso search for \"Anti-Deficiency Act\" maybe.\n\nBut we need to gather all statutes. Let's do search for \"U.S.C. §\" in Complaint. That will give many matches. Additionally search for \"U.S. Const.\".\n\nAlso search for \"Anti-Deficiency Act\" for that statute.\n\nAlso \"APA\" maybe.\n\nBut we need to capture the statutory basis: the governing statutes underlying the claims. So we need to list each statute referenced in the complaint. So we need to capture all. Let's do searches.\n\nWe also need remedy sought: we should read the prayer. That we can read and then append.\n\nThus we need two actions: search_document_regex for statutes, and read_document for prayer. But we can only choose one action per turn. We need to prioritize. We can maybe search for statutes first, then next turn read prayer. But we also want to capture remedy. But we can do search for prayer? The prayer is not a pattern. We can search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" then read that section. That matches we already saw. But we can search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in Complaint. That would give context. But we already know the snippet but need full. So we can search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in Complaint. That will give us the snippet including the prayer. Then we can read the entire prayer section. But we need to read the full content. So we can do search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in Complaint to get the start location. Then read from that offset to maybe the next heading or end.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"WHEREFORE\" which starts the prayer. That might also be good.\n\nBut we might just read from token 12462-13034 as we know the prayer starts at 12462. But we don't have evidence of the exact location. But we can read from 12462 to 13034. That is within 10,000 limit. So we can read that and capture the prayer.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief from 12462 to 13034.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":12462,\"end_token\":13034}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 12462, "end_token": 13034}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6236, "completion_tokens": 2263, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have read Complaint fully. Need to extract from Complaint. We also have parts of First and Second Amended Complaints partially. Likely cause of action listed in complaint, maybe at \"COUNT I\" etc. Remeds sought listed under \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". We have that text. We need to append.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with extracted items. But we must ensure we provide all distinct values. For Cause_of_Action, we need list of causes enumerated: COUNT I, II, III, IV etc. Each count is cause of action. Provide separate entries. Also maybe \"non-statutory right\" etc. In complaint, there are counts with titles: COUNT I (Non-statutory review of official and agency action), COUNT II (Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Law – Violation...), COUNT III (Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious), COUNT IV (Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Law – Impoundment Control Act). Also there might be \"COUNT V\" etc? Let's search. We saw up to COUNT IV. There may be more beyond token 11942? We have full complaint read to 13034. Let's search in that range. But we read full complaint. The counts might be in earlier parts we saw: COUNT I, II, III, IV. Possibly there are more counts: maybe COUNT V etc. Let's quickly search in the complaint text for \"COUNT\" beyond 11942. We saw in read_document from 12462-13034; but earlier we saw counts 1-4. There may be more counts after COUNT IV? We need to read beyond 13034? But complaint only 13034 tokens. So last part had 13034. So counts are only I-IV. So Cause_of_Action entries should include each count. Provide evidence snippet with location: e.g., tokens 10468-10668 for COUNT I etc. We have those token ranges from step 30. We can reference them.\n\nStatutory or Constitutional basis: For each cause, the statutory basis is listed within the cause description: e.g., for COUNT I, the cause description includes references to U.S. Constitution art. I, etc. For COUNT II, references to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). For COUNT III, references to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). For COUNT IV, references to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and 2 U.S.C. § 683. Also mention the Anti-Deficiency Act. But the statutory basis may be separate key: we can extract all statutory references found in complaint. But the definition: \"The governing statute(s) or constitutional provision(s) underlying the claims, including specific clauses and amendments when constitutional.\" So we need list of statutes/constitutionals underlying the claims. In complaint, there are multiple statutes: Anti-Deficiency Act, APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), 2 U.S.C. § 683, 20 U.S.C. §§ 9511, 9512, 9531, 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(i)(4), 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(k), etc. We should include each distinct statutory basis. Also constitutional parts: U.S. Constitution art. I? Also maybe 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) etc. But we can include them.\n\nRemedy_Sought: from PRAYER FOR RELIEF section, list all items (A) through (I). Each is a remedy. Provide separate entries. Provide evidence snippet.\n\nThus we need to append these. We have evidence snippets from earlier search results for counts and for remedy. For remedy, we have the text from step 33. We can copy that snippet.\n\nFor statutory basis, we need to gather from counts. We can use evidence from step 30 matches for counts. For each count, we have some statutory references. We should list each distinct statute/constitution. Might be many. But we can extract from the text of counts. We'll use evidence snippets from step 30: For COUNT I, we have references: \"U.S. Const., art. I.\" For COUNT II, references: \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\" For COUNT III, same. For COUNT IV: \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\" and \"2 U.S.C. § 683.\" Also earlier in PRAYER Sought, mention \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\" and \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B)\", etc. Also \"Anti-Deficiency Act\" and \"APA\" etc. We can include those.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe we should only extract the main statutory basis for each cause: e.g., for each count, the statutory basis is the APA (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). But also Anti-Deficiency Act. Might be too many. But we can include all statutes we find in complaint. We have evidence. Let's compile:\n\nStatutory/Constitutional Basis list:\n\n- Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA) – mention of violation in PRAYER.\n- Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\n- U.S. Constitution, Article I (implied)\n- 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B)\n- 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)\n- 20 U.S.C. §§ 9511, 9512, 9531\n- 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(i)(4)\n- 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(k)\n- 2 U.S.C. § 683 (Impoundment Control Act)\n- Possibly 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) referenced in First/Second amended complaints but not in base complaint? But we could include.\n\nBut the definition: \"including specific clauses and amendments when constitutional.\" So each constitutional clause: Article I, etc. We'll include those.\n\nThus we will create append_checklist patch with 3 keys.\n\nNow craft evidence for each.\n\nCause_of_Action entries:\n\nWe need each count title. Provide evidence snippet with location. We have token ranges:\n\n- COUNT I: tokens 10468-10668 (from step 30). Provide snippet: shows \"COUNT I (Non-statutory review of official and agency action)\". We'll reference that snippet.\n\n- COUNT II: tokens 10704-10904. Provide snippet: shows \"COUNT II (Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Law – Violation of Education Sciences Reform Act and Higher Education Opportunity Act)\".\n\n- COUNT III: tokens 11547-11747. Provide snippet: shows \"COUNT III (Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious)\".\n\n- COUNT IV: tokens 11742-11942. Provide snippet: shows \"COUNT IV (Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Law – Impoundment Control Act)\".\n\nNote: token ranges overlap but fine.\n\nWe also may need to include \"COUNT V\" etc. But not present. So only four.\n\nStatutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case entries:\n\nWe need distinct statutes. Provide evidence snippet for each. For each, we need source_document \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". Provide location as token range or page. Use the snippet from step 30 for each.\n\nExamples:\n\n- \"Anti-Deficiency Act\" – evidence snippet from PRAYER Sought (step 33). location tokens 12462-12662 (PRAYER). Provide snippet: \"Anti-Deficiency Act\".\n\n- \"Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\" – evidence snippet from COUNT I or II or III etc. Provide location tokens 10468-10668.\n\n- \"U.S. Constitution, Article I\" – evidence snippet from COUNT I tokens 10468-10668.\n\n- \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B)\" – evidence snippet from PRAYER Sought tokens 12462-12662.\n\n- \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)\" – same.\n\n- \"20 U.S.C. §§ 9511, 9512, 9531\" – evidence snippet from COUNT I tokens 10468-10668.\n\n- \"20 U.S.C. § 1015a(i)(4)\" – evidence snippet from COUNT I tokens 10468-10668.\n\n- \"20 U.S.C. § 1015a(k)\" – evidence snippet from COUNT I tokens 10468-10668.\n\n- \"2 U.S.C. § 683\" – evidence snippet from COUNT IV tokens 11742-11942.\n\n- \"5 U.S.C. § 706(1)\" – evidence snippet from First/Second Amended Complaints, but not needed for base complaint. But maybe not.\n\nWe can include these.\n\nRemedy_Sought entries:\n\nFrom PRAYER FOR RELIEF snippet, items (A)-(I). Provide each as separate entry with evidence snippet. Provide location tokens 12462-13034. Provide the snippet lines: (A) ... ; (B) ... etc.\n\nWe should include each remedy as value. For example: \"Declare that Defendants’ actions terminating IES’s performance of statutorily mandated activities and impounding funds are unlawful.\" That is the remedy. But maybe the remedy is \"Declare the termination unlawful; set it aside; enjoin; etc.\" The text includes multiple remedial requests within each letter. We need to capture each remedy. Perhaps we should list each letter's remedy as separate entry. For letter (A) request: \"Declare that Defendants’ actions terminating IES’s performance of statutorily mandated activities and impounding funds that IES would otherwise use to pay salaries, operating costs, and contract and grant obligations are unlawful.\" That is one remedy. For (B): \"Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants’ mass termination of contracts, reduction in force, and termination of remote restricted-use data licenses, as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), contrary to ...\". For (C): \"Order Defendants to take steps to restore terminated contracts that execute statutorily mandated tasks or enable the agency to do so.\" For (D): \"Vacate any RIF as to IES employees necessary to perform the agency’s statutory functions.\" For (E): \"Vacate the decision to terminate all remote restricted-use data licenses.\" For (F): \"Enjoin Defendants from taking any further steps that hinder IES’s ability to perform its statutorily mandated tasks.\" For (G): \"Issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction directing Defendants to cease immediately actions to cease IES’s operations.\" For (H): \"Award Plaintiffs their costs, reasonable attorney’s fees, and other disbursements as appropriate.\" For (I): \"Grant such other relief as the Court deems necessary, just, and proper.\"\n\nThus nine entries.\n\nWe must provide evidence snippet for each. Use same text snippet. Provide location tokens 12462-13034.\n\nNow let's construct append_checklist with patch for three keys. Ensure each entry includes evidence array.\n\nWe need to provide the evidence text verbatim. We have snippets from step 30 and 33. For counts, we can copy the snippet around. For statutory basis, we may need to provide multiple evidence snippets. Could list one per value.\n\nLet's gather snippets:\n\nFrom step 30:\n\n- For COUNT I: snippet beginning around \"COUNT I (Non-statutory review of official and agency action)\" and includes lines 84-88. We can copy lines: \"COUNT I (Non-statutory review of official and agency action) 84. Plaintiffs have a non-statutory right of action to enjoin and declare unlawful official action that is ultra vires. 85. Members of the Executive Branch have only those powers conferred on them by the Constitution and federal statutes. 86. Federal legislation must be passed by both chambers of Congress before it may be presented to the President, and, if signed, become law. U.S. Const., art. I. Members of the Executive Branch have no authority under the Constitution to amend statutes unilaterally. 87. IES and the National Education Centers were established by statute and charged with specific responsibilities. IES and the National Education Centers can be eliminated only by a statute enacted by Congress. 88.\"\n\n- For COUNT II: snippet: \"COUNT II (Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Law – Violation of Education Sciences Reform Act and Higher Education Opportunity Act) 89. The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). 90. Defendants’ decision to end the programs and activities of IES...\"\n\n- For COUNT III: snippet: \"COUNT III (Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious) 100. The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are found to be arbitrary and capricious. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). 101. Defendants have offered no reasoned explanation...\"\n\n- For COUNT IV: snippet: \"COUNT IV (Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Law – Impoundment Control Act) 103. The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). 104. The Impoundment Control Act requires the executive to make appropriated funds “available for obligation” unless the President sends a special message to Congress...\"\n\nFor PRAYER Sought snippet: from step 33. Let's capture the whole block with letters A to I.\n\nWe'll need to extract values. Let's create array of objects.\n\nWe must ensure each value is separate entry. For Cause_of_Action, each count as separate value. For Remedy_Sought, each letter as separate value. For Statutory basis, each statute/constitution as separate value.\n\nNow we need to ensure each evidence entry has text, source_document, location. For location, we can specify token ranges from snippet. Eg, COUNT I snippet tokens 10468-10668; location maybe \"tokens 10468-10668\". For each other, similar.\n\nFor statutory basis, we can assign location tokens accordingly. For example, Anti-Deficiency Act snippet from PRAYER snippet tokens 12462-12662. For APA, we can use snippet from COUNT I tokens 10468-10668. For U.S. Constitution art. I, same snippet. For 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) snippet: from PRAYER snippet tokens 12462-12662. For 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) same. For 20 U.S.C. §§ 9511, 9512, 9531 snippet: same as COUNT I snippet. For 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(i)(4) snippet: same. For 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(k) snippet: same. For 2 U.S.C. § 683 snippet: from COUNT IV snippet tokens 11742-11942. For 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) snippet: from First/Second amended complaints; but not needed for base complaint. But we can include if we want. But maybe we should limit to statutes present in base complaint. So we include above.\n\nNow build JSON patch.\n\nLet's prepare append_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Cause_of_Action\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"COUNT I – Non‑statutory review of official and agency action\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"COUNT I (Non-statutory review of official and agency action) 84.

Step 32 also 0. That indicates no \"COUNT\" pattern. But maybe the amended complaints have \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" or \"CAUSE OF ACTION\" spelled out differently. But we didn't see. Since we didn't read those documents fully, there might be other items. Perhaps the amendments add new causes of action or additional remedy soughts. But if the complaint already has all, maybe amendments didn't add more. But we should search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in those docs. Step 34 had appended from complaint. No search for prayer for relief in amended complaints. Let's search \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in those docs.\n\nAlso \"Statutory\" search may capture basis. But we might have to read the entire documents.\n\nGiven the instruction: \"Extract all 3 checklist items from the legal case documents as completely as possible.\" So we should include any additional values from other documents. So we need to confirm. The best action: search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" in First and Second Amended Complaint. Since step 31 search for \"COUNT \\d\" returned 0. But maybe the amendments list causes of action as \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" headings. Let's search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" in those docs. Use search_document_regex on those docs for pattern \"CAUSES? OF ACTION\". Use doc_names: list.\n\nAlso search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in those docs. And \"STATUTORY\" or \"CONSTITUTIONAL\" maybe.\n\nAlso the Declaration and Docket may not contain these items.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on First and Second Amended Complaint for \"CAUSES? OF ACTION\" and \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". Let's do that.\n\nWe'll use search_document_regex with doc_names array containing the two complaints. pattern \"CAUSES? OF ACTION\" flags IGNORECASE. Also maybe we should search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" pattern.\n\nWe can do two searches or one combined? We can do separate calls.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on the two complaints for \"CAUSES? OF ACTION\".

They claim extraction is complete. But the system says we are at stop attempt 1/2. We need to decide if we should stop or search for additional items. We need to examine if any checklist items may be missing or incomplete. The checklist has 3 items: Cause_of_Action, Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case, Remedy_Sought. All extracted values are from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. But we might need to consider that other documents may contain additional causes of action, statutory bases, or remedies, especially the first and second amended complaints might have additional counts or remedies. Since the system has partially visited those documents, there may be more values.\n\nThe last search steps didn't find \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" in the amended complaints. But that might be due to different formatting. There could be \"Causes of Action\" or \"Cause of Action\" or \"COUNT I\" etc. We saw earlier that they found counts in the complaint, but not in the amended complaints. However, the amendment may contain new counts or new remedies.\n\nWe should verify if the amended complaints include any new causes of action or remedies not in the original complaint. The system says 14% coverage of first amended complaint, 9% coverage of second amended complaint. That means we might not have fully extracted all values. So we should search those documents for \"Cause of Action\" or \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" or \"COUNT\" or \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" etc.\n\nAdditionally, the \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\" may have more items in the amended complaints. And \"Remedy_Sought\" may have more items.\n\nThus we should search the amended complaints for \"COUNT\" and \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" or \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" to find missing values.\n\nWe need to be efficient: The documents are partially visited. We can search for \"COUNT\" and \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" patterns.\n\nBetter approach: Use search_document_regex on the two amended complaints for \"COUNT\\s+\\d\" or \"COUNT \\w+\" or \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" or \"Causes of Action\" or \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" and capture context.

But we have partially visited other documents that might contain additional cause of action, statutory basis, remedy sought. We need to check if any missing values exist beyond what was extracted. The prior steps 34 extracted from Complaint. But there may be more in the Amended Complaints or other documents. Let's examine: Step 38 search on Amended Complaints found matches of causes of action? It found matches for \"CAUSES? OF ACTION\" returned 0. That suggests no new cause of action entries in those documents. But we might still find more remedy or statutory basis. Step 38 search for pattern including PRAYER FOR RELIEF etc. They found matches in Amended Complaints. Those matches include prayer for relief items (A, B, C, D...). Those are likely remedy sought. But we already extracted 9 remedy sought items from Complaint. The Amended Complaints may have additional remedy items not in Complaint. So we need to extract those additional remedy items. Also maybe more cause of action? The search didn't find \"CAUSES? OF ACTION\" but may still have \"COUNT\" headings? But pattern not found maybe missed due to formatting. But we should search for \"COUNT\" headings in Amended Complaints. Or search for \"Causes of Action\" etc. Step 35 search for \"CAUSES? OF ACTION\" found 0. But maybe the Amended Complaints use \"COUNT\" headings. Step 38 search for \"(?i)CAUSES? OF ACTION|COUNT\\s+\\d|PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" found 2 matches: one for each Amended Complaint. Those matches included \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" and some \"COUNT\" maybe not captured in snippet? The snippet shows only \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" section. So maybe the Amended Complaints also have counts but not captured? Wait snippet shows \"5 U.S.C. § 706(1).\" \"141. Defendants have unlawfully withheld...\" That seems like a new cause of action count, maybe \"COUNT I\". But the snippet truncated before \"COUNT I\" heading. But we need to see the full context. We need to read the Amended Complaints around the match tokens 13917-14117, 11671-11871 to capture counts and remedy. So we should read those sections.\n\nThus next action: read_document on First Amended Complaint tokens 13917-14117 (range). Also read Second Amended Complaint tokens 11671-11871.\n\nWe need to extract any new Cause_of_Action, Statutory basis, Remedy.\n\nAlso maybe the Memorandum Opinion may contain basis etc but we already have all from Complaint.\n\nThus next action: read_document for Amended Complaint sections.\n\nWe need to produce one function call. We can batch two reads? We can only call one function per turn. So we choose one read_document. We might read the first Amended Complaint tokens 13917-14117. That will give us the content. We can later read second if needed. But maybe we can read both using larger token range? The token limit is 10,000 tokens per call. The Amended Complaint is 14,528 tokens; reading 13917-14117 is 200 tokens. Ok.\n\nThus we will call read_document on First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, start_token 13917, end_token 14117.\n\nWe might also want to capture the preceding context; maybe we need to include entire count heading. But the snippet shows start at 13917. That might be inside the count heading. We'll read that range.\n\nThus answer: function call read_document.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":13917,\"end_token\":14117}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 13917, "end_token": 14117}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6895, "completion_tokens": 809, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The prior steps indicate that the assistant performed a search and appended 22 values for 3 keys. The current status indicates all 3 keys are filled. They also say \"Current Status: Keys with Values: 3/3\" and \"Empty Keys: 0/3\". So all keys are filled. They also have partial coverage of other documents but not needed.\n\nNow we need to decide whether to stop or to continue. The instructions say stop only when every key is complete or Not Applicable. The keys are filled. However, we should verify completeness: Are there any missing values? The current extraction used the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief only. But there are also First and Second Amended Complaints and Memorandum Opinion, which might contain additional causes, statutory bases, remedies. The prior search found matches in the Amended complaints but only the prayer for relief, not cause of action. But the causes of action may be in the same documents. The initial search for \"Cause of Action\" found 3 matches in Memorandum Opinion but not in Complaints. That suggests maybe the Memorandum Opinion contains some cause of action. But the prior appendix appended 22 values from Complaint only. But maybe there are additional values in other documents.\n\nWe must ensure completeness: All distinct values of each checklist item that directly match the definition. So we need to check other documents for any additional cause of action, statutory basis, remedy sought.\n\nWe have not read the First Amended Complaint fully. Only partial coverage. And Second Amended Complaint partially. The Memo partially. The Declaration, Docket, Motion unvisited.\n\nWe should search for \"Cause of Action\" in the Amended Complaints. Step 35 search returned 0 matches. That might mean no cause of action sections. But maybe the cause of action is in earlier counts or other sections. The complaints likely have counts with cause of action. The search pattern \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" may have missed due to case differences. But step 35 search for \"CAUSES? OF ACTION\" returned 0.\n\nBut the complaints have counts highlighted with e.g., \"COUNT I\" etc. The cause of action might be embedded within each count. The search pattern \"COUNT \\d\" didn't find in complaints. But we did find \"COUNT I\" and \"COUNT\\s+\\d\" etc. But the cause of action may be found in the \"COUNT I\" section. However, the search pattern \"COUNT I\" found matches in the complaint. That might contain cause of action within the count. But we didn't parse those for cause of action. We need to ensure all cause of action values.\n\nThe complaint likely enumerates multiple counts, each with a cause of action. For example, \"COUNT I: Violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. The search for \"COUNT I\" found 4 matches in Complaint. But we didn't parse them. So we may have missed cause of action values from those counts.\n\nThe remedy sought may be repeated across counts. But we appended 9 remedy values from Complaint. But there may be more. We need to check.\n\nThus we must decide to read further parts of Complaint to capture any cause of action and remedy values. But we already read entire Complaint (0-13034 tokens). That includes all counts. So the cause of action values should have been captured in that. But we appended 4 cause of action values from Complaint. That might be all that are present. But we need to confirm if there are more cause of action values that might be in other documents.\n\nWe saw search in Amended complaints for cause of action returned 0 matches. But that might be due to the cause of action being expressed differently, maybe \"Cause\" or \"Count\" or \"Complaint\" but not \"Cause of Action\". But the requirement is to extract any cause of action asserted. So we need to search for any part that lists cause of action. That could be \"COUNT\", \"COUNT I\", \"COUNT II\", etc. The complaint might have multiple counts, each with a cause. The search for COUNT did find for Complaint; but we didn't parse them. We need to read those parts to extract cause of action statements. But we already read entire Complaint, so the text is available. We need to examine the read content to check if we missed any cause of action. The read_document outputs earlier in steps show reading 0-2000, 2000-4000, 4000-8000, 8000-13034. But we didn't see those extracted. We appended 4 cause of action values from Complaint. Maybe those correspond to 4 counts. But we need to confirm if there are more counts.\n\nWe can search within the Complaint for \"COUNT\" to see all count sections.\n\nWe can perform search_document_regex on Complaint for \"COUNT\" pattern to see matches. But the prior search for \"COUNT I\" etc. found matches. We should search for \"COUNT\\s+\\w+\" or \"COUNT \\d\" etc. The search may produce matches in the Complaint. We need to parse them to ensure all cause of action statements.\n\nAlso, we should search for \"Statutory\" or \"Statute\" or \"U.S.C.\" to capture statutory bases.\n\nBut we already appended 9 statutory bases from Complaint. Might be all.\n\nRemedy sought: we appended 9 remedy values. Might be all.\n\nBut to be safe, we should search for \"Remedy\" or \"Relief\" to capture any additional remedy descriptions.\n\nAlternatively, we could search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" or \"WHEREFORE\" to capture remedy. We may have captured them.\n\nBut the complaint may include \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" once, listing multiple remedies. That may be captured.\n\nBut no remedy in the Amended complaints maybe.\n\nThus we might be done. But we must confirm that the cause of action, statutory basis, remedy sought are complete across all documents.\n\nThe partial coverage of other documents may contain additional claims, but the search for cause of action returned 0 in those documents. So we can assume none.\n\nBut it's possible that the cause of action is within the \"Memorandum Opinion\" which we partially read. But the search for \"Cause of Action\" found 3 matches in Memorandum Opinion. But we didn't parse them. They may be references to the cause of action but not actual claims. They might be discussing the cause of action.\n\nBut the requirement: \"The legal claim(s) asserted—the theory of liability or right to relief.\" That may be the cause of action. The memorandum opinion may discuss the cause of action but not assert them. So we only need the claims asserted in the pleadings. The complaint is the pleading. So our extraction from Complaint should suffice.\n\nThus we might stop.\n\nBut we must be careful: The checklist may require that we capture all distinct values for each key. We appended 4 cause of action, 9 statutory, 9 remedy. But we should verify if there are any missing values. Could there be additional remedy sought in the Amended complaints? They might be same. We can search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in the Amended complaints. We saw a match in Amended complaints. That match includes the same remedy list? It lists declarations of termination and enjoin. That might be similar. But we need to capture each remedy separately. For example, \"Declare the termination of NPSAS 2024 ... and enjoin Defendants to resume the study.\" That is a remedy. We already captured that remedy. But there might be additional remedy for each count.\n\nWait, the remedy list includes 4 items: A, B, C, D. We captured 9 remedies? Actually, we appended 9 remedy values. That seems too many for 4 items. But maybe the remedy list includes other items like \"compensatory damages\" etc. But we don't know.\n\nThus to be safe, we might need to read the Amended complaints to capture any additional remedy or cause of action.\n\nBut the complaint had 4 cause of action. The remedy list may include also 4 remedies. But why 9? Perhaps the remedy list includes multiple specific remedies for each count. For example, each count might request \"declare termination\" and \"enjoin\" separately. That could be separate remedy values. So 9 remedies could be 3 per count? That matches 4 counts? 4 counts * 2 remedies each = 8. But we have 9.\n\nThus there may be more remedy items.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, we might want to search the Amended complaints for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" and parse to confirm if there are additional remedy items.\n\nBut we only partially read the Amended complaints, only a few tokens. So we need to read more of them.\n\nWe also need to check if the Amended complaints contain any cause of action statements that we didn't capture. The search for cause of action returned 0 for them, but maybe the cause of action is expressed differently.\n\nThus we should read the full Amended complaints.\n\nThus we should perform the next action: read the parts of the Amended complaints that contain the cause of action and remedy.\n\nWe should also read the Memorandum Opinion for any cause of action statements? Probably not necessary.\n\nThus, we can decide to read the Amended complaints. But we should choose to read the \"First Amended Complaint\" from token 11128 to maybe 12961 (already partially visited). But we might need to read from 12961 to 14528 (end). That is 14528-12961=1557 tokens. Within 10k limit. So we can read that range.\n\nAlso for the Second Amended Complaint: we visited tokens 9650-10046, 10096-10296, 10324-10524, 11571-11871. We might need to read the rest from 11871 to 12203 (end). That's 332 tokens. Also the first segments from 0-9650 might have cause of action. Actually we visited 9650-10046 etc. But we didn't see earlier tokens. So we need to read from 0 to 9650. That is 9650 tokens. We can read 0-9650. That covers the earlier part, including cause of action sections.\n\nThus we should read the missing ranges.\n\nThus next action: read_document for First Amended Complaint from 12961 to 14528.\n\nBut we also might want to read Second Amended Complaint from 0-9650.\n\nBut we can only issue one function call per turn. We can choose to read one doc at a time. We can choose to read the First Amended Complaint for the missing range. Then we will parse and append extracted values.\n\nThus we will proceed with reading First Amended Complaint for the missing part.\n\nWe need to confirm the doc name. The doc name is \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". We need to provide start_token and end_token.\n\nStart_token: 12961 (already visited 11128-12961). We need to read 12961-14528. End_token: 14528.\n\nWe need to ensure within 10k tokens. 14528-12961=1557 < 10000.\n\nThus we will call read_document.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":12961,\"end_token\":14528}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 12961, "end_token": 14528}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5474, "completion_tokens": 2393, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

According to current status, all keys are filled: 3/3. But we need to verify completeness? Step 34 appended 22 values for 3 keys. The status says 4 values for Cause_of_Action, 9 for Statutory, 9 for Remedy. The user earlier had extracted from first complaint. But there might be additional values in other documents (First Amended, Second Amended). We haven't read them fully. The current status: First Amended partially visited 11128-14528; we have read some tokens 12961-14528 and 13917-14117. We haven't covered earlier tokens 11128-12960. There might be more causes of action or remedies or statutes. Also Second Amended partially visited 9650-10046 etc.\n\nThus it's possible we haven't extracted all values. The prior step 34 appended 22 values, but that only from the Complaint? The step 34 likely appended values from the Complaint; but we may need to extract more from amended complaints.\n\nThe checklist requires all distinct values that directly match definitions; So we need to capture all cause of action, statutory basis, remedy sought from all documents.\n\nWe need to perform more reading or search. Let's search for \"COUNT\" or \"Cause of Action\" in the remaining documents.\n\nWe have partially visited First Amended. Let's search for \"CAUSES? OF ACTION\" in First Amended. Also \"COUNT\" might have causes enumerated.\n\nAlso search for \"Remedy Sought\" pattern maybe not present.\n\nLet's search with regex pattern \"CAUSES? OF ACTION|COUNT\\s+\\d|PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in the remaining documents. Step 38 did that for First and Second Amended and found matches. But we didn't read the content of those matches fully. We read the First Amended matches in Step 39 and 40 but maybe not all. The matches we saw are the \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" sections. But we need to capture cause of action and remedy sought.\n\nThe cause of action likely appears earlier than the prayer. In the first amended, maybe each count has a cause of action heading.\n\nWe might need to search for \"COUNT\" headings or \"Cause of Action\" again, but we already searched for \"CAUSES? OF ACTION\" and found 0 matches. Wait Step 38 search for \"CAUSES? OF ACTION|COUNT\\s+\\d|PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" found matches: for First Amended, 1 match tokens 13917-14117 (which is PRAYER). For Second Amended, tokens 11671-11871 (PRAYER). So there were no \"CAUSES? OF ACTION\" matches; maybe the cause of action is under each COUNT heading. So we need to read the counts.\n\nWe also need to capture statutory basis; the first amended includes statutory citations within counts.\n\nThus we should read the counts sections. We need to read from where \"COUNT\" headings start. In the first amended, we saw tokens 12961-14528, which includes \"COUNT X\" etc. That portion includes statutory references. We probably need to capture all counts. We have read 12961-14528, but maybe not all counts earlier. Let's check earlier tokens 11128-12960. The viewing tokens currently: 11128-14528. So we have not read 11128-12961? Actually we have read 12961-14528, but not 11128-12960. That might contain earlier counts (COUNT I, etc.) So we need to read 11128-12960.\n\nSimilarly for second amended: we have read 9650-10046, 10096-10296, 10324-10524, 11571-11871. We may need to read earlier segments 9650-10046 etc. But we have some coverage.\n\nThus we should read missing token ranges. Let's read from 11128-12961 in First Amended. That's 11128 to 12961 (about 1833 tokens). That's within limit. Then read from 9650-10046 maybe we already have but we can read entire 9650-11871? That is 2221 tokens.\n\nBut we need to capture all values. Let's read 11128-12961 of First Amended.\n\nThen we may need to read 9650-11871 of Second Amended to capture earlier counts. But we already have 9650-10046, 10096-10296, 10324-10524, 11571-11871. That covers up to 11871. The second amended has 12,203 tokens, so maybe more after 11871? But we only have 9650-11871; we might need 11872-12203. But counts might be earlier. But to be safe, maybe read 11872-12203.\n\nLet's proceed step by step. First read 11128-12961 of First Amended.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":11128,\"end_token\":12961}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 11128, "end_token": 12961}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7220, "completion_tokens": 1085, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The user provided an extensive state. They have already extracted all values from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief fully. They need to extract from other documents? They have partial coverage of First Amended Complaint and Second Amended Complaint, and partial of Memorandum Opinion. They have 22 values extracted: 4 Cause_of_Action, 9 Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case, 9 Remedy_Sought. That matches the complaint. But \"all 3 checklist items from legal case documents as completely as possible.\" We need to ensure that all documents are checked. Are there other sources with these items? The other documents may contain additional causes of action, statutory basis, remedy sought. We must examine First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, Declaration, Docket, Motion. The user has not yet extracted from these. We should search for \"Cause of Action\" or \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" in these docs. The search earlier didn't find in amended complaints. But maybe the amended complaints have \"Causes of Action\" earlier. The earlier search had no matches. But maybe the amended complaints have \"Causes of Action\" spelled differently. We should search for \"CAUSE\" or \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" or \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" pattern again in those docs. Also \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" may contain remedies. Also \"STATUTE\" or \"STATUTORY\" etc. But the earlier step 38 search for \"CAUSES? OF ACTION|COUNT\\s+\\d|PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" found matches in both amended complaints. That gave some remedy prayers. But we need to extract Cause_of_Action and Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case from those amended complaints. The earlier search didn't find \"Cause of Action\" in those docs but found \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". However, the amended complaints likely have the same \"Causes of Action\" as the complaint. But maybe they didn't include the heading because they omitted it. But they may include \"COUNT\" headings, each with a cause. The earlier search found the \"COUNT\" patterns. But maybe each \"COUNT\" is a cause. We should extract \"COUNT I\", \"COUNT II\", etc. But the earlier extraction didn't include those. The 4 causes in original complaint may be: Termination of NPSAS 2024 contrary to law; Termination of BPS:20/25; Termination of HSLS:09; Termination of HS&B:22. However, the amended complaints might include additional counts for other programs. In Step 40 we saw many counts: X, XI, XII, XIII etc. Those are likely also causes. So we need to extract all causes from all documents. Similarly, statutory basis might include many statutes: 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), 20 U.S.C. § 9575, etc. Many are already extracted from complaint (9). But the amended complaints might have more. Similarly, remedy sought: The complaint had 9 items, but the amended complaints have many items: A, B, C, etc. We need to extract all remedy items from all documents. So we need to read more of the First Amended Complaint. Already we have tokens 11128-14528. That covers many. But we haven't read earlier portion of the document prior to 11128. That portion may contain the initial causes and remedy. So we need to read earlier tokens, maybe 0-11127. Also for Second Amended Complaint, we have partial coverage from 9650-10046, etc. We need to read more. Also Memorandum Opinion may contain causes or remedies. We should read more of that.\n\nBut we need to extract all checklist items from the entire corpus. The current extracted 22 values likely only from the Complaint. We need to add values from other documents. We should search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" in the remaining docs. Let's search for that pattern across the remaining docs.\n\nWe should call search_document_regex on the remaining docs: First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, Declaration, Docket, Motion. Use pattern \"(?i)CAUSES? OF ACTION\". Also maybe \"CAUSE OF ACTION\". Also \"COUNT \\d\" etc. But we need to find causes. The earlier search didn't find \"CAUSES? OF ACTION\" in amended complaints. But maybe the heading is missing. However, each count heading indicates a cause. So we need to extract each count heading as a cause. In the complaint, the causes were listed as \"COUNT I, COUNT II, COUNT III, etc.\" The earlier extraction only captured 4 counts? Actually in the complaint there were 4 counts? But the complaint had 4 counts? Wait the complaint had 4 counts: NPSAS 2024 Termination – Contrary to Law, BPS:20/25 Termination – Arbitrary and Capricious, HSLS:09 Termination – Arbitrary and Capricious, HS&B:22 Termination – Arbitrary and Capricious. That matches 4 cause.\n\nThe complaint also had a \"Count\" for \"Terminations\" maybe. But 4 counts. So 4 cause of action extracted. The amended complaints likely have more counts. The \"First Amended Complaint\" has many counts: X, XI, XII, XIII. The second amended complaint has similar counts. So we need to extract those.\n\nThus we need to read more of the First Amended Complaint to capture all counts. We have tokens 11128-14528. That covers up to COUNT IX maybe? The snippet from 11128 to 14528 includes many counts. We need to extract each \"COUNT X\" heading as a cause. Also we need to extract the statutory basis within each count: e.g., 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), 20 U.S.C. § 9543(a)(E), etc. Many are already extracted? The earlier extraction from complaint had 9 statutory references. The amended complaint has more: 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), 20 U.S.C. § 9543(a)(E), 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(k), 20 U.S.C. § 9574, 20 U.S.C. § 9575, 20 U.S.C. § 9546(e)(2), 20 U.S.C. §§ 9575(2)–(3), 20 U.S.C. § 9543(a)(E) again, etc. So we need to extract all statutory references.\n\nAlso remedy sought in amended complaint: The snippet shows the prayer for relief with many items A-H, etc. Each item is a remedy sought: e.g., \"Declare termination of NPSAS 2024 arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, set it aside, and enjoin Defendants to resume the study.\" etc. So we need to extract each remedy.\n\nThus we need to read more of the First Amended Complaint to capture all these items. But we already read 11128-14528. That includes up to COUNT XIII? The snippet from 11128-14528 includes many counts. But we haven't read the earlier part of the document before 11128, which may include some counts and the initial \"Causes of Action\" heading and maybe the \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" at the top. So let's read the first part of the First Amended Complaint: tokens 0-11128. That covers 11128 tokens. Let's call read_document on 0-11128.\n\nAlso for Second Amended Complaint, we have partial coverage of some sections: tokens 9650-10046, 10096-10296, 10324-10524, 11571-11871. We need to read earlier parts: tokens 0-9650, 10046-10096, 10296-10324, 10524-11571. That would cover the entire doc. But maybe we can just read the entire doc 0-12203. But need to not exceed 10k tokens. 12203 tokens >10k? 12,203 tokens slightly above 10k? Actually 12,203 > 10,000. So we cannot read entire doc in one go. We can read multiple windows. But we might only need parts that contain causes, statutory references, remedy. We can focus on counts. For each count, we need to capture the heading and the related statutory references and prayer items. The second amended complaint likely has similar structure to first amended complaint. We could search for \"COUNT\" headings. Let's search for pattern \"COUNT\\s+[IVXLCDM]+\" or \"COUNT\\s+\\w+\" in the second amended complaint. But we need to read the sections.\n\nInstead, maybe easier to read the entire second amended complaint in 2 chunks: 0-10000 and 10000-12000. But that would be 2 calls. But we only need one action per turn. We could read 0-10000 tokens from second amended complaint. That may cover many counts. But we might miss counts after 10000. But we can do next turn to read rest. But we need to decide next action.\n\nWe can also search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in the second amended complaint. That appears in earlier snippet. But we already read 11571-11871. That includes prayer. But we might need to read earlier tokens for initial prayer. But maybe the prayer is same. But we might need to extract the remedy items from that.\n\nWe should likely read the first part of First Amended Complaint to capture causes and statutory references. That is 0-11128 tokens. That is within limit. So next action: read_document First Amended Complaint tokens 0-11128.\n\nBut we also need to capture from Second Amended Complaint. But maybe we can do that in next turn. So next action: read_document on First Amended Complaint tokens 0-11128.\n\nLet's do that.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":11128}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 11128}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9243, "completion_tokens": 2166, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The prior steps: they appended 22 values for 3 keys. That might be complete? The checklist summary says all keys filled. So likely we should stop.\n\nBut we need to consider if there could be additional values missed. The extracted values come from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. But the other documents might have more cause of action, statutory basis, remedy. But the prior steps appended 22 values. But maybe missing some from Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, which is partially visited. The previous steps have not fully extracted that doc. But they appended only from Complaint. Maybe there are additional items in the second amended complaint that were not extracted. The last step says \"Keys with extracted values: 3/3 ... 22 values extracted.\" The doc list shows Second Amended Complaint partially visited. So we might not have fully extracted all possible values. We need to check if other documents contain more claim items, statutory basis, remedy. The second amended complaint likely contains same claims but maybe different or additional. But it's partially visited; we might need to complete extraction.\n\nThus we should continue to extract from Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. We'll need to read remaining token ranges that haven't been viewed.\n\nLet's examine the token ranges for Second Amended Complaint: 9650-10046, 10096-10296, 10324-10524, 11571-11871. That's 9% coverage. Likely many of the cause of action, statutory basis, remedy are earlier in the document. The document probably includes similar content to first amended complaint. But we need to identify any missing items. Let's search that doc for \"Cause of Action\" or \"COUNT\". Let's use search_document_regex on that doc for \"cause of action\" and \"COUNT\" and \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". Also search for \"Statutory\" maybe.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex on Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for patterns \"cause of action\", \"COUNT\", \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\", \"Statutory\". That will give context.\n\nSo I'll call search_document_regex with doc_name \"Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". Pattern maybe \"Cause of Action|COUNT\\\\s*\\\\d|PRAYER FOR RELIEF|Statutory\". Let's use pattern \"(?i)cause of action|COUNT\\\\s*\\\\d|PRAYER FOR RELIEF|Statutory\".
