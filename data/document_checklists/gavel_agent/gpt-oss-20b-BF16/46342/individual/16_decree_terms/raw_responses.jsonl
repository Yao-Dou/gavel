We have seen some matches: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief has a list of relief items (vacate, enjoin, restraining order, etc.). Are these terms of decrees? The complaint is a pleading, not a court order. Terms in complaint are not decrees. So maybe there is no decree included. We have docket entries with \"STANDING ORDER Establishing Procedures\" and \"MOTION for Preliminary Injunction\" but those are not orders. There's \"STANDING ORDER Establishing Procedures for Cases Before Judge Trevor N. McFadden\" which is a court order? It's a standing order. That might be a decree? It's a court order, yes. But is it a \"Significant Term of a Decree\"? The definition: substantive obligations ordered by the court. Standing orders are court orders, but do they count as significant terms? Possibly yes. But we need distinct values; each term separate. The standing order is a single order. We could extract the text of the order? The docket entry gives summary: \"STANDING ORDER Establishing Procedures for Cases Before Judge Trevor N. McFadden. The parties are hereby ORDERED to read and comply with the directives in the attached standing order.\" The content of the standing order isn't shown. We need the terms. We might need to read the actual order document. But the docket entry doesn't include the order text. There's no separate document for that order.\n\nWe also have \"MOTION for Preliminary Injunction\" docket entry. But that's a motion, not order.\n\nThe complaint lists relief items but it's not a decree.\n\nThus, maybe there are no decrees in the corpus. But there might be \"Consent Decree\" or \"Stipulated Judgment\" in other documents (not yet visited). The first amended complaint, second amended complaint, declaration of Abigail Doe may contain orders. But we haven't looked at them.\n\nThe search in all documents for \"decree|consent decree|stipulated judgment|injunction|orders that|the court orders|court orders\" found 14 matches, all in the documents we already partially viewed. None matched \"consent decree\" or \"stipulated judgment\" or \"decree\". So likely no decree text in the current set.\n\nTherefore, we might determine Not Applicable. But we need evidence of Not Applicable: explicit statement that no decree exists, or that decree terms are not included. We could use the docket entry: \"STANDING ORDER\" is an order, but it's a standing order, but maybe not a decree? The term \"decree\" refers to a court order; standing orders are orders. So maybe we could include that standing order as a term. But still, the question: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders.\" So an injunction could be a decree. But the complaint's injunction request is not a decree. We need the court's order. The docket entries show a \"STANDING ORDER Establishing Procedures...\" which is a court order; but is that a decree? It is a court order, but it's a procedural order, not substantive obligations like injunction. But still a substantive obligation? It orders parties to read and comply with directives. That could be considered a term.\n\nBut the question: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We need to find all significant terms of decrees. That includes the content of any court orders (e.g., injunction, consent decree). So we need to find any order text. We have a docket entry but not the full order. We might need to read the \"STANDING ORDER\" document itself if it exists. It's not listed separately. The docket entry may be the only mention.\n\nSearch for \"STANDING ORDER\" full text? That might be in the docket. But the docket entry only includes summary. We may need to read that entry's content if available. But maybe the docket entry contains the full text? It says \"attached standing order\" but not included. So we cannot extract terms.\n\nThus, maybe no decree terms found.\n\nBut we still need to provide a Not Applicable if no decree terms exist. We need evidence: maybe the docket entries and no \"decree\" text found. The search results show no matches for \"decree|consent decree|stipulated judgment|injunction|orders that|the court orders|court orders\" except those we saw. The complaint's relief items are not decrees. So we can mark Not Applicable.\n\nBut we need to provide evidence: maybe we can use the search results showing no matches for \"decree|consent decree|stipulated judgment|injunction|orders that|the court orders|court orders\" in the docket entries that would contain orders. But we saw matches for \"orders that\" etc. But those were docket entries. The search results didn't return any matches for \"decree\" in any document. So we can argue no decree terms.\n\nThus, we should set key to Not Applicable with evidence: maybe the search result for \"decree\" returned 0 matches. But we don't have that result; we only have search results for patterns that returned matches. But we can search again specifically for \"(?i)decree|consent decree|stipulated judgment\". That might return 0. But we need to provide evidence, so we should perform a search.\n\nWe can do a search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(?i)decree|consent decree|stipulated judgment\" to confirm no matches. Then we can update the checklist with Not Applicable, citing the evidence that no matches.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(?i)decree|consent decree|stipulated judgment\".\n\nBut we might also search for \"injunction\" within orders, but we already have that.

Also the Docket has Standing Order establishing procedures, Motion for Preliminary Injunction, etc. Also the Memorandum Opinion may have a decree? But it seems no decree. We need to search for \"order\" terms. Maybe read complaint tokens 12797-12997 already contains the relief. We need to capture each term as separate value, with evidence. Also maybe other documents contain orders: e.g., Docket entries: Standing Order, Motion, etc. We need to extract significant terms of decrees: the substantive obligations ordered by the court. So from complaint: the relief list: vacate, enjoin, issue temporary restraining, award costs, grant other relief. Are these \"terms\"? They are orders.

We need to extract each of the six items (E) through (I). Also extract the standing order from Docket.\n\nAlso maybe from the memorandum opinion there might be a \"decree\" but we might need to read further to see if there's a court order. Search for \"ORDER\" maybe. But let's first parse the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief snippet.\n\nWe have:\n\n```\nVacate any RIF as ...;  \n(E) Vacate the decision to terminate all remote restricted-use data licenses;  \n(F) Enjoin Defendants from taking any further steps that hinder IES’s ability to perform its statutorily mandated tasks; \n(G) Issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction directing Defendants to cease immediately actions to cease IES’s operations; \n(H) Award Plaintiffs their costs, reasonable attorney’s fees, and other disbursements as appropriate; and  \n(I) Grant such other relief as the Court deems necessary, just, and proper. \n```\n\nWe need each as separate entry. We need evidence for each. The snippet itself is evidence. We need to provide text snippet, source_document, location. The location can be \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, tokens 12797-12997\". But we might need a more precise location (like page). But okay.\n\nNow for the standing order: The snippet from Docket tokens 300-600 shows:\n\n```\n5 | 2025-04-09 | STANDING ORDER Establishing Procedures for Cases Before Judge Trevor N. McFadden. The parties are hereby ORDERED to read and comply with the directives in the attached standing order. Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 4/9/2025. (lctnm3). (Entered: 04/09/2025)\n```\n\nSo we extract the term: \"STANDING ORDER Establishing Procedures for Cases Before Judge Trevor N. McFadden\". Also evidence.\n\nAlso maybe there are other orders like \"MOTION for Preliminary Injunction\" but not a decree. Also maybe \"Consent\" not. So 7 items.\n\nAre there any other orders in the docket? Let's search for \"ORDER\" in docket. But we haven't read beyond tokens 300-600. But we saw tokens 556-756 etc. But might contain other orders. For example, there might be \"ORDERED\" statements for \"MINUTE ORDER\" etc. But those may be orders too. But we want significant terms of decrees; maybe \"MINUTE ORDER\" is not a decree? But it's a court order. The docket shows \"MINUTE ORDER: Defendants' opposition filing to Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is due...\" etc. That is a minute order, a court order. Probably we should include it. But it's not part of the decree terms? It's a court order. So maybe we need to include all significant terms of decrees: i.e., the substantive obligations. A minute order is a court order that imposes a duty. So maybe we should include \"MINUTE ORDER: Defendants' opposition filing to Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction is due on April 30, 2025...\". And also \"MINUTE ORDER: The Motion Hearing scheduled for May 9, 2025...\". And \"MINUTE ORDER: The Motion Hearing scheduled for May 9, 2025...\". And \"MINUTE ORDER: The Motion Hearing scheduled for May 9, 2025...\". Also \"MINUTE ORDER: The Motion Hearing scheduled for May 9, 2025...\".\n\nAlso the docket includes \"STANDING ORDER Establishing Procedures for Cases Before Judge Trevor N. McFadden\". So we should extract that.\n\nAlso the docket includes \"MOTION for Preliminary Injunction\" but that's not an order.\n\nAlso \"NOTICE OF RELATED CASE\" etc. Not orders.\n\nAlso \"RETURN OF SERVICE/AFFIDAVIT of Summons\" etc. Not orders.\n\nSo we need to extract all significant terms of decrees, including standing orders, minute orders, and the orders listed in the complaint.\n\nBut the complaint is a pleading, not a decree. The orders listed are the relief sought; not actual decrees. Wait, the complaint lists relief sought, not the decree. The question: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders. Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court.\" So the items we extracted from the complaint are relief sought, not decrees. Are they actual decrees? The complaint lists the relief that the court is asked to grant. But these are not the court's actual orders. The complaint is a pleading; the orders would be found in the actual court order documents (e.g., the decree). The complaint lists what the court should order, but not the decree itself. So we cannot treat them as decrees. They are just requested relief. So perhaps we need to find actual decrees issued by the court. Those would be in the docket entries that are orders: standing order, minute orders, maybe a consent decree. But we have not seen a consent decree. Maybe the docket has a \"Consent\" entry but that's not a decree. The docket entries include \"CONSENT\" but might be a consent decree. Let's examine the snippet: \"Issued Electronically as to All Defendants, U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General (Attachments: # 1 Notice and Consent)(zljn)\". That might be a consent decree. The docket entry says \"Notice and Consent\" but no mention of \"decree\". But the docket entry might refer to a \"Consent\" that could be a consent decree. But we need to find the text of the decree.\n\nThus we need to search for \"consent decree\" or \"decree\" or \"stated\" etc. But we already searched for \"decree\" and found only a match in memorandum opinion, not a decree. But maybe we need to search for \"consent decree\" in docket.

Also \"MINUTE ORDER\" etc. We need substantive obligations ordered by court—i.e., the terms in the orders. We need to capture each distinct term. But we need evidence: text snippet, source doc, location.\n\nWe haven't read the actual order text. The docket entries show \"Text of Proposed Order\" but not the content. We need to read the actual order documents. There may be separate documents for the order. For example, \"Text of Proposed Order\" likely refers to a document named something. In docket entries, we see \"Text of Proposed Order\" with id. We need to read that document.\n\nWe have not visited the \"Text of Proposed Order\" document. We need to search for it. Use search_document_regex on all documents for \"Text of Proposed Order\". That will return matches. Let's do that. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"Text of Proposed Order\" and maybe \"proposed order\" or \"order\". Also search for \"STANDING ORDER\" maybe is a document. But we need the substantive terms. The \"STANDING ORDER\" is a document itself. We should read that. Also \"MINUTE ORDER\" documents contain order text. These are likely separate documents. We need to extract the terms.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Text of Proposed Order\" to find document names. Use pattern \"Text of Proposed Order\". Also maybe \"Proposed Order\" but okay.

We have seen some evidence: The docket shows text of proposed orders, but those are not decrees, they are proposed orders. We need terms that are substantive obligations ordered by the court. We saw in docket entries: \"Text of Proposed Order\" but those are not necessarily decrees. However, the court may issue a consent decree or stipulated judgment or injunction. We need terms that are substantive obligations. There may be a consent decree or other order in the docket. Let's search for \"consent decree\" or \"stated\" in docket or opinion. Search in all documents for \"consent decree\". The search earlier found 0 matches. But we might need to read the docket entries for \"Text of Proposed Order\" - those might be proposed orders; but maybe they include decree terms. But we need \"decree terms\" that are ordered by the court. The docket entries include \"Text of Proposed Order\" referencing attachments. Those might be orders. Also \"STANDING ORDER Establishing Procedures for Cases Before Judge Trevor N. McFadden\" is a standing order. That is a court order. We need terms that are obligations: e.g., \"The parties are hereby ordered to read and comply with the directives in the attached standing order.\" That is a term. Also \"The parties are further ordered to appear for an in-person Motion Hearing\" etc. Also \"The parties are ordered to read and comply with the directives in the attached standing order.\" Those are obligations.\n\nWe need to extract each distinct term of decree. The list likely includes: (1) Parties must read and comply with the attached standing order. (2) Parties must appear for an in-person motion hearing. (3) Possibly other terms in the \"Text of Proposed Order\" attachments. But we don't have the actual texts of the attachments. But we have the docket entries referencing them. We might need to read the attachment itself. But attachments may be separate documents. There might be a document titled \"Text of Proposed Order\" which is likely a separate file. But do we have that file? It's referenced in docket entries but not listed as separate docs. The docket entries might contain the text of the proposed order within the docket. The snippet shows \"Text of Proposed Order)(Pulver, Adam) (Entered: 04/17/2025)\". It doesn't show the content. So we may not have the text.\n\nThus, we can extract terms that are present in the docket entries. The docket entries include the following lines:\n\n- \"STANDING ORDER Establishing Procedures for Cases Before Judge Trevor N. McFadden. The parties are hereby ORDERED to read and comply with the directives in the attached standing order. Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 4/9/2025.\"\n\n- \"The parties are further ORDERED to appear for an in-person Motion Hearing before Judge Trevor N. McFadden on May 9, 2025 at 10:00 AM in Courtroom 2. SO ORDERED. Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 4/18/2025.\"\n\nWe also have \"Notice of Proposed Order - REVISED\" but that's not a decree.\n\nWe also have \"Consent MOTION for Extension of Time to File Answer\" but that's not a decree.\n\nThus, likely the only court-ordered obligations discovered so far are those in the standing order.\n\nAlso, there might be \"Text of Proposed Order\" which might include terms, but we can't read it yet. We could search for \"Text of Proposed Order\" again but we already did. That only shows references.\n\nPerhaps the \"Memorandum Opinion\" contains orders. Let's search for \"ORDERED\" or similar in Memorandum Opinion. We saw earlier in step 14: \"The parties are hereby ORDERED to read and comply with the directives in the attached standing order.\" That's from docket.

The search for \"Text of Proposed Order\" gives lots but those are docket entries referencing the order, not the order itself.\n\nWe need to find the actual decree text in the Memorandum Opinion or possibly in the Docket? The \"Text of Proposed Order\" might refer to the actual order content, but maybe the docket entry includes the order? It might be the actual order in the docket, but we need to confirm.\n\nWe should search for \"ORDERED:\" or \"the court hereby orders\" patterns. The prior search did not find \"ORDERED\" because maybe capitalization? It returned 0 matches. Check pattern \"(?i)the court hereby orders|court hereby orders|the court orders\" returned 0. Maybe the order is in the Memorandum Opinion, but might be under \"ORDERED:\" or \"The court orders that\". We should search for \"orders that\" pattern again? Already did search \"orders? that\" earlier, but not found? The earlier search results had 10 matches in Memorandum Opinion. We should read those matches.\n\nWe didn't read those matches yet. We need to read the relevant token ranges for those matches.\n\nAlso, we may need to read the entire Memorandum Opinion to get the order text. But the limit is 14,049 tokens. We already read several windows. We need to read the part where the order is issued. Usually a memorandum opinion ends with the order: \"Accordingly, the court orders that...\".\n\nWe may search again for \"Accordingly, the court orders\" or \"the court orders that\" or \"The court hereby orders\". The earlier search for \"the court orders\" returned 0 matches; maybe the phrase has punctuation or formatting. Let's search for pattern \"(?i)the court orders that|the court orders|court orders\" again. But we did earlier with \"the court ordered|court ordered|the court hereby orders|court hereby orders|the court orders|court orders\" and got 0. Maybe the phrase is \"court orders the\" or \"the court orders:\" etc.\n\nBetter to search for \"ORDERED\" pattern but in uppercase. Already did search for \"ORDERED\" returned 0. Maybe the order is in the docket. The docket entries show \"ORDERED\" in the context of docket items. But the actual decree text is likely in the docket entry \"Text of Proposed Order\". The docket entry may include the entire order text.\n\nWe should read the docket entry that contains the \"Text of Proposed Order\". The search results list token ranges for matches of \"Text of Proposed Order\" in Docket. For each match, the context includes the docket entry. For example, Match 1 tokens 488-688: shows a docket entry starting with \"Text of Proposed Order)(Pulver, Adam) (Entered: 04/17/2025)\". That likely is the entry for the proposed order, but the actual content might be a linked document not included here. But maybe the docket entry includes the order text? It might not. The docket entry is just a reference. So we might need to read the actual order file, but we don't have that.\n\nBut maybe the order text is included within the docket entry as a \"Text of Proposed Order\" field? The context may include the order text after that marker. Let's examine the snippet: It shows a list of declarations and then \"Text of Proposed Order)(Pulver, Adam) (Entered: 04/17/2025)\". It seems the entry includes the entire docket item but not the order. So maybe the order is not available.\n\nAlternatively, the Memorandum Opinion might contain the final order. We need to read the part of the Memorandum Opinion near the end. We have read tokens 11954-14049. That's near the end. But we have not seen the decree text. We need to read further maybe 14049-? But we already read 14000-14100 and got some text that ended with \"Separate orders will issue in each case.\" That might be the final part of the opinion. The order might be earlier.\n\nLet's search for \"Accordingly\" pattern. Or search for \"orders that\". The earlier search for \"(?i)orders? that|orders:|order:\" returned 3 matches in Memorandum Opinion. We need to read those matches.\n\nLet's search again for \"orders? that\" in Memorandum Opinion. But we need to get the token ranges. Let's use search_document_regex on Memorandum Opinion with pattern \"(?i)orders? that|orders:|order:\" and top_k maybe 10.

We have many documents. We need to find court-ordered terms. Likely in Memorandum Opinion (the opinion includes orders). Also Docket includes orders. The orders are in docket entries but might not contain terms. In the opinion, there might be \"orders\" that are the decree terms.\n\nWe should search for regex pattern \"ORDERED\" or \"ORDER TO\" etc. But we need the substantive obligations ordered by the court. We need to extract each distinct term.\n\nFrom the docket entries, there are many \"ORDERED\" items but the content of the orders may be in the docket entry text? The docket entries include \"ORDERED to read and comply with the directives in the attached standing order\" etc. But the standing order text is not included here. The docket entry probably references other documents (like the standing order). So maybe we need to read the standing order document. Which doc is that? It's likely a separate document in the docket (like \"Standing Order\". But not listed. Might be in the docket entries referencing attachments.\n\nWe might need to read the \"Standing Order\" document, but it's not in the catalog. However, the docket entry mentions \"attached standing order\". That may not provide actual terms.\n\nThus we need to look at the Memorandum Opinion for any \"DECREES\" or \"orders\" that include substantive obligations. The opinion may have a \"Decree\" section.\n\nLet's search for \"ORDERED TO\" in the opinion. But we already had search results but no matches for \"ordered that\". We might need to read more of the opinion beyond the 32% coverage we have. We need to read the part that contains the decree.\n\nWe should read more tokens from the Memorandum Opinion where the decree is likely present. The decree might be in the opinion section where it says \"The Court hereby orders that...\". That may be beyond token 14049? Actually the opinion has 14,049 tokens total. We have read 11954-14049 (the last part). That covers the end of the opinion. So the decree might be earlier.\n\nWe have read tokens 6452-6697, 9301-9501, 10299-10499, 11954-14049. The earlier part (first 6452 tokens) might contain the decree. We need to read earlier tokens, maybe 5000-7000 range includes the decree. Let's search for \"DECREES\" or \"DECREED\" or \"ORDERS\" within the opinion. But we already used search for \"orders that\" and \"ordered that\" etc. No matches. Maybe the decree is in a separate document that is the \"Consent Decree\" referenced within the opinion. The \"Consent Decree\" might be a separate doc. But we didn't see it in catalog. It might be in docket entries as attachments. But not listed.\n\nLet's inspect the docket entries for any \"Consent Decree\" attachments. The docket entries show \"Consent MOTION for Extension of Time to File Answer\" etc. No.\n\nThus maybe the decree terms are in the \"Memorandum Opinion\" in the \"Orders\" section. But we didn't find matches. Perhaps the decree is in the \"Memorandum Opinion\" but our regex didn't capture due to case or punctuation. We could search for \"ORDER TO\" or \"ORDERED TO\" or \"ORDERS THAT\" etc. But we already did search for \"ordered that\" and \"ORDERED TO\". But maybe the decree is in the \"COORDINATED\" part, like \"The Court orders the following:\" etc. Let's search for \"orders\" or \"ordered\" with preceding words.\n\nWe can search for regex \"(?i)orders? that|ordered that|the court orders that|the court ordered|the court hereby orders|the court orders|ordered that\". Already did. No matches. Maybe the decree is in a separate \"Court Order\" document that we haven't looked at. But in docket entries, there is \"MINUTE ORDER: The parties are further ORDERED to appear for an in-person Motion Hearing\". But that's not the decree. Maybe the decree is the \"Consent Decree\" itself, which likely is a separate document. But we don't see it.\n\nWait, the docket entries mention \"Consent MOTION for Extension of Time to File Answer\" etc. Those are motions, not decrees.\n\nThe 15th step found 10 matches in the opinion for \"orders that|orders:|order:\" etc. But we didn't read those sections. Those matches likely include the decree. We need to read those sections.\n\nLet's identify the tokens for those matches. We don't have the token numbers. We could run a new search with the same pattern but limit context to e.g., 200 tokens. That will return matches with context. That will give us the decree text. So let's do search_document_regex on Memorandum Opinion for pattern \"(?i)orders? that|orders:|order:\" with context 200. That will give us the text around matches.

We should search for terms that are court orders. We have seen many \"ORDERED\" patterns. But we need to find distinct terms of decrees: e.g., \"ORDERED to read and comply with the directives in the attached standing order\" is a term. Also \"SO ORDERED\" appears. We need to capture each distinct term. Likely we need to find all decree terms: consent decrees, stipulated judgments, injunctions. We should search for \"consent decree\" etc. But earlier search found only 1 match in Memorandum Opinion. Let's search for \"consent decree\" again maybe in Docket? earlier step 9 found none. But maybe other documents. Let's search for \"consent decree\" in all documents. Also \"consent motion\" maybe refers to consent decree? Actually \"consent motion\" is not a decree. We need terms that are substantive obligations ordered by the court. In the Docket we have many \"ORDERED to read and comply with...\" \"SO ORDERED\" etc. But those might be part of orders, not necessarily substantive obligations? But each order imposes obligations. So likely we need to extract each order's substantive obligations. Let's use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern: \"ORDERED to\" or \"SO ORDERED\" and \"ORDERED to\" etc. Already step 27 did search for \"ORDERED to\" and got matches in Docket. But not in other docs. We should read those matches to extract the obligations.\n\nAlso search for \"the parties are hereby ORDERED to\" etc. Let's read those matches thoroughly.\n\nWe have partial coverage of Docket. We should read the matches from earlier search: step 26 had many matches. We have tokens for each match. We need to capture obligations from each. Let's read a few tokens beyond match to capture full sentence. For instance, match 1 in Docket (tokens 269-469) contains \"STANDING ORDER ... The parties are hereby ORDERED to read and comply with the directives in the attached standing order.\" That is a substantive obligation: read and comply with directives. Also match 3 (tokens 629-829) contains \"The parties are further ORDERED to appear for an in-person Motion Hearing ...\". That is an obligation: appear for hearing.\n\nAlso match 4 (tokens 1366-1566) includes \"MINUTE ORDER ... The parties are further ORDERED to appear for an in-person Motion Hearing ...\". Actually similar. Let's read to get full sentences.\n\nWe also have match 6 (2620-2820) with \"Order on Motion for Extension of Time to Answer AND Set/Reset Deadlines ... The Court GRANTS ... SO ORDERED.\" Might include obligation: \"Defendants' response to the Complaint is now due June 24, 2025.\" That's an obligation.\n\nSimilarly match 7 (2961-3161) with \"Order on Motion for Extension of Time to File Response/Reply ...\" includes \"Defendants' reply, if any, is due August 20, 2025.\" etc.\n\nMatch 8 (3299-3499) includes \"MINUTE ORDER: The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' 31 Consent Motion for Briefing Schedule ... Defendants' Renewed Motion to Dismiss is due August 19, 2025.\" etc.\n\nAlso match 9 includes similar.\n\nAlso earlier matches 5 maybe.\n\nWe need to extract each distinct term: each obligation? Could be each specific order. We need to be precise: each distinct value of this checklist item. So each distinct sentence/obligation that is a substantive obligation ordered by court. Should capture the obligation text.\n\nThus we need to read these matches to capture obligations. Let's read Docket tokens around each match fully to capture full sentence.\n\nWe need to read from Docket for each match. Let's use read_document for each match range with some buffer. For example, match 1 tokens 269-469. Let's read 200 tokens around: 200-500? But we already have tokens 269-469. Let's read 200-500 to capture context. Let's do read_document on Docket tokens 200-500.\n\nAlso match 3 tokens 629-829. Read 600-900.\n\nMatch 4 1366-1566. Read 1300-1600.\n\nMatch 6 2620-2820. Read 2600-2900.\n\nMatch 7 2961-3161. Read 2900-3200.\n\nMatch 8 3299-3499. Read 3200-3600.\n\nMatch 9 3365-3565. Read 3300-3600 (already overlapped). Actually 3365-3565 within that same range.\n\nAlso earlier match 5 1041-1241 maybe? That was an order? Not sure. We can read 1000-1300.\n\nAlso match 2 1041-1241 maybe includes \"Notice of Proposed Order - REVISED\". Might not be substantive obligations.\n\nWe should focus on matches that are actual orders with \"ORDERED\".\n\nThus let's read the Docket sections for obligations. We'll issue read_document calls for each.\n\nBut we should be efficient: we can read multiple ranges in one call? read_document only reads one range. So we need multiple calls. Let's plan to read each relevant range.\n\nGiven we can batch patch in one append_checklist call. We'll gather evidence from each read.\n\nLet's start with Docket tokens 200-500.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":200,\"end_token\":500}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 200, "end_token": 500}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9054, "completion_tokens": 1186, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

So standing order is a decree. The \"STANDING ORDER Establishing Procedures for Cases Before Judge Trevor N. McFadden\" is a decree. The minute orders are orders. But \"Consent Motion for Extension of Time to File Answer\" is a motion, not a decree. The decree terms are within the orders. We need all distinct terms of decrees.

We need to read each match's context. Let's request read_document for Docket tokens 600-1000? Already covered 200-829. We need token ranges for each match.

Let's check Docket after 3565: tokens 3565-3591 might include no more orders. But we need to ensure that we captured all orders. The docket entries show many \"MINUTE ORDER\" entries, but we saw only up to token 3565. We need to check if there are any other orders after that.

We need to extract each distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Each term is a substantive obligation ordered by court. So from the Docket, there are many \"ORDERED\" lines.

We might need to search for \"the court hereby orders\" or \"ordered that\". Step 11 and 12 didn't find. Step 15 found matches for \"orders? that\". But we need actual decree wording. In the docket, we have many orders: \"The parties are hereby ORDERED to ...\". But those are procedural orders, not substantive decree terms. We need substantive obligations: e.g., \"The court orders that the Association reinstates ...\", etc. In the memo, we saw the phrase \"the Association wants a sweeping order that ... reinstate ...\". But that was not the actual court order.\n\nWe need to search for \"the court orders\" in the Memorandum Opinion. Step 11 didn't find. Step 12 found 10 matches for \"consent decree|decree|...\" but likely not the order text.\n\nPerhaps the decree terms are in the \"Text of Proposed Order\" in the docket. Docket has many \"Text of Proposed Order\" entries. Those might be the actual orders. We need to read one of those sections to extract terms. Which one? Maybe the first \"Text of Proposed Order\" near token 488-688 includes \"The parties are further ORDERED to appear for ...\". That's a procedural order.\n\nBut maybe there is a \"Text of Proposed Order\" that includes substantive decree terms, e.g., \"The court orders that the Association must do X\". We need to identify which docket entries contain substantive decree terms. We should search for \"orders that\" within the docket again? Step 34 found many ORDERED matches, but not the decree text.\n\nMaybe the \"Text of Proposed Order\" is inside a docket entry that refers to a \"Proposed Order\" filed by the Association. That might be the order text. The docket entries with \"Text of Proposed Order\" appear in many. We could read one of those, like tokens 488-688. But we need to confirm if that contains substantive terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Memorandum Opinion\" contains the final order text. The opinion likely ends with the order. We don't have the text. We need to read near the end of the opinion: e.g., around token 12000-14000 we have a large read. That might include the order. We should read a portion near the end to find the order text.\n\nThus next action: read more of the Memorandum Opinion near the end to capture the order. Use read_document on Memorandum Opinion tokens 12000-14000 (already read). But we didn't parse the extracted text. We need to read again? We have the text from 12000-13000 (step 13), 13000-14000 (step 14). We didn't analyze. We should check those to see if they include the decree terms. The text is not present in the prompt. We need to request reading again? We can read a new window around tokens 14000-15000 maybe.\n\nBut step 16 read tokens 14000-14100 (49 tokens). That might contain the order text. We need to check. We don't have the content. So we need to read that window again. We can read 14000-15000.
