But maybe there is another document that names a monitor. We need to check all other documents. Step 2-7 only searched for \"monitor\" pattern across all documents, found only in Memorandum Opinion.

That might not be a disposition of a monitor, but just a suggestion of what the monitor would do. But we don't have explicit statement of \"no monitor\" either.

The evidence we have is a statement that the court will deny preliminary injunction and mention \"monitor the agency's day-to-day statutory compliance\" as part of plaintiffs' desire. That is not a statement that there is no monitor. But we could argue that evidence shows no monitor was appointed.
