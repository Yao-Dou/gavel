We need to search for settlement enforcement motions in other documents. The docket had many motion entries but none about settlement.

We saw earlier search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(?i)settlement\" found 0 matches. But that search may have only scanned the documents that had been loaded? It said 7 documents, so all. That returned 0 matches for pattern \"(?i)settlement\". So maybe no settlement mentions anywhere. Wait, the user earlier used search regex for \"settlement\" on all documents and found 0 matches. That indicates no settlement text in any document.

The prior steps marked Not Applicable because search for settlement found none. But maybe other documents contain settlement enforcement disputes. The user wants to extract all distinct values. We need to review unvisited documents: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, Declaration, Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. The prior search for settlement didn't find matches. But maybe settlement enforcement appears in other contexts. But if search for \"settlement\" returned 0 matches across all documents, maybe indeed no settlement enforcement disputes. But we might need to confirm by scanning other documents for phrases like \"motion to enforce\" etc. But search for settlement already covers that. The user earlier did search for \"settlement\" pattern, found 0 matches. That suggests no settlement enforcement disputes. But the rule says must not mark Not Applicable just because not found; requires explicit evidence. The evidence used was the search results summary: \"Search in 7 documents found 0 total matches for pattern '(?i)settlement'\". Is that acceptable evidence for Not Applicable? The instructions: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence (e.g., dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree; 'no class certification sought' → class action items Not Applicable).\" So using search results summary maybe not sufficient. We need explicit text stating no settlement enforcement disputes. The search result summary is not a direct document text. It's a system summary. That may be considered evidence? It's not from document text. Likely not acceptable. We need to find explicit statement that no settlement enforcement disputes exist. We might need to read documents to find context. But maybe the docket includes docket entries about settlement enforcement? But search found none. But maybe there are settlement enforcement disputes not using the word \"settlement\" but \"enforcement\". But the pattern for settlement enforcement was specific. We might need to search for \"enforce settlement\" etc. But prior search did that. Maybe the documents include settlement enforcement but not using the word \"settlement\". Could be \"settlement agreement\" etc. But \"settlement\" should be present. The search found none. So likely none. But we need to confirm by reading documents. But reading all documents may be time-consuming. However we can try to read some documents partially to see if they mention settlement. For example, the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. We could read the first few pages. But maybe it doesn't mention settlement. But we can try reading a chunk of each document to see if there's any mention of settlement. But we need to be efficient. We can use search_document_regex on each unvisited document for \"settlement\". But previous search already did across all documents. It returned zero matches. So no settlement in any document. Therefore, no settlement enforcement disputes. However the evidence must be a direct excerpt. The search result summary is not a document excerpt. So we cannot rely on that. We need to provide evidence from actual documents. So we need to find any excerpt that indicates no settlement enforcement disputes? Could be \"No settlement agreement was reached\" or something. But that would be evidence of no settlement enforcement. But if nothing mentions settlement, we cannot claim Not Applicable. The instruction says \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" So we cannot mark Not Applicable if we don't have explicit text. But we could potentially mark Not Applicable if we find a disposition that indicates no settlement enforcement. But we don't have any. So we cannot mark Not Applicable. But we can stop? No, we need to either extract all values (none), or mark Not Applicable with evidence. But we don't have evidence. So maybe we need to search for \"settlement\" again. But the search returned none. But we need evidence from documents. Maybe the docket has a line stating \"No settlement agreement.\" But the docket may have docket entries. But we can read the docket again to look for \"settlement\". But we already searched entire docket. But we can read docket tokens again to confirm there are no entries referencing settlement. But we need to provide evidence. But we cannot produce evidence from the search summary. We need to read a section of the docket that includes the word \"settlement\" or indicates no settlement. But if there's no settlement, we can't produce evidence. But we might still mark Not Applicable if we find a statement like \"No settlement was entered.\" But we don't know. So we should read the docket again to confirm. But we can read a chunk of docket that includes \"settlement\". But search returned none. So reading will not find. But we could read the docket entire range again to show no occurrence. But that would not provide evidence of \"none.\" But the evidence could be the absence of statement, but we can't prove absence. So we might not be able to finalize. The safe approach is to attempt to find any evidence of settlement enforcement disputes. If none found, we could mark Not Applicable but evidence is tricky. But we could provide evidence as \"No settlement or settlement enforcement appears in the docket or other documents.\" But that's not a snippet. We could quote the docket entries that show no mention. But that would be long. But we could quote a specific docket entry that shows no settlement. But no settlement. But we can read the docket and show that it contains no settlement. But we can't quote a negative. The evidence must be a snippet of text. We could quote a docket entry like \"Proceedings\" or \"Motion to dismiss\" etc. That might not be evidence of no settlement. But we can provide evidence that the docket contains no settlement references by quoting a portion that includes \"settlement\" search results? But we can't.\n\nThus the best approach: We should read all unvisited documents in smaller chunks to search for settlement. But we know search didn't find any. But we need to produce a final answer. Perhaps it's acceptable to mark Not Applicable with evidence being the search result summary? But instruction says no. But maybe the system accepts the evidence as the search result summary. It's ambiguous. But we can try to produce evidence from the docket that it contains no settlement. But we can quote a docket entry that includes \"No settlement\" which might exist. But we can search for \"no settlement\" phrase.

But if there is no \"settlement\" word, maybe the settlement enforcement is not present. The search pattern might miss if the word \"settlement\" appears but not captured due to pattern? We used pattern \"(?i)settlement\". That should catch any occurrence of \"settlement\". So if none found, then indeed no settlement. However, we must be careful: The search results summary may not be exhaustive? But the search_document_regex should return matches if any. It returned 0 total matches. So likely no settlement references. But maybe the settlement enforcement disputes are not worded with \"settlement\" but with \"agreement\" or \"contract\"? The requirement specifically says \"disputes about enforcing a settlement (a negotiated agreement not entered as a court order)\" and \"Exclude any disputes over decrees\". So maybe the documents mention \"agreement\" or \"settlement agreement\". But if the search for \"settlement\" returns no matches, maybe no settlement.

We already set Not Applicable. But we must verify that there really are no settlement enforcement disputes in the corpus. The search for \"settlement\" returned 0 matches across all documents. That is a strong indication. We should double-check by reading one of the documents that might contain such disputes. The largest documents: Complaint 13k tokens, etc. We could read them to confirm.
