The complaint likely does not mention class action; maybe not. We need to search for \"class action\" but earlier search returned 0 matches.

We need to search for \"class action\" again but maybe pattern \"class action\" is case insensitive. The earlier search returned 0 matches in all 7 docs. Maybe the case is not a class action; if no evidence of class action, we need to mark Not Applicable. But we need explicit evidence. The docket might say \"class action\" or \"class representative\". If none, maybe it's individual plaintiffs. But we need description of individuals if individual. The complaint mentions plaintiffs: Association for Education Finance and Policy, and Institute for Higher Education Policy. Those are associations, not individuals. So maybe the plaintiffs are organizations, not individuals. The classification might be \"Class Action\" if a class is represented. Likely not a class action. The checklist expects \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" or \"Class Action\". We need evidence. If no evidence of class action, we might conclude Not Applicable? But the rule: Not Applicable only if explicit evidence that the item is not applicable. For class action status, if the lawsuit is not a class action, the key is \"Not Applicable\" because the item is about class action status? Wait: The item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". It expects to indicate whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs. So if it's not a class action, we should indicate \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\". But the plaintiffs are organizations, not individuals. So maybe the correct answer is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Association for Education Finance and Policy, and Institute for Higher Education Policy\". But are those individuals? They are associations. But the guideline says \"brief description of the individuals when applicable\". Here it's organizations. Might still be \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" is wrong because they are not individuals. The correct classification might be \"Class action\" if class representative. But no evidence. Could be \"Not Applicable\" if the concept of class action doesn't apply because it's not a class action. But the item is not about whether a class action is applicable, but the status of plaintiffs.

There could be multiple distinct values: e.g., \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\" or perhaps \"Plaintiffs: Class Action, with individual plaintiffs described as ...\".\n\nWe need to check all documents.

But we already used pattern \"class action\" with default flags? The earlier search had pattern \"class action\" with default flags maybe none. Could try with IGNORECASE. But we don't know if search_document_regex will treat pattern case-insensitively.

Let's read a portion of that document. The \"First Amended Complaint\" likely contains the same info, but we need to check. So we need to read maybe tokens 0-2000 of that doc.\n\nLet's do read_document on \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" tokens 0-2000.

But maybe some documents are Individual (e.g., Declaration of Abigail Doe). But that is a declaration, not a pleading. So may not be \"plaintiffs\" designation. But the classification refers to the plaintiffs in the case. So all documents likely refer to plaintiffs as class action. Could be that some documents might be \"Individual\" if there was a motion for individual? We need check other documents like \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\". Might refer to \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" if the plaintiff is a single entity. But the motion probably refers to same plaintiffs. So classification is same.\n\nThus only one unique value: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\".\n\nBut we need to extract evidence from text. We have evidence snippet from Complaint doc that indicates plaintiffs are a group. Let's find a snippet: the excerpt shows \"Plaintiffs,\" line after \"Association for Education Finance and Policy, Inc., and The Institute for Higher Education Policy\". That indicates group. Also earlier \"Plaintiffs,\" line. That is evidence.\n\nWe need to append this value. But we already appended one value earlier. We need to confirm maybe there are multiple values? But step 5 appended 1 value. We need to check if any other documents provide \"Individual\" classification. Let's search for \"Individual\" maybe in \"Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\". Could be that the motion refers to \"Plaintiffs\" as \"class action\" also. But no difference.\n\nLet's search for \"individual plaintiffs\" pattern. Use search_document_regex on all docs for \"individual plaintiffs\" or \"individual\" maybe.\n\nBut first, we should confirm that the classification is indeed class action. We can read more of Complaint to see a heading like \"Plaintiffs\" etc. But we already saw part. Might be enough.\n\nBut to be safe, we should read more of the Complaint to capture phrase \"Class Action\". Let's search for \"Class Action\" in the Complaint. Use search_document_regex on \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" for pattern \"Class Action\". If found, we can capture.\n\nAlso maybe the Complaint has a caption line with \"Class Action\" in the title. Let's search.\n\nAlso \"First Amended Complaint\" may also have similar. Let's search for \"Class Action\" across all docs. Use search_document_regex on all docs pattern \"Class Action\". That will return matches.\n\nBut we need to ensure we don't read entire 13034 tokens. The search will return context. That might be efficient.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex on all docs pattern \"Class Action\" with context 200? We'll do that.\n\nBut we already searched for \"class action\" (lowercase). But maybe the case uses \"Class action\" with capital C. Could be not found due to case sensitivity? We used flags default none. Without IGNORECASE, pattern \"class action\" matches only lowercase. We can use IGNORECASE. Let's search with IGNORECASE. That may find.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern \"Class Action\", flags [\"IGNORECASE\"], context_tokens 200, top_k maybe 5.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Class Action\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Class Action", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5270, "completion_tokens": 1048, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Both had a class action? The appended value from Step 5 likely came from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. We need to extract all distinct values of Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs across all documents. We have not searched all documents; we did regex searches for \"class action\" but found no matches. That might mean that the documents don't use the phrase \"class action\" but maybe they use \"class action lawsuit\" or \"class action suit\" or \"class action\" is not present. The appended value maybe from a different pattern. Let's examine what the appended value was. We don't have the actual appended value text. Need to read the portion of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief that contains the class action designation. Let's read more of that document beyond 0-2000, maybe find a phrase that indicates \"class action\" or \"class action lawsuit\" or \"class action\". We'll search for \"Class Action\" again but maybe it's not matched due to case sensitivity? The regex search was case-sensitive by default? The flags default none; we used pattern \"class action\" (lowercase). Might miss \"Class Action\" capitalized. We also used \"Class Action\" pattern but found 0. So maybe the phrase \"class action\" is not present; maybe they didn't describe plaintiffs as class action. The appended value may be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\"? Let's examine the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief snippet. At top we saw parties: \"Association for Education Finance and Policy, Inc.\" and \"Institute for Higher Education Policy\" as plaintiffs. They are groups, so they might be acting as a class? But likely they are acting as a class; maybe the complaint states \"Plaintiffs bring this action as a class\" somewhere else. We need to find that. Let's search for \"class\" in the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. We'll use search_document_regex with pattern \"class\" maybe? But that is too generic. Let's search for \"class action\" but the search returned no matches. Maybe the phrase \"class action\" appears in a footnote? But we can't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the appended value from Step 5 came from the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief but the actual value might have been \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". That would be a generic classification. That might be the only value. But we need to extract all distinct values. There might be multiple: maybe plaintiffs are class action; also maybe some plaintiffs are individual. Let's search for \"Plaintiff\" terms. But we need classification: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". So we need to find if any plaintiffs are described individually. The complaint lists two plaintiffs: Association for Education Finance and Policy, Inc. and The Institute for Higher Education Policy. Those are organizations, not individuals. So classification likely \"Class Action\". But maybe there are also individual plaintiffs described later. But likely not.\n\nLet's read more of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief beyond 2000 tokens to see if there's a description of plaintiffs as a class.

We need to determine if plaintiffs are class action or individual. The complaint likely states \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" etc. We need to find all distinct values in any document.\n\nLet's inspect the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for the phrase \"Class Action\" or \"class action\" maybe not present.

Already did search with \"class action\" (lowercase) and \"Class Action\" (capitalized). No matches.

Already did earlier but got 0 matches. But perhaps we need to search for \"Class Action\" with different punctuation like \"Class‑Action\"? But unlikely.\n\nMaybe the class action status is indicated by \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" in the complaint. Let's find the extracted value: In Step 5, they appended a value. We need to read the value. Could be 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...'. Let's read the portion where the value was extracted. That was likely from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. Let's search for \"Plaintiffs:\" again in that document. Search result earlier returned 0 matches. But perhaps the phrase appears as \"Plaintiffs\" but no colon. The extracted value might come from a line like \"Plaintiffs, Association for Education Finance and Policy, Inc. and the Institute for Higher Education Policy, Inc.\" That would be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Association for Education Finance and Policy, Inc. and the Institute for Higher Education Policy, Inc.\" So the extracted value might be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Association for Education Finance and Policy, Inc. and the Institute for Higher Education Policy, Inc.\" So that's the only value.\n\nBut we need to ensure no other documents mention class action. Let's search for \"class action\" in the Plaintiff's Motion. Might have \"class action\" but maybe not.\n\nAlso, the Motion may specify \"Plaintiffs\" but again no class action.\n\nThus likely only one value. We need to confirm no other distinct values exist; thus we can stop. But we need to ensure we have extracted evidence for the value.

The system may keep track but we don't see the evidence. We can still provide stop because the key is considered filled.\n\nBut might need to verify if any other documents contain a different classification like \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\".

Search for \"Plaintiffs:\" pattern in all documents with regex.\n\nLet's call search_document_regex for doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"Plaintiffs:\" maybe with colon. But earlier search found 0 matches. So no.\n\nSearch for \"Class Action\" again? Already did.\n\nThus likely only one value.\n\nHowever, there might be documents that are class action filings like \"Class Action Complaint\" but no matches.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we must be sure that the extracted value is indeed the correct classification. The extracted value may have been incorrectly labeled as \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Association for Education Finance and Policy, Inc. and the Institute for Higher Education Policy, Inc.\" The classification is \"Individual\" not \"Class Action\".
