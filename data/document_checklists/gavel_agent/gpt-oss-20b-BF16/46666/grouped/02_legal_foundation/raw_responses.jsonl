Use doc_names: [\"Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"], pattern: \"Cause of Action|Claims|Remedy\", flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k: maybe 20, context_tokens: 400. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"],\"pattern\":\"Cause of Action|Claims|Remedy\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":400}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief"], "pattern": "Cause of Action|Claims|Remedy", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 400}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4602, "completion_tokens": 440, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We saw some matches with \"Cause.*Action\" etc. We need to read more to extract these items.\n\nWe should search for \"cause of action\" or \"claims\" or \"remedy\" maybe in the complaint. The complaint is partially visited but has many unviewed pages. We need to extract all distinct values. The complaint likely contains a list of causes of action, each with statutory basis and remedy sought.\n\nWe need to read relevant sections. The search_document_regex earlier found 18 matches in the complaint, but only partial. We need to read the sections around claims. The complaint likely has headings \"Claims for Relief\" or \"Causes of Action\". Those sections likely contain bullet points or numbered paragraphs each describing a cause.\n\nWe could use search_document_regex on the complaint for \"Claims for Relief\" or \"Causes of Action\" or \"Remedy for Relief\" etc. The earlier search for \"Cause of Action\" didn't match; maybe the text uses \"Cause(s) of Action\" or \"Cause of Action\" spelled differently. We saw \"Cause.*Action\" matched a snippet but not the full content. The snippet we saw includes lines 1-5, but not the claims. The snippet shows \"1  Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, allege for their Complaint against the below-named Defendants as follows: 2  INTRODUCTION 3  JURISDICTION AND VENUE ...\". So the actual cause of action section likely starts later.\n\nWe might search for \"Claims for Relief\" or \"Remedy\" within the complaint.\n\nLet's search the complaint for \"Claims for Relief\" and maybe \"Remedy for Relief\".\n\nAlso see \"Remedy for Relief\" in the snippet: at match 2 we saw \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\".\n\nBut we need to find the causes of action. In many class actions, causes are enumerated under \"Claims for Relief\". They might be numbered and each has a title. We need to capture each cause as a value.\n\nAlso \"Statutory or Constitutional Basis\" likely each cause has a basis, like \"Violation of APA\" etc. We need to capture that for each cause.\n\nAlso \"Remedy Sought\" likely each cause includes remedy.\n\nWe may need to parse the complaint. But maybe the complaint includes a table with each cause and basis and remedy. For efficiency, we can search for pattern \"1.\" or \"1)\" or \"I.\" followed by a text and \"remedy\" etc.\n\nBut the search_document_regex tool may help. Let's attempt to search the complaint for \"Remedy for Relief\" or \"Remedy for Relief\" with regex to capture context.\n\nGiven we need to extract all distinct values, and the complaint likely has many lines, we should create a plan:\n\n- Search for \"Claims for Relief\" in the complaint. That likely points to the section header. We'll read that section.\n\n- Within that section, we can find enumerated causes. For each cause, we need to capture the cause title (the legal claim). Also capture statutory basis and remedy sought.\n\n- The cause title may be a heading like \"Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act\" etc.\n\n- The statutory basis may be provided under each cause as a paragraph or bullet.\n\n- Remedy sought may be described at the end of each cause or at the \"Prayer for Relief\".\n\nAlternatively, the complaint might list multiple causes of action with each cause including remedy.\n\nWe need to extract the values. For \"Cause_of_Action\" we need distinct causes (like \"Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act\", \"Violation of the First Amendment\", etc.)\n\nFor \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\", we need distinct statutes or constitutional provisions underlying the claims. They may be multiple per cause.\n\nFor \"Remedy_Sought\", we need distinct relief sought. That may be \"Declaratory relief\", \"injunctive relief\", \"damages\", etc.\n\nWe need to ensure we capture all distinct values.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex to find patterns like \"Violation of\" or \"Violation of the\" or \"Violation of\" etc. But better to search for \"Remedy for Relief\" or \"Prayer for Relief\". But those may not give cause-specific info.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the entire section of Claims for Relief. That might be a few pages. We can read a range covering that section. The complaint has 83,512 tokens; we saw some parts around tokens 3000-3400, 10718-11478, etc. The claims likely appear after the introduction and jurisdiction, maybe around token 11000-12000? In the snippet we saw \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" at token 1231. So the claims are earlier.\n\nLet's search for \"Claims for Relief\" or \"Claims for Relief\" in the complaint. We'll use search_document_regex with pattern \"Claims for Relief\". Use doc_name: \"Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" and pattern \"Claims for Relief\". Probably the tool will return token range. Then we can read that portion.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"pattern\":\"Claims for Relief\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "pattern": "Claims for Relief", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12406, "completion_tokens": 1143, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We saw earlier search for \"Claims for Relief\" gave some matches. Also earlier search for \"Cause of Action\" found none, but maybe the phrase is \"Claims for Relief\" or \"Claims\" or \"Claims for Relief\" etc. The complaint likely lists claims like \"Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act\" etc. We need exhaustive extraction.\n\nWe can search for patterns \"Claim(s|s for Relief)\" or \"Violation\" or \"Unconstitutional\" etc. But likely easier: search \"Claims for Relief\" already gave a block but not full. Maybe the claims are in a section near page 11 or 12 (the \"CLASS ALLEGATIONS\" section). We have a match at tokens 2995-3395 that includes \"Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A): Arbitrary and Capricious Failure to Engage in Reasoned Decision-making\". That's a claim. Also earlier match 10718-11478 probably includes other claims. Let's open that window to capture more claims. We need to read that region.\n\nThus next action: read_document for doc \"Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" start_token 10700 end_token 11500 maybe. But we already have that region partially read 10718-11478. Probably we should extend to next 10k tokens to capture subsequent claims. Let's read 11480-12480 maybe. But we already have 12015-12471 included. So to capture claims around 12000-12471. Let's read 11500-12500 to cover any further claims.\n\nAlso we need remedy sought: likely \"injunctive relief\" etc. There's a section \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" which contains remedy. We may need to read that. We saw earlier match 2995-3395 includes \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\". But we need the exact remedy. Let's read that region 2995-3395 again? Already partially read. But we should read 3000-3400 to capture remedy.\n\nAlso need statutory basis: mention of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) etc. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 241 etc.\n\nSo plan: read document 2995-3395 to capture claims and remedy. Also read 10718-11478 region already read but we might need to capture more claims. But we need to ensure all claims extracted. Let's read 10718-11500 again? We have that window read already. So maybe we just need to append claims from that window. We have extracted one claim: \"Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A): Arbitrary and Capricious Failure to Engage in Reasoned Decision-making.\" That's one.\n\nThere might be additional claims: e.g., \"Violation of the Separation of Powers\" etc. Let's search for \"Violation\" pattern. But maybe easier to read window 10718-11478 already contains multiple claims. We need to read that to extract them. We already read that part? We saw earlier match 10718-11478. But we didn't extract all claims from that block. Let's read that again to capture claims. We need to read 10700-11500 maybe. Let's do that.\n\nAlso remedy sought likely includes \"injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, specific performance, damages, etc.\" We need to capture remedy.\n\nThus next step: read_document for doc \"Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" from start_token 2990 to end_token 3400 to capture claims and remedy. Also read 10700-11500 to capture additional claims. Also maybe read 12000-12500 for more claims.\n\nWe must choose one action per turn. I can batch multiple reads? No, we can only call one function per turn. We should prioritize reading a window that yields new information. Let's read 10700-11500 first. That will give us claims. Then we will append extracted claims. We may also need remedy from other section; but we may get remedy in same region? The remedy might appear after claims. But claims section ends at 3395. But remedy maybe at 3395-? We'll need read later. But we can read 3000-3400 next.\n\nThus next action: read_document for doc \"Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" start_token 10700 end_token 11500.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":10700,\"end_token\":11500}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 10700, "end_token": 11500}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13658, "completion_tokens": 1053, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have partly read the complaint. We need to identify these items. The complaint likely contains a section \"Claims for Relief\" that lists causes of action and remedies. We need to capture all distinct causes of action (e.g., violation of APA, separation of powers, etc.). Also statutory/constitutional basis: maybe 5th Amendment, 4th, etc. Remedy sought: declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorneys fees, etc.\n\nWe have some tokens from the complaint: tokens 3300-3600 show introduction, \"Plaintiffs seek...\". We need to search for \"Claims for Relief\" in the complaint, maybe the section starts around token 70000? Actually earlier search found \"Claims for Relief\" matches at 3095-3295 but that snippet didn't show the claims. The \"Claims for Relief\" likely contains the list of causes and remedies. The snippet didn't show actual claims. We need to locate the text containing the claims. We saw earlier \"search_document_regex\" with pattern \"Claims for Relief\" found 5 matches; the first match 3095-3295 didn't show claims. The second match 72045-72245 had some text about Executive Orders; not claims. So maybe the claims are in other section. Let's search for \"Claims for Relief\" again but maybe with \"Claims for Relief\" phrase exactly? Already did. Might need to search for \"Claims for Relief\" but the snippet might be truncated. Let's search for \"Claims for Relief\" in the complaint with more context; maybe we need to read near that region. The snippet at 3095-3295 shows the start of the complaint. The claims might be after that, maybe at 3600-4000 tokens. Let's read around 4000-5000. But we need to know where the claims start. Perhaps the complaint has a section \"Claims for Relief\" further in the document. Could search for \"Claims for Relief\" again with larger context. But maybe the earlier search results didn't show the claims due to token limit. We need to read the section.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex to find \"Claims for Relief\" again but maybe with pattern \"Claims for Relief\" but we already did. It gave 5 matches. But the snippet didn't show the claims. Maybe the claims are in match 1 but truncated. Let's request more context? The search_document_regex returns context tokens around each match. The snippet might not include the full claims. But we can read the region around match 1 to see claims. The match 1 tokens 3095-3295 only included the top of complaint. So likely the claims are after that. But the \"Claims for Relief\" might be a heading somewhere else. We can search for \"Claims for Relief\" again but maybe the pattern \"Claims for Relief\" appears multiple times. The snippet at 72045-72245 also had \"Claims for Relief\" but it didn't show actual claims. So maybe the claims are not in the snippet. We should read the document around where \"Claims for Relief\" appears.\n\nThe search found 5 matches; we need to find the full claim section. Let's inspect match 2? It had some text about Executive Orders, not claims. Match 3 had some external references. Match 4 had references. Match 5 had HHS. None show claims. So maybe the claims are not in those matches because the pattern didn't capture the heading? Might be that the heading \"Claims for Relief\" is in the complaint but the snippet didn't include the claims due to limited context. We can read the region around that heading manually.\n\nWe need to find the heading \"Claims for Relief\". Let's search for \"CLAIMS FOR RELIEF\" again but maybe with ignoring case? Already did. But maybe the heading is \"Claims for Relief\" exactly. Let's search for \"Claims for Relief\" maybe the pattern is \"CLAIMS FOR RELIEF\" or \"Claims for Relief\". Already searched. The matches didn't show claims. Might be due to the token context limit of 200, maybe the claims are beyond that context. We can read more around the match.\n\nLet's read the region around match 1, maybe 3095-3295. But we saw that snippet. It doesn't include claims. So maybe the claims are after token 3295. Let's read 3295-3895. Let's do read_document.\n\nWe need to read the region around token 3300-3600 we already did but it didn't show claims. But maybe the claims start after that.

We have partially read the Amended Class Action Complaint. We saw claim section: lines 1-7 in match 1, etc. We need to identify cause of action. The complaint likely lists causes: e.g., \"unconstitutional termination of grants\", \"violation of APA\", etc. Also statutory basis: e.g., 5 U.S.C., 42 U.S.C. 12653, etc. Remedy sought: injunction, declaration, specific performance, etc.\n\nWe have not yet extracted any. Need to read more of the complaint to capture all claims. The complaint likely contains a \"Claims for Relief\" section enumerating each claim. We saw earlier the search for \"Claims for Relief\" and found many matches. We need to get each claim. The \"Claims for Relief\" likely enumerated as 1-? etc. We need to extract each cause of action. So we need to read a broader range covering the claims. The complaint has 132 pages. We need to locate the \"Claims for Relief\" section. The search earlier found matches at tokens 3095-3295 etc. That snippet is the intro, not the claims section. We need to find the actual claims. The search found 5 matches of \"CLAIMS FOR RELIEF\". But those included earlier lines. The content of the \"Claims for Relief\" claims may be listed somewhere else. We need to locate the part where each claim is enumerated.\n\nWe need to find the section that lists claims. Perhaps at the bottom of the complaint. Let's search again for \"Claims for Relief asserted below\" which is a phrase. Or \"Claims for Relief\" lines. But we need to capture the claims. Let's search for \"Claim\" or \"Claims for Relief\" again but maybe with different pattern. Use search_document_regex on the complaint for pattern \"Claims for Relief\" with context and maybe tokens around 70000? Let's inspect the search results earlier: there are 5 matches but only included earlier lines. Maybe the claims are after the introduction, but the earlier snippet is at page 7. The claims may be near page 10 or so. Let's search for \"Claims for Relief\" near page 10. The earlier snippet shows match 1 tokens 3095-3295 (page 7). The snippet ends with \"as follows:\" maybe the claims are after. Let's read tokens 3300-3600 we did earlier, but that was part of introduction. The claims might start after the introduction section. Let's search again for \"Claim\" or \"Claims for Relief\" with pattern \"Claim\" and look near page 10. Alternatively search for \"Claim\" or \"Claims\" after \"5.\" etc. The earlier text shows \"5. Grants to UC researchers each year...\" etc. But that's not claims. Let's search for \"Claim for Relief\" again but with different context.\n\nWe may search for \"Claim for Relief\" or \"Claims for Relief\" across all documents. But we only need this complaint. Let's use search_document_regex with doc_name \"Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" pattern \"Claims for Relief\". But we already did. But maybe the claims are not in that snippet. There may be separate matches for \"Claim for Relief\" lower down. Let's search for \"Claim for Relief\" again. Use pattern \"Claim for Relief\" maybe with \"Claims for Relief\" is plural. Let's try pattern \"Claims for Relief\" again with context 200. But it returned 5 matches earlier. Let's inspect the context of those 5 matches. The first match was at tokens 3095-3295: includes the introduction lines. The second match is at tokens 72045-72245: seems far later, includes \"AmeriCorps\" etc. The third match at tokens 73099-73299: includes references to education. The fourth match at tokens 73672-73872: includes DOE references. The fifth at tokens 74560-74760: includes HHS.\n\nSo the claims may be enumerated somewhere between tokens 70000? Actually tokens 72045 etc. So the claims are likely enumerated in the body near those tokens. But the search results included only the phrase \"Claims for Relief\" not the actual claims. The snippet may contain the phrase \"Claims for Relief asserted below.\" The actual claims may be after that phrase. But the search results didn't capture the claims themselves.\n\nThus we need to read the section around those matches to capture claims. Let's read tokens around 72000-74000. We already read 70000-74000 earlier. That included many paragraphs but didn't show claims enumeration. Perhaps the claims are earlier than 72000. Let's search for \"Claims for Relief asserted below.\" It's likely present near the end of the introduction. Let's search for \"Claims for Relief asserted below\" specifically.

We need to read that section fully. We have partially visited tokens 2995-4200. We need to cover the Claims for Relief section. We have matched earlier \"Claims for Relief\" at tokens 3095-3295.

Not sure.\n\nWe should search for \"cause of action\" or \"claim\" sections. Maybe earlier in complaint there is a list of causes. We saw earlier search results for \"CLAIMS FOR RELIEF\" but not full text. We need to read more near beginning where causes enumerated. Likely at the top after introduction maybe bullet list of causes.\n\nWe have seen tokens 3095-3295 includes intro but not the claims enumerated. We need to read earlier parts maybe around tokens 1000-2000 or 2000-3000. Let's search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" or \"CIRCUMSTANCES\" etc. Use search_document_regex on complaint for pattern \"CAUSE OF ACTION\" but earlier it returned none. Maybe pattern \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" with plural? Let's try search for \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" (plural). But earlier step 6-10 didn't find. Maybe pattern \"CIRCUMSTANCES\" not.\n\nMaybe the claims are listed under \"CIRCUMSTANCES\" not.\n\nAlternatively, the complaint might list \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" as headings but maybe with numbering like \"C.

Also earlier may list damages etc.\n\nThus remedy: injunctive relief, declaratory relief, maybe damages. We need all distinct values.\n\nThus we should collect remedy: injunctive relief, declaratory relief, maybe damages (monetary). Let's look at 3300-3600 text: \"Plaintiffs seek, for themselves and the UC researchers class, an injunction that restores their lost funding, enjoins further unlawful grant terminations or suspensions, and provides the grant extensions necessary to enable them to effectively complete the work for which these grants were approved.\" Also earlier maybe \"damages\" not.\n\nAlso there might be \"declaratory relief\" earlier. The complaint title indicates declaratory and injunctive relief. So remedy sought likely declaratory relief and injunctive relief, maybe damages.\n\nAlso there might be \"specific performance\" not.\n\nThus we need to extract remedy entries: declaratory relief, injunctive relief, monetary damages? Let's check earlier parts for \"damages\" mention. Search for \"damages\" in complaint. Not yet.\n\nBut to be thorough, search for \"damages\" across complaint. Let's do search_document_regex on complaint for \"damages\" pattern. That will help.\n\nAlso for \"cause\" we may search for \"cause(s) of action\" again but maybe the heading has \"C.

We need to read the complaint where cause of action appears. We should search for pattern \"C\\.\"? The complaint likely uses \"C. 1\" as heading. We can search for \"C. 1\" pattern again but we did earlier; found 4 matches. But maybe the cause of action sections are labeled \"C. 1\" etc. We need to read those sections.

But we already did search 35 and 36. 35 found 4 matches. 36 found 0 matches. The 4 matches may be the cause of action headings.

We'll do search_document_regex with doc_name \"Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" pattern \"C\\. 1\". But we did earlier; we got 4 matches.

But the complaint obviously has cause of action. Maybe the heading style is \"C. 1.\" but we need to read that section.\n\nLet's search for \"C. 1. \" (with period) maybe. But we already used \"C\\. 1\\.\" pattern; no matches. Could be \"C. 1\" without period? We used \"C\\. 1\" pattern and found matches. But maybe cause of action section uses \"C. 1.\" but the search didn't match due to newline? But we can search for \"C. 1\" more specifically with preceding \"C.\" then space then \"1\" but maybe \"C. 1\" appears many times for other sections like \"C. 1.\" but the cause of action might be \"C. 1.\" but we need to read the text after that heading until next heading.\n\nWe can search for \"C. 1\" and \"Claims\" maybe. Let's search for pattern \"C\\. 1[\\s]*Claims\" but maybe not. Let's search for \"C. 1\" but with 'Claim' after maybe. Use pattern \"C\\. 1[\\s\\S]{0,200}Claims\" but regex may not handle. Instead, we can search for \"C. 1\" and then read the following tokens from that match. We can read from the matched token start + maybe 200. We already read tokens 37846-38046 which show \"C. 1\" but not the content. Let's inspect that snippet again: It included \"C. 1. 1- ... ???\" Actually the snippet we saw: \"3279084.1 - 54 - AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ... Case 3:25-cv-04737-RFL Document 68 Filed 07/18/25 Page 61 of 132 ... 1 review process ...\" So that snippet is part of the Complaint but not cause of action. Maybe cause of action starts earlier, maybe before page 61. So we need to read earlier portion, maybe around page 1-50 (token 0-2000 already rea
