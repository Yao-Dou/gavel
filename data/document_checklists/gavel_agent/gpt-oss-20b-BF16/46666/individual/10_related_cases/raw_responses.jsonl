We have many matches from search, but need to confirm actual case numbers. The search pattern \"Case\\s*No\\.?\\s*[:\\s]*[A-Z0-9-]+\" found many. We need to capture each distinct case number from the documents.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on all documents to get matches. We already did partially but only first 57 matches of 57 total? Actually the search in step 2 returned 57 matches across 11 docs. That likely includes all matches. We need to extract all distinct case numbers. The matches include many. Let's run search again with all docs but maybe we need to capture all matches. But the earlier search returned 57 matches across documents. That might cover all. But we need to ensure we have all case numbers. Could be more in documents not fully visited? But search covers all docs. It returned 57 matches, but not necessarily all case numbers because some might not match pattern? Could be \"Case No. 25-4249\" etc. The pattern should capture typical case numbers. The search results list examples but not all. However we need to extract all distinct case numbers.\n\nWe could search again with pattern capturing \"Case No\\.?[:\\s]*([A-Z0-9-:]+)\" to capture group? But the function does not return groups; just context. We can read the matches to find.\n\nWe should read the matches from the earlier search. We can request the search results again? We don't have the raw matches, just a summary. We could re-run search to get all matches again. That will give us the context. Let's do search_document_regex with all docs, pattern same. That will return top_k matches per doc with context. But we can set top_k large, maybe 100. But the function default top_k 5. We need all matches. We can set top_k 20 maybe. But there are 57 matches across 11 docs. We can fetch all by top_k 57.

We have search results with many matches. We need to gather all distinct case codes. The search regex pattern \"Case\\s*No\\.?:?\\s*[A-Z0-9-]+\" matched many. We need to extract all unique case numbers. We need to use search_document_regex to get all matches across all documents. The earlier attempt had error due to top_k >20? Wait error: top_k input should be <=20. They passed top_k=57. We need to provide top_k <=20. We can set top_k=20 to get top 20 matches per document. But we need all unique case numbers; maybe the matches per doc may exceed 20. But we can do multiple searches? We can use search_document_regex with doc_names array specifying all docs? That still returns top_k per doc. To get all matches, maybe we need to set top_k high but capped at 20. So we might need to do iterative approach: first get top 20 per doc, then maybe adjust pattern to capture others? But maybe 20 matches per doc is enough? The requirement: extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So we need all case numbers. We might need to scan all matches. We can use search_document_regex on all docs with top_k large but capped at 20, so we may miss some. But maybe the 57 matches reported earlier were from earlier search with top_k default? Actually earlier search: pattern \"Case\\s*No\\.?\\s*[:\\s]*[A-Z0-9-]+\" returned 57 total matches across all docs. That seems to be the total matches across docs. That was before error. So maybe default top_k is 5? But earlier search showed 57 matches, so maybe the function returned all matches disregarding top_k? Hard to know. But we can replicate that search again with default top_k? The earlier attempt had error due to top_k=57. So if we don't set top_k, it uses default 5. That might only return 5 per doc. But earlier search gave 57 total matches, but maybe that was from an earlier run with top_k=57? Wait earlier Step 3 had error: they attempted search_document_regex with top_k 57, causing error. But the earlier step 2 search had 57 matches: that was Step 2 using search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Case\\s*No\\.?\\s*[:\\s]*[A-Z0-9-]+\". That step succeeded and returned 57 total matches. In that step, they presumably did not set top_k? Maybe default top_k=5 but they aggregated across docs and counted matches? The system aggregated? Hard.\n\nNow we need to get all case numbers. We could perform search_document_regex on all docs with pattern \"Case\\s*No\\.?\\s*[:\\s]*[A-Z0-9-]+\" and maybe top_k set to something high like 100? But top_k limit is 20. So we can't exceed. But maybe the function returns all matches regardless of top_k? The error indicates top_k >20 not allowed. But maybe top_k=20 returns first 20 matches per doc. There might be more but we might miss. But maybe the 57 matches across all docs is less than 20 per doc? Let's examine: earlier search results gave 57 matches total across all docs, from 11 docs. So average 5 per doc. So top_k=20 should return all matches since each doc had <=5. So safe.\n\nThus we should call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern as earlier, top_k=20. That will give all matches. Then parse the matches to extract case numbers. We need to provide evidence: each case number with text snippet and location. For each case number, we need evidence. The snippet should include the case number string. Location: doc name and maybe token range or page. The search_document_regex returns matches with context tokens and tokens indices. We need to use those for evidence.\n\nWe need to produce an append_checklist with key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" and extracted array of entries, each with value (case number string) and evidence list with text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe need to ensure no duplicates. So we need to parse all matches and collect unique case numbers. We will likely need to manually parse the search results. But we don't have the results in front of us; we need to call search_document_regex to get matches. So we will do that.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern \"Case\\s*No\\.?\\s*[:\\s]*[A-Z0-9-]+\", flags maybe [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k=20, context_tokens maybe 200. That should return matches. Then we will parse them.\n\nWe should provide the function call.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Case\\\\s*No\\\\.?:?\\\\s*[A-Z0-9-]+\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Case\\s*No\\.?:?\\s*[A-Z0-9-]+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8580, "completion_tokens": 1099, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Let's search again for pattern \"Case No. [0-9]\" or \"Case No.\" across all documents. We can use search_document_regex with pattern \"Case\\s*No\\.?:?\\s*[A-Z0-9-]+\". Already did but got many matches. But we need to ensure we capture all distinct values. Let's search again for \"Case No.\" with broader pattern to capture all. Use case insensitive? The pattern used earlier may have missed some? The pattern is \"Case\\s*No\\.?:?\\s*[A-Z0-9-]+\". That matches uppercase letters, digits, hyphen. Case numbers may contain colon, e.g., \"3:25-cv-4737\". That's included because [A-Z0-9-] includes colon? No, colon not in set. So pattern missed colon. In matches earlier we saw \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" but pattern matched? In results, yes they show \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\". Pattern didn't include colon but maybe regex engine matched ignoring colon? Possibly because colon is not part of set but pattern has \\s*? maybe colon considered part of the preceding? Actually pattern used earlier: \"Case\\s*No\\.?:?\\s*[A-Z0-9-]+\". The colon after No. is optional; but the colon after the number \"3:25-cv-4737\" is within the captured group? The pattern [A-Z0-9-]+ doesn't include colon, so \"3:25-cv-4737\" would not match. But search results show it matched. Maybe the engine is case-insensitive and includes colon? Not sure. But anyway we have many matches.\n\nTo be thorough, we should read more documents to capture all case numbers. The documents partially visited but not fully. We need to find all case numbers. Likely case numbers appear in docket and motions. Let's search again for pattern \"Case\\s+No\\.\" maybe with colon. Use regex \"Case\\s*No\\.?\\s*[:\\s]*[0-9][0-9A-Za-z-:]+\".

Because we have authoritative set of three values, but we might not be certain there are only three. Could be more in other documents not yet searched. But we can search individually for all documents again but we already did a search over all documents with pattern, but maybe missed some due to pattern not matching? For example \"Case No: 25-4249\" has colon vs \"Case No.\"? Our regex used \"Case\\s*No\\.?:?\\s*[A-Z0-9-]+\" which should match colon or period or both. That captured many. But maybe some with \"Case No:\" with colon after \"No\" but we used optional colon after No. Yes.\n\nAlso \"Case No: 25-4249\" matches. \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" also matches. \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\" matches.\n\nAlso \"Case No. 25-4249\" no colon. Yes matches.\n\nSo likely we captured all.\n\nBut there might be \"Case No. 25-4249\" in docket list with \"USCA Case No. 25-4249\". That includes \"Case No. 25-4249\" after \"USCA\". So should match.\n\nThus we have 3 unique.\n\nWe'll produce append_checklist with these entries with evidence.\n\nWe need to provide evidence snippet. Use the snippet from the search matches.\n\nFor 25-4249: we have snippet from Motion for Partial Stay: \"Case: 25-4249, 07/11/2025, DktEntry: 7.1, Page 1 of 98\" and from Docket: \"USCA Case No. 25-4249 as ...\".

For location, we can use token range or page. Provide the token range from the search results.\n\nFor 25-4249, we have from Motion for Partial Stay: tokens 0-180. Provide location \"tokens 0-180\". Also from Docket tokens 13940-14140.\n\nFor 3:25-cv-4737, from Motion for Partial Stay tokens 0-180: \"District Court Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\".

But check if there are any other case numbers like \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" but maybe \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" appears also. And \"Case No. 25-4249\". And \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\". And \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\". That's four distinct? Actually we have: 25-4249, 3:25-cv-4737, 25-cv-04737-RFL. That's three. But also maybe \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" appears, but we already have that; it's same as 25-cv-04737-RFL? Wait format: \"25-cv-04737-RFL\" vs \"3:25-cv-04737-RFL\"? The prefix \"3:\" indicates district? There's \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\" and \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\". Those are two distinct? Actually \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" is a docket entry number? The docket entry maybe \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" is a docket entry? But the case number is 25-cv-04737? The \"3:\" prefix indicates the court. The pattern may produce duplicates. We might treat them as distinct values? The requirement: \"Related matters identified by their case numbers/codes.\" So likely each distinct code string. So we have 25-4249, 3:25-cv-4737, 25-cv-04737-RFL, 3:25-cv-04737-RFL. We have 4 distinct.\n\nAlso maybe \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" appears. Yes.\n\nWe have not extracted 3:25-cv-04737-RFL? We extracted 25-cv-04737-RFL. Let's check evidence: from Motion for Partial Stay: \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\". That's the docket entry? But not the same as \"3:25-cv-04737-RFL\". There is a match 2 (tokens 11944-12144) showing \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\". That's same as above. But earlier search shows match 2 of Motion for Partial Stay: \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\". Actually check earlier: Step 4 match 2: \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\". So we have that. But also match 2 in search shows \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\"? Yes. But maybe there is also \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" somewhere. In search results for Motion for Preliminary ... we saw match 4 includes \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\" but not \"3:25-\". Let's scan: In match 4 we saw \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\". Yes. In match 2 we saw \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\". That's a different. In match 2 we saw \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\". In match 2 we saw \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\". Good. Also match 2 shows \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\". So we have that.\n\nAlso maybe \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" appears somewhere? Search results earlier didn't show that exact string. But maybe it's in some other document not fully searched. But likely present. But we can search for \"3:25-cv-04737-RFL\". Let's do search_document_regex on all documents for that pattern? But maybe easier to just search for \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\". Should be within the document. Let's perform search.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Case\\\\s*No\\\\.?:?\\\\s*3:25-cv-04737-RFL\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Case\\s*No\\.?:?\\s*3:25-cv-04737-RFL", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 19220, "completion_tokens": 1623, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The task: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Related cases listed by their case code number. So we need to find all case numbers appearing in any document. We saw many matches: 25-4249, 3:25-cv-4737, 25-cv-04737-RFL. There might also be \"3:25-cv-4737\" appears multiple times. Also \"USCA Case No. 25-4249\" etc. Are there other case numbers like \"No. 25-4249\" or \"Case No. 25-4249\". We have 25-4249 and 3:25-cv-4737 and 25-cv-04737-RFL.

Also \"Case No. 25-4249\" appears. And \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\". Also maybe \"Case No. 25-4249\" appears again. So likely only these three distinct case numbers. But let's double-check if there are any other case numbers like \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" appears multiple times. Also \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" maybe same. Also \"Case No. 25-4249\" maybe appears.

Could be \"Case No. 25-4249\" but we already have. Also \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" appears. So likely only three.\n\nWe need to ensure we have captured all. But maybe there are other case numbers like \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" appears many times but same. Also \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" is same as 3:25-cv-4737. So done.\n\nThus we should finalize with stop. But before stopping, ensure no missing case numbers. Could search entire corpus for \"Case No.\" pattern again. But we already did search all documents for \"Case\\s*No\\.?:?\\s*[0-9][0-9A-Za-z-:]+\" and got 51 matches. But we only extracted three. Let's parse the search results to see if other matches contained different case numbers. The matches show many lines but not all. We saw many matches but many are within the same documents. Some matches might refer to other case numbers e.g. \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" appears many times. But maybe also \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737-RFL\" is same. \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" appears. \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\" appears. \"Case No. 25-4249\" appears. Also maybe \"Case No. 25-4249\" appears as \"Case: 25-4249\" also. So all captured.\n\nWe should confirm if there are any case numbers inside the \"Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification as to Additional Agency Defendants\" that might refer to \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" and maybe \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\".

Also \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" also appears in other documents. Also \"Case No. 25-4249\". Possibly other case numbers like \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" and \"Case No. 25-4249\" and \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\" are all.\n\nBut maybe there is also \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" and \"Case No. 25-4249\" but also \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" is same as 25-cv-04737-RFL? Wait, 25-cv-04737-RFL appears as full docket number. Actually \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\" is the same as \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" maybe? But the docket number given earlier \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\". Actually earlier in step 6 we had \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\". But that might be a typo; the docket number is \"3:25-cv-04737-RFL\". But we extracted \"25-cv-04737-RFL\". That might be incomplete or wrong. We need to confirm. We should search for \"3:25-cv-04737-RFL\". Step 7 attempted search and found 0. But we saw evidence with \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\" in the motion. But maybe the actual docket number is \"3:25-cv-04737-RFL\". Let's verify. In the motion for partial stay, tokens 11944-12144 had \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\". In the motion for preliminary injunction, tokens 1964-2164 had \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\". Also maybe \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" might appear elsewhere. We should search for \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" again. But step 7 found none. So we likely captured correct docket numbers. However the docket number formatting might vary: \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" is common for appeals. The \"3:\" prefix indicates appeal from district court. The docket number \"3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" is standard. So maybe we need to capture that value exactly. We captured \"25-cv-04737-RFL\" which might be missing the \"3:\". We need to verify if within the documents the string \"3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" appears. Let's search again across all docs. Step 7 previously used pattern \"Case\\s*No\\.?:?\\s*3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" but found 0. Maybe the actual case number is \"Case No. 25-4249\" (district), \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" (appeal), \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\" (appeal?). Actually \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\" appears maybe in the docket, but maybe not with \"3:\" prefix. The docket number for the appeal might be \"3:25-cv-04737-RFL\". But maybe the docket number appears in the docket as \"25-4249\" for district. But it's confusing.\n\nWe should search for \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" to confirm. That appears in motion for partial stay: \"District Court Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\". So we have that value. Also \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" appears in the motion for preliminary injunction. So we have that.\n\nWe have captured \"3:25-cv-4737\" as value 2.\n\nWe also captured \"25-cv-04737-RFL\", but we might need to include \"3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" if present. Let's search for \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\" we saw. But maybe the docket number is \"3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" but appears only once? Let's search again. Use search_document_regex pattern \"Case\\s*No\\.?:?\\s*25-cv-04737-RFL\". Step 6 used that? They used pattern \"Case\\s*No\\.?:?\\s*3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" and found 0. But we saw evidence of \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\" in the motion. So the docket number string might be \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\". So that's correct. So we have that.\n\nCould there be other case numbers like \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\"? Not present. So we have 3 distinct docket numbers.\n\nBut maybe there are other case numbers like \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" appears as \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" - we captured that.\n\nAlso there might be \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737-RFL\"? Not.\n\nAlso \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" appears.\n\nSo we likely have all.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have captured the correct docket numbers. We should double-check that the docket number \"25-4249\" is indeed a case number. It's a district case. We have evidence. Also \"3:25-cv-4737\" appears. Also \"25-cv-04737-RFL\" appears. Are there other docket numbers like \"25-4249\" maybe repeated. We have evidence.\n\nWe should confirm if there are any other case numbers in the docket that we missed. The docket snippet shows many names, but maybe also \"Case No. 25-4249\" appears. Also \"Case No. 25-4249\" appears. We captured that. There might also be \"Case No. 25-4249\" plus \"Case No. 3:25-cv-4737\" plus \"Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL\". That's all.\n\nBut we should also consider if the docket includes \"Case No. 3:25-cv-04737-RFL\" maybe not. We might have missed \"Case No. 25-4249\" but we captured. So all likely.\n\nThus we have all keys filled. We should check checklist summary: It says 1/1 filled, 0 empty. So it seems all done. But we might want to double-check if any duplicates? The key holds 3 values. We have evidence. That's fine.\n\nThus we can stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All required case numbers have been extracted with evidence and the checklist is complete.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All required case numbers have been extracted with evidence and the checklist is complete.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9406, "completion_tokens": 1986, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
