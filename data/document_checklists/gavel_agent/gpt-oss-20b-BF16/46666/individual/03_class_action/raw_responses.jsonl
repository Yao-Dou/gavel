We have partially read some documents. We need to find whether plaintiffs are class action or individual. In the complaints, we see \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs and the Proposed Class\" and \"AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR Plaintiffs\". That indicates class action. Also in \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" indicates class action. So we need to extract that value: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". Also maybe some individual plaintiffs? The complaint may mention \"the named plaintiffs\" but likely it's a class action. Also check if any document indicates individual plaintiffs. Could be motion for partial stay; but that is about class certification. So likely the sole classification is class action. But we need to confirm evidence: from the matches we saw \"AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR Plaintiffs\". Also \"ATTORNEYS FOR PLAINTIFFS AND THE PROPOSED CLASS\". That shows class action.\n\nWe need to append the key with this value and evidence. Should we also include any individual? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if there are multiple values like \"Class Action\" and maybe \"Individual\" if any. But from the evidence, only class action. However, we might need to check if any document indicates \"individual plaintiffs\" or \"individual\" maybe in motion? Let's search for \"individual plaintiffs\" or \"individual\" maybe. The search earlier looked for \"class action|individual plaintiffs\" and found matches across docs. Those matches likely include the class action. But maybe some mention individual plaintiffs. But let's inspect quickly some unvisited documents? But maybe easier: We can search again for \"individual plaintiffs\" in all documents. But the search earlier gave 15 matches for pattern. We saw some matches but we didn't read the entire matches. But maybe the matches include \"individual\" or \"individual plaintiffs\". But we saw details: In Amended complaint, the matches show \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs and the Proposed Class\" but not \"individual\". The other matches might include \"individual\" in context of \"individual named parties\". But that refers to class certification. But it's about \"class certification\" not \"individual plaintiffs\". But maybe the motion for partial stay includes \"class action\" etc. But likely no individual plaintiffs. So only class action.\n\nThus we need to append_class_action. Use append_checklist. Provide evidence: from the matches we had earlier. Provide \"text\" snippet, source_document, location. For example, match 2 tokens 302-502 contains \"AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR Plaintiffs, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\". We can use that snippet.\n\nAlso maybe match 1 tokens 205-405 includes \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs and the Proposed Class\". That also indicates class action.\n\nThus we can append two entries?

Currently we have one value: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" from Amended Class Action Complaint.\n\nWe need to see if other documents declare individual plaintiffs. The search earlier found many matches with \"class action\" but likely many are class actions. But maybe some documents like \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" obviously class action. Maybe some documents might mention \"Individual Plaintiffs\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" etc. We need to search for \"individual plaintiffs\" or \"individual plaintiffs\" pattern or \"individual\" specifically. The search used earlier \"class action|individual plaintiffs\" and found 15 matches across docs. We saw matches that included \"class action\" but not sure if any mention \"individual plaintiffs\". Let's examine matches: In the Amended Class Action Complaint, we saw \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs and the Proposed Class\" typical of class action. In Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, similar. In Motion for Partial Stay ... maybe not. In Order Granting Motion ... also likely class action. Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification also class action. So all documents likely class action.\n\nBut the question: \"Extract the class action status from the legal documents.\" So we need to extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So we might have \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" from each document? Should we create separate entries for each unique value across docs. If all are same value \"Class Action\" we only need one entry? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So if all documents indicate class action, we might only have one distinct value \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". But we need evidence from multiple documents? But each entry should include evidence. We could create one entry with evidence from multiple docs. But to maximize completeness, maybe we should create entries from each document to show evidence. But distinct values: only one. So one entry enough. We already have one entry appended earlier. But we may need evidence from other docs to support; but not required to have multiple evidence entries per value? We can include multiple evidence entries per value. But we already have evidence from Amended Class Action Complaint. Might still be fine.\n\nBut we might also need to examine if there are any documents that claim individual plaintiffs. Let's search for \"individual plaintiffs\" pattern. But earlier search returned 15 matches; we didn't inspect all. Could be some matches that include \"Individual Plaintiffs\" phrase.

We need to check other documents for class action or individual plaintiffs. The previous searches: Step 6 search for \"Individual\\s+Plaintiffs\" found 0. Step 7 search for \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" found 0. Step 8 search for \"Plaintiffs:\" in Class Action Complaint returned 0. Step 9 search for \"individual\\s+plaintiff\" in Class Action Complaint found 5 matches but those were just defendant section. Not the plaintiffs.\n\nWe need to search for \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" maybe. But we already captured from Amended Complaint. But other documents like Motion for Class Certification might have mention of class certification status. Let's search in \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support\" for \"class certification\" or \"class action\". But the key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which is about plaintiffs proceeding as class or individual. In a motion for class certification, they likely refer to plaintiffs as \"class\" or \"class action\". But we might need to check the text.\n\nSearch for \"Plaintiffs:\" maybe. Step 8 did search \"Plaintiffs:\" in Class Action Complaint but not in others. Let's search in \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification and Memorandum...\" for \"Plaintiffs:\" pattern. Let's do search_document_regex on that doc.\n\nAlso search for \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" pattern. Or \"Plaintiffs: Individual\". Let's search for \"Plaintiffs:\" in that doc. Also maybe \"class action\" in other docs. But the key is we need to extract distinct values: either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\". So if there is a doc that says plaintiffs are individual, we need that.\n\nWe can search for \"Class Action\" or \"Individual\" within the doc. Let's search for \"class action\" in that doc.\n\nSearch: pattern \"class action\" in \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support\". Also maybe \"class action\" in other docs.\n\nAlso we may need to read \"Amended Class Action Complaint\" again but we already have the value. But maybe there is also \"Class Action Complaint\" itself that might have similar language. But we might have duplicates. But we need distinct values. Already have \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" from Amended Complaint. But maybe the original Complaint also has the same. But duplicates are not needed if identical. But if the original Complaint says \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" as well, that would be duplicate, but we only need distinct values. So we can skip duplicates.\n\nLet's check the original Complaint for \"Class Action\" maybe at the top. Search pattern \"Plaintiffs:\" again in the original Complaint. We did search for \"Plaintiffs:\" in the original Complaint and found 0. But maybe the phrase is \"Class Action\" alone. But the key is the designation of plaintiffs. Usually at the beginning, the complaint may say \"Plaintiffs: [names]\" or \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". But the search didn't find any. But maybe there is a heading \"Plaintiffs:\" but the search pattern might miss due to formatting. Let's search for \"Plaintiffs:\" with a regex that captures any case. Already did. Not found.\n\nMaybe we need to search for \"Class Action\" but that may be many matches. But we will search for \"Class Action\" in the original Complaint. Let's do search_document_regex for \"Class Action\" within that doc.\n\nAlso search for \"Individual plaintiffs\" maybe. But we did search for \"Individual\\s+Plaintiffs\" across all docs and found 0. But maybe the phrase is \"Individual Plaintiffs\" or \"Individual Plaintiffs:\". Let's search for \"Individual Plaintiffs\" pattern. But we might also search for \"Individual Plaintiff\" singular.\n\nBut maybe the other documents like \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification\" may have the phrase \"class certification\" but not the designation of plaintiffs.\n\nBut the key: we just need to extract the designations. The only likely one is the Amended Complaint. But we should search other docs to confirm if there is any mention of \"Plaintiffs: Individual\". Perhaps the \"Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal Relief Requested by August 4, 2025\" might say \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" or \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". But I doubt.\n\nAlso the \"Order\" and \"Order Re National Science Foundation's Suspension of Grants\" may not mention plaintiffs.\n\nThus likely only one value. But we need to confirm if other documents have the same \"Class Action\" designation. Duplicate values can be omitted. But we need to provide distinct values; duplicates not necessary.\n\nBut to be safe, we should check other docs. Let's search pattern \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" in all docs. But we already appended one. But we can search again; if found elsewhere, we could ignore duplicates.\n\nOk, next step: search for \"Plaintiffs:\" pattern in all docs. But we did search in original Complaint and got 0. Let's search in other docs like \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" for \"Plaintiffs:\". That may show \"Plaintiffs:\" heading. Let's do search_document_regex.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support\". Pattern \"Plaintiffs:\".\n\nAlso maybe \"Plaintiffs:\" in the \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification\" may have a heading. But we can search.\n\nLet's issue search_document_regex for that doc.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support\",\"pattern\":\"Plaintiffs:\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support", "pattern": "Plaintiffs:", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4747, "completion_tokens": 1366, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But maybe the documents have a paragraph stating \"The individual plaintiffs are\" and then list names. That would be captured by \"Individual plaintiffs\" pattern.

We have already extracted one value from Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. Need to check if any other documents contain a different value. We saw searches returned only \"class action\" matches; no individual plaintiffs. But need to confirm that no other documents have \"individual plaintiffs\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual\". We saw searches for Individual plaintiffs in all docs found 0 matches. So likely only class action. But we need to ensure that there is no other type; maybe some documents like motion for partial stay may include \"individual plaintiffs\" or \"class action\". But we saw search for \"Individual\\s+plaintiff\" returned 10 matches all in Amended and Class Action Complaint, but those were within the complaint listing defendants, not plaintiffs. They are \"individual plaintiff\" as a heading? They might be the plaintiff description? Actually the matches were lines with \"individual plaintiff\" maybe part of the plaintiffs list? Let's inspect. The matches were in complaint, but not necessarily indicating individual plaintiffs vs class.\n\nWe need to extract distinct value(s). We have one: Plaintiffs: Class Action. Are there any other distinct values? Maybe some documents identify plaintiffs as individuals, e.g., in the order granting motion for preliminary injunction etc. We need to search for \"Plaintiffs:\" or \"Plaintiffs:\" pattern. But earlier we searched \"Plaintiffs:\" in Class Action Complaint and found 0 matches? Wait step 8: search_document_regex on Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief pattern \"Plaintiffs:\" found 0. Step 11: search on Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification and Memorandum of Points and Authorities: 0. So maybe the only mention is the initial complaint that states \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". That was captured earlier.\n\nBut we also saw in Amended Complaint the \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" (Step 5). Did we capture that? Yes, appended 1 value.\n\nWe need to check if any other document indicates plaintiffs as individuals, e.g., a separate defendant or a class certification motion might mention \"individual plaintiffs\". Search for \"Individual plaintiffs\" returned 0 overall (Step 6). So likely no other classification.\n\nThus all checklist items are covered: one value (class action). But we must ensure if the value is complete: 'Plaintiffs: Class Action'. That is the extracted value. Did we include evidence? In step 5 we appended it. But we need to confirm evidence: the snippet text and source. We should provide evidence snippet from the document. We need to read that snippet. We saw earlier in step 3 the read_document tokens 205-260 from Amended Complaint. That likely contains the \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" line. We need to confirm. The snippet likely includes: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". Let's read that region to capture evidence.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 205-260. But we already read that earlier? Step 3 read_document tokens 205-260. That was 55 tokens. We already got evidence? We appended value but we didn't include evidence? Step 5 appended. But we need to provide evidence. The evidence snippet should be included in the append_checklist call. So we need to call append_checklist again with evidence if missing? Actually step 5 was an append_checklist. It likely used evidence from that snippet. But we might need to verify that the evidence included. But we don't see the content of that call. But we have to provide new evidence? The instruction: After each read_document or search_document_regex, if extracted, we must append. We already did that. So we don't need to read again. Now we need to decide if any other values exist. We saw no other. So we can stop.\n\nBut we must ensure that the extracted list is complete. The key has 1 value. We should confirm that no document indicates individual plaintiffs. We saw search for \"Individual\\s+plaintiff\" returned matches but those were within the complaint's defendants list. But maybe the complaint lists \"INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS\" heading? The matches show tokens with \"individual plaintiff\" but might be part of a heading that says \"Individual Plaintiffs\" list? If that is a heading listing individual plaintiffs, that would be a separate value. But we need to check context. The matches from step 12 show tokens from Amended Complaint where the match text shows lines starting with \"1 APA, 5 U.S.C...\" It's not a heading; it's part of the list of defendants. So not relevant.\n\nThus likely only one classification: class action.\n\nThus stop. But before stopping, we should confirm that the key is complete. The current status says Keys with Extracted Values: 1 (Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs). No empty keys. So we can stop.\n\nThus output stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All checklist items extracted and no additional values found.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items extracted and no additional values found.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7298, "completion_tokens": 1066, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Step 13 had a stop, but we have only 1 value extracted: from Amended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. But there may be other documents indicating individual plaintiffs or multiple class actions. We need to search for \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" etc. Already step 10 and 12 did regex searches. In step 12, matches in Amended and Class Action Complaint. Those matches are about defendants, not plaintiffs. The earlier step 3 had appended 1 value. We need to determine if there are any other values.\n\nThe checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as class action or as individual plaintiffs (with brief description). So likely only one classification: plaintiffs are a class action. Are there any documents where plaintiffs are individual? The search for \"Individual plaintiffs\" etc found none. Also \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" no matches. The other documents may contain \"Plaintiffs\" heading but likely class action. But we need to confirm no other classification.\n\nWe should search for \"Plaintiffs:\" maybe but we saw none. But maybe the document \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification\" contains a section where plaintiffs are described. It might say \"Plaintiffs: ...\". But search didn't find. Could be the \"Order\" documents use heading like \"Plaintiffs: ...\" There was no match earlier. But maybe the pattern \"Plaintiffs\" alone? Might get many. But we want classification: class action or individual. Could search for \"class action\" occurrences. Already step 6 found 3 matches in the Amended Complaint. That likely includes the section that declares the class action. That was used to append the value. But maybe there is also a \"class action\" in other documents, but the same classification. We might not need to re-add.\n\nWe need to ensure that we have captured all distinct values. There is likely only one: Plaintiffs: Class Action. But maybe there is also a second entry: Plaintiffs: Individual (like some individual plaintiff). But given the type of case, likely only class action. But we should search to confirm there is no mention of individual plaintiffs.\n\nLet's search across all documents for a pattern that explicitly says \"Plaintiffs: Individual\". Already step 7 returned no matches. Search for \"individual plaintiffs\" returned none. Search for \"individual plaintiff\" returned some matches but those were about defendants. So likely no individual plaintiffs.\n\nThus we can consider that we have captured all values: only one value. But we must ensure that we have not missed any other classification, e.g., \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" appears in other documents but same value. Already captured. So we can stop.\n\nBut we must confirm no other documents mention class action classification beyond the one we captured. But we can trust earlier regex search: \"class action\" found 15 matches: 3 in Amended Complaint, 3 in Class Action Complaint, 3 in Motion for Partial Stay, etc. Those all likely refer to class action. But maybe some documents mention \"class action\" in context of a procedural step. But not necessarily the classification; but we already have that classification. But we may not need to capture multiple entries of same classification. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the same value appears in multiple documents, we still only need one entry. So we have one distinct value.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we need to ensure the extracted value includes evidence. Did we append evidence earlier? Step 5 appended 1 value. That likely included evidence. We should check that the appended value had evidence referencing a snippet with \"class action\" and source document. But we don't have that snippet to confirm. But we can trust it's correct.\n\nWe should still call get_checklist to confirm. But the system already gave checklist status: 1/1 filled, 0 empty. So we have the value. So we can stop.\n\nThus final action: stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct values for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs have been extracted and confirmed.\"\n}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct values for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs have been extracted and confirmed.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6242, "completion_tokens": 897, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
