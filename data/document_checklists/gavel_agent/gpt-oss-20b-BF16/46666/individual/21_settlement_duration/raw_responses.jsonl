We have one match in complaint, but that snippet is about termination, not settlement. Likely settlement terms are in a settlement agreement document, not in this complaint. But we have no settlement agreement listed. Could be in the docket or order. Maybe search for \"settlement\" again with more context. The search already gave one match. Maybe we need to read further tokens around that match to see if any settlement duration is mentioned. But that snippet is about DOD termination, not settlement. But maybe settlement refers to a class action settlement, but not present.\n\nWe need to search for other keywords like \"settlement period\", \"duration\", \"monitoring period\", \"obligations\", \"period\", \"term\". But the requirement is to extract settlement duration from documents. It could be in \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" etc. However, settlement usually refers to a settlement agreement. Might be in an \"Amended Class Action Complaint\" but that is a complaint, not a settlement. But maybe the complaint mentions settlement? Unlikely.\n\nWe should search more specifically for \"settlement\" in all documents again but maybe also search for \"term\" or \"duration\". But better to search for \"settlement\" again but maybe the snippet we saw didn't include duration. We might need to read more tokens around that match to see if any settlement duration appears further. But snippet is 200 tokens around the match. It only shows part of the complaint. Could be that settlement is not present.\n\nCheck other documents: maybe there is a \"Settlement Agreement\" among the documents but not listed. But we only have those 11 documents. None are named settlement agreement. So maybe the settlement duration is not present in the corpus. Thus we might conclude Not Applicable. But we need evidence that no settlement duration exists. We need to search all documents thoroughly for \"settlement\". The search returned only one match. That match likely doesn't include duration. But we need to confirm that no settlement duration exists. We could search for pattern \"months\" or \"years\" after settlement. But no guarantee.\n\nBetter approach: We can search for \"settlement\" again but set higher context tokens to capture more. But the search already returned top_k matches. It found only one match. We can request more context or read the entire document of the complaint to see if settlement appears elsewhere. But we might not need to read entire 83k tokens; we could search again with different pattern \"settlement\" to confirm no more matches. But search_document_regex returns top_k matches per document. It found only one match overall. That suggests no other matches. But the snippet might be incomplete. But \"search_document_regex\" should find all matches, but only returns top_k. We set top_k default 5, so if there are more than 5 matches, it would return 5. But we saw only 1 total. So likely only one match across all documents.\n\nThus no settlement duration likely present.\n\nWe need to set \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" as Not Applicable with evidence: maybe the absence of settlement terms. But we need explicit evidence. We could use the search result: the only match for \"settlement\" found in the complaint, but that snippet didn't show any settlement duration. We could read that snippet as evidence that no duration is present. But maybe we should read the entire document to confirm. But reading entire 83k tokens is too large. But we could read the snippet again and interpret. But the evidence must be text snippet that shows the absence of settlement duration. The snippet we have does not mention duration. But we need to provide evidence that settlement duration is not present. But we need to show that the snippet is from the complaint, which is not a settlement agreement. We can use that snippet as evidence that settlement duration is not in the complaint. But that doesn't prove it's not in other documents. But search found no other matches. So we could use the search result as evidence that there is no settlement duration.\n\nWe can set Not Applicable using update_checklist. Provide evidence: the search result snippet or a statement that the only \"settlement\" match is in the complaint, which does not contain a duration. That is supporting evidence.\n\nThus we will call update_checklist for key \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" with extracted entry value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence: the snippet from search.

Let's search for patterns like \"months\", \"years\", \"days\", \"weeks\", \"months\", \"years\" following \"settlement\" or \"agreed\" or \"term\" etc. But we can use regex search for \"settlement\" followed by digits and duration words, or \"duration of settlement\" etc.\n\nWe can do a regex search across all documents for patterns like \"settlement.*?(?:for|of|over|in|lasting|duration|period|periods).{0,200}\".
