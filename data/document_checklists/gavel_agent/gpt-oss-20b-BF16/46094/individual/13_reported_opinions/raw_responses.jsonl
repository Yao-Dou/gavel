We must search for citations. Likely many opinions etc. The best is search_document_regex across all documents for patterns like \"v.\" or \"In re\" plus reporter citations like \"U.S. 123\". But Bluebook shortened includes case name and reporter citation. We can search for patterns like \"\\w+ v\\. \\w+ \\d{1,3} U.S.\\s*\\d{1,4}\\b\" but many variations.\n\nBetter: Use regex that captures typical Bluebook citations: e.g., \"In re Smith, 123 U.S. 456 (2020);\" or \"Smith v. Jones, 456 F.3d 789 (9th Cir. 2007)\". Shortened Bluebook citation includes case name plus reporter. The pattern: \"[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9 &.'-]* v\\. [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9 &.'-]*, \\d{1,5} [A-Za-z.]+ \\d{1,6} \\([0-9]{4}\\)\". But easier: use regex for \"(\\w+ v\\. \\w+),? \\d+ [A-Za-z.]+ \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\)\". Also for \"In re\" or \"In re\".\n\nWe can search with regex for pattern like \"(?:[A-Za-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Za-z]+)* v\\. [A-Za-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Za-z]+)*)?[\\w\\s]+,?\\s+\\d{1,5}\\s+[A-Za-z.]+\\s+\\d{1,6}\\s+\\(\\d{4}\\)\". But maybe simpler: search for \" v\\. \" and digits after. But we need Bluebook citations, not docket.\n\nWe should search across all documents. Use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern something like \"(?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*) v\\. (?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)\\s*,?\\s*\\d{1,5}\\s+[A-Za-z.]+\\s*\\d{1,6}\\s*\\(\\d{4}\\)\". Use flags IGNORECASE MULTILINE DOTALL maybe.\n\nGiven large corpus, we might get many matches. But we must extract all distinct values. Might be many. But we can start by searching for typical patterns. We'll get matches per doc.\n\nBut caution: There are many documents; some may not include case citations. But we need all citations.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex to get top_k 20 per doc. That may produce many. But we can limit to 10 per doc? But we need all distinct. Might be many matches across many docs. But we can fetch top_k 20 across all. Then we may need to read more if needed.\n\nGiven limited time, we can start with search_document_regex on all docs, pattern for case citations. Let's craft pattern:\n\n\"([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*) v\\. ([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*),?\\s*\\d{1,5}\\s+[A-Za-z.]+\\s*\\d{1,6}\\s*\\(\\d{4}\\)\"\n\nBut simpler: pattern: \"([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*) v\\. ([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*),?\\s*\\d{1,5}\\s+[A-Za-z.]+\\s*\\d{1,6}\\s*\\(\\d{4}\\)\"\n\nThis captures case name and reporter. But we want the entire citation string. Might capture the entire match as group 0.\n\nLet's use pattern: \"([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*) v\\. ([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*),?\\s*\\d{1,5}\\s+[A-Za-z.]+\\s*\\d{1,6}\\s*\\(\\d{4}\\)\"\n\nBut the capture groups may not capture the entire string. We can just use the whole match.\n\nAlternatively, pattern: \"([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*) v\\. [A-Z0-9][A-Za-z0-9 &.'-]*(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*,?\\s*\\d{1,5}\\s+[A-Za-z.]+\\s*\\d{1,6}\\s*\\(\\d{4}\\)\"\n\nBut it's okay.\n\nLet's do: pattern: \"(?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*) v\\. (?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*),?\\s*\\d{1,5}\\s+[A-Za-z.]+\\s*\\d{1,6}\\s*\\(\\d{4}\\)\"\n\nFlags: IGNORECASE MULTILINE DOTALL. top_k 20. context_tokens 200.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*) v\\\\.

The key we need to extract: All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation. We need to extract every distinct value of this item found in any document, with evidence.\n\nWe already have many matches from search_document_regex, but we need to parse them for distinct citations. We should confirm we have all. The search regex matches many citations but we need to extract the shortened Bluebook citations: case name (only when immediately precedes citation) plus reporter/db citation. That means pattern like \"Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020)\" etc.\n\nWe need to extract unique values. We can use the search results as evidence. We must gather all unique citations and evidence snippets. We need to read each match to include evidence. We have many matches. Should we use search_document_regex again to get all? Already got 146 matches across 33 documents. We need to extract distinct citations from those matches. We could also read more tokens to confirm. But the search results give context. However, we must ensure all distinct citations. We should consider all matches for each document. Maybe easier to iterate each document and search. But we can use search_document_regex again with pattern for citations. But we already used a pattern that matches case name v. case name, reporter, year. That gives many matches. We could use that to extract all.\n\nWe need to produce append_checklist containing all unique citations. But we must provide evidence: snippet text and source_document and location. We can use the token ranges from search results as location. The search results gave token ranges for each match. That is enough as evidence. We need unique list.\n\nThe matches from \"Application to Vacate...\" include several citations. We need to list each unique citation. The matches from Brief of Amici... include many citations. We need to capture them all.\n\nBut maybe there are other documents with citations not captured by regex? But regex pattern likely captured many. Maybe some citations appear without \"v.\"? Unlikely. We can assume coverage.\n\nWe should produce append_checklist with all unique values. Each entry has evidence array with one snippet. Provide source_document and location (token range). We need to list each unique citation as separate value. Provide evidence snippet text from the match.\n\nWe have in the search results many matches with snippet excerpts that include citations. For each match we can extract the citation(s). But we need distinct values. Let's list them:\n\nFrom Application to Vacate:\n\nMatch1 snippet contains: \"Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021).\"\n\nSo two citations: Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020) and Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021).\n\nMatch2 snippet contains: \"Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 654 (Barrett, J., concurring). See Brewer v. Landrigan, 562 U.S. 996 (2010); Brunner v. Ohio Republican Party, 555 U.S. 5,\". So citations: Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 654 (Barrett, J., concurring). Brewer v. Landrigan, 562 U.S. 996 (2010); Brunner v. Ohio Republican Party, 555 U.S. 5, (maybe missing rest). Might be truncated. But we need citations as complete as in snippet. Use text.\n\nMatch3 snippet: \"Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (No. 19-422).\" That is a citation.\n\nMatch4 snippet repeats similar.\n\nFrom Brief of Amici:\n\nMany matches. They include many citations. We need to list them all.

DeSantis, No. 4:22-cv-302 (N.D. Fla.); Webster v. Fall, (incomplete). Also others: maybe DeSantis? etc.\n\nWe need to ensure each unique citation. We can include them all.\n\nBut we might have duplicates across documents: e.g., Seila Law LLC v. CFPB appears also in other doc. So we need unique list.\n\nGiven the large number, we might just append all. But we must ensure each entry has evidence. For each citation, we can use the snippet where it appears. We might include multiple snippets for same citation? Not necessary; one evidence is fine.\n\nWe need to produce append_checklist with patch array: key: \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\". extracted: array of entries.\n\nBut we need to ensure that we provide evidence with source_document and location. Use the doc names and token ranges from search results.\n\nWe have many docs. We can choose a subset of evidence for each unique citation. We can use the search results from Application to Vacate and Brief of Amici. But we might also need citations from other docs not covered? But likely the search regex captured many.\n\nGiven the huge list, maybe simpler to use search_document_regex again on all docs to get all matches, then extract. But we already have 146 matches. We need to parse them all. That is a lot. But we can produce a list with all citations. The answer may be large but acceptable.\n\nWe need to use append_checklist. Provide evidence for each citation. For each citation, we need to provide snippet text and doc and location. We can use the snippet from the search match. For each citation, we can provide evidence snippet that contains the citation. We can include more than one snippet if needed, but one is enough.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't missing any citations. Let's scan the search results quickly to capture all.\n\nFrom Application to Vacate (doc name: \"Application to Vacate the Order Issued by the U.S. District Court and Request for an Immediate Administrative Stay\") we have matches 1,2,3,4. We captured 2-3 citations each.\n\nFrom Brief of Amici: many matches 1-16. We captured many.\n\nBut also other docs may have citations. But we can use the search results to capture all. Maybe some matches not shown (we saw first 20 of 146). There are more matches across other docs. We didn't see them, but we can open them to capture more. But due to time, maybe we can rely on the provided 146 matches. But we only saw 20. There are 126 more matches not displayed. So we might miss citations.\n\nThus it's safer to perform search_document_regex again but with a pattern that matches citations and return all matches. Then parse them. But we already did that. But we only saw first 20. The tool might not show all. We can request more matches by specifying top_k larger? But default top_k 5. We can ask for top_k 20 per doc. But still only 20 overall? The tool returns top_k matches per document. But we can increase to 50 to capture more. Let's do search_document_regex for all documents with pattern same as before but top_k 50. That should return more matches. Then we can parse.\n\nWe need to add context_tokens maybe 200. Provide evidence. Then parse.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern same, top_k 50, context_tokens 200.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*) v\\\\.

We have many matches already from search regex. We must extract each unique citation from all documents. We have partial coverage. We need to read more to capture all citations. The search regex found many matches in many documents. We should search specifically for case citations. We might use search_document_regex with pattern: something like \"[A-Z][a-z]+ v\\\\. [A-Z][a-z]+,? \\\\d{1,5} [A-Za-z.]+ \\\\d{1,6} \\\\(\\\\d{4}\\\\)\" which is what was used. But we need to get all matches across all documents. We should run search_document_regex with top_k maybe 20, but we need all matches. We can set top_k 20, but that will give 20 matches per document. We might need to call multiple times or set top_k high. But earlier error: we set top_k 50 causing error. So we need to set top_k <=20. Let's set top_k 20, context 200. That will return up to 20 matches per document. But we might miss beyond 20. But we need all unique citations across all documents. We could search across each document individually to get all matches. But we can read portions where matches appear. But easier: we can first run search_document_regex on all documents with top_k 20, context 200, then manually parse the returned sample to extract citations. Then we can read more windows to catch others. But we need to ensure we capture all unique citations. Might be many. But given many documents, many citations likely appear. We need to collect them.\n\nWe have search results from many documents above. We can parse those matches manually. But we only have the snippet of matches for certain documents. We can also search again with different pattern maybe capturing up to 20 matches per doc; then we add new matches. But we need to produce final list. We can do multiple calls, each time appending new entries.\n\nWe should first get all matches across all documents. We could set top_k 20, but if a doc has more than 20 matches, we may miss some. But we can run search_document_regex on each document individually to get all matches. We can iterate.\n\nWhich documents have high coverage? We can search each doc individually. But there are 33 docs. Might be heavy. But we can focus on those with many matches: e.g., \"Brief of Amici Curiae Florida...\" has many matches. We already have many matches from 1-20. But we might need to get more beyond 20. But we can search again with a larger context? But top_k can't exceed 20.\n\nWe could search for each document individually with top_k 20, then read the remaining token ranges to get more matches. But we need all citations; 20 per doc may not suffice. We need to read more windows. We can manually search for patterns again. Maybe we can just read entire documents? But token limit 10k per call. Some docs are 10-20k tokens; but we can read sequentially windows.\n\nAlternate approach: use search_document_regex on all documents with top_k 20, but also set context 200, then parse matches. That will give up to 20 matches per doc. But we might miss beyond 20. But we can then read remaining portions of any doc where we suspect more matches.\n\nWe can start by searching again, but we need to add new matches. Let's start with search_document_regex across all docs, top_k 20, context 200. That will give matches. Then we can parse them to extract citations. But we need to do this systematically.

Landrigan, 562 U.S. 996 (2010); Brunner v. Ohio Republican Party, 555 U.S. 5, ... incomplete but probably 555 U.S. 5 (2010?) but not fully. We can capture Brewer v. Landrigan, 562 U.S. 996 (2010) and Brunner v. Ohio Republican Party, 555 U.S. 5 (???). The snippet truncated. Might need read further.\n\nMatch3 includes Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (No. 19-422). That is a docket number; maybe not reporter citation. But we can extract \"Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021)\" already captured. The (No. 19-422) is docket? Might disregard. But the citation remains same.\n\nSimilarly other matches include many citations: Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021); Seila Law LLC v. CFPB (same). Also many others like Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962); Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211 (2011); etc.\n\nThus we need to extract all distinct citations from all matches across all docs. That is a lot.\n\nWe could just harvest from search results. But there are many matches (146). But we can parse snippet but might miss citations that appear further down.\n\nGiven constraints, maybe we need to read all documents fully? That seems heavy.\n\nBut maybe we can use search_document_regex again with pattern that returns all matches with context, and then append the extracted.\n\nWe can call search_document_regex with pattern same but maybe top_k 50? It returns top matches per document (max 20). Already got 146 total matches. We need all. We could increase top_k to 50 per doc to capture all. But we still might not get all.\n\nAlternative: search_document_regex with pattern that matches citation but returns all tokens? The tool returns top_k matches per doc. We can set top_k to 50 to get more.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex with pattern same, doc_names all, top_k=50, context_tokens maybe 200. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Application to Vacate the Order Issued by the U.S. District Court and Request for an Immediate Administrative Stay\",\"Brief of Amici Curiae Florida and 19 Other States in Support of the Secretary's Application to Vacate the Order of the United States District Court\",\"Defendants' Motion to Stay the Courts Administrative Stay\",\"Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\",\"Defendants' Reply in Support of their Motion for Summary Judgment and Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment\",\"Defendants; Motion for Summary Judgment\",\"Defendants’ Motion to Stay the Court's Order Pending Appeal\",\"Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal (001)\",\"Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal (002)\",\"Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and Permanent Injunction and in Opposition to the Governments Motion for Summary Judgment\",\"Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and a Permanent Injunction and in Opposition to the Governments Motion for Summary Judgment\",\"Reply in Support of Application to Vacate the Order Issued by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia\",\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"Mandate\",\"On Application to Vacate the Order Issued by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia\",\"Order (001)\",\"Order (002)\",\"Order (003)\",\"Order (004)\",\"Order (005)\",\"Order and Opinion\",\"Per Curiam Order Filed (Special Panel) (001)\",\"Letter Response to Plaintiffs\",\"Letter on Behalf of Plaintiff\",\"Appellee's Motion to Dismiss as Moot\",\"Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Stay the Administrative Stay\",\"Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\",\"Memorandum Opinion\",\"Order on Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal\",\"Per Curiam Order Filed (Special Panel) (002)\",\"Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger’s Opposition to the Government’s Application to Vacate the Order Issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and to Enter an Administrative Stay\",\"Reply in Support of Application to Vacate the Order Issued by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia\",\"Order\",\"Order (001)\",\"Order (002)\",\"Order (003)\",\"Order (004)\",\"Order (005)\",\"Order (006)\"],\"pattern\":\"(?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*) v\\\\.

We have many matches from search_document_regex. Those are matches but we need to capture the citations. Likely we should read some docs to capture them. We have many matches across many docs, but maybe we can use search_document_regex results as evidence? The guidelines say after reading or searching, we need to append. The search gives context but not full? It returns matched snippet. We could just use search output to extract citations. But we need evidence with text, source_document, location. The search output shows doc name and tokens. We can use that as evidence.\n\nWe must extract every distinct value. We should avoid duplicates. Many matches show same citations multiple times. We need unique citations across all docs. We have found many citations: Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021); Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593 (2021); Brewer v. Landrigan, 562 U.S. 996 (2010); Brunner v. Ohio Republican Party, 555 U.S. 5 (??). Also many in the Amici list: Seila Law etc. Also many others: Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962); Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211 (2011); etc. We need to extract all distinct citations found. There are many.\n\nGiven time, maybe just extract a subset? But requirement: all distinct values. We could rely on the search results which provide many citations. But there are many matches across 33 docs. We need to extract all. This is a huge list.\n\nWe could craft a search_document_regex to get all citations? We already did. But we need to read to confirm each. But maybe we can use search to capture. We can use the search results as evidence, but must ensure the extracted values are exactly the shortened Bluebook citation. That is case name included only when immediately precedes the citation. So entries should be like \"Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020)\". We should not include \"Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021)\" as separate entries.\n\nThus we need to parse each match snippet to extract each citation.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex again but limit top_k maybe 20 per doc? We already have many.\n\nBut we need to create append_checklist with many entries. That could be a large payload but acceptable. We need evidence per entry: text snippet, source_document, location. We can use the match snippet and location tokens.\n\nWe have many matches across many docs. It may be too many to output all. But requirement is all distinct values. Might be dozens. Let's count approximate: In brief list, many. Actually the brief list includes a typical case caption list with many citations: e.g., Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962); Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211 (2011); etc. That list includes many. We need all those unique.\n\nGiven the large number, maybe we can extract those from the brief list only. But there may be citations in other docs too.\n\nGiven complexity, maybe we can output an update_checklist with empty? But we cannot set Not Applicable because we have many citations.\n\nMaybe we should just stop? No.\n\nGiven constraints, I think we can at least extract a representative set? but requirement says all distinct. Might be too many.\n\nBut we can try to gather all from the brief list: it lists about 30 citations. Also from other documents: Seila Law, Collins, Trump v. United States, Brewer, Brunner.\n\nAlso from other documents like Dellinger v. Bessent, etc.\n\nPerhaps we can produce a list of all unique citations seen in the search matches. Let's compile:\n\nFrom Application to Vacate:\n- Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020)\n- Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021)\n- Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593 (2021)\n- Brewer v.

Fla.) – not reporter\n- Webster v. Fall – incomplete.\n\nAlso from other docs maybe: Seila Law etc. We see many duplicates.\n\nGiven this large list, we can output all.\n\nWe need to provide evidence: we can cite snippet from brief list. For each citation, we need evidence: text snippet, source_document, location tokens.\n\nWe can use the snippet from the brief list: the match snippet shows each citation. We can use that as evidence. For location, we can use token range of match. For example match 1 tokens 543-743 includes many citations. But each citation appears inside that snippet. But we need separate evidence per citation. We could just use the same snippet for all. That might be acceptable.\n\nBetter to use the snippet that contains the specific citation. But we can approximate.\n\nGiven constraints, we can produce append_checklist with many entries. Might be large but okay.\n\nLet's produce append_checklist with key \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\" and extracted array of many entries.\n\nWe need to ensure each entry has evidence array with at least one evidence item.\n\nWe can provide evidence from the brief list match 1 for many. For citations not in that snippet, we might need other snippets. But many citations appear across multiple matches. For simplicity, we can use match 1 snippet for all citations present in that snippet. But some citations like \"Seila Law LLC v. CFPB\" also appear in match 1? Yes, match 1 snippet includes \"Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020)\". Good.\n\nThus we can use that snippet.\n\nWe need to specify location: e.g., \"Brief of Amici Curiae Florida and 19 Other States in Support of the Secretary's Application to Vacate the Order of the United States District Court (tokens 543-743)\".\n\nWe'll produce entries accordingly.\n\nLet's craft the JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Seila Law LLC v.

Need to gather all distinct citations from documents. We have many matches from regex search earlier. We need to read documents to capture evidence for each distinct citation. We can use search_document_regex to gather matches across all docs. The earlier search provided many matches, but we didn't extract them yet. We need to append these citations.\n\nWe should probably use search_document_regex again with pattern same and top_k maybe 50? But earlier error because top_k default 5, but we used 50 in call? In step5 error due to top_k >20. Let's just use default (5) but we need all matches. We can iterate over documents? We can use search_document_regex with doc_names list? The earlier step had matches across many docs. Could use search_document_regex on all documents but limit top_k to 20? But we need all matches; we could sequentially call search_document_regex with top_k 20 on each doc to gather all matches. But we can also just read documents and identify citations manually. Might be easier to read each document partially, but many docs.\n\nWe may choose to use search_document_regex on all docs with top_k 20 and then read each match individually. But we need all distinct citations; we can gather from the search results we saw earlier. Let's parse the earlier search results manually? They are many.\n\nBut we can use search_document_regex again on all documents but with top_k maybe 20 to get first 20 matches; but we need all. We can then read each match of those 20 and extract citations. But we still need to cover all matches across all documents (146 matches). That's many.\n\nGiven time, maybe easier to use search_document_regex with top_k 20 and then read from each match to extract citations. But we need all distinct citations. We could read each match and extract citations and append. That is doable.\n\nBut we need to provide evidence for each citation. So for each match, we will need to identify the citation text. The regex pattern is capturing the case name and reporter citation. The match includes the citation.\n\nThus we can iterate over each match and create an entry with evidence text snippet including citation text, source document, location (token range maybe). We need to provide location; we can use token range or page. In search results we have token ranges.\n\nSo we should parse the search results: we saw match details. For each match, we can create an entry. But there are many matches across many docs.\n\nMaybe we can reduce: we need unique values. The citations may repeat across docs. We should gather set of citations. Probably many duplicates. We need all distinct citations. That could be large but manageable.\n\nGiven the challenge, maybe we can extract only a few entries for demonstration? But the task says extract all distinct values. We must be thorough.\n\nAlternate approach: Use search_document_regex with pattern that matches all citations across all docs, top_k set to 50? But error. But we can use top_k 20 and then iterate. But we still need all 146 matches. We could call search_document_regex again with top_k 20 but maybe it returns different set each time? It returns top matches per doc; each doc may have top 5 matches sorted by relevance. But not all.\n\nMaybe we can use read_document to read entire documents? That would be huge.\n\nBut we can use the search results we already have to gather all matches. The earlier search provided many matches across multiple docs. We could manually parse and append all citations. But there's a lot.\n\nGiven the constraints, maybe we can focus on the \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\" key and append the citations we have seen. We may only need to provide a subset? But the requirement says all distinct values.\n\nGiven the time, maybe we can output an append_checklist with some entries. But risk incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, we can set Not Applicable? But obviously there are citations.\n\nThus, we need to proceed.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex again but with top_k 20 for each doc separately. But we don't know doc_names. We could list documents and then call search for each. But too many.\n\nBut we can use search_document_regex on all docs again but maybe it returns all matches? But earlier error due to top_k >20. We can set top_k 20. That will return up to 20 matches per doc? Actually it returns top_k matches per document. If we set top_k 20, for 33 docs, that's up to 660 matches, but we only need 146. That might be fine. Let's try.\n\nWe need to call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern same, top_k=20, context_tokens maybe 200.

We have many matches from regex search. But we need to confirm each citation includes reporter or database citation. We need to build list of unique citations. Likely many. We need to read portions to confirm each citation. But we could use search_document_regex again specifying pattern for case name plus reporter etc. But we already have matches. We need to extract all distinct values.\n\nWe could just use the search results as evidence? But we need to provide evidence snippet containing the citation. We could use the snippet from search results. The search_document_regex output includes token ranges and text snippet. We can use that as evidence.\n\nBut we must be careful: The snippet sometimes includes multiple citations. Each match includes several citations. For example, Match 1 in Application document includes \"Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021).\" That's two citations. We need to extract each separately.\n\nWe could do a new search that extracts each citation individually. But we could parse manually from snippets. We can read portions of documents to capture all citations.\n\nGiven time, maybe we should just use search_document_regex across all documents again but with a pattern that captures the full citation, maybe using regex to capture \"([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)* v\\. [A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*,\\s*\\d{1,5}\\s+[A-Za-z\\.]+\\s+\\d{1,6}\\s*\\(\\d{4}\\))\". The previous pattern worked. But we need to get all matches. The search output gave 146 matches across all documents but only first 20 displayed. We need all matches. We could perform search_document_regex again with top_k maybe 200? But default top_k is 5. Could set top_k to 200 to get more results. But the tool limit top_k <=20. So can't get all at once. We could iterate per document.\n\nWe have many documents unvisited. We could search per document individually with top_k 200? but limit 20. So need to process per document and collect all matches. But we might not need to read all documents; maybe we can rely on the search results for each match we need. But we need to extract all distinct citations. We need to parse manually. That might be large.\n\nMaybe we can choose to stop? But we must extract all. Possibly the list is large. But we can attempt to extract some.\n\nGiven the scope, maybe we should read a document that contains many citations, e.g., the Brief of Amici Curiae. It has many. We can read the entire document (11k tokens) but limit 10k. Could read multiple ranges.\n\nWe can read the first 10k tokens of that brief. That might include many citations. But we also need to cover all documents. Too many.\n\nGiven constraints, perhaps we should set Not Applicable? But it's not applicable because there are citations.\n\nWe must extract all citations.\n\nMaybe we can use search_document_regex on each document with a high top_k but we have limit. But we can loop through each document individually. There are 33 docs. For each, we can call search_document_regex with top_k 20 and gather all matches. But that would require many calls.\n\nBut we can maybe rely on search results from earlier: 146 matches across all docs. We can parse them. But we don't have all matches, only first 20. But we can issue a new search for specific documents we still need.\n\nWe can start with the brief of Amici, which returned 19 matches. We can read those matches? We have token ranges for each. We can read each token range to capture the citations. But the snippet already shows citations. For each match, we can extract citations.\n\nWe need to produce a list with evidence for each citation. The evidence can be snippet provided by search. So we can use that.\n\nWe need to handle duplicates: maybe same citation appears multiple times. We need distinct.\n\nLet's plan: For each match in brief, we parse snippet. For example, Match 1 snippet shows multiple citations: \"Earl of Clarendon, 17 Ves. Jr. 491, 34 Eng. Rep. 190 (Ch. 1810); Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962); Beebe v. Robinson, 52 Ala. 66 (1875); Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538 (D.D.C. Nov. 14 1983); Bond v. Floyd, 385 U.S. 116 (1966); Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211 (2011); Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793).\"\n\nWe need to extract each as separate entry. Provide evidence snippet containing the citation. We'll include source_document and location token range (we have token numbers). Let's record.\n\nSimilarly for other matches.\n\nBut we have many matches across all documents. Might be too many to fully extract manually.\n\nGiven time, maybe we can stop after extracting a subset? But requirement says all distinct values. Must be exhaustive.\n\nGiven complexity, we might not complete within single turn.\n\nBut we can attempt to read all documents sequentially with search. But might exceed time.\n\nPerhaps we can ask for a summary from the tool: use search_document_regex with pattern and top_k 20 per document, but we can loop. We could implement a batch: call search_document_regex for each document with top_k 20, gather results, parse. But we need to produce final answer with all citations. This is heavy.\n\nMaybe we can use read_document to read entire brief of Amici (11k tokens) to capture all citations; but still need to parse. But reading entire doc in chunks of 10k tokens: first 10k tokens and remaining 1k tokens. That might capture all citations. Then we can parse manually.\n\nBut there are many documents.\n\nTime is limited.\n\nPerhaps we can use the search results we already have as evidence for many citations; we can append them. But we still need to cover all documents not yet searched (e.g., other brief, motions). Many citations in other documents.\n\nGiven the difficulty, maybe we can set Not Applicable? But that would be wrong.\n\nGiven constraints, maybe we can choose to stop? But that would be incomplete.\n\nWe could choose to read one more document to gather more citations and then stop? But not all.\n\nHowever, the instruction: \"Your Next Action\" choose one action. We need to proceed.\n\nLet's at least read one full document to get many citations. For example, read the \"Application to Vacate\" document fully, but that's 18k tokens. We can read two 10k token chunks: 0-10000 and 10000-20000. That will give many citations.\n\nBut we have partial coverage already: 1110-1310, 5856-6056, 9093-9305. We need rest.\n\nLet's read from 0 to 10000. That will cover 1110-1310 etc. Then from 10000-20000 to cover rest.\n\nBut reading 0-10000 tokens might include all earlier content with citations. Good.\n\nWe can then parse all citations from this chunk. But still many citations.\n\nGiven time, maybe we can just read the entire document in two calls. Then we can parse.\n\nLet's proceed: call read_document for Application to Vacate from start 0 to 10000. Then call again for 10000 to 20000. Then we can parse.\n\nBut we might exceed token limit 10k per call, but we can read 0-10000 and 10000-20000 each 10k.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Application to Vacate the Order Issued by the U.S. District Court and Request for an Immediate Administrative Stay\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":10000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Application to Vacate the Order Issued by the U.S. District Court and Request for an Immediate Administrative Stay", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14915, "completion_tokens": 1722, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to read each match snippet to confirm. Perhaps we can use search_document_regex again with pattern and get matches. Then we can parse each snippet. Or we can just use the matches from step 7? But we need to ensure all citations are captured. The search results show many citations across documents. We need to extract each citation string in shortened Bluebook form. For example: Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021). Also many others like Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593 (2024). Also others like Brewer v.

If we set top_k to 20, might get more. But we need all 146 matches. We could iterate over docs, but maybe easier: we can read a document that has many citations, like the brief of amici. We saw many matches in that doc. We could read that entire doc to capture all citations. But doc length 11,751 tokens, but we can read 0-10000 tokens. That would cover many citations. But we might miss some beyond 10000? The doc has 11751 tokens. We could read 0-10000 tokens, but need to capture all citations. We need to ensure we capture all. We can read 0-10000; that covers most. But maybe some citations beyond 10000? The snippet shows tokens 543-1368 etc. The 0-10000 likely covers all citations. But to be safe, we could read 0-11751. However max 10000 tokens. We could read 0-10000 then 10000-11751. But we need to track visited ranges. The doc is partially visited: 543-1368, 1386-1907, 4478-4678. So we need to read unviewed ranges. For citations we need to read entire doc. But we can read 0-10000 covering many. But we have visited 543-1368 and 1386-1907. The rest unviewed 0-543? 0-543 is unviewed. Also 1368-1386 unviewed. Also 1907-4478 unviewed. Also 4678-11751 unviewed. That's a lot. We could read in segments. Maybe easier: search_document_regex across all docs to get all matches, then read each match snippet context. That might be easier. The search results gave 146 matches already. We can use that to capture all citations. We might need to parse each snippet. We can use the search_document_regex results from step 7 as source. But we need to retrieve them again. Let's perform search_document_regex on all docs with pattern same and top_k maybe 50 to get all. But the tool returns top_k per doc. We can set top_k to 20 but not enough. Could set top_k to 50? Max 20? The tool says max 20. So can't get all. But we can iterate per document. We can read each doc's snippet. But many docs. Might be heavy. Alternatively, we could use read_document on the brief of amici doc and read entire doc to capture citations. That doc has many citations. But still might miss citations in other docs. But maybe most citations are in that doc. But others also have citations like in the application doc, etc. We should capture all.\n\nWe could use search_document_regex on each doc individually. But we have 33 docs. We can loop over them? Might be many calls. But we can batch? No. We must choose one action. We need to decide next action. Perhaps we should read the brief of amici doc from start to finish to get all citations. That may yield many citations. Then we can append them. Then we might still miss some citations from other docs, but we can later search.\n\nGiven time, let's read the brief of amici doc fully. We'll read token range 0-10000 (covers majority). That was partially visited: 543-1368, 1386-1907, 4478-4678. We need to read 0-543, 1368-1386, 1907-4478, 4678-11751. We can read in multiple calls. Let's read 0-543 first. Then we could append extracted citations from that snippet. Then read 1368-1386, 1907-4478, 4678-11751. But we can only do one action per turn. So we need to decide first. Let's read 0-543. Then parse. So next action: read_document on \"Brief of Amici Curiae Florida and 19 Other States in Support of the Secretary's Application to Vacate the Order of the United States District Court\" from 0 to 543.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Brief of Amici Curiae Florida and 19 Other States in Support of the Secretary's Application to Vacate the Order of the United States District Court\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":543}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Brief of Amici Curiae Florida and 19 Other States in Support of the Secretary's Application to Vacate the Order of the United States District Court", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 543}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 25463, "completion_tokens": 1314, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have some citations in the read_document of Application to Vacate. We saw citations: Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021). Also Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 654 (Barrett, J., concurring). We need to extract all distinct values. We should search across all documents to capture all citations.\n\nWe have a regex search earlier that found many matches, but we haven't extracted them. We could use search_document_regex again across all docs for pattern of Bluebook citation. Pattern provided earlier; that regex matches case name v. case name, numbers. But we need shortened Bluebook citation: case name and reporter citation, no id/supra.\n\nWe need to gather distinct citations. Let's gather from application doc: Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021); Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 654 (Barrett, J., concurring) — but that includes parenthetical with concurring; still a citation? The requirement: shortened Bluebook form, includes case name only when immediately preceding the citation. The citation includes reporter and page. So \"Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593\" maybe. The second part 654 is a separate citation? Might be id. But we just capture the citation with reporter and page. Let's include each distinct citation.\n\nAlso in the brief doc: there were many citations in table of authorities lines: Abbott v. Thetford, 529 F.2d 695 (5th Cir. 1976); etc. Those are case names and reporter citations. We should extract all distinct ones.\n\nWe need to read more of brief doc to capture more citations. We have tokens 0-1368, 1386-1907, 4478-4678 coverage. We saw some lines but not all. We could search for pattern across all docs again.\n\nWe'll use search_document_regex with pattern as earlier: \"(?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*) v\\\\.

The current status: no values extracted yet. We have many matches from regex but not yet appended.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values of the checklist item \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\". We need to list each citation with evidence.\n\nWe need to read documents to capture the citations. We already have regex results with matches showing citations. But we need to ensure we capture all unique citations across all documents. We have many matches across many documents. We can use search_document_regex again for all documents to get all matches. But we already have 146 matches from step 10. We need to extract all citations from those matches. We need to parse each match to find citations.\n\nThe regex pattern used matches case name v. case name, case number, reporter, page, year. That captures many citations. But we also need to capture citations that are not in that pattern? For example, some citations might be in shortened form with reporter and year, but not case name? The requirement says: \"All citations to judicial opinions that include a reporter or database citation, represented in shortened Bluebook form (case name included only when it immediately precedes the citation); excludes id./supra/infra, docket-only references, slip opinions without reporter/database cites, and non-case sources.\"\n\nThus each citation is essentially like \"Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020);\" or \"Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021).\"\n\nWe need to extract each distinct value. That includes each unique citation string. We must add evidence with snippet, source document, location.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex to find all matches. We have 146 matches from step 10 across many documents. We need to parse them to extract each citation. But we can also search for a pattern like \"(?P<case>[\\w\\s]+ v\\. [\\w\\s]+),? \\d{1,5} [A-Za-z.]+ \\d{1,6} \\(\\d{4}\\)\" which we already used. The results give us each citation, but we need to capture each unique citation. Might need to read each match context to confirm. We can use search_document_regex with pattern capturing the whole citation and returning context tokens. But we need to ensure we capture each citation. The search results already show many lines with multiple citations per match. For example, the first match shows \"Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021).\"\n\nWe need to parse both citations. But the search results only give us the context around the match. Actually the regex pattern matched only the first citation in that context. But we can search again with a pattern that matches the entire citation string. We might just parse the matches manually.\n\nBut for extraction, we can approximate by reading the document 0-10000 tokens of the Application to Vacate... Already read. That contains at least Seila Law and Collins. We can capture them.\n\nWe also need to capture citations from other documents. We can use search_document_regex across all documents to get all matches. But we need to extract each citation individually. The search results provide many contexts but each context may contain multiple citations.\n\nWe can use a pattern that matches each citation individually. For example: pattern: \"(?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*) v\\. (?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*),?\\s*\\d{1,5}\\s+[A-Za-z.]+\\s*\\d{1,6}\\s*\\(\\d{4}\\)\" and maybe include optional semicolon or period after. That will capture each citation individually. We can then use search_document_regex on all documents with that pattern. That will give us each match.\n\nWe need to ensure we get all citations across all documents. We might need to search again but we already did. But the search results may not include all because some citations might not match the pattern due to formatting differences. But we can assume the regex covers most.\n\nGiven the size, it might be easier to use `search_document_regex` again to get all matches. Then we can parse each match to extract citation string and evidence.\n\nAlternatively, we can read each document partially and manually find citations. But with 33 documents, that's heavy.\n\nGiven the time, we can use `search_document_regex` again. But we already did step 10; we can just use `search_document_regex` again but maybe with a different pattern that captures the citation string and returns context. But we want to extract all citations. The search results show 146 matches across all documents. That likely covers all citations. We need to parse them into distinct citations. We need to extract each unique citation.\n\nWe can proceed with the next action: `search_document_regex` again on all documents with pattern capturing citations. But we might want to specify `top_k` to return all matches. The default is 5 per doc, but we want all. We can set `top_k: 20` maybe. But we need all. We can set `top_k: 1000` but that's not allowed. The max is 20. But we can just use search_document_regex with pattern and rely on default 5 but we might miss some. But we can use `search_document_regex` with `top_k: 20` to get more. But still may miss if >20 matches per doc. But we can perform multiple passes with different token ranges? That's tough.\n\nAlternatively, we can use `read_document` on each document where we have seen citations. But that's many.\n\nPerhaps we can just parse from the search results we already have. We can extract citations from the matches listed. We need to gather all distinct citations.\n\nFrom the search results, we saw many matches. We saw citations like:\n\n- Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020);\n- Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021).\n- Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 654 (Barrett, J., concurring). -> But this is a case citation with multiple page numbers? Actually it's \"Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 654 (Barrett, J., concurring).\" This is a citation but not in shortened Bluebook form? The pattern includes \"603 U.S. 593, 654\". But maybe we want each case cited with reporter and year. This seems to be a valid citation. We need to capture it.\n\n- Brewer v. Landrigan, 562 U.S. 996 (2010);\n- Brunner v. Ohio Republican Party, 555 U.S. 5, 6 (2008). Another citation.\n\n- \"Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020)\" appears many times.\n\n- \"Collins v.

But the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to fully gather all citations.\n\nBut as an AI, we can produce the final answer with all citations. But we need to provide evidence for each. That would be huge. But maybe for demonstration we can limit to a few.\n\nBut the instruction says \"EVERY distinct value\". So we need to list them all. That includes many.\n\nGiven time constraints, maybe we can produce a summarized list of citations with evidence from the provided excerpts. But we need to include evidence for each. This is huge.\n\nMaybe we can produce a subset? But that would violate instructions.\n\nGiven the system, we might need to output only a function call, not final answer. So we need to produce next action. The next action likely is to search again for citations across all documents. But we already have search results.\n\nBut we might need to read more to capture the rest.\n\nWe can use `search_document_regex` again with pattern capturing each citation individually and maybe set `context_tokens: 200` and `top_k: 20` with `doc_names: null` to search all. That will return up to 20 matches per doc, but we might need all. But we can set `top_k: 20` but there's many matches. But we can also use `search_document_regex` on all documents with pattern capturing the citation and we need to parse all matches. But we can set `top_k: 20` per doc. That might still miss some if >20.\n\nAlternatively, we can use `search_document_regex` with `doc_names: []`? Not possible.\n\nGiven the limitations, maybe we can use `search_document_regex` again but we will then parse matches to extract all citations. We can then add them to checklist. That might be acceptable.\n\nLet's do that: call `search_document_regex` with pattern: \"(?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*) v\\\\. (?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*),?\\\\s*\\\\d{1,5}\\\\s+[A-Za-z.]+\\\\s*\\\\d{1,6}\\\\s*\\\\(\\\\d{4}\\\\)\" and flags IGNORECASE, MULTILINE, DOTALL. top_k: 20. context_tokens: 200. doc_name: \"all\".\n\nWe'll then parse results. But we need to extract each distinct value. We might need to do it manually. But we can rely on the tool to fetch all matches. Then we can parse them.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*) v\\\\.

We could maybe use search again but we need to append all. We might need to do multiple append_checklist calls, but we can batch many entries. The instruction says after each read or search, we must append. But we can perform search_document_regex and then append. We can do one search that returns all matches; we already did. But we still need to append each unique citation. That might be many. But okay.\n\nWe must ensure we don't read fully visited docs. We have many partially visited. But we can rely on search results to extract citations. The search provided context. We can use that context as evidence. We need to provide text snippet containing the citation. So we can use the snippet from search.\n\nThus next action: perform search_document_regex again? We already did. But we can use the same results. We might just need to append. So we should call append_checklist with all unique citations extracted from the search results.\n\nWe need to compile list. Let's list distinct citations from all matches:\n\nFrom Application:\n\n1.

We may need to group duplicates.\n\nNow we need to provide evidence contexts. We have snippets from search results. We can use those.\n\nWe must ensure to provide location: token range or page. But we can use snippet location: e.g., \"Application to Vacate...\" tokens 1110-1310 etc.\n\nThus we need to call append_checklist with key and array of extracted entries.\n\nGiven many items, we may need to split across calls? The instruction allows batch. Let's create a single call with many entries. But careful about token limit? Not specified. We can send many entries.\n\nLet's construct patch with key \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\". For each entry, value string as citation, evidence array with text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe need to specify location: maybe token range.\n\nWe'll refer to the snippet tokens.\n\nLet's gather evidence:\n\n- Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020): snippet from Application tokens 1110-1310: \"Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020)\".\n\nLocation: tokens 1110-1310 in Application to Vacate...

We already have appended 36 values from 2 documents (Application and Brief). But that may not be exhaustive. There are many other documents (orders, opinions, other briefs) that likely contain additional citations. The snapshot says 33 documents, many partially visited. We need to systematically extract all distinct values.\n\nWe have already extracted 36 from two documents. We need to find remaining citations in other documents. We should search remaining documents for citations. We can use search_document_regex on all documents again to find matches. The pattern used earlier captured many but maybe not all. It captured 146 matches across documents. Already extracted from two docs. There are many other documents: Memorandum Opinion, Order on Emergency Motion, etc. We need to read those to capture citations.\n\nWe should search again for pattern across all documents to see any not yet extracted. But we need to read the matches to confirm unique citations. But we have 146 matches total. We extracted from Application 4 matches (Seila, Collins, Trump, Brewer, Brunner) and from Brief 19? Actually we extracted 36 values from Brief (but 19 matches? The brief had many citations). The 36 values maybe all citations in Brief. So we have captured citations from those two documents. The remaining 146-? Actually 146 matches found earlier. We extracted 36 from two docs. That leaves 110 matches. Those likely come from other documents. We need to systematically read those to extract citations.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex again on all documents to get all matches with context. That returns matches with context. We can process each document. But we need to avoid re-adding duplicates. We have not extracted any from other documents yet. So we should read the other documents to extract citations.\n\nWe should avoid re-reading tokens already visited. We have partial coverage of many documents, but we haven't read any of the orders or opinions. So we will read them.\n\nWe should decide to read one document at a time to extract citations. Could batch reading but each read_document can read up to 10k tokens. Many documents are smaller than that; we could read entire documents. For example, \"Memorandum Opinion\" 36k tokens, but we can read in chunks. But maybe easier to use search_document_regex to get matches per doc. That will give context around each match. We can then read each match context to confirm. But we can also read entire doc to capture all.\n\nGiven the time, we need to extract all citations. This is a large task. But we can try to just use search_document_regex to get all matches and then extract unique citations. The matches already capture citations. We can parse them from the context. We need to ensure we capture distinct values.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern, get all matches. That will give us tokens around each match. We can then parse the text of each match to extract the citation. We need to ensure we capture the shortened Bluebook format. The pattern might capture the citation and case name. We can extract the entire match text as the value. The pattern includes case name and citation. But we need to include the case name only if it immediately precedes the citation. That is satisfied by pattern. So we can just use the matched text.\n\nLet's run search_document_regex with pattern again. But we already did and got results. But we need to parse all matches. The search results gave matches in many documents. We need to process each match to extract the text. We can then compile a list of unique citations across all docs. We captured 36 from two docs. We need to find additional ones.\n\nWe can run search_document_regex again with top_k maybe 20 for each doc. Already did; we can request all matches per doc. But the tool default is 5 matches. We need all. We can set top_k large, maybe 200. But we don't know number per doc. Could set top_k 200. Let's call search_document_regex on all documents with pattern, top_k 200, context_tokens maybe 200. That will return many matches.\n\nBut we need to avoid duplicate extraction.

We need to verify completeness. The key is All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation. The task: Extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. We have 36 extracted values. We need to ensure all citations across all documents have been captured. Likely some citations may still be missing from remaining documents not fully searched. We saw that search_document_regex was used on all documents, but errors occurred due to top_k over 20. We had limited top_k default 5. But we have 146 matches across 33 docs. But we only captured citations from two documents: Application to Vacate ... and Brief of Amici Curiae. There may be additional citations in other documents: Orders, opinions, etc. The earlier search results show many matches but we only appended those from the two documents. We need to extract remaining citations from other documents.\n\nWe must use search_document_regex again but with top_k maybe 20? The error says top_k must be <=20. It default was 5. But we need to retrieve all matches. We could do multiple searches with different top_k but we need to handle all matches. But we can also just search with top_k 20 and then read each match manually. But there are many matches. However, the extraction requirement: extract every distinct value. The number of matches is 146. We have captured 36. There are 110 missing. We need to extract them.\n\nWe could do search_document_regex with top_k 20 per doc, then read each match token range. That may be many calls. But we can batch across documents. We can also use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern and top_k 20 (default). That will return first 20 matches per doc. We still need to capture others. We can use search_document_regex with top_k 20 but we need to set context_tokens maybe 200. But we need to capture all matches. We can do incremental search for each doc, but we might skip some matches.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for each doc individually with top_k 20, but we need to iterate over all docs. That is many calls. But acceptable.\n\nWe have 33 docs. Might take >30 calls. But we can possibly search across all docs with top_k 20 but then we cannot guarantee capturing all 146 matches. But we could do successive searches with offsets? Not supported.\n\nThus we should search each doc individually.\n\nWe need to identify which documents have matches. The search_document_regex results earlier indicated 4 matches in Application to Vacate, 19 in Brief of Amici, and others in other docs. We need to know which docs have matches. The \"Remaining matches: 3 in Brief of Amici Curiae Florida and 19 Other States... 2 in Defendants' Motion to Stay..., 3 in Defendants' Opposition..., 2 in Defendants' Reply..., 20 in Defendants; Motion for Summary Judgment\" etc. So we need to search those docs.\n\nWe can target docs with potential matches: Defendants' Motion to Stay, Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, Defendants' Reply in Support of their Motion for Summary Judgment and Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants; Motion for Summary Judgment. Also maybe others.\n\nWe might need to check each of these docs for matches. We'll do search_document_regex on each doc.\n\nLet's start with Defendants' Motion to Stay the Courts Administrative Stay.

The current extraction only used matches from first documents and the defences docs. We might have missed citations in other documents like Memorandum Opinion, Order opinions, etc. Likely many more. So we need to search all documents again for the pattern and ensure we capture all unique citations. We should use search_document_regex on all documents for the pattern, but earlier we had error due to top_k default too high. We can set top_k=20 and context_tokens maybe 200.

We need to ensure completeness. The checklist key: All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation. We have 36 extracted values from searches across many documents. We need to verify if any remaining citations exist beyond those 36.\n\nWe scanned many documents: Application to Vacate, Brief of Amici, Defendants' Motion, etc. The search results show 146 matches total. The current extraction includes 36 unique citations. But there may be more beyond those 36. We need to find remaining citations in the rest of the documents.\n\nWe have 33 documents, many unvisited. We have partial coverage of many. We need to find any other citations not yet extracted.\n\nWe should run search_document_regex on the remaining documents for the regex pattern, but we already did (the search returned 146 matches across all documents). We have extracted from at least 5+21+10=36 unique. But the 146 matches include duplicates and repeated citations. We need to find any unique citations not yet captured. There may be more than 36 unique ones.\n\nWe need to scan the matches again quickly: In step 15, we saw many matches across documents. We need to list all unique citations from those matches. Let's parse the matches seen in step 15 for other documents beyond those already covered.\n\nMatches from Application to Vacate: we captured Seila Law, Collins, Trump v. United States, Brewer, Brunner, etc. Did we capture all? The matches show only those 6. That seems correct.\n\nMatches from Brief of Amici: many citations. We captured 21 from that doc. Let's double-check if any missed: the matches list includes items up to 21? Let's list unique citations seen in Brief matches:\n\nFrom match1: Baker, Beebe, Berry, Bond (two), Chisholm\n\nThat's 6 citations.\n\nMatch2: same plus Cochran\n\nNow 7.\n\nMatch3: plus Collins, Delahanty, Dellinger\n\nNow 10.\n\nMatch4: same plus Dellinger, Dep't.\n\nNow 12? Wait Dellinger already counted. Dep't added.\n\nMatch5: Dep't, Edmond\n\nNow 14.\n\nMatch6: same plus Fineran? Actually match6 includes Fineran v.

But we only extracted 21 earlier. So many missed.\n\nThus need to extract all unique citations from Brief of Amici.\n\nAlso other documents may contain citations not yet extracted: Defendants' Motion to Stay, etc. We should search for matches not yet captured.\n\nWe could use search_document_regex again but limited to unvisited docs or partially visited. But we already did search all documents and got 146 matches; but the extraction may have omitted many. We can parse matches to identify new unique citations. But we need to locate them in the text to provide evidence. We will need to read the relevant token ranges.\n\nThus next action: read_document on the Brief of Amici at those token ranges that contain the missed citations. But many matches from that document are already partially visited: we saw matches 1-16 covering tokens up to 1907, 4478-4678. But there may be more matches after 4678, up to 11751 tokens. We need to identify missing citations.\n\nSimpler: run search_document_regex again on the Brief of Amici to get full list of matches. But we have already run search_document_regex on all documents and got 146 matches. But we need to see the full list of matches for Brief. The step 15 shows first 20 of 146 matches; but we need the rest, but not necessary to parse all. We can just read the entire Brief document to capture all citations. But the doc is 11,751 tokens; reading 10k tokens will cover most, but we might miss after 10k. But we could read entire doc in two chunks: 0-10000, 10000-11751. Already we have 0-1368, 1386-1907, 4478-4678. But we need rest: 1908-4477, 4679-11751. We can read those ranges.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Brief from tokens 1908-4477 and 4679-11751. But check coverage: we have already visited 0-1368 and 1386-1907 and 4478-4678. So we need to read 1908-4477 and 4679-11751. Each chunk <=10k tokens? 1908-4477 is 2569 tokens, fine. 4679-11751 is 707? Wait 11751-4679=707? Actually 11751-4679=707? Let's compute: 11751-4679=707? No, 11751-4679=707? Let's calculate: 11751-4679=707? 11751-4000=7751, minus 679 = 7072. So 7072 tokens. So both <=10k. Good.\n\nThus we will read those tokens to capture missing citations.\n\nTherefore next action: read_document on Brief of Amici tokens 1908-4477. Then read_document tokens 4679-11751.\n\nWe can do two actions? The instruction: choose one action per turn. So we can do first read 1908-4477. Then next turn read 4679-11751. But we might also need to read other documents for missing citations in other docs: Defendants' Motion to Stay, etc. But we will gradually add.\n\nThus next action: read_document Brief of Amici tokens 1908-4477.\n\nBut we must ensure we pass correct doc name: \"Brief of Amici Curiae Florida and 19 Other States in Support of the Secretary's Application to Vacate the Order of the United States District Court\".

But maybe there are more citations in other documents not yet searched. We have partially read many docs; but we have not searched all for citations. We can search remaining docs for citations. We might need to search all documents for pattern again and read more. But we already did search on all documents with regex matching case name pattern and reporter. That yielded 146 matches across many docs. We read some docs but not all. So we need to read other parts to capture additional citations that may not be in the ones we read? But we might have already collected many. But there may be more citations in other docs like Complaint, Docket, Mandate, etc. Also maybe in Memo Opinion, Order, etc. We should search the rest. Use search_document_regex again across all documents with same pattern, but we need to limit to documents we haven't fully read. But we already did search across all and got matches. But we only appended 36 citations from two docs. But there might be more citations in other docs. So we need to search again but gather evidence from other docs. We can read more tokens from other docs that contain matches, but we need to fetch the context. We can use search_document_regex with top_k maybe 1 per doc? But we want to get all matches? We might run search on all docs and get matches; but that might be large. But we can scan docs we haven't fully visited: e.g., Complaint, Docket, Mandate, etc.\n\nWe need to decide next action.

The status indicates all keys? Only one key. We need all distinct values of that key. We have 36 values extracted. Are there more? The search found 146 matches across documents; then we appended 36 values. We might need to confirm if all matches were captured. We need to ensure we extracted all distinct citations. The search gave 146 matches, but we appended 36. Likely multiple citations per match? We may need to read more documents to find any missing citations not already captured. We have seen many matches in various documents, but we might have missed some.\n\nWe need to check if any of the remaining documents have citations not yet extracted. We must read portions of documents with matches that were not yet captured.\n\nWe should use search_document_regex to get matches with context, but we need to capture from documents we haven't fully read. The status shows many documents partially visited. We need to identify which documents still have unvisited token ranges containing matches. We can search again for the regex pattern but limit to documents that are not fully visited. But search returns matches; we need to parse to identify which ones not yet captured.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the remaining documents where we haven't scanned for citations. But maybe the 36 extracted are all distinct citations. But likely not; we have 146 matches and likely many duplicates across documents. But some citations may be repeated. The goal is to extract all distinct values of that key. The 36 extracted might be all distinct citations. But we need to confirm. We need to check if any citations are missing. We should check documents not yet fully read: e.g., Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Mandate, Order (001), etc. But we didn't examine them for citations. Could contain citations too.\n\nThus, we need to search for citations in those documents. We can use search_document_regex on each unvisited document.\n\nBetter: Use search_document_regex on all documents with top_k maybe 20. But we need to capture all matches. We can parse the output. However, the tool returns matches; we may need to extract all matches per document. The search had errors due to context_tokens default too small? The error says context_tokens must be >=100. We can set context_tokens=200 as before. That seemed okay earlier.\n\nBut we can use search_document_regex on all documents again, get top 20 matches per doc. That returns matches for each doc. But we need to check which documents we still need to examine: many are unvisited. We can search them.\n\nAlternatively, we can read each document partially. But that would be many calls.\n\nBetter: Use search_document_regex to get matches across all docs. Then we can identify matches not yet captured by comparing to our 36 extracted list.\n\nWe need to store the extracted list. Probably we have 36 distinct citations.\n\nLet's see extracted list? Not provided. We can call get_checklist to get values. We should call get_checklist for key. That will return the list. Then we can manually check if missing.\n\nBut the problem expects we do next action; likely we need to search for remaining citations. We should call search_document_regex on all documents again. But we need to be careful about context_tokens. Let's call search_document_regex with context_tokens=200. That will give matches.\n\nWe need to parse the output; but the assistant can't parse; we just call. After receiving, we need to append new ones. But we might need to read further.\n\nWe might need to read documents that contain matches not yet extracted. The search output will give token ranges. We need to read those ranges to confirm.\n\nThus next step: search_document_regex on all documents again, context_tokens=200, top_k=20. Then read the matches that are not yet extracted.\n\nProbably easiest: call search_document_regex on all documents again. Then read each match specifically. But the tool might return a lot.\n\nHowever, we can narrow: The documents that still have unvisited tokens. Let's list those: many.

We have extracted 36 values for the key. We need to verify completeness. The key All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation has 36 entries. But earlier note says 36 values extracted from 5 from Application to Vacate, 21 from Brief of Amici..., 10 from Brief of Amici... Wait duplication? There's confusion: The key has 36 values, but maybe more exist beyond those 36? We need to ensure all distinct citations across all documents. We have searched all documents and found 146 matches, but we only appended 36 values. Perhaps we need to also extract from other documents that were not fully searched/ read. The search results gave 146 matches across 33 docs, but we only appended 36. The rest might be duplicates or not captured? The extracted 36 may be incomplete because the search results show many matches across documents, but maybe the 36 were unique ones from the three documents already read. There may be additional unique citations in other documents not yet fully examined. We need to examine more documents.\n\nWe should read more documents to capture missing citations. The next step: read the \"Memorandum Opinion\" and other orders to capture court opinions cited. But those documents might contain citations. The 36 values may be all from the two main documents; but other documents may have citations too. The search regex returned 146 matches across all documents, but many of those might be duplicates or appear in those same documents. But we need to capture all distinct citations across all documents.\n\nWe should process the remaining documents partially visited. Let's check the \"Memorandum Opinion\" which is partially visited but only 6% coverage. It likely contains many citations. We should read more of it.\n\nWe need to read the rest of the \"Memorandum Opinion\" to capture all citations. The key has 1 key. We must collect all citations. Let's read token ranges not yet viewed.\n\nCurrent viewed tokens in Memorandum Opinion: 3825-4025, 17369-17742, 18192-18573, 18785-18985, 30320-30520, 31327-31527, 31757-31957, 32229-32429, 34547-34747. That's 9 ranges; coverage 6%. We need to read more to capture all citations. We may need multiple read_document calls.\n\nBut maybe easier: use search_document_regex on \"Memorandum Opinion\" to find all matches. But we need to search across all documents; we already did that. But we didn't parse all matches. The search results gave 146 matches across all docs, but we only extracted 36. We need to extract the rest of the matches that are unique citations. We can use search_document_regex again but with context_tokens perhaps 200, but we need to avoid duplicates. We could search again and parse results. The results were already provided in step 18, showing matches for each doc. We saw matches for Application to Vacate, Brief of Amici, etc. For other documents, we didn't see matches? In step 18, the search results show matches for Application to Vacate (4), Brief of Amici (19), but not matches for other documents. That suggests the other documents didn't have citations matching pattern? But maybe they do but were not captured due to incomplete coverage? Wait the search result earlier found 146 matches across all documents. It listed matches for Application to Vacate (4), Brief of Amici (19), but didn't list matches for other documents, but it said remaining matches: 3 in Brief of Amici..., 2 in Defendants' Motion, 3 in Defendants' Opposition, 2 in Defendants' Reply, 20 in Defendants; Motion for Summary Judgment, and 10 more documents with matches. So indeed other documents have matches but not shown in the snippet. So we need to read those documents or search for matches specifically in those docs.\n\nSimplest: for each remaining document, run search_document_regex to get matches and extract them. But that could be many. But we can pick one doc at a time. Let's identify the documents with matches:\n\nFrom remaining: \n- Brief of Amici Florida (already partially read, but still has matches)\n- Defendants' Motion to Stay the Courts Administrative Stay (2 matches)\n- Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (3 matches)\n- Defendants' Reply in Support of their Motion for Summary Judgment (2 matches)\n- Defendants; Motion for Summary Judgment (20 matches)\n- 10 more documents with matches (not listed). These likely include other motions, orders, etc.\n\nWe should systematically go through each doc and extract matches.\n\nGiven limited time, we could focus on the 5 documents with known matches. The 10 others might also contain citations, but we must capture all.\n\nMaybe we could search all documents again but with a larger context and parse the matches programmatically? But we are human now; need to decide next action.\n\nWe should use search_document_regex on each document with known matches. Let's do for \"Defendants' Motion to Stay the Courts Administrative Stay\" (which we already saw matches). We need to extract those 2 citations: Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021); Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020). Actually match 1 had Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987). Match 2 had Hilton v. Braunskill again? Wait match 2 same? Let's re-check step 14: match 1 tokens 518-718 shows Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987). Match 2 tokens 528-728 shows same. So duplicates; but distinct citations: Hilton v. Braunskill, Collins v. Yellen, Seila Law LLC v. CFPB. So we need to capture those.\n\nAlso maybe other citations in that doc.\n\nSimilarly for Defendants' Opposition: we need to capture its citations.\n\nWe need to read each doc and extract all citations. Let's read \"Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\". It's partially visited (130-340, 4074-4274). We should read more.\n\nAlso \"Defendants' Reply in Support of their Motion for Summary Judgment\": partially visited 3262-3462, 5265-5465. We need to read more.\n\nAlso \"Defendants; Motion for Summary Judgment\": partially visited 1100-1300, 1304-1728, 1780-2914. We need more.\n\nAlso 10 more documents with matches: we can maybe search all documents again but specify doc_names list of those 10. But we need list. We don't have list. We could search all documents again; maybe it will list all matches to parse. But we can't parse programmatically; we need to read the results. The search results already gave first 20 matches. But we don't see the remaining matches. Possibly we can ask the system to provide all matches. But the search results only show first 20 of 146. Not entire. We could re-run with top_k bigger? The function has top_k param max 20. So can't get all at once. We could search per doc.\n\nThus we need to identify the remaining documents. We could inspect the list of documents from the catalog. The catalog is provided; we can read list_documents. But we already have the catalog in the snapshot. But we can call list_documents again to get list. That will give us all docs. Then we can identify which have matches. The search results gave matches for Application to Vacate (4), Brief of Amici (19), and then said remaining matches: 3 in Brief of Amici (again?), 2 in Defendants' Motion, 3 in Defendants' Opposition, 2 in Defendants' Reply, 20 in Defendants; Motion for Summary Judgment, and 10 more documents with matches. So we should search for those 10 docs.\n\nBut we don't know names. We could search per doc for pattern; but that's many.\n\nGiven time, maybe we can stop if we think 36 values are all? But that seems incomplete. We need to ensure completeness. The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we must find all. So we must continue.\n\nThus next action: read_document of \"Defendants' Motion to Stay the Courts Administrative Stay\" from token 518 to 728? Already read partially. But we should read the entire doc to capture all matches. Let's read from 0-2000 tokens. That covers the matched area. We'll get all citations. Use read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Defendants' Motion to Stay the Courts Administrative Stay\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":2000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Defendants' Motion to Stay the Courts Administrative Stay", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 2000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 19442, "completion_tokens": 1904, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The task is to extract all distinct values of the checklist item. It says we have 36 values. But we need to ensure all distinct values across all documents. The last status says 36 values extracted. But we need to confirm that we have all possible citations. We might need to review other documents that may contain additional citations not captured. The search results show 146 matches across 33 documents. The 36 values likely are subset of those matches. The prior step 12 appended 36 values. But there may be more than 36 across all documents. Need to verify completeness.\n\nSo next action: get_checklist to see current extracted list. But we need to decide if any documents remain partially unvisited that might contain citations. The list shows many partially visited documents with large coverage but not fully visited, but the search regex found matches across many. The 36 appended likely came from the first search; but the initial search found 146 matches across all documents. It seems the 36 values were extracted from the first search (maybe from the first few documents). But there may be many more citations beyond those 36.\n\nThus we need to extract all distinct citations from all documents. The easiest is to run search_document_regex again with the pattern across all documents, then manually parse all matches. But the search results already show 146 matches. If we had appended all those 146 entries, that would be the final set. However, we appended only 36, likely from the first search but not all. We need to extract the rest.\n\nSo we should perform `search_document_regex` again, but we already did many times. But we should maybe use a method to search for all matches and then read each match context. But the search returns context tokens around each match; we can parse them. However, we need to extract citations. We can use the regex pattern to capture citations. But the search results include many repeated matches because the same citation appears multiple times in the document. But we need distinct values: unique citations. We should gather distinct citations across all docs.\n\nThus we need to gather all unique citations from all matches. But we already have 36 extracted. We need to see if there are more. We can run `search_document_regex` again but maybe with top_k larger and context_tokens bigger to capture all, but we need to parse manually. We can also use search_document_regex with pattern that captures the citation: e.g., `(?P<case>[\\w\\s]+ v\\. [\\w\\s]+,\\s*\\d{1,5}\\s+[A-Za-z.]+\\s*\\d{1,6}\\s*\\(\\d{4}\\))`. But easier: use the same pattern and then parse matches. The pattern will capture each citation; we need to gather unique ones.\n\nWe might need to read each match to confirm it is distinct. There may be duplicates across documents.\n\nWe should decide to run search_document_regex again. But we saw earlier that the tool requires context_tokens >= 100. We can set context_tokens to 200. Use top_k maybe 20. But we want to get all matches; but the tool returns top_k per document. So we need to run for each document separately to get all matches, or set top_k high enough. But 20 per doc might not cover all 146 matches across 33 docs. But we can run for each doc individually. But that could be many calls. But we can process one doc at a time.\n\nAlternatively, we might read the entire documents where we know there are citations: e.g., the previously partially visited ones. But the search already found matches across many documents. We could just read each document fully to capture all citations. But that's many tokens.\n\nBetter approach: use search_document_regex for each document. But we can combine many docs at once using doc_names list.\n\nWe need to decide what to do next: we need to extract remaining citations. Let's see which documents are partially visited that might contain citations: many. But we could target the ones with many matches: e.g., \"Brief of Amici Curiae\" has 19 matches. But many of those citations appear already in our 36 appended? Not sure. The 36 appended likely came from search results but maybe only unique ones from the first few docs. Let's examine the 36 values appended: It says 5 from Application to Vacate, 21 from Brief, 10 from Brief again? Wait the summary says: 5 from Application to Vacate, 21 from Brief of Amici, and 10 from Brief of Amici? That seems duplicate. Actually the summary: \"36 values (5 from Application to Vacate the Order Issued by the U.S. District Court and Request for an Immediate Administrative Stay, 21 from Brief of Amici Curiae Florida and 19 Other States in Support of the Secretary's Application to Vacate the Order of the United States District of Columbia, 10 from Brief of Amici Curiae Florida and 19 Other States in Support of the Secretary's Application)\"\n\nSeems like maybe 5 from application, 21 from brief, 10 from brief? That totals 36. So maybe indeed all citations were from those two docs. But there might be other documents with citations too, like the orders, etc. But those orders might not have citations.\n\nBut we need to be thorough. Let's search for citations in other docs. We can search for pattern across all docs again. But we need to capture all matches. We can use `search_document_regex` with pattern and top_k maybe 20, but we need all. Let's try to call search for all docs individually.\n\nBut maybe easier: Use `search_document_regex` on all documents with pattern and context_tokens 200 and top_k 20. That will return 20 matches per doc. But some docs might have more than 20 matches. But we can maybe parse manually.\n\nAlternatively, use `search_document_regex` on all docs and then manually parse each match string for citations. But we would need to parse each match string. The tool returns 20 matches per doc. But we might need more. But we can run search again with top_k 100 maybe. The tool might allow top_k up to 20. Wait the spec says top_k between 1 and 20. So cannot exceed 20. So we cannot get all matches at once. We need to run multiple searches. But we can search for each doc separately and get all matches (top_k 20 each). But if a doc has >20 matches, we miss some. But maybe no doc has >20 matches; the brief has 19 matches. So top_k 20 covers all. Good.\n\nThus we can run search_document_regex on each doc individually and collect all matches. But we already have many matches from earlier. But we didn't parse them all. We need to parse all matches from each doc and compile unique citations. We need to incorporate those into the checklist. We need to create entries for each distinct value.\n\nThus next step: call search_document_regex on all documents individually, gather matches. But that's many actions. But we can batch multiple doc_names in one call. The tool supports doc_names array. So we can pass all 33 documents names. But the search will return top_k 20 per doc. That should cover all matches per doc. So we can get all citations.\n\nThus next action: call search_document_regex on all documents (doc_names array) with pattern, flags [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k 20, context_tokens 200. Then parse results. But we need to incorporate evidence for each citation. The search results include the snippet containing the citation.

The current status says keys with values: 1/1, empty keys 0/1. That indicates the only key is All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation. It has 36 values. Are we missing any? We must ensure all distinct values found.\n\nWe saw from search results many matches, but maybe there are more values beyond the 36. The current extraction probably included all from the documents yet read. But we haven't looked at all documents. Many documents unvisited: various orders, opinions, etc. There may be more citations in those documents. Must extract all citations to opinions in all documents. We haven't read all. So need to search across all documents. The search_document_regex already returned 146 matches across all docs, but we only extracted 36 values. The 36 likely from the two main documents? Wait 36 matches from the two documents? The search shows 4 matches in Application to Vacate..., 19 matches in Brief..., 2 matches in Defendants' Motion to Stay..., etc. But we extracted 36? The summary says 36 values from Application to Vacate, 21 from Brief, 10 from Brief? That seems off.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct citations across all 33 documents. We need to search all documents for pattern.\n\nWe already did search_document_regex across all, found 146 matches but only 36 extracted. We need to extract all. Approach: Use search_document_regex with pattern and get all matches; we saw many matches across documents. We need to extract each distinct citation. We can read the matches to confirm each citation. But given many matches, but we can rely on search results to identify each citation. But must provide evidence. We need to extract each citation with evidence from the document. That is many entries. This is a large task.\n\nGiven only 33 documents, we could search and capture all matches. But the search result lists many matches, but we need to extract each. We can perhaps do a search for pattern again with context 200 tokens to capture all. But we need to ensure we capture each distinct value. The pattern used earlier captured many matches. We could run search_document_regex again but maybe include all documents. We saw all matches. However the earlier search returned matches with context, but we need to parse them.\n\nGiven the complexity, but the instruction says we must extract all distinct values. The system likely expects many entries. We have to produce them.\n\nWe need to decide next action: maybe use search_document_regex again to get all matches, then parse. But we might need to do read_document to get more context for each.\n\nBut we can use search_document_regex to get all matches across all docs. It returned 146 matches, which is the number of citations found. That likely covers all. But we need to capture each distinct citation. We might need to read each match to confirm and extract the citation text. But we can provide evidence from the match snippet.\n\nWe can do a search with context 200 tokens and top_k maybe 150 to get all. But the tool might limit matches per doc to 20? We can set top_k to large, but the tool default is 5. We can set top_k: 20 maybe. But we need all matches. The search function returns top_k matches per document. To get all matches, we might need to request top_k > number of matches. But there may be many. Let's try top_k: 200.\n\nBut we need to provide evidence for each entry. That would be huge. However the instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to output all 146 entries. That is huge.\n\nBut maybe the 36 values we extracted earlier are all. But the search shows 146 matches across all docs. So we need to extract all 146.\n\nGiven time constraints, maybe the system expects we stop? But the instructions require all. We must proceed.\n\nWe can call search_document_regex again with top_k large to get all matches. Then we parse each match. But we need to produce JSON with entries. That will be extremely large. But we can attempt.\n\nWe can possibly produce a batch append_checklist with all entries. Each entry must include evidence snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe can extract the evidence from the search matches. The matches provide snippet of context. We can use that as evidence snippet. The location can be \"Match X (tokens a-b)\" or maybe \"page X\" if available. But we can use token range.\n\nThus we gather all matches from search result. But the search result includes only the first 20 matches of 146. We need all 146. We can request again with top_k 200 to get all.

Need to ensure all distinct values across all documents. Must check if any missing. The search results show 146 matches across all docs. But we only extracted 36. Likely many more. We need to extract all citations. The current extracted 36 are from some docs. We need to check other documents for citations.\n\nAvailable documents with partial coverage: many. We need to search for patterns of case citations in other documents.\n\nWe could use search_document_regex on remaining documents not fully visited. But we need to read the full results maybe to collect all citations. The search returns matches but we didn't capture all. We need to parse all matches and append all unique citations.\n\nWe should perform search_document_regex on all documents again with pattern, but we need to get all matches. The earlier attempts had errors due to context_tokens min. But we can run with default context_tokens 200. Should be fine. Use search_document_regex on all documents to get top_k 20 but that might miss some. Instead we can use search_document_regex on all documents with top_k 200? The tool requires top_k <=20. So we cannot get all. But we can use multiple calls for each document with top_k 20, then read more. But maybe simpler: we can use read_document for each unvisited doc to manually scan for citations. But that's many.\n\nMaybe we can rely on earlier search results: They list 146 matches total across all docs. But we need to extract all distinct citations. That could be many. But we only have 36 extracted. The rest were not captured. So we need to append them.\n\nWe need to parse search results from step 18, which listed many matches across docs, but we didn't capture them. We need to gather them.\n\nWe could perform a new search_document_regex on all docs; but tool may limit to 20 matches per doc. But we can call for each doc individually with top_k 20. That will get first 20 matches per doc; but there may be more. But maybe each doc has fewer than 20 matches? The brief had 19 matches. That's fine. The other docs may have fewer. So we can do search_document_regex per doc.\n\nBut we need to identify all doc names. We have a list of 33 docs. We need to loop. But we can batch multiple doc_names array. The tool supports doc_names array. We can give array of doc names. But we cannot exceed top_k 20 per doc. We'll get top 20 matches per doc. For each doc we will then read those windows to confirm citations.\n\nHowever, we already appended 36, but we need to avoid duplicates. We need to keep track of what we have extracted. We don't have that list here, but we can approximate.\n\nGiven time, maybe we can just stop? But requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have many missing.\n\nThus need to continue.\n\nWe'll perform search_document_regex on all documents with pattern, top_k 20, context 200. Then read each match to extract citations. But we need to browse maybe many. Could be many matches. But let's proceed.\n\nWe have list of documents names. We can provide doc_names array of all except those already fully visited? But we can include all.\n\nBut we need to read each match for evidence. That is a lot. However maybe we can just append citations from the earlier search results, which already provide matches. But we need evidence snippet with text and location. The matches provide snippet but location tokens. We can use those as evidence.\n\nThus we can use append_checklist with multiple entries extracted from those matches.\n\nWe need to create entries per distinct citation. The matches include citations like \"Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021).\" We can parse them.\n\nBut this is huge. Maybe the number of distinct citations is large (~?).\n\nGiven time, maybe we decide to stop? But would violate requirement.\n\nBut maybe the 36 extracted already cover all distinct citations? Could be that the search earlier found 36 unique citations across all docs. But the earlier step 12 appended 36 values. That suggests all distinct citations were found. The search earlier found 146 matches but many duplicates. So 36 unique citations. So we might already be done.\n\nWe need to verify if any doc might have additional unique citations not in those 36. The search results include many citations, but many duplicates of the same cases. The 36 might cover all unique ones.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nWe should double-check if any doc has citations not seen: e.g., \"Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477 (2010)\" appears in brief. That might not be in 36. Did we extract it? Not sure. But we might have missed. So maybe missing.\n\nThus we need to extract all distinct citations. We need to gather them. Let's count unique citations in the brief matches list. We could manually list some: Baker v. Carr, Beebe v. Robinson, Berry v. Reagan, Bond v. Floyd, Bond v. United States, Chisholm v. Georgia, Cochran v. McCleary, Collins v. Yellen, Delahanty v. Warner, Dellinger v. Bessent, Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. New York, Edmond v. United States, Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., Freytag v. Comm’r of Internal Revenue, Georgia v. Stanton, Gregory v. Ashcroft, Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, Inc., Hagner v. Heyberger, Humphrey’s Ex’r v. United States, In re Sawyer, Morrison v. Olson, Myers v. United States, Nixon v. United States, PHH Corp. v. CFPB, Props. of the Vills., Inc. v. FTC, Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, etc. That's many. Likely >36.\n\nThus we are missing many.\n\nTherefore we need to append them. We'll gather from the matches.\n\nTo avoid redundancy, we can add all unique citations found in matches. We'll need to provide evidence. We'll use the snippet from match and token range to locate.\n\nWe'll create append_checklist with many entries.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't exceed token limit? No.\n\nWe'll compile a list.\n\nGiven many, but we can approximate.\n\nLet's parse matches from brief: Provided many citations. We'll list unique ones.\n\nFrom match 1 snippet: includes: \"Baker v.
