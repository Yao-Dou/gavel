The prior step 10 claimed all parties extracted from Complaint and no additional parties appear in other documents. But we should verify. The checklist only has one key: Who_are_the_Parties. We have 7 values extracted. Are there other parties in other documents? Possibly the Docket might list parties. But the Complaint likely lists all. But other documents may include additional parties not in Complaint? For example, the Defendants' Motion etc may mention other parties like \"Secretary of the Treasury\" etc. But these are same parties. The question: \"Extract the parties involved from the legal documents.\" That likely means all parties across all documents. But if all parties are same as in Complaint, no new ones. However, to be safe, we should search for \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\" across all documents to confirm no other parties. But we already did search_document_regex with pattern matching and got many matches across many docs. But those matches presumably include parties. But we only appended those from Complaint. We might need to see if other documents mention other parties like \"United States\" or \"U.S.\" etc. But the pattern may match names with \"United States\" phrase. But the parties list might include \"United States\" as party? In the Complaint, parties are individuals. Some documents may refer to \"United States\" as a party? But usually in federal cases, the United States is a party. But the Complaint seems to have only individuals. But the docket may list \"United States\" but that's the plaintiff? The Complaint is \"Plaintiff: Hampton Y. Dellinger\" and \"Defendant: Scott Bessent\" etc. The \"United States\" is not listed as a party. But some documents may mention \"United States\" as a party in other contexts. But the question is to extract parties involved. It might be acceptable to include \"United States\" if present. But we didn't extract it. But the pattern search found many matches; but we didn't check them. The search pattern \"(Plaintiff|Defendant)\\s*:\\s*[^\\n]+\" might miss \"United States\" because not preceded by Plaintiff or Defendant.\n\nBetter to search for \"United States\" as party. But the pattern might not capture. But maybe the docket has \"Plaintiff: United States\" or \"Defendant: United States\" but not.\n\nGiven the earlier step, we appended 7 parties. We should confirm if any other party appears in other documents. Let's do a search_document_regex for \"United States\" preceded by \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" maybe \"United States\" alone. But also search for \"United States\" anywhere. But we might just search for \"United States\" or \"United States of America\" etc. But we can also search for \"United States\" but could be many. But we can search for \"United States\" preceding \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" maybe.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" in the entire corpus but we already did. But the search returned many matches across documents, 231 matches. But we didn't read those. But those matches might include the same parties but repeated. But could also include other parties like \"Secretary of the Treasury\" etc. But those are already included. But maybe there's an \"Attorney General\" etc. But not.\n\nMaybe other documents have \"United States\" party. But check docket. Let's search docket for \"United States\" or \"Plaintiff\" etc. Use search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"United States\" or \"Plaintiff\". But maybe we search for \"United States\" (case-insensitive). Let's do search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"(United States)\" with IGNORECASE. But we might need to include \"United States\" phrase. Let's do search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"United States\" with IGNORECASE. But we need to specify doc_name \"Docket\".

We did earlier a regex search across all docs for \"Plaintiff|Defendant\" but got many matches; but we only appended 7 from complaint. There could be other parties in other documents, e.g., other plaintiffs? Let's check: The complaint had Plaintiff, multiple defendants. Other documents may include other parties like \"Defendants' Motion to Stay\" etc. But parties could be same as complaint; but maybe there are other parties like \"United States\" as defendant? However the parties list includes \"United States\" as government? In complaint, the defendants are named individuals; the government may be considered party. But in the complaint, the parties list does not include \"United States\". The complaint may have \"Defendants: ...\". The \"United States\" may be a party in other documents. For example, the docket might list \"United States\" as a party. But the checklist item: \"Who_are_the_Parties\": descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices. So we should include all parties across documents. The complaint lists 1 plaintiff and 6 defendants. Other documents may refer to other parties (e.g., \"United States\" as the \"Plaintiff\" in a motion to dismiss? Not sure). However the docket references \"United States\" maybe as a party. The docket might list \"United States\" as defendant. But we need to extract distinct values across any document. So we should search for party names.\n\nLet's search all documents for \"United States\" pattern? But that may be many irrelevant references.

But we should confirm if any other documents mention parties. We have covered many documents partially. But if we believe no other parties appear, we can stop. But we must be sure that we didn't miss any party.\n\nWe need to check if other documents might contain parties. We have many documents partially visited: Docket, Mandate, etc. Some documents might mention parties. But the prior steps indicate that only the Complaint had parties. The user says \"All parties have been extracted from the Complaint ... and no additional parties appear in other documents.\" That is presumably from a previous step. But we need to verify: maybe other documents mention parties. But given the list of documents, many are orders, opinions, motions, etc. They might mention parties. But the system may have already scanned some. We need to check if any other document might mention parties that are distinct from the ones already extracted.\n\nWe have 7 parties extracted. The next step, if satisfied, is to stop. However, the instruction says \"You must extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have 7 values. We must ensure that all parties in all documents are captured. We have not visited all documents fully, but the summary says no additional parties appear. That may be based on prior search. But we might double-check by searching across all documents for \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" patterns again. But we already did a search on all documents for pattern \"(Plaintiff|Defendant)\\\\s*:\\\\s*[^\\\\n]+\" and found matches in many documents. It found 231 matches: 10 in Appellee's Motion to Dismiss as Moot, 6 in Application to Vacate, 1 in Brief of Amici Curiae, 19 in other docs. Those matches might include parties like \"Plaintiff: John Doe\" etc. But earlier we did search and appended 7 values from Complaint. But perhaps some of those matches in other docs are same parties, or new parties? We need to check.\n\nGiven the earlier step 6: 231 matches across many documents. But the user step 10 said \"All parties have been extracted from the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and no additional parties appear in other documents.\" That implies that the search found matches but those matches are not new parties. But I'm not 100% sure.\n\nGiven the instruction: \"Choose ONE action\" - we can decide to stop if we are confident. But maybe we need to verify with a search. Let's think: The search pattern matched \"Plaintiff:\" \"Defendant:\" etc. But the complaint had 7 parties. Other documents might refer to the same parties. But they might also refer to \"Government\" or \"United States\" as defendant, but maybe that's a party. The parties might include \"United States\" as defendant. That might be considered a party. But the Complaint might have listed \"United States\" as defendant. But we need to see if any other documents mention \"United States\" as plaintiff or defendant.\n\nThe search on Docket for \"United States\" found only a snippet about administrative stays. The Docket might not list parties.\n\nThe other documents might be orders, which may not list parties. The orders may refer to parties in context. But they might not include the \"Plaintiff:\" labels.\n\nNevertheless, the previous step 12 searched Docket for \"United States\" and found a snippet. That snippet is not a party statement.\n\nThus, we could stop.\n\nBut to be careful, maybe we should run a search on all documents for \"(Plaintiff|Defendant):\" again but with location context to see if any new parties appear.
