When investigation is warranted, the OSC resolves most matters by assisting settlement or alternative dispute resolution with the complainant-employee and the agency-employer, but the OSC occasionally seeks corrective action on behalf of the employee in the MSPB. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1212, 1215. If the OSC declines to seek corrective action, the employee alleging a PPP retains an independent right of action to file with the MSPB without OSC involvement, subject to certain procedural requirements. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1209.5(a)."
