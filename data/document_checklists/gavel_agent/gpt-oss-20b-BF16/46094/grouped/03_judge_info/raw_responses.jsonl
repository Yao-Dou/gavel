There may be other judge names in other documents. We need to extract all distinct values of the checklist item First_and_Last_name_of_Judge. So we need to find all judge names across all documents. The earlier search regex \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" found matches. But maybe there are judge names with middle initials or titles. The regex may be too narrow. We need to search again maybe with broader pattern: \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+\". But we need to capture first and last. Could also be \"Judge [First] [Last]\" or \"Judge [Full]\". We might look at Docket entries show \"Judge Amy Berman Jackson\". That is first and last names? Actually \"Amy Berman Jackson\" is full but includes middle name \"Berman\". We should capture the full name as found. For other documents, might have \"Judge J. Smith\" or \"Judge John Doe\". Let's search again but maybe we need to find all matches.\n\nWe already did a search on all documents with pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" and found 46 total matches. The matches included \"Judge Katsas\" etc. The earlier step appended Amy Berman Jackson, but there were other matches like \"Judge Katsas\". We need to extract all unique judge names. So we should read or search further to capture all names. The search returned 46 matches; we have only captured 1. We need to extract all distinct judge names.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex again to get all matches. Maybe we can request all matches; default top_k 5 per doc. But we may need all. We can set top_k high? Max 20. We could call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)\" maybe to capture multi-part names. But we can simply search with \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+\" and get matches. But we need to capture context. Let's use search_document_regex with doc_names all? doc_name=\"all\". pattern: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+\". This should match sequences of alphabetic words after Judge. It's okay. Provide flags [\"IGNORECASE\"] maybe not needed. top_k maybe 20. context_tokens maybe 200.\n\nAlternatively, use search_document_regex with doc_names all and pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" to get first two parts. But we need to capture names like \"Judge Amy Berman Jackson\" which includes three words. The regex \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+\" will capture at least two words after Judge. That may capture \"Judge Amy Berman Jackson\" as \"Judge Amy Berman Jackson\". Good.\n\nWe likely also have \"Judge Amy Berman Jackson\" repeated. We need distinct names. Also \"Judge Katsas\" appears (maybe just one word). That would not match the two-word pattern. We might need to include single-word names as well. But we can capture those by separate regex or match all.\n\nAlternative: search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" and include the next word optionally. But we can parse. Let's just search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" to capture at least two words: \"Judge\" then first name. Then we can include context for extraction.\n\nBut we might miss \"Judge Katsas\" because it's single word after Judge. But we can also search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][A-Za-z]+\"? That would match \"Judge Katsas\" as \"Judge Katsas\". But we need to capture the judge name. We can then parse the name: \"Katsas\". But \"Katsas\" is last name? Might be just the last name. But we need first and last name. Not sure if \"Katsas\" is full name. Possibly \"Judge Katsas\" is a judge with last name only. Should we extract \"Katsas\" as the judge name? The requirement: \"The name of the presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided).\" So we can take \"Katsas\" as provided. So we need to include that.\n\nAlso there may be \"Judge Amy Berman Jackson\" repeated. Also \"Judge J.\" maybe. We'll just capture all.\n\nSo we need to extract unique names from all matches.

But there may be also other judges, e.g., \"Judge Katsas\" appears in an appellate case, but it's not the presiding judge for this case. The checklists likely want the presiding judge for the case (the main case). The docket shows \"Case Assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson\". So that's the presiding judge. There may be other judges appearing in the case, but not presiding. The instruction: \"The name of the presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided).\" So we should capture Amy Berman Jackson. We already have that.

So we should update the checklist to set the key to that value? We already appended. But we need to ensure that the key is complete. According to instructions: \"Stop when all keys are either complete or Not Applicable.\" We have one key, and we have one value. But do we need to confirm there's no other judge assignment?

In the docket we saw Amy Berman Jackson. In other documents, we saw \"Judge Katsas\" but that's a judge in the appeals court, not the presiding judge? Possibly the presiding judge is the judge in the docket, but the requirement is generic: \"The name of the presiding judge\". Usually, the presiding judge is the one listed in the docket. There may be multiple docket entries with same judge. But we should collect all distinct judge names.\n\nSearch document regex for \"Judge\" found many matches. But we need to verify if those names are presiding judge. For example, \"Judge Katsas\" appears in many appellate documents. Also \"Judge White\" appears? We saw \"Judge White\" in some context? The search results show matches but some are not judge names. But we need to decide whether to include them.\n\nGiven the task, we should extract all distinct judge names that appear as \"Judge X Y\" within the documents. The current extraction only captured Amy Berman Jackson from the docket. We should search other documents for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" pattern for more names. Also, the docket shows \"Case Assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson\" and \"before Judge Amy Berman Jackson\". So that's the presiding judge.\n\nOther documents: \"Judge Katsas\" appears in the appellate documents. But does that judge preside over the case? Possibly the appellate court's judge. But the presiding judge for the case might be the same across all documents? Usually, the docket indicates the judge for the case. So we might only need Amy Berman Jackson. But let's confirm if there are other judge names in docket: search for \"Judge \" pattern in docket. The docket entries show only Amy Berman Jackson. There is no other judge name.\n\nThus the only judge name is Amy Berman Jackson. But the search matches found \"Judge Katsas\" in other documents. But the instruction says extract the presiding judge. The presiding judge should be the same across all documents. So we should not list appellate judges. However, the specification might just want all judge names that appear. But the item is singular: \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\". That implies a single name? But the instruction says \"Every distinct value of each checklist item\". For a single-valued key, we could have multiple values if there are multiple judges. But likely only one. So we can leave as Amy Berman Jackson.\n\nBut we might need to confirm if any other judge appears in docket or court orders as presiding judge. Let's search docket for \"Judge\" again. The docket entries show only Amy Berman Jackson. So we are done.\n\nThus the checklist is complete. No Not Applicable. So we should stop.\n\nBut before stopping, we should double-check that no other judge names appear in docket. The docket's token range 0-234 includes the lines. It's enough. There might be other docket entries later that mention other judge names? The docket is 7480 tokens; we have partially visited 38%. But we saw only Amy Berman Jackson.

The requirement: extract every distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition. If multiple judges appear across documents, need to capture all. We saw other matches: Search found many matches with \"Judge Katsas\", \"Judge Amy Berman Jackson\", possibly others. We need to check if other judges appear. Likely multiple judges in various documents. The Docket shows only Amy Berman Jackson. But other documents might have other judges: e.g., other orders, opinions. We need to search for Judge [A-Z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+ pattern. Already did a search earlier: 63 matches across 33 docs. That included many \"Judge Katsas\". So we need to extract all distinct judge names.\n\nThus we should search for judge names across documents. We could use search_document_regex with pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+\" across all documents. That already was done and returned 63 matches. We need to extract each unique judge name. The search results show many matches but we need to read to confirm each name. Maybe each match snippet contains the judge name. We can parse from search results.\n\nBetter to use search_document_regex on all documents again but collect unique names. But we need evidence for each. The search results already include context. But we need to capture evidence snippets from the returned matches. The search will give top_k matches per document with context. But we need to read for each to get evidence.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex with pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+\" on all documents, top_k maybe 20 per doc.

The search_document_regex might return the entire match. We can later parse.\n\nThus next step: search_document_regex across all documents for pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+\". Then output matches. Then we will parse unique names.\n\nWe need to include the evidence snippet. The search returns context tokens. We'll need to include the text snippet containing the name.

Also \"Judge\" in other contexts maybe \"Judge\" from docket entries etc. We need to gather all distinct judge names that are presiding over this case. The case is the U.S. District Court for DC? It might have judge Amy Berman Jackson as the presiding judge. But there might be other judges: e.g., \"Judge Katsas\" is a circuit judge? Actually \"Judge Katsas\" appears in the case \"On Application to Vacate the Order Issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\" which is a district court case. \"Judge Katsas\" might be a judge in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals? Wait, the text shows \"Judge Katsas\" in the district court case, but the case might be in the DC Circuit? The docket shows \"Case Assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson.\" So likely Amy Berman Jackson is the district judge. The other \"Judge Katsas\" might be a circuit judge? In the District of Columbia, there is a Judge David S. Katsas of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. So the case may involve both district and appellate judges.
