The complaint says \"Plaintiffs the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the State of California, ... allege as follows\". But does it refer to class action? In the Amended Complaint, there may be a paragraph that states \"This is a class action\" or \"Class action under Rule 23\". The snippet didn't show. We need to search for \"class action\" again in Amended Complaint maybe beyond token 2000. The previous search found 0 matches in all documents, maybe because pattern didn't catch \"Class Action\" with capital? It searched case-insensitive.

But earlier search returned 0. Could still be not present. Perhaps plaintiffs are \"individual\" (states and agencies) but they are filing as \"class action\" representing states? But they are states, not individuals. The question: \"class action status\" - designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs (with brief description of the individuals when applicable). So we need to determine if the lawsuit is a class action. The Amended Complaint might have a section \"Class Action\" or \"Class Settlement\" etc. We should search for \"class action\" again but maybe the term appears as \"class action\" but earlier search might have missed due to line breaks? It was case-insensitive, should find. The result 0 indicates no match. Maybe the complaint uses \"class action\" elsewhere?

But likely the complaint states.\n\nWe could search all documents for \"class action\" again but earlier search returned 0. Maybe the phrase is \"class action\" but not present. Could be \"class\" alone? We could search for \"class\" but that may be too broad.\n\nAlternatively, the status may be \"Class Action\" if the complaint is filed as a class action by states.

We might need to search for \"class\" alone? But that returns many false positives. Perhaps the classification is not in the complaint but in other documents like motions or orders. We need to find where \"class action\" or \"individual\" designation occurs. The only mention of \"class action\" might not exist because the plaintiff is a set of states and the Commonwealth, but not a class action.\n\nWe need to check if the case is a class action or individual.

If no evidence, maybe \"Not Applicable\"? But we need evidence. We need a clear statement \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\".\n\nWe need to find such statement. Maybe the complaint has a heading \"Class Action\" or \"Class\" or \"Individual\". But we saw the complaint's heading includes \"Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the State of California, ... Plaintiffs\". That appears as a list of state governments, not a class action. So maybe it's not a class action; it's a group action of states, but not a class action.\n\nBut the classification key likely expects a value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\" or \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". We need to extract that. Where is that indicated? Possibly the complaint has a heading \"Class Action\" or \"Class\". But not found. Maybe the docket or the motion to dismiss includes mention of \"class action\" but not found.\n\nMaybe the docket includes \"Class Action\" as a docket entry. But we haven't searched docket. Let's try search_document_regex on Docket for \"class action\" again? Already did all documents. But maybe the docket is large and not scanned? But we should try search on docket for \"class action\".\n\nBut the search_tool returned 0 matches on all documents. That means the term \"class action\" is not present anywhere. So maybe the classification is not present. But the instruction says extract every distinct value. If none, maybe we set Not Applicable? But we need evidence that it's not applicable. We might find that the complaint is a multi-state action, not a class action. But evidence might be that the complaint lists the plaintiffs as states, not a class. However, that might not be enough.\n\nWe need to search for \"Class Action\" phrase specifically. Already none. Maybe \"class action\" appears in a different format: \"class action\" in lower case? Already case-insensitive. So none.\n\nThus, the only evidence that the plaintiffs are not a class action is that the complaint lists them as states, not a class. But we might need a statement like \"The plaintiffs are a group of states\" or \"The plaintiffs are the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the State of California, etc.\" That indicates not a class action.\n\nBut the key expects \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\". We could extract that the plaintiffs are individual states. Is that considered individual plaintiffs? They are distinct parties. The classification might be \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" with description \"Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the State of California, the State of Maryland, etc.\" That could be evidence.\n\nThus we should extract one entry: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State of California, State of Maryland, etc.\" Provide evidence from the Amended Complaint excerpt that lists the plaintiffs. The excerpt includes the list of plaintiffs. So we can use that.\n\nThus we need to append the checklist for key \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" with extracted entry \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State of California, State of Maryland, State of Washington, State of Arizona; the State of Colorado; the State of Delaware; the State of Hawaiʻi, the State of Minnesota; the State of Nevada; the State of New Jersey; the State of New Mexico; the State of New York; the State of Oregon; the State of Rhode Island; and the State of Wisconsin\".\n\nWe need evidence: text snippet from the complaint.

However we might need to confirm from other documents like \"Motion to Dismiss\" may mention \"class action\" or \"class\" but we didn't search there. Since we didn't find any, maybe the case is not a class action, so the sole key should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" with description. But we need to verify that no other documents mention class action. Perhaps the \"Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" etc. Might mention \"class action\" or \"class action status\".\n\nWe should search again for \"class action\" but maybe need to include words like \"class action\" with different spacing or hyphen. Already searched with pattern \"(?i)Class Action\" and \"(?i)class[- ]action\" and no matches. Could search for \"class action\" without case? Already did. Maybe the word \"class action\" appears but pattern didn't catch due to line breaks? But regex with DOTALL? Maybe we need to set flags [\"IGNORECASE\", \"DOTALL\"]. But pattern \"class action\" should match across line breaks? No, regex default is dot does not match newline. But pattern doesn't use dot, just literal \"class action\". Should match across tokens. It may have \"class action\" across line break not possible. So if it's there it would match.\n\nMaybe we need to search for \"class action\" in each document individually. But we already did search all docs. So likely no class action mention.\n\nBut we might need to search for \"class\" alone? But that might generate many false positives. But given we only need to find distinct values for class action status, we can assume only one value: individual plaintiffs. But we must confirm that no documents mention \"class action\" or \"class\" as a status. We can search for \"class action\" again but maybe with \"class action\" inside quotes. Let's do search_document_regex with pattern \"(?i)class action\" again? But we already did. Maybe some docs have \"Class action\" with capital C and no space? Already did.\n\nMaybe the \"Plaintiffs\" might be a class action but the labels in the complaint might not contain \"class action\" but may have \"class action\" used in the heading of the complaint? But we didn't see.\n\nWe can search for \"class action\" across all docs again just to be safe. But we already did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"class action status\" is \"Individual\" and includes description of plaintiffs. We already extracted that. The value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State of California, State of Maryland, State of Washington, State of Arizona; the State of Colorado; the State of Delaware; the State of Hawaiʻi, the State of Minnesota; the State of Nevada; the State of New Jersey; the State of New Mexico; the State of New York; the State of Oregon; the State of Rhode Island; and the State of Wisconsin\".\n\nBut we might want to shorten or keep as is. The requirement: Each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nThus we should produce the value exactly: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State of California, State of Maryland, State of Washington, State of Arizona; the State of Colorado; the State of Delaware; the State of Hawaiʻi, the State of Minnesota; the State of Nevada; the State of New Jersey; the State of New Mexico; the State of New York; the State of Oregon; the State of Rhode Island; and the State of Wisconsin\".\n\nShould we include \"Commonwealth of Massachusetts\" etc. Yes.\n\nWe need to confirm evidence: we have the snippet from the Amended Complaint. We need evidence location: page 1 of 92. We need text snippet. The snippet shows \"Plaintiffs,\" then list of states. So we can provide that as evidence. Should we include the entire snippet? Just the snippet that includes the description.\n\nWe need to update checklist? We already appended one value. But maybe we need to update if we find more values. Since we think only one value, we might consider setting Not Applicable for any other keys? But there are no other keys. So we can stop.\n\nBut we need to ensure we didn't miss any other values. The \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" might mention \"class action\" but we didn't search. Let's search again for \"class action\" in that doc. Use search_document_regex on that doc.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)class action\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Defendants' Motion to Dismiss", "pattern": "(?i)class action", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6627, "completion_tokens": 1217, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But is this complete? We need \"Every distinct value\" found in any document. We have one value: Individual. There may be other values in other documents. We haven't scanned many documents. We need to search for other mentions of class action or individual plaintiffs description. The prior searches for \"class action\" returned no matches in all documents. But the value we extracted is \"Individual, described as Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State of California, ...\". That likely covers all plaintiffs.\n\nBut we must check other documents for class action designation; maybe some documents mention \"Class Action\" differently, like \"class action lawsuit\" or \"class action suit\". The earlier regex didn't find anything. But maybe the Amended Complaint might also have a heading \"Plaintiffs\" with description. We have that. Are there any other documents that might mention \"Class Action\"? Could be the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction etc. Let's search again for \"Plaintiffs:\" pattern. Already did; but maybe \"Plaintiffs\" appears elsewhere. But we only need the designation: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\". The extracted value is presumably correct.\n\nHowever, there might be documents that mention \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" though earlier search didn't find. But maybe the text is in a different case or across pages not scanned. We have not visited many documents. We should search for \"individual plaintiffs\" or \"class action\" across all documents again. The earlier regex search for \"(?i)class action\" returned 0 across all 15 documents. So likely no other mention. But maybe the word \"class action\" appears as \"class action lawsuit\" or \"class action suit\". The pattern could miss due to hyphen? But \"class action\" is unhyphenated. That should match. However maybe \"class action lawsuit\" appears. That includes the phrase \"class action\". So the regex should catch it. Since no matches, likely no mention.\n\nBut we might have to confirm that the Amended Complaint is fully visited? It's partially visited: only first 2000 tokens. We might need to read more of the Amended Complaint to confirm that the designation is only \"Individual\" and not \"Class Action\". The current extracted value might be incomplete if there are other plaintiff designations later. The Amended Complaint could list multiple groups: e.g., \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Commonwealth of Massachusetts, ...\". That might be all. But there might be other statements later, like \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" but unlikely.\n\nWe need to ensure we have all distinct values. The evidence we have is from Amended Complaint page 1 of 92. The extracted value is a single string. That seems correct.\n\nBut we also need to check other documents where the plaintiffs might be described differently. For example, the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction might include a caption, but likely similar to the complaint.\n\nThus, to be thorough, we should read more of the Amended Complaint beyond token 2000 to see if there are additional designations. Maybe later, after the caption, there's a section stating \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" etc. But we have that. But we might want to confirm there is no mention of \"Class Action\" anywhere else. We could read a later portion of the Amended Complaint, e.g., tokens 2000-4000, or search for \"class action\" within that file. Let's do search_document_regex on Amended Complaint for \"class action\" again. That might confirm. But earlier search all documents found 0. But maybe we didn't search within Amended Complaint after token 2000. The regex might have scanned the whole document, so 0. So no mention. So likely no other values.\n\nBut we should consider that the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" key might also have a value \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\". That is a single value. If the answer expects listing multiple distinct values, we might need to check other documents for other values like \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". But there are none.\n\nThus we can stop if we confirm that no other values exist. But we need to be sure. We could perform a search for \"Plaintiffs:\" again across all documents to see if any other mention. It returned 0 matches. That means no other \"Plaintiffs:\" lines. So safe.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we should double-check the extracted value we appended is correct: we appended the text from Amended Complaint page 1. The snippet: \"Plaintiffs, v. ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., in his official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human Services; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; No. 1:25-cv-10814-BEM JAYANTA...\" The extracted value was a description of the plaintiffs: Commonwealth of Massachusetts, etc. That might be correct.\n\nBut the value we appended earlier might have been truncated? It was: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State of California, State of Maryland, State of Washington, State of Arizona; the State of Colorado; the State of Delaware; the State of Hawaiʻi, the State of Minnesota; the State of Nevada; the State of New Jersey; the State of New Mexico; the State of New York; the State of Oregon; the State of Rhode Island; and the State of Wisconsin\". That looks plausible.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we need to ensure that the value is the entire string, not truncated. We might need to confirm that the captured evidence covers the entire description. But we have evidence from Amended Complaint page 1; the snippet likely includes all. It may be enough.\n\nThus, we should issue a stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct values for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs have been extracted and no further documents contain additional designations.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct values for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs have been extracted and no further documents contain additional designations.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4539, "completion_tokens": 1256, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The earlier extraction appended one value: Plaintiffs: Individual, described as list of states. But we need to ensure no other documents mention class action or other designation. We searched pattern \"Class Action\" and \"class action\" on all documents, found none. However maybe other documents mention \"class action\" but not exact phrase? Could be \"class-action\" or \"class action\" with hyphen. Already searched \"class[- ]action\" pattern, no matches. Could be \"class action lawsuit\" etc. The earlier search regex didn't find matches but might have missed due to case-insensitivity? We used (?i) which covers case-insensitivity. So likely no other mention.\n\nBut we need to double-check the Amended Complaint for other classification. The extracted value came from the Amended Complaint: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State of California, State of Maryland, State of Washington, State of Arizona; the State of Colorado; the State of Delaware; the State of Hawaiʻi, the State of Minnesota; the State of Nevada; the State of New Jersey; the State of New Mexico; the State of New York; the State of Oregon; the State of Rhode Island; and the State of Wisconsin\". That is describing plaintiffs as individuals? Actually they are states. So the classification says \"Individual\" but described as states. That matches requirement.\n\nBut we must ensure that no other documents have \"class action\" claim, maybe in the \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". That may be class action but not captured. The prior search didn't find \"class action\" but maybe it's a class action complaint? But the search pattern may have missed due to not exactly containing \"class action\" phrase, but could be \"class-action lawsuit\" etc. We should search for \"class-action\" again. We did \"class[- ]action\" pattern. That should catch hyphen. So likely none.\n\nBut we might also look for \"class action\" in docket or orders; but likely not.\n\nThus likely the classification is only that one value.\n\nBut we must follow the instruction: we need to extract all distinct values. If only one, that's fine. But check if any other documents mention \"class action\" but not \"class action\" phrase, e.g., \"class action lawsuit\" might not be captured by our regex but still indicates class action. The pattern \"(?i)class[- ]action\" would match \"class action\" and \"class-action\". So should catch. So no matches.\n\nBut maybe other documents describe the plaintiffs as \"class\" in some other phrasing. But they might not use the phrase \"class action\". But the classification specifically is a designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs. The text might not use the phrase \"class action\" but could say \"class action lawsuit\" etc. But we captured the only instance where plaintiffs are described as Individual. But maybe other documents might say \"class action\" but we didn't see.\n\nGiven the search didn't find any matches, we can assume no other values.\n\nThus we can mark stop. But we should double-check: The earlier append_checklist step 8 indicated \"Successfully appended 1 key: Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" and added that value. That is the only value.\n\nThus we must stop. There's no need to update checklist.\n\nThus next action: stop.
