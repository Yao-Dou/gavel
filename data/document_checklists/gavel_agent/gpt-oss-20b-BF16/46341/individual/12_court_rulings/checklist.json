Two groups of plaintiffs sued, alleging that the new policy and the research grant terminations that directly flowed from it violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs claimed, for example, that the new policy was arbitrary and capricious because NIH and HHS never defined the prohibited research categories and the explanation for discontinuing such research rested on circular reasoning. The district court held a trial on the merits, ruled in the plaintiffs' favor, including on their arbitrary and capricious claims, and entered two orders setting aside the new policy and related grant terminations as \"illegal\" under the APA. See Am. Pub."
