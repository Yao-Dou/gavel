HARTLIEB (IL Bar No. 6322571) 6 BENJAMIN S. KURLAND (DC Bar No. 1617521 Trial Attorneys 7 U.S. Department of Justice 8 Civil Division\". This indicates defendants counsel: government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice). Plaintiffs counsel not seen here. The other documents: \"Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion\" shows counsel for defendants: individuals from DOJ: YAAKOV M. ROTH, ERIC J. HAMILTON, ALEXANDER K. HAAS, CHRISTOPHER D. EDELMAN, etc. So we have defendants counsel: government counsel (United States Department of Justice, Civil Division, Federal Programs Branch). Plaintiffs counsel might be in other docs like Complaint or Plaintiffs' documents. We haven't read those. We could search for \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" or similar. Use search_document_regex on all docs pattern \"Counsel for Plaintiff\". That might find. Also search for \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" or \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" etc. Or \"Counsel\". We already did a broad search for \"Counsel\" and matched many. Might need to parse further. Also docket shows appearance by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Dept of Defense. That indicates plaintiffs counsel: maybe private counsel representing Trump? Actually Donald J. Trump is the plaintiff? In the case, the plaintiffs are Donald J. Trump and Pete Hegseth? The docket says \"Notice of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". That indicates the plaintiffs are Trump and Hegseth; the defense is DOJ? Wait, the case is a lawsuit by the plaintiffs (Trump) against the DOJ? The titles: \"Defendants' Corrected Opposition\" indicates defendants are DOJ. So plaintiffs are Trump and Hegseth. So the plaintiffs counsel is Eric J. Hamilton? Wait, Eric J. Hamilton is listed as counsel for defendants in the defendant notice. But the docket says Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. That suggests that Eric J. Hamilton is representing the plaintiffs (Trump) but also appears as counsel for the defendants? That seems contradictory. But maybe the docket entry is incorrectly labeled. Or maybe the docket entry lists the appearance of Eric J Hamilton as counsel for the defendant side? Actually the docket entry says \"Notice of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". So Eric J. Hamilton appears as counsel for the plaintiffs (Trump, Hegseth) and for the defendant (DoD). But maybe he is a defense counsel? Actually, the defendants include the Department of Justice and Department of Defense? The case might be a lawsuit by Trump et al. against the DOJ and DoD. So the defendant counsel is government counsel (DOJ, DoD). The plaintiffs counsel is maybe a private law firm (maybe \"Public interest nonprofit\"?). But we need to identify.\n\nWe should search for \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" in all documents to see if it appears.

Also earlier matches may have other counsel. We need both sides if available. We have evidence for defendants: \"Counsel for Defendants\" with staff details. For plaintiffs, we need counsel. There was earlier search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" but no matches. Could be in docket? That had \"Counsel for plaintiff or the removing party\". That's generic. Not a specific counsel. We need to find actual counsel names for plaintiffs. Let's search in the docket for \"Counsel for plaintiff\" again but maybe we should read more of docket around those matches. Also check other documents: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief may list counsel. Also Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion may list counsel. Let's search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" in all documents again but maybe we did earlier and got 0. But maybe pattern wrong: could be \"Counsel for the plaintiff\" or \"Counsel for the Plaintiffs\". Let's broaden search: pattern \"Counsel for the\" could catch. But we need to extract counsel for plaintiffs. Alternatively, in the docket, the \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\" indicates that Eric J Hamilton is appearing on behalf of those parties. That might be plaintiff counsel. The docket shows \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". So that's counsel for defendants? Actually Donald J. Trump and Pete Hegseth are defendants. So Eric J Hamilton is counsel for defendants. But we need plaintiffs: Donald J. Trump is a defendant. The plaintiffs are likely other parties. The docket may not show plaintiff counsel. Let's search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" again but maybe the docket has \"Counsel for plaintiff or the removing party\". That is generic. Doesn't give name. Let's search in other documents for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" or \"Counsel for the Plaintiff\" etc. But we only have the search results earlier. Maybe the plaintiff counsel is in the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. Let's search that.

We have some info: in Defendants' Notice, we saw \"Counsel for Defendants\" and list of DOJ counsel. Also we have docket entries referencing Eric J Hamilton representing Donald J Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. So we can extract:\n\nPlaintiff: (Donald J. Trump and Pete Hegseth) represented by Eric J Hamilton, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Department of Defense. So type: Public interest nonprofit? Actually it's government counsel. So \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Defense)\". But guidelines: brief category labels and include organization in parentheses. So: \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Defense)\". Also \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Defense)\" might be enough. For defendants: \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\". Also there may be other counsel: \"Defendants' Notice\" has multiple DOJ attorneys.\n\nWe need to review other documents for other counsel. The docket entries show \"Counsel for plaintiff or the removing party is responsible ...\". But not specific counsel names. But we have the \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" entry in docket with names: Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. So we have that.\n\nWe should also search \"Counsel for Defendants\" in other documents: In Defendants' Corrected Opposition, maybe there are other counsel. But we can search. We already have partial coverage in Defendants' Corrected Opposition: tokens 0-178, 356-556, 3841-4041, etc. We should search for \"Counsel for Defendants\" there. But maybe the docket is enough.\n\nAlso \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" might exist in Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction? Not sure.\n\nWe can perform a search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Counsel for Defendants\". That will give matches and context. Then read the relevant matches to extract.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" in Defendants' Corrected Opposition, but we saw none earlier. But the docket gives.\n\nWe should also search for \"Counsel for\" in the Complaint, Order, etc. But let's start with searching for \"Counsel for\" in all documents to find any other counsel. But we have many matches already. But we can narrow: \"Counsel for Defendant\" and \"Counsel for Plaintiff\". Let's do search_document_regex for \"Counsel for Defendant\" maybe.\n\nBut to avoid too many matches, we can search for \"Counsel for Defendant\" or \"Counsel for Defendants\" and \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" in all documents.\n\nWe already saw \"Counsel for Defendants\" in the Notice; we can get evidence.\n\nWe also saw \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" in docket. We can extract.\n\nWe might also need to extract \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" if present. But we saw none.\n\nThus we have two entries:\n\nPlaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Defense)\nDefendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\n\nAlso maybe the DOJ counsel includes multiple: YAAKOV M. ROTH, ERIC J. HAMILTON, ALEXANDER K. HAAS, CHRISTOPHER D. EDELMAN. So we can list organization in parentheses. The type: Government counsel. So \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\". We might also include \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\" even though multiple DOJ counsel.\n\nNow evidence: The excerpt from Notice shows \"Counsel for Defendants\" and the list of DOJ attorneys. Also docket excerpt shows \"Counsel for plaintiff or the removing party is responsible ...\", but we need specific names: \"Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". That's the evidence.\n\nThus we need to capture the text snippet with that line. We should read the relevant part from the docket to capture the names. The search earlier gave tokens 1139-1339 etc. The excerpt included \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". So we need to capture that.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Docket for tokens 1139-1339 or maybe 1139-1339 already loaded. But the earlier search gave tokens 1139-1339, but we didn't read that text. We might need to read to confirm. So we should call read_document for Docket tokens 1139-1339.\n\nAlso we might read the notice for defendants to capture the list. We saw tokens 0-400 earlier; maybe we need to read the rest of the list. But we have tokens 0-400 with the list. It includes the DOJ counsel. We saw lines 1-13 with names. So that is enough. But we might need to read more to confirm the list. But we can also read tokens 0-400 again for evidence. But we already have that snippet. But we need to provide evidence snippet. We can use the earlier snippet.\n\nBut the earlier snippet was excerpted; we need to provide the evidence text exactly. The snippet in Step 9 shows the text. So we can use that.\n\nThus we need to perform read_document for Docket tokens 1139-1339. Then append_checklist for Type_of_Counsel with two entries.\n\nThus next action: read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":1139,\"end_token\":1339}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 1139, "end_token": 1339}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4708, "completion_tokens": 1215, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have evidence from Step 9: read_document of Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order shows \"Counsel for Defendants\" and list of DOJ officials. We need separate entries for Plaintiff and Defendant. We have Plaintiff counsel: maybe none. But we need to search other docs for counsel for plaintiff. We saw Docket includes a notice of appearance by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. That suggests counsel for plaintiff: Eric J. Hamilton (Deputy Assistant Attorney General? Actually from DOJ). So we have counsel for plaintiff: Eric J. Hamilton (United States Department of Justice). Also maybe other counsel for plaintiff in other docs. Let's search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" in other docs not yet read. There was search result in Docket but not specific names; but the notice of appearance includes \"Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". So we can extract that as Plaintiff counsel: Eric J. Hamilton (United States Department of Justice). For defendant counsel, we have \"Counsel for Defendants\" list: YAAKOV M. ROTH, Acting Assistant Attorney General; ERIC J. HAMILTON; ALEXANDER K. HAAS; CHRISTOPHER D. EDELMAN (Senior Counsel, United States Department of Justice). So multiple counsel for defendants. We should create separate entries for each side? The requirement: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" But also \"The type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available.\" So we need to categorize each. For defendant counsel: all are government counsel (United States Department of Justice). So type: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). Maybe multiple names but same category. Could we consolidate into single entry per side? The requirement ambiguous: \"extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" That suggests two entries: one for plaintiff, one for defendant. Each entry might include list of counsel types? It says \"extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …'\". It doesn't say multiple entries per counsel, just per side. So we should produce two entries: Plaintiff: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice); Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). But if there are distinct organizations (like DOJ vs other), but here both sides are DOJ. But the defendant side includes multiple DOJ officials. The plaintiff side also DOJ. So same type. But we might list the specific names? The requirement: \"using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available.\" So we can list: \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\" and \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\". That suffices.\n\nHowever, maybe there are other documents with other counsel types. We need to check other documents for counsel. Let's search in Complaint, motion, order for counsel. Use search_document_regex for pattern \"Counsel for\" in those docs. But we already did search in all docs for \"Counsel\" and found matches mostly in defendant doc and docket. But maybe the Complaint doesn't have counsel. But let's search specifically for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" in Complaint. But earlier search across all docs found 3 matches only in docket. So likely no other counsel.\n\nThus we can conclude only DOJ counsel for both sides. So Type_of_Counsel has two entries.\n\nWe need evidence: For plaintiff: evidence from Docket tokens 1139-1339: the notice of appearance by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. That's a DOJ employee, so government counsel. Provide text snippet. For defendant: evidence from Defendants' Notice tokens 0-400: \"Counsel for Defendants\" list includes DOJ officials. Provide snippet.\n\nThus we need to append to checklist. We'll call append_checklist with key Type_of_Counsel and two entries:\n\n- Plaintiff: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\n\nWe need evidence array for each: for plaintiff evidence: text snippet from Docket. Provide location: Docket, tokens 1139-1339, maybe page? We'll note location string \"tokens 1139-1339\". For defendant: text snippet from Defendants' Notice tokens 0-400, location \"tokens 0-400\".\n\nWe should ensure evidence text is verbatim snippet. Let's copy from Step 13: snippet includes \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". We'll use that.\n\nFor defendant: Step 9 snippet contains list of DOJ officials, but we need to show the portion that includes \"Counsel for Defendants\" and list. We can use snippet: \"Counsel for Defendants\" plus the names of DOJ officials. That is from Step 9.\n\nWe might want to include more context: \"YAAKOV M. ROTH Acting Assistant Attorney General Civil Division ... \" etc. But snippet can be the first part lines. We'll provide snippet containing \"Counsel for Defendants\" plus names.\n\nOk.

But still might be more counsel types. Need to search for other counsel mentions. We saw earlier search results indicated many \"Counsel\" matches. We need to find if there are other counsel types such as Private counsel or other types. Let's search within the unvisited documents for \"Counsel for\" or \"Counsel\" maybe mention private counsel. Also maybe \"Counsel\" in Docket beyond the portion we read. We have partially visited Docket; we could read more token ranges to capture more counsel mentions. The Docket appears to have a lot of entries. We saw \"Counsel for plaintiff or the removing party is responsible...\" etc. That does not specify counsel type. But earlier we extracted from Docket \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". That is government counsel.\n\nWe need to check other documents for counsel for plaintiff or defendant. Let's search in all documents for \"Counsel for\" again. But we did earlier; maybe we missed some. We can search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" again (but earlier found 3 matches). There may be \"Counsel for Defendant\". Let's search for \"Counsel for Defendant\". Also \"Counsel for the Defendant\". Also \"Counsel for the Plaintiff\".\n\nAlso \"Counsel for\" might appear in other documents like Complaint, Motion, etc. Let's search.\n\nWe should use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern: \"Counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant|the Plaintiff|the Defendant|Plaintiffs|Defendants)\" etc. But we can just search \"Counsel for\" and then parse.\n\nBut we already have partial coverage of many docs; we can read more tokens for each doc to find counsel mentions.\n\nLet's search all documents for \"Counsel for\" again but maybe we missed due to earlier search only limited matches? The earlier search for \"Counsel for\" on all documents returned 5 matches: 2 in Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion, 3 in Docket. So only those 5 matches. That suggests no other \"Counsel for\" in other docs. But there may be other \"Counsel\" patterns not starting with \"for\" like \"Counsel representing\" or \"Counsel on behalf of\". We saw the Docket had \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". That is a \"NOTICE of Appearance\" entry indicating counsel.\n\nMaybe other documents include \"Counsel for\" but the earlier search didn't find them. But there may be \"Counsel\" in the Defendants' Corrected Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order.\n\nLet's search in that doc for \"Counsel\". Already did search_document_regex for \"Counsel\" on that doc earlier? Step 8 indicated no matches found. So maybe no counsel mentions there.\n\nAlso \"Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" earlier had \"Counsel for Defendants\" lines.\n\nNow we need to check if there are private counsel or other types. In the Docket, the appearance is for U.S. Department of Defense, government counsel. In Defendants' Notice, the counsel names: \"YAAKOV M. ROTH, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division\" etc. That's also government counsel. So far all counsel are government.\n\nBut maybe there are other counsel for plaintiffs or defendants in other docs like Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction? Maybe there is a \"Counsel for\" entry in docket or other documents. But earlier search \"Counsel for\" didn't find others.\n\nHowever we might have counsel for plaintiffs in the docket besides government? The docket may list appearances for plaintiffs as well. The earlier match shows \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". That's for plaintiffs, but still government.\n\nThere might be other appearances, e.g., \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by John Doe on behalf of ABC Corporation\" etc. Let's search in Docket for \"NOTICE of Appearance\" more broadly. But we just need counsel types.\n\nMaybe there are \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" in other documents like \"Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" etc. But earlier search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" found none in those docs. So likely no counsel.\n\nBut maybe there are private counsel for defendants, e.g., \"Counsel for Defendant: John Smith, Doe Law Firm\". Could be in the \"Defendants' Corrected Opposition\" doc. But earlier search for \"Counsel\" returned none. So maybe not.\n\nThus maybe only two counsel entries exist. But we need to check if any other counsel entries appear in the docket beyond the ones we read. The docket has many entries; we only read token ranges 1139-1339, 1355-1555, 1571-1771, 3237-3488. There might be more \"NOTICE of Appearance\" entries elsewhere that we haven't read. They might involve private counsel or other government counsel for plaintiffs or defendants. So we need to search the docket for \"NOTICE of Appearance\" patterns. But we can also search for \"Appearance\" or \"Appearance\" maybe. But better to search for \"Appearance\" or \"appearance\" in docket.\n\nLet's perform search_document_regex on Docket with pattern: \"NOTICE of Appearance\" or \"Appearance\". The docs are large; but we can search \"Appearance\" maybe. Let's use pattern \"NOTICE of Appearance\" which is uppercase. Use search_document_regex on Docket.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"pattern\":\"NOTICE of Appearance\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "NOTICE of Appearance", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4705, "completion_tokens": 1264, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But we need to ensure all counsel types represented in documents. There may be other counsel: e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, etc. We need to search for other \"Counsel\" patterns in documents not yet visited: Docket has many appearances; we saw many notices of appearance with names and state of California attorneys. Those represent Plaintiff side? The docket shows many appearances on behalf of Gavin Newsom, State of California. That indicates Plaintiff counsel: State of California (public interest, but likely government counsel). Also there are appearances on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. That indicates Defendant counsel: U.S. Department of Defense (government). Also maybe appearances on behalf of other parties.\n\nWe need to extract each distinct value with evidence. The current extracted values include only those from Docket and Defendants' Notice. But Docket has many more. We need to read more of Docket to capture all counsel. Also check other documents: Complaint, Order, etc. We should search for \"NOTICE of Appearance\" or \"Counsel for\". But we already did search. But need to capture all appearances.\n\nWe should read more of Docket beyond current tokens. Currently visited ranges 0-375, 432-1011, 1139-1339, 1355-1555, 1571-1771, 3237-3488.

We might find other parties: e.g., \"Notice of Appearance filed by ...\" with party names. Identify Plaintiff and Defendant. We can parse as: Plaintiff side: State of California, Governor Gavin Newsom. Defendant: Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. Also maybe other parties: e.g., \"Christopher David Edelman\" on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. Also \"Eric J Hamilton\" on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. Also \"Nicholas David Espiritu\" on behalf of Gavin Newsom, State of California. Also \"Megan Richards\" on behalf of Gavin Newsom, State of California. So all counsel are government counsel (state or federal). No private counsel? Might be in other documents: Complaint maybe lists counsel. We haven't visited Complaint. We should search in Complaint for \"Counsel\". Search_document_regex on Complaint for \"Counsel\". It found 0 earlier? Step 12 search in Complaint found 0. But maybe there is counsel list in the Complaint? Usually the Complaint lists attorneys for parties. The search pattern \"Counsel\" might not find \"Counsel for\". Let's search for \"Counsel for\" specifically in Complaint. But we can search again. But maybe the Complaint uses \"Counsel\" or \"Represented by\". But we can search for \"Counsel for\" in Complaint. Also \"Counsel\" maybe present. But we should search for \"Counsel for\" in all documents again. But to avoid redundancy, maybe use search_document_regex on all documents for \"Counsel for\". But we already did many searches. The search in Step 7 found 5 matches across documents. But maybe not include Complaint. But we could search again to capture any new matches. But we might need to read the portions of Docket that contain appearances. Let's read more of Docket.\n\nWe need to capture all distinct counsel type entries. We have already two entries. But we may need to add \"Plaintiff: State of California (government counsel)\" maybe differentiate that from United States Dept of Justice. But the two entries are already \"Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\". But we might also have \"Government counsel (State of California)\". The current extraction didn't include that. We need to add. Also maybe private counsel for other parties? But likely not.\n\nThus we need to read more of Docket to find appearances for State of California and U.S. Department of Defense. We'll then append two entries: Plaintiff: Government counsel (State of California) and Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). However, the Defendant entry might already exist but we may need to differentiate between Trump and DOJ counsel? But the DOJ counsel appears for both parties.\n\nThus we need to gather evidence.\n\nLet's read Docket tokens 1700-2100 to capture appearances.\n\nWe also might need to read other documents like Order, Complaint, etc. But let's focus on Docket.\n\nWe'll read Docket from 1700 to 2100.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":1700,\"end_token\":2100}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 1700, "end_token": 2100}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6218, "completion_tokens": 1106, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have extracted 2 values: Plaintiff: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice) and Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). Are there other counsel? Maybe private counsel for plaintiffs or defendants. We haven't read all docket tokens; we saw multiple Notice of Appearance for various parties: e.g., Nicholas David Espiritu on behalf of Gavin Newsom, Megan Richards on behalf of Gavin Newsom, Christopher David Edelman on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. Also earlier we saw \"Eric J Hamilton\" on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense (Gov). So these appear to be government counsel. But maybe there is private counsel for plaintiffs: e.g., maybe \"Ruth B. Smith\" etc. Let's search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" again? Already done. Maybe \"Counsel for Defendants\" we had. But also \"Attorney\" could be private. For plaintiff side, we saw \"Gavin Newsom\" is a public official, but the counsel listed is \"Nicholas David Espiritu\" (likely a private attorney). That could be private counsel for plaintiff. And also \"Megan Richards\" on behalf of Gavin Newsom, also private counsel. Also \"Christopher David Edelman\" on behalf of Trump and Department of Defense; but that's government counsel. Also \"Eric J Hamilton\" is government counsel. So for plaintiff side, we might have private counsel: Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards. Are there any other? Also maybe \"Attorney: John Doe\" etc. Let's search for \"Notice of Appearance filed by\" for plaintiffs. We saw multiple. We saw \"Nicholas David Espiritu on behalf of Gavin Newsom, State of California\". That is plaintiff. Also \"Megan Richards on behalf of Gavin Newsom\" also plaintiff. So we may have at least two private counsel entries for plaintiffs. Also maybe \"Christopher David Edelman\" is also plaintiff? Actually he is on behalf of Trump and Department of Defense, which is defendant side. So we have at least 2 private counsel for plaintiff.\n\nAlso there might be \"Attorney: ... on behalf of State of California\" etc. But we saw those. Also \"Gavin Newsom\" is the plaintiff. So we need to extract distinct values of Type_of_Counsel. So the values should be unique categories. They said format 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. So we should produce entries:\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu)\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Megan Richards)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice) from Docket\n- Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice) from Defendants' Notice...\n\nBut we already have two entries for Defendant: Government counsel. Should we deduplicate? They are same value. We may combine into one entry: Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So distinct value; duplicates not needed. So we should keep only one entry for Defendant: Government counsel.\n\nSimilarly for Plaintiff, two distinct values: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu) and Private counsel (Megan Richards). Could there be also private counsel for plaintiff: maybe \"Attorney: ... on behalf of ...\"? We should search for \"Notice of Appearance filed by\" for plaintiff. But we only looked at the docket partial. Might have other plaintiff counsel in other documents like Complaint? Let's search across all documents for \"Notice of Appearance filed by\" maybe include other parties. But we already have many. We might search for \"Attorney\" in documents. But we need to find counsel for plaintiff. Let's search across the docket for \"Notice of Appearance filed by\" again but maybe earlier tokens include \"Gavin Newsom\" etc. We saw that. We could read more tokens to confirm no other plaintiff counsel.\n\nLet's examine the docket tokens 0-375, 432-1011, 1139-1339, 1355-1555, 1571-2100, 3237-3488. We have read 0-375? We saw some matches earlier. Let's read token 0-400 of Docket? Actually we have token 0-375 view. Let's read 0-400 to capture earlier notices.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":400}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 400}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6660, "completion_tokens": 964, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have only two values currently, but we may need to check other documents for more counsel types: e.g., plaintiffs might have private counsel or public interest nonprofit. In docket we saw many notice of appearances by attorneys representing Gavin Newsom, State of California, etc. Those may be counsel for plaintiff. Also attorneys representing Defendants include Christopher David Edelman, etc. These are likely private counsel (maybe private law firm). The document \"Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion\" had counsel for defendants, but we only captured the first two lines (YAAKOV M. ROTH etc). Actually we need to read more of that document to see other counsel. Also the docket has many notices of appearance for multiple attorneys representing the parties. We need to extract all distinct types: For plaintiffs: government counsel (US Department of Justice) is for Defendants not Plaintiffs? Wait caretaker: The case is about US government vs State of California? The docket shows \"Notice of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". That is government counsel representing the US. That is defendant side? Actually US government is a defendant? The complaint is \"against All Defendants\" including US government. So the US is a defendant. The plaintiff is State of California. The docket also shows \"Notice of Appearance filed by Nicholas David Espiritu on behalf of Gavin Newsom, State of California\". That is plaintiff counsel (the state). So we have plaintiff counsel: State of California (public interest nonprofit? Actually it's a state, not a nonprofit). We need to format as \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\"? Wait for plaintiff counsel: It's state counsel, maybe \"Government counsel (State of California)\". The instruction: \"brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available (e.g., Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)). If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\"\n\nThus we need to produce entries like \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (State of California)\" and \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\". Also maybe private counsel entries like \"Defendant: Private counsel (Edelman, Christopher David)\" if that is a private attorney.\n\nWe need to check the Defendants' Notice Regarding... which had counsel for defendants: YAAKOV M. ROTH etc. That likely is the DOJ counsel. The docket shows many attorneys for the US, but it's the same group. For defendants, we might have private counsel too. We need to search for \"Counsel for Defendants\" in other docs. We already saw matches but no text. We should read more of Defendants' Notice to capture the list of counsel names. Additionally, the docket shows names: Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards, Christopher David Edelman. These could be private counsel for the State of California. The docket also shows \"Eric J Hamilton\" and \"Christopher David Edelman\" for US. Those could be DOJ counsel.\n\nWe need to extract distinct values. Likely we need:\n\n- Plaintiff: Government counsel (State of California)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\n\nPossibly also private counsel entries if present. For example, the docket shows \"Christopher David Edelman\" representing US. That might be private counsel. But the description says \"Counsel for Defendant: ...\".\n\nThe docket show \"Notice of Appearance filed by Christopher David Edelman on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". That indicates private counsel for US. So that might be \"Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman)\". But earlier we had \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\" from the same docket. But which is correct? The DOJ counsel could be \"Eric J Hamilton\" (Deputy Assistant Attorney General). That is internal DOJ counsel. So we have two types for defendants: Government counsel and private counsel. The docket shows both; we need to list both distinct values. For plaintiffs, we have \"Nicholas David Espiritu\" and \"Megan Richards\" and possibly others. They may be private counsel. Also \"State of California\" could be considered government counsel. The docket shows \"Notice of Appearance filed by Nicholas David Espiritu on behalf of Gavin Newsom, State of California\". That could be the state's counsel. So it's government counsel.\n\nThus distinct values:\n\nPlaintiff: Government counsel (State of California)\nDefendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\nDefendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman)\nPlaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu)\nPlaintiff: Private counsel (Megan Richards)\n\nAlso maybe more attorneys appear later in docket; we might need to capture all. Let's search the docket for \"Notice of Appearance filed by\" pattern. Search doc for \"Notice of Appearance filed by\" gives many matches. We saw tokens 0-400, 432-1011, 1139-1339, 1700-2100. Let's check other token ranges for docket that may contain more notices. We should read more of the docket at 0-400 we already did; but we should read the portion 432-1011 (already read). That included some notices. We should also read 1355-1555, 1571-2100 (we have 1700-2100). Also 3237-3488. That might contain more notices. We need to capture all unique counsel names and categorize.\n\nLet's search within the docket for \"Notice of Appearance\" pattern again but retrieve context. Use search_document_regex on Docket with pattern \"Notice of Appearance filed by\". Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"pattern\":\"Notice of Appearance filed by\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "Notice of Appearance filed by", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7103, "completion_tokens": 1335, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to ensure all distinct values found in documents. Are there other counsel types? Possibly private counsel for plaintiff? But we have evidence from Docket for Plaintiff: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). Also from Defendants' Notice we have Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). Are there other documents with other counsel types? Docket had many \"Notice of Appearance filed by\" entries: Many names: Nicholas David Espiritu (representing Gavin Newsom), Megan Richards (representing Gavin Newsom), Christopher David Edelman (representing Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense), Eric J Hamilton (representing Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense). These are appearances by attorneys representing parties. They might be private counsel. However the extraction so far only captured two entries. We need to capture all distinct values of Type_of_Counsel: each side (Plaintiff/Defendant) and type categories. The instruction: \"extract the type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available. If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to parse Counsel for plaintiffs and defendants. The Docket shows many \"Notice of Appearance filed by\" for plaintiff side: Representing Gavin Newsom (state official). Those attorneys might be private counsel. But we need to see if they are private counsel. Also there is \"Notice of Appearance filed by Christopher David Edelman on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\" — these are attorneys for the defendant side (US Dept of Defense). They might be government counsel? But they are representing the US Dept of Defense, but the attorney is likely a private counsel? Actually, representing US Dept of Defense may be government counsel. But the attorney is Christopher David Edelman; we don't know if he is a government attorney. The docket also shows \"Notice of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\" — again representing US Dept of Defense. Those attorneys likely are private counsel for Trump? But they are representing the US Dept of Defense, but that is a defendant. In the earlier extraction, they only extracted \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\". That refers to the Government counsel from the Docket? Wait the earlier extraction shows for Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice) came from Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. That document likely lists counsel for defendants, e.g., \"Counsel for Defendants: YAAKOV M. ROTH, etc.\" That might be government counsel. So for Defendant we have that.\n\nBut for Plaintiff, we have \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\" from the Docket. That appears to refer to the plaintiff side being represented by the US DOJ? Actually, the Docket shows \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\" etc. The earlier extraction says Plaintiff: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). That seems mismatched; maybe the earlier value came from another docket entry: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\" but why would that be Plaintiff? Actually, the docket entry shows \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". That seems to be defendant side: Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. But the earlier extraction says Plaintiff: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). That seems wrong. Let's analyze: The docket entry earlier: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\" — that is a defendant side (the parties: Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense). So the earlier extraction might have misattributed. Wait, earlier extraction was:\n\nValue 1: \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\"\nEvidence 1 from Docket (tokens 1139-1339):\n\"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\"\n\nThis indicates that the extraction incorrectly labeled that as Plaintiff. Actually, that docket entry is for the defendant side. So the extraction is wrong. We need to correct it: We need to identify which side is plaintiff and which is defendant. The plaintiffs are Gavin Newsom, State of California, etc. The defendants are Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. So the docket entries for \"Notice of Appearance filed by Nicholas David Espiritu on behalf of Gavin Newsom, State of California\" represent plaintiff side. That attorney is Nicholas David Espiritu. He may be private counsel. The docket entry for \"Notice of Appearance filed by Megan Richards on behalf of Gavin Newsom, State of California\" also plaintiff side. And \"Notice of Appearance filed by Christopher David Edelman on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\" is defendant side. And \"Notice of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\" also defendant side.\n\nAlso earlier extraction for Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice) came from Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. That document likely shows counsel for defendants: YAAKOV M. ROTH, etc. That might be government counsel. So we have at least one defendant counsel: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). And for the plaintiff side: we have private counsel representing Gavin Newsom: Nicholas David Espiritu; Megan Richards; etc. So we need to extract those.\n\nThus the current extraction is incomplete and possibly incorrect. We need to update the checklist: we must correct the extracted values and add missing ones.\n\nWe should use update_checklist to replace the entire extracted list for Type_of_Counsel, with the correct set of values.\n\nWe need to gather evidence for each.\n\nWe have evidence from Docket tokens 75-275: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Nicholas David Espiritu on behalf of Gavin Newsom, State of California\". That is plaintiff side: private counsel.\n\nAlso evidence from Docket tokens 585-785: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Megan Richards on behalf of Gavin Newsom, State of California\". Also plaintiff side.\n\nAlso evidence from Docket tokens 811-1011: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Christopher David Edelman on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". Defendant side: likely government counsel? But it says representing Donald J. Trump, etc. Possibly private counsel representing Trump. But the parties are a private individual and a government entity. It's unclear if that counsel is private or government. But the attorney is Christopher David Edelman; we don't know if he's a government attorney. But the representation is for the defendants: Donald J. Trump (private) and U.S. Department of Defense. The counsel might be private counsel for Trump; but also could be government counsel for DoD. But we have earlier extraction of Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice) from Defendants' Notice. That seems distinct.\n\nThus for the defendant side, we have at least one government counsel: from Defendants' Notice: YAAKOV M. ROTH etc. Also there is possibly \"Eric J Hamilton\" which might be government counsel? But he is representing Donald J. Trump, etc. Hard to classify.\n\nThe instruction: \"using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available\". So for plaintiff side counsel: Nicholas David Espiritu (private counsel). Megan Richards (private counsel). For defendant side counsel: YAAKOV M. ROTH (government counsel - United States Department of Justice). For other defendant counsel: Christopher David Edelman and Eric J Hamilton - maybe private counsel, but representing Trump and DoD. We could label as private counsel? But the earlier extraction labeled them as \"Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\". That might be wrong. We need to check the document that lists YAAKOV M. ROTH. The Defendants' Notice document: we saw evidence snippet: \"Counsel for Defendants 1  YAAKOV M. ROTH  2  Acting Assistant Attorney General  3  Civil Division\". That indicates YAAKOV M. ROTH is a government counsel from the Civil Division of DOJ. So we have \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\". Good.\n\nWe also have \"Counsel for Defendants\" lines that might include other counsel names. But we only saw YAAKOV M. ROTH. The snippet shows \"YAAKOV M. ROTH\" and \"ERIC J. HAMILTON\" maybe as well. That might be the same. But we have \"ERIC J. HAMILTON\" lines. Eric J. Hamilton is the attorney for the government? He might be a Deputy Assistant Attorney General. So also government counsel. So we have at least 2 government counsel for defendants: YAAKOV M. ROTH and ERIC J. HAMILTON. But the earlier extraction only captured one value: \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\". That may represent both, but maybe we should capture each individually? The instruction: \"extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" If we have multiple counsel entries, each with unique organization or label, we should include each as a separate value. But the value format: \"Plaintiff: …\" and \"Defendant: …\". We could consolidate multiple government counsel under same side with one entry? But they are distinct attorneys but same category. The instruction: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" It doesn't say separate per counsel; but each side separately. So we can have one entry per side: \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards)\"? But that would combine multiple names. But the instruction says \"using brief category labels and including specific organizations in parentheses when available\". So we could have \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards)\" but that might not be ideal. The earlier extraction had separate entry for each side. So we should produce one entry per side. But if multiple counsel exist, we can include multiple organizations in parentheses separated by commas. But the earlier extraction had just one per side.\n\nGiven the instruction, we can produce two entries: one for Plaintiff and one for Defendant. For Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards). For Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). However, we also have potential private counsel for defendants: Christopher David Edelman and Eric J Hamilton. But they might be private counsel representing Trump and DoD. But the earlier extraction used government counsel. But if we want to be accurate, we might need to differentiate. However, the instruction says \"type(s) of counsel representing each side\". So for defendants, there may be government counsel and private counsel. So we might need two entries: one for Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice) and Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J Hamilton). But does the instruction allow multiple entries per side? It says \"extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" It doesn't restrict one per side. So we can include two entries for Defendant: Government counsel and Defendant: Private counsel. But we need to be careful not to duplicate.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, we can consider the type classification: For defendants, the government counsel from DOJ is one; the private counsel for Trump is private counsel. So we can include two entries. But we need to ensure evidence for each.\n\nEvidence for private counsel for defendants: Docket tokens 811-1011: \"Notice of Appearance filed by Christopher David Edelman on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". Also \"Eric J Hamilton\" entries similar. So we can combine them: \"Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J Hamilton)\". But we need to show evidence.\n\nEvidence for government counsel for defendants: Defendants' Notice snippet: \"Counsel for Defendants 1 YAAKOV M. ROTH ... 2 ERIC J. HAMILTON ...\". That is government counsel. Provide evidence.\n\nEvidence for plaintiff private counsel: Docket tokens 75-275: Nicholas David Espiritu; tokens 585-785: Megan Richards.\n\nThus we will create 4 entries: Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards); Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice); Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J Hamilton). But we may also consider that \"Eric J Hamilton\" appears in both government and private? He appears in Docket as a representative for the defendant but also in Defendants' Notice as government counsel. In the Defendants' Notice snippet, \"ERIC J. HAMILTON\" appears as a government counsel. So that is the same attorney but classified as government counsel. In the Docket, \"Eric J Hamilton\" appears as a representative for the defendant side; but that is likely the same attorney. So we should not duplicate. So we have one government counsel (ERIC J. HAMILTON) and one private counsel (Christopher David Edelman). But the Docket also shows \"Eric J Hamilton\" as representative for the defendant side. That matches government counsel. So we can drop the private counsel entry for Eric J Hamilton.\n\nThus we have:\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice) (represented by YAAKOV M. ROTH, ERIC J. HAMILTON)\n- Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman) (representing Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense)\n\nBut we need to check if Christopher David Edelman is private counsel. The docket entry shows \"Notice of Appearance filed by Christopher David Edelman on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". That indicates he is representing both private and government parties. He may be private counsel for Donald J. Trump. So we can label him as private counsel.\n\nThus we have 3 entries.\n\nNow we need to update checklist.\n\nWe need to use update_checklist with patch containing key \"Type_of_Counsel\" and extracted array with 3 entries. Each entry includes evidence list.\n\nWe must ensure evidence includes text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe need to choose token ranges for each evidence.\n\nWe have token ranges from Docket: 75-275 (Nicholas Espiritu). 585-785 (Megan Richards). 811-1011 (Christopher Edelman). Also for government counsel: Defendants' Notice tokens 0-400 had snippet with YAAKOV M. ROTH and ERIC J. HAMILTON. But that snippet may not be fully captured; but we can provide evidence from tokens 0-400: \"Counsel for Defendants 1 YAAKOV M. ROTH ... 2 ERIC J. HAMILTON ...\". That is enough.\n\nThus we will produce update_checklist with 3 entries.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist.\n\nLet's prepare JSON.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Nicholas David Espiritu on behalf of Gavin Newsom, State of California\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 75-275\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"text\": \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Megan Richards on behalf of Gavin Newsom, State of California\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 585-785\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Counsel for Defendants 1  YAAKOV M.

Check if any missing. We have Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards) and Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice) and Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman). Are there other counsel? Defendants' Notice includes \"Counsel for Defendants 1 YAAKOV M. ROTH 2 ERIC J. HAMILTON\". That was used for Government counsel? Actually YAAKOV M. ROTH, ERIC J. HAMILTON might be government counsel? Might be private? They are likely attorneys for DOJ? Not sure. But we might have more.\n\nAlso the Defendants' Corrected Opposition may contain counsel. We haven't read it fully. We should search for \"Counsel for Defendants\" again or \"Counsel for Plaintiff\". Also search for \"Counsel for\" maybe pattern.\n\nAlso check Docket for other \"NOTICE of Appearance\" entries: there were many for Christopher David Edelman, Eric J Hamilton. Also possibly other counsel names. Also there are \"Notice of Appearance filed by ... on behalf of ...\" for other parties? e.g., \"Notice of Appearance filed by ... on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". That indicates private counsel for Trump? Actually it's a private counsel for Trump and Dept of Defense? Could be private counsel? But likely it's private counsel.\n\nAlso \"Notice of Appearance filed by Nicholas David Espiritu on behalf of Gavin Newsom\". Gavin Newsom is a public official, counsel is private. So we have two plaintiff counsel entries.\n\nAlso \"Notice of Appearance filed by Megan Richards\" also plaintiff.\n\nAlso \"Notice of Appearance filed by Christopher David Edelman\" and \"Eric J Hamilton\" appear to represent private counsel for Donald J. Trump and Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense? That might be private counsel for those parties. So we need separate entries for each side: plaintiff, defendant. The defendants are government (US Department of Justice) and also private counsel for Trump? Actually Donald J. Trump and Pete Hegseth are presumably private defendants? But the case is against all defendants, including the US government. So the counsel for defendants could include private counsel for Trump and others too. But the instructions: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So we should produce entries for Plaintiff and Defendant. But we have multiple plaintiffs? Actually plaintiffs are Gavin Newsom and maybe others? The complaint is against all defendants. So Plaintiff side is Gavin Newsom. So \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards)\". For defendants, we have government counsel (United States Department of Justice) and private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J Hamilton). Might combine into one entry \"Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J Hamilton)\". Or separate entries? The instruction says \"each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" But we can have multiple defendant entries? It says \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" It doesn't say only one per side. But typical might be one per side. But we could have multiple entries for defendant if multiple counsel categories. But would that break format? Might be acceptable. But to be safe, we can include one entry for defendant covering all counsel: \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice; YAAKOV M. ROTH, ERIC J. HAMILTON)\" and another for defendant: \"Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J Hamilton)\". But we need to check evidence.\n\nWe have evidence for YAAKOV M. ROTH and ERIC J. HAMILTON from Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. That document likely has \"Counsel for Defendants\" list. It says \"Counsel for Defendants 1 YAAKOV M. ROTH 2 ERIC J. HAMILTON\". We need to confirm government counsel? YAAKOV M. ROTH and ERIC J. HAMILTON may be attorneys for US DOJ. Not sure. But we had evidence \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\" from that doc. But we need to verify that YAAKOV M. ROTH and ERIC J. HAMILTON are government counsel. Might be common knowledge that they represent DOJ. But need textual evidence that they represent DOJ. The doc may contain \"Counsel for Defendants 1 YAAKOV M. ROTH 2 ERIC J. HAMILTON\" but no explicit affiliation. But maybe earlier in the doc it says \"United States Department of Justice\". So we need to read more of that doc to confirm.\n\nAlso need evidence for private counsel for Christopher David Edelman and Eric J Hamilton: In Docket we have \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Christopher David Edelman on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". That indicates private counsel for Trump and others. Also \"Notice of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". So we can treat that as private counsel.\n\nWe also have evidence for plaintiff counsel: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Nicholas David Espiritu on behalf of Gavin Newsom\" and \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Megan Richards on behalf of Gavin Newsom\". So those are private counsel for plaintiff.\n\nThus we have two plaintiff counsel entries? The instruction: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" It doesn't say each counsel separately. But we can combine multiple counsel names per side in parentheses. For plaintiff: \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards)\". For defendant: \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice (YAAKOV M. ROTH, ERIC J. HAMILTON))\" and \"Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J. Hamilton)\". But the earlier extraction had \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\" and \"Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman)\". It didn't include Eric J Hamilton though. But we need to include both.\n\nWe should read more from Docket to capture the appearances for Christopher David Edelman and Eric J Hamilton. The earlier search results show matches with tokens 811-1011 and others. We need to confirm that these are private counsel. The text: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Christopher David Edelman on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense (Edelman, Christopher) (Filed on 6/10/2025)\". There's no explicit \"private counsel\" but that is the nature. Also \"Notice of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense (Hamilton, Eric)\". So we can treat them as private counsel.\n\nTo include evidence, we need to read those tokens.

They might contain counsel info. But we might have all counsel types. We need ensure completeness. The checklist likely expects all sides counsel. We have plaintiff counsel: two attorneys. Defendant counsel: government and private. Are there other defendants? The case includes Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. Plaintiff is Gavin Newsom. So plaintiff counsel: Nicholas Espiritu, Megan Richards. Defendant counsel: Christopher Edelman (private), Eric Hamilton? He is listed as Counsel for Defendants 1 YAAKOV M. ROTH 2 ERIC J. HAMILTON. That seems government counsel? It says government counsel (United States Department of Justice). But maybe Eric Hamilton is DOJ counsel. Also YAAKOV M. ROTH? That seems maybe private? But the document said \"Counsel for Defendants 1 YAAKOV M. ROTH 2 ERIC J. HAMILTON\". Might be both private? But the update had \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\". Let's verify. We need evidence for each. We have evidence for Plaintiff. For Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice) evidence from Defendants' Notice doc tokens 0-400: \"Counsel for Defendants 1  YAAKOV M. ROTH  2  ERIC J. HAMILTON\". That doesn't mention DOJ. But earlier we had \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\". That seems not evidenced. We need evidence that government counsel represented DOJ. Might be in other doc. Maybe Order Granting Plaintiffs' Application? Let's search for \"Department of Justice\" in documents. We haven't searched. So we might need to confirm. Also the Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman) evidence from Docket tokens 811-1011. Good.\n\nWe need to confirm government counsel representation. We could search for \"United States Department of Justice\" or \"DOJ\" across documents. Also maybe \"Counsel for the United States\" etc. Let's search in Docket maybe. The docket has \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Christopher David Edelman on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\" - that's defense counsel. The government counsel might be for DOJ? Actually the defendants include U.S. Department of Defense, not DOJ. But the government counsel might represent DOJ? Wait the note: \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\" maybe refers to the U.S. Department of Justice as a defendant? But the U.S. Dept of Defense is a defendant. DOJ might be a party? Possibly the case includes DOJ as a defendant? Not clear. But the earlier update had that.

Are there more? We should review remaining documents:\n\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: maybe has counsel info? The complaint might list counsel for plaintiffs: maybe \"Counsel for Plaintiff: ...\"? We searched earlier for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" but found none. But maybe \"Counsel for Defendants\" in complaint? maybe not. But we should check.\n\n- Order Granting Plaintiffs' Application for Temporary Restraining Order: maybe includes counsel.\n\n- Defendants' Corrected Opposition: we saw counsel for defendants list. We already captured that type: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). But maybe there are multiple counsel for defendants: maybe also private counsel? We saw names of multiple attorneys: YAAKOV M. ROTH (Acting Assistant Attorney General), ERIC J. HAMILTON etc. Those are all DOJ lawyers. So still government counsel.\n\n- Order: maybe includes counsel.\n\n- Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion: maybe includes counsel.\n\n- Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction: maybe includes counsel.\n\nAlso, Docket may list counsel for other parties: e.g., notice of appearance by \"Eric J Hamilton\" etc. but that's already captured.\n\nBut we might need to capture counsel for defendants in other documents: e.g., Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion: we captured defendant counsel as private counsel (Christopher David Edelman). But maybe also government counsel? It lists \"Counsel for Defendants\" but those are DOJ attorneys. It may include \"United States Department of Justice\" as counsel for defendants. The earlier extracted value 2: \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\" is based on Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion. But we also extracted private counsel for defendant from same doc? Wait we extracted Value 3: \"Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman)\" from Docket. But Docket shows \"Notice of Appearance filed by Christopher David Edelman on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". That indicates that Edelman is counsel for the United States Department of Defense (a government entity). But the note says \"on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". So that is a government counsel (DoD). But the classification \"Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman)\" is incorrect. That should be Government counsel (U.S. Department of Defense). So we need to correct that.\n\nAlso, \"Notice of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\" indicates also government counsel.\n\nThus our values may be wrong. We should revisit. The earlier update had 3 values: 1) Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards) ; 2) Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice); 3) Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman). But we need to correct 3 to \"Defendant: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Defense)\" perhaps.\n\nAlso, there may be other counsel such as \"Attorney General Rob Bonta\" (state government), but might be plaintiff's counsel? In complaint, attorney for plaintiff might be state government? Actually plaintiffs are state of California (Gov). But counsel for plaintiffs could be private counsel? The complaint may list counsel for plaintiff as \"Rob Bonta\" etc. We need to check.\n\nWe should review the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for counsel info. Also Order Granting and Order may list counsel. Also Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion may list counsel for plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction may list counsel.\n\nThus we need to read more documents to capture any other counsel.\n\nWe should perform search on all documents for \"Counsel for\" patterns again, but we have already done earlier. But maybe some documents have counsel but not captured due to earlier search patterns? Let's search again for \"Counsel\" in complaint and others.\n\nAlso search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" again? But earlier search got none. Maybe the complaint uses \"Counsel for the Plaintiff\" etc. But we need to capture any counsel.\n\nWe could search for \"Counsel for\" pattern across all documents. We did earlier: step 2 found matches in many documents. But we only extracted from some. Maybe other matches haven't been read.\n\nWe should search again for \"Counsel for\" in all documents to get new matches. Then read those matches.\n\nAlso search for \"Counsel for the\" etc. But simplest: search for \"Counsel for\" across all documents.\n\nLet's call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"Counsel for\" flags maybe [\"IGNORECASE\"].\n\nWe should also search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" again maybe find nothing.\n\nAlso search for \"Counsel for Defendant\" maybe.\n\nAlso search for \"Counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant)\".\n\nBut better: search for \"Counsel for\" not previously read.\n\nWe need to check which documents had matches that we haven't read fully.\n\nFrom earlier search: Step 2: found 16 matches: 5 in Defendants' Corrected Opposition; 4 in Defendants' Notice; 5 in Docket (+1 more docs). So we have matches in Docket, Defendants' Notice, Defendants' Corrected Opposition. We read Docket (multiple ranges). We read Defendants' Notice (0-400, 827-1064). We read Defendants' Corrected Opposition (0-207, 356-556, 3841-4041, 14576-14776, 14955-15166, 19375-19575). So all matches are covered? Might be.\n\nBut maybe other documents contain counsel? The Order Granting and Order might have counsel.\n\nLet's search for \"Counsel\" in Order Granting, Order, Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion, Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Use search_document_regex.\n\nWe can also search for \"Counsel for\" across all documents again; maybe it will include matches in the other docs too.\n\nLet's call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" and pattern \"Counsel for\" flags [\"IGNORECASE\"]. top_k maybe 5.\n\nWe'll get matches. Then read new matches.\n\nAlso search for \"Counsel\" pattern may be too broad. But we want to capture any counsel.\n\nBut we already captured some from Docket. But maybe the Order Granting has counsel.\n\nLet's do search.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Counsel for\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Counsel for", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8689, "completion_tokens": 1417, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to confirm if any more counsel types exist. Checklist says Type_of_Counsel. We have 3: Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards). Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman).\n\nWe must check if any other counsel exists: e.g., maybe other defendants counsel such as \"Eric J. Hamilton\" appears in Docket as counsel for defendant? In Docket notice, \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\". That could be defendant counsel? But this is for Donald J. Trump. But is Donald J. Trump a defendant? In this case, probably yes. The other \"Eric J. Hamilton\" might be representing Donald J. Trump. So that's also defendant counsel, but maybe private counsel. But we already have \"Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman)\". Actually \"Christopher David Edelman\" is private counsel for Donald J. Trump. \"Eric J. Hamilton\" is federal government counsel for Department of Defense? Wait, \"U.S. Department of Defense\" is a government entity. That might be government counsel. But \"U.S. Department of Defense\" appears as client, not necessarily counsel. The appearance by \"Eric J Hamilton\" on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense. So the counsel is \"Eric J Hamilton\" representing Donald J. Trump. He is presumably private counsel? He is an attorney. But we might treat as private counsel for defendant Donald J. Trump.\n\nBut we already have defendant private counsel for Christopher David Edelman. Is that same defendant? Yes, Donald J. Trump is a defendant; Christopher David Edelman is a private counsel for him. But \"Eric J Hamilton\" is also counsel for Donald J. Trump. So we might add another entry: Defendant: Private counsel (Eric J. Hamilton). But we have to check if \"Eric J Hamilton\" appears in the counsel list. In Docket, he is listed. So we should add that.\n\nAlso check if any other counsel for plaintiff? We have Nicholas David Espiritu and Megan Richards as counsel for plaintiff Gavin Newsom. Are there any other counsel for plaintiff? Perhaps \"Attorney General Rob Bonta\" appears but that is part of the state organization. But that is government counsel for plaintiff. But the plaintiff is the state of California? The plaintiff is Gavin Newsom. Rob Bonta is attorney general of CA; maybe part of state counsel. It might be government counsel for plaintiff. But the summary had \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards)\". But maybe there is government counsel for plaintiff as well: e.g., \"Rob Bonta\". But the list didn't capture that. So might need to add \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (California Department of Justice)\". But need evidence. We saw in the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, the paragraph mentions \"Attorney General Rob Bonta is the chief law officer of the State of California and head of the California Department of Justice.\" That indicates government counsel for the plaintiff. So we should add \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (California Department of Justice)\".\n\nThus we have at least 5 entries: Plaintiff private counsel, Plaintiff government counsel, Defendant private counsel (Christopher David Edelman), Defendant private counsel (Eric J. Hamilton), Defendant government counsel (United States Department of Justice). Check if any other government counsel for defendants: e.g., \"United States Department of Defense\" is also a defendant? That appears as a client in an appearance. But \"U.S. Department of Defense\" might be a defendant or part of the case. But we have \"U.S. Department of Defense\" in the appearance with \"Eric J Hamilton\" and \"Pete Hegseth\". That may represent the Department of Defense. The counsel for that entity is \"Eric J Hamilton\" or maybe \"U.S. Department of Defense\" is the client. So we treat as private counsel? Actually \"U.S. Department of Defense\" is a government entity, but the counsel \"Eric J Hamilton\" might be a private attorney representing the DoD. So we could categorize as \"Defendant: Private counsel (Eric J Hamilton)\". But we already have that.\n\nAlso we might have \"YAAKOV M. ROTH\" etc. In Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion, there are multiple counsel: YAAKOV M. ROTH, ERIC J. HAMILTON, ALEXANDER K. HAAS, CHRISTOPHER D. EDELMAN. These are counsel for defendants (the government). So those are government counsel. We already have \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\". That covers all those. But should we list each separately? The requirement: \"Create separate entries for each unique value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we should list each distinct value. \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\" is a single value covering all government counsel. But perhaps we need separate entries for each counsel? The wording: \"type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available (e.g., Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)). If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" So we need separate values for each side, not for each counsel. So we can have:\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards)\n- Plaintiff: Government counsel (California Department of Justice)\n- Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J. Hamilton)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\n\nBut the requirement says \"using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available\". So we can combine multiple private counsel into one entry? They are multiple names. We can list them separated by comma. That seems acceptable.\n\nThus we need to add two more entries: Plaintiff: Government counsel (California Department of Justice) and Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J. Hamilton). Also maybe we can combine them into one entry.\n\nWe have evidence for plaintiff government counsel: from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, snippet. We saw tokens 1779-1979 includes \"Attorney General Rob Bonta is the chief law officer of the State of California and head of the California Department of Justice.\" So we can use that.\n\nEvidence for defendant private counsel: We have \"Christopher David Edelman\" from Docket tokens 811-1011 and \"Eric J Hamilton\" from Docket tokens 800-1100. We can combine them.\n\nWe also need to capture the government counsel for defendants: we already have that from Defendants' Notice.\n\nThus we need to append two new values.\n\nWe should call append_checklist with patch containing two new entries.\n\nWe must include evidence for each value.\n\nWe need to gather evidence text.\n\nEvidence 1: Plaintiff: Government counsel (California Department of Justice). Use excerpt from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 1779-1979. We have snippet:\n\n```\n  15.  Attorney General Rob Bonta is the chief law officer of the State of California and head of the California Department of Justice. He has the authority to file civil\n```\n\nWe can extract that.\n\nEvidence 2: Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J. Hamilton). Use Docket tokens 800-1100 includes both appearances. Provide snippet: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Christopher David Edelman on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense ...\" and \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense ...\".\n\nWe need to ensure we provide separate evidence objects for each evidence snippet.\n\nWe should use append_checklist.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with patch for Type_of_Counsel adding those two values.\n\nWe must ensure we don't duplicate values already extracted. We have existing values for Plaintiff private counsel, Defendant government counsel, Defendant private counsel (Christopher David Edelman). But we will add Plaintiff government counsel and Defendant private counsel (include both names). But we already have one entry for Defendant private counsel (Christopher David Edelman). We should not duplicate that. We need to incorporate Eric J Hamilton. But we can create a new entry \"Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J. Hamilton)\" but that would duplicate the existing entry for Christopher David Edelman. So maybe we need to update existing entry to include Eric J Hamilton. But the instruction says we can only use append_checklist to add new entries, not modify existing. But we could use update_checklist to replace the entire value list for that key. We can replace the existing entry for Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman) with a new entry that includes both names. That would be an update. But we may keep the existing entry and add a new entry with both names? That would duplicate Christopher David Edelman. But the checklist expects unique values. Duplicate entries not desired.\n\nThus we should update the existing entry to include both names. We need to identify the key for that entry: Type_of_Counsel. There's only one entry for Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman). We should replace that with \"Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J. Hamilton)\". We can do that via update_checklist for Type_of_Counsel, replacing the entire list? But we also need to maintain other entries. So we could update the entire list of values for Type_of_Counsel: replace with:\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards)\n- Plaintiff: Government counsel (California Department of Justice)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\n- Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J. Hamilton)\n\nBut we must ensure we don't lose existing entries. Yes.\n\nThus we should call update_checklist with patch for Type_of_Counsel with new extracted list containing four entries.\n\nWe need evidence for each entry.\n\nWe already have evidence for all entries except maybe the defendant private counsel entry. For that we use Docket tokens 800-1100. For plaintiff private counsel, we have evidence from Docket tokens 75-275 and 585-785.

Hamilton). Are there any other counsel? We saw \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" or \"Counsel for Defendants\" maybe other names. Also in the docket we might have other entries like \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" maybe for other parties. Let's search the docket for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\". But the earlier step 22 had \"Counsel for plaintiff or the removing party\" but that wasn't a specific counsel. We might need to check for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" entries in docket or other documents. The docket may have other \"NOTICE of Appearance\" lines with other counsel names. The docket has many entries; we saw tokens 0-400, 432-1339, 1355-1555, 1571-2100, 3237-3488. There could be more. We haven't read beyond 2100 tokens and 3488. The docket is 21,784 tokens; so many unviewed. We could search for \"NOTICE of Appearance\" again to find more entries. The earlier search for \"NOTICE of Appearance\" found 10 matches in Docket. We read 0-400 and 800-1100. That might not cover all. We might need to parse all matches to ensure we captured all counsel. The 10 matches might include others beyond the 4 we captured. For example, there may be \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by [Name] on behalf of [Party]\" for other parties, e.g., other plaintiffs or defendants. We only captured 2 for plaintiff, 2 for defendant. But maybe there are more plaintiffs or other parties? Let's check the docket matches. We saw tokens 0-400 and 800-1100. We haven't read other matches. Let's find approximate tokens for matches: earlier step 21 found 10 matches. We need to read all to capture all counsel.\n\nAlso we should check the other documents: Order Granting etc. Might have counsel info. But likely docket contains all notices of appearance. We need to ensure we have all counsel.\n\nThus we need to read the remaining docket matches. We can use search_document_regex on Docket with pattern \"NOTICE of Appearance\" again to get all matches context. He did earlier but we didn't review all tokens. Let's do a search again to confirm we capture all matches. Then read each and extract counsel.\n\nWe need to determine if any other counsel are present. Let's search docket again.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"pattern\":\"NOTICE of Appearance\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "NOTICE of Appearance", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7289, "completion_tokens": 613, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Are there any more? The list of documents shows many unvisited. But the prior steps 23 indicates all required values extracted and no additional counsel representations present. However, we should verify if any other counsel representations exist in unvisited documents. But the earlier search results show many appearances. Maybe there are other counsel like \"Brendan Hamme\" etc from docket, but those are also plaintiffs? Those are for plaintiffs, but we already captured two plaintiff counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards) and government counsel (California Dept of Justice). But there might be other plaintiff counsel e.g., Brendan Hamme, and Nicholas Reiss Green. The earlier update at step 23 only captured 2 plaintiff counsel. But docket shows many more. Should we include them? The instruction: \"extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we must capture all distinct entries. The current extraction has 4 values: Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards), Plaintiff: Government counsel (California Department of Justice), Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice), Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J. Hamilton). But there are also private counsel for plaintiffs: Brendan Hamme, Nicholas Reiss Green? Also maybe \"Hamme\" appears. Also \"Brendan Hamme\" appears. Those are private counsel for plaintiff. Also \"Nicholas Reiss Green\". Also \"Megan Richards\" already captured. \"Nicholas David Espiritu\" captured. \"Christopher David Edelman\" is a defendant private counsel? Actually it's a defendant counsel for Donald J. Trump (private). Also \"Eric J. Hamilton\" is a defendant counsel. So we have two defendant private counsel entries. Should we combine them into one value? The requirement: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" So we should separate each side. But we have multiple private counsel on each side. So should we list separate values for each counsel? The spec: \"the type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available (e.g., Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)). If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\"\n\nThis seems to allow listing each side separately, but might include multiple counsel per side? Might be multiple entries per side. The example shows \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards)\" combined both names. So they combined multiple private counsel into one entry for plaintiff. So we can group multiple private counsel names into a single value. So we should include all private counsel names for plaintiff: Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards, Brendan Hamme, Nicholas Reiss Green. Maybe also others. Let's scan docket matches for other names: \"Brendan Hamme\" appears, \"Nicholas Reiss Green\" appears. So we should include them all in the same value: Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards, Brendan Hamme, Nicholas Reiss Green). Also maybe other names not captured: \"Hamm\" etc. But likely just those.\n\nWhat about government counsel for plaintiff? Already captured California DOJ. There may be other government counsel for plaintiff: maybe \"State of California\" but that's same. So keep.\n\nDefendant side: we have Private counsel: Christopher David Edelman, Eric J. Hamilton. Also maybe other private counsel? Not seen. Government counsel: US DOJ.\n\nThus we need to update the checklist: remove 2 separate private counsel entries for defendants? Already we have one value for Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J. Hamilton). That's fine. We also have Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice). Good.\n\nBut we need to consolidate plaintiff private counsel into one value. And maybe need to add \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Brendan Hamme, Nicholas Reiss Green, Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards)\". Also maybe \"Brendan Hamme\" appears in docket, but maybe there are also \"Hamm\" etc. The docket matches show many entries: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Brendan Hamme on behalf of Gavin Newsom, State of California\". So yes.\n\nWe need to read more of docket to confirm all names. We have seen matches 15-20 show Brendan Hamme, 18-20 show Nicholas Reiss Green. Also earlier matches 1-6 show Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards. So we should include all four names.\n\nThus we need to append checklists for new entries: add a new value for Plaintiff: Private counsel with all names. But we also have existing entry for Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards). We should update that to include all names. So we need to replace the existing entry with new list containing all names. So we should use update_checklist for Type_of_Counsel. We need to provide evidence for each name.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist for Type_of_Counsel with 4 values: two or more? We might keep government counsel entries unchanged. But we need to update the plaintiff private counsel entry. So patch: key Type_of_Counsel, extracted: list of 4 entries: update the existing plaintiff private counsel entry to include all names, add new evidence for each name. Also we might keep the existing entries but duplicate? We should replace entire list? We can use update_checklist to replace entire extracted list for key. But maybe easier to append new values? But we need to modify existing value. So update entire list. Let's gather evidence: we have evidence from docket matches: tokens 75-275 for Espiritu and Megan Richards; tokens 585-785 for Megan Richards; tokens 2237-2437 for Brendan Hamme; tokens 2609-2800 for Nicholas Reiss Green. We can provide evidence from those ranges.\n\nWe should also provide evidence for government counsel for plaintiff (California DOJ) from Complaint tokens 1779-1979. Defendant government counsel from Defendants' Notice tokens 0-400. Defendant private counsel from Docket tokens 800-1100. So we have evidence.\n\nThus we will update checklist.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist.\n\nWe need to pass patch with key \"Type_of_Counsel\" and extracted array of entries.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each entry.\n\nLet's craft JSON for update_checklist.\n\nWe need to provide evidence array: each evidence has text, source_document, location. We can use snippets.\n\nWe will include 4 entries:\n\n1. Plaintiff: Private counsel (Nicholas David Espiritu, Megan Richards, Brendan Hamme, Nicholas Reiss Green)\n   evidence: combine all names with snippet text from docket tokens.\n\nWe can provide separate evidence entries for each name: maybe one evidence per name.\n\nBut requirement: each extracted entry must include evidence. It can have multiple evidence entries. So we can give evidence for each name: snippet \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Nicholas David Espiritu\" from Docket tokens 75-275; snippet \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Megan Richards\" from Docket tokens 585-785; snippet \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Brendan Hamme\" from Docket tokens 2237-2437; snippet \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Nicholas Reiss Green\" from Docket tokens 2609-2800.\n\nThus evidence array of 4 items.\n\n2. Plaintiff: Government counsel (California Department of Justice)\n   evidence: snippet from Complaint tokens 1779-1979: \"Attorney General Rob Bonta is the chief law officer of the State of California and head of the California Department of Justice.\" Provide that.\n\n3. Defendant: Government counsel (United States Department of Justice)\n   evidence: snippet from Defendants' Notice tokens 0-400: \"Counsel for Defendants\" and names, but we can use snippet \"Counsel for Defendants 1 YAAKOV M. ROTH 2 ERIC J. HAMILTON\" etc. Provide that.\n\n4. Defendant: Private counsel (Christopher David Edelman, Eric J. Hamilton)\n   evidence: snippet from Docket tokens 800-1100: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Christopher David Edelman on behalf of Donald J. Trump, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense\" and \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by Eric J Hamilton on behalf of Donald J.
