The complaint lists \"Defendants are agencies of the United States or officers of such an agency.\" but only lists those three.

The complaint uses \"Plaintiff:\". But other documents may use \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\".\n\nWe should search for \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" lines. Let's use search_document_regex with pattern \"(Plaintiff.*|Defendant.*)\" across all documents. We previously did that and found 0 matches due to context_tokens default 200, but we had error due to context_tokens too low? Actually error was about context_tokens min 100, we used default 200. Wait error: context_tokens input should be >=100; we passed 200? It says \"context_tokens Input should be greater than or equal to 100 [type=greater_than_equal, input_value=50, input_type=int]\". That indicates we passed 50? maybe default is 100? But we passed nothing, default maybe 100? But the error says input_value=50. Maybe the tool requires context_tokens specified and min 100. We didn't specify context_tokens, but maybe default is 50?
