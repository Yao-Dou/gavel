We have some matches in Docket: \"Order by Judge Charles R. Breyer\". Also Order: maybe similar. But we need to find all judges. Likely multiple courts. We need to read more of Docket around match 2 to confirm judge names. Also Order Granting Plaintiffs' Application for Temporary Restraining Order had match 2: \"Order by Judge Charles R. Breyer\". We need to capture that. Also maybe other judges in other documents not yet visited. So we need to read Docket further for other judge names. The Docket is partially visited: tokens 1958-2158, 10571-10771. We saw match 2 tokens 10571-10771 includes order by Judge Charles R. Breyer. That is likely the judge. There might be other judge mentions in other documents: e.g., in \"Order\" maybe \"Judge\" in other matches? Search shows in Order matches none. But maybe other parts. We should search for \"Judge \" again but maybe more general: \"Judge [A-Z][A-Z]\" etc. But we already did search regex \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" found matches. But those matches didn't capture the judge name in Docket? Wait, match 2 was \"Order by Judge Charles R. Breyer\". That pattern includes \"Judge Charles R. Breyer\". So yes.\n\nAlso maybe other judge names like \"Judge ...\". We need to ensure we capture all. So we should search for \"Judge\" again but maybe include middle initial. The regex used: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\". That pattern matches two words after Judge, but \"Judge Charles R. Breyer\" has three words after Judge: Charles R. Breyer. But pattern only matched \"Judge Charles R.\"? It might have matched \"Judge Charles R.\" ignoring Breyer? Actually pattern didn't include trailing Breyer. So maybe our search didn't capture all. We need to adjust regex to capture more: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*\" to capture multiple names. But we can just search for \"Judge \" and then look at context. Let's search for \"Judge\" in all docs.\n\nBut we have to avoid re-reading documents we've partially visited: Docket has tokens 1958-2158 and 10571-10771. We need to read more. But we can search again. Let's use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Docket\" and pattern \"Judge\" maybe with flags IGNORECASE. But we already searched all docs. But we can search for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" again with different pattern. But we need to read relevant tokens to confirm.\n\nGiven we already have a match with the judge name, we can append that.\n\nBut we need to check if there are other judge names in other documents not yet visited. We can search across all documents for \"Judge\" again with a broader pattern. But we need to read the matches. We can use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" and pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*\" maybe. But we might get large matches. But we can get top_k 5 per doc. That should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, we can read specific docs like Complaint, etc. But likely the judge appears only in docket and order documents.

Also Order Granting: tokens 8459-8659 includes \"Judge Charles R. Breyer\". Also Docket maybe others. We can read one of those ranges to capture the text.

The search results mention \"Remaining matches: 2 in Docket, 4 in Order, 7 in Order Granting Plaintiffs' Application for Temporary Restraining Order\". That implies there are 7 matches in Order Granting. But those were not visited yet. Also, the search did not find any matches in the other documents, but maybe they didn't contain the phrase \"Judge\". But we should check.\n\nWe need to confirm if there are any other judge names. For caution, we should search again with the same pattern across all documents, but the earlier search returned 33 matches. It might have found all matches across all documents. But maybe the search did not include the unvisited documents? It says \"search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: ...)\", but the results list only mentions Docket, Order, and Order Granting. So likely no matches in the other documents. But to be thorough, maybe we should search those unvisited documents for \"Judge\" pattern to double-check.\n\nWe also need to consider that \"Judge\" might appear as \"Judge\" but not followed by a name, or with a middle initial, etc. The regex pattern used earlier: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+|\\s+[A-Z]\\.)*\" should capture names like \"Judge Charles R. Breyer\". It might also capture \"Judge Charles R\" etc. That should find names.\n\nBut there might be also \"Judge\" followed by a name that is not capitalized? Unlikely.\n\nWe should also consider if \"Judge\" might appear in a context like \"Judge of the Court\" etc. But we only need names. The system earlier extracted \"Charles R. Breyer\" from Docket and Order. So we need to confirm if there might be any other judge names in other documents.\n\nWe can do a search on the unvisited documents for \"Judge\" pattern. Let's do search_document_regex for those four unvisited documents.\n\nWe need to perform a search on \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\", \"Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\", \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\". The pattern remains \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+|\\s+[A-Z]\\.)*\".\n\nWe can do a combined search across those four docs. Use doc_names array.\n\nLet's call search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\",\"Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\",\"Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\"],\"pattern\":\"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+|\\\\s+[A-Z]\\\\.)*\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order", "Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order", "Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction"], "pattern": "Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+|\\s+[A-Z]\\.)*", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8408, "completion_tokens": 907, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

They have appended one value for First_and_Last_name_of_Judge. But check if there are more judge names in the corpus. We need to extract all distinct judge names. We have 8 documents. They searched many times but only found 33 matches in all documents earlier, but only appended one. That means we likely missed others. Let's examine the documents: Docket, Order, Order Granting Plaintiffs' Application for Temporary Restraining Order, Defendants' Corrected Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Defendants' Notice Regarding Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The judge name likely appears in order documents and docket, maybe also in the Correction. We need to search for judge names in all documents. The search regex used earlier may have matched but we didn't read the contexts. We need to read the relevant token ranges where matches occur. The search results for Docket: 20 matches. But we only read some ranges. We should locate the matches that haven't been viewed. The \"search_document_regex\" can give context. Let's search for \"Judge\" pattern again across all documents. That might produce matches. However we want to read the actual context for each match. We could use search_document_regex to get context for each match, but we need to read the full context. The tool can return top_k matches per document. We might get many matches. We could get 33 matches total. We might need to parse each.\n\nWe previously appended one value. Likely we need to append the rest.\n\nSo we should call search_document_regex on all documents again, maybe with a high top_k to get all matches (max 20 per doc?). But we want all. Let's choose top_k 20 per doc. There are many matches. But we can parse.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the document ranges that contain the judge names manually. Which documents likely contain judge names? Docket, Order, Order Granting Plaintiffs' Application for Temporary Restraining Order, Defendants' Corrected Opposition. Also maybe the other pleadings don't mention judge names. The plaintiff's motions might have judge names. But we need to verify.\n\nWe should call search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" maybe with optional middle names. Use flags IGNORECASE? The earlier searches used pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+|\\s+[A-Z]\\.)*\". That should capture titles. Let's repeat. But we need to specify top_k maybe 20. But default top_k is 5. We need all. We can set top_k 20. That might give all.\n\nBut the tool returns matches with context. That might be enough evidence. We don't need to read tokens separately.\n\nThus we should call search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+|\\s+[A-Z]\\.)*\" with flags [\"IGNORECASE\",\"MULTILINE\",\"DOTALL\"] maybe. But we want exact matches.\n\nWe can set context_tokens 200. We'll get matches.\n\nThen we parse results and extract distinct names.\n\nWe will then append all unique names to checklist.\n\nThus we choose action 3: search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+|\\\\s+[A-Z]\\\\.)*\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\",\"MULTILINE\",\"DOTALL\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+|\\s+[A-Z]\\.)*", "flags": ["IGNORECASE", "MULTILINE", "DOTALL"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3867, "completion_tokens": 800, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But there may be other judge names. The regex search earlier found 33 matches, many in Docket, Order, etc. But only 1 appended? Step 7 appended 1 value. But there might be multiple judge names. We need to extract all distinct judge names across corpus.\n\nWe need to read more tokens to capture all judge names. The search results show many matches with Judge Charles R. Breyer. That appears many times. Also maybe other judges. We need to confirm if there are any other judge names besides Charles R. Breyer.\n\nWe should inspect the unmatched documents: Order Granting Plaintiffs' Application for Temporary Restraining Order, Order, Defendants' Corrected Opposition, etc. But we might already have many matches of Breyer. But maybe there are other judges like Judge Jane Doe etc.\n\nLet's search for \"Judge\" in other documents quickly. Use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+|\\s+[A-Z]\\.)*\" to get matches. We already did earlier, but we need to get full list. We need to read beyond the previously covered matches. The search already returned 33 matches. We saw many matches in Docket. Also 4 matches in Order, maybe others. We need to identify all unique names. Let's inspect the matches in Order: we saw four matches? In Step 14, it says 4 matches in Order, but not listed. We should read tokens around those matches to see if there are names besides Breyer.\n\nAlso Order Granting Plaintiffs' Application for Temporary Restraining Order has 4 matches, we should inspect.\n\nWe also have Defendants' Corrected Opposition has 2 matches but earlier snippet didn't show a judge name. Might have.\n\nThus we should search again for \"Judge \" pattern but maybe with capturing group to output matched text. But we can use search_document_regex.\n\nLet's perform search on all documents again, maybe return more context or top_k=20. But we already saw 33 matches. The earlier search gave 33 matches: 2 in Defendants' Corrected Opposition, 20 in Docket, 4 in Order, +1 more docs. The +1 more docs likely are Order Granting Plaintiffs' Application etc. So we need to locate matches in those docs.\n\nWe can search again with top_k=20 and context_tokens=200. Then we can see the matches.\n\nWe need to read the matches to confirm the name.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex all documents with pattern \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+|\\\\s+[A-Z]\\\\.)*\" top_k maybe 20, context 200.
