Already we have from Docket (001) match 1: \"Date Filed: 09/19/2019\". Also Complaint has \"Filed 09/19/19\". That is another value: 09/19/19 (year 2019). Also maybe other documents have filings maybe different date. But likely filing date is 09/19/2019. There might be other dates like 2019-09-19. Also maybe Order, etc. But the filing date is the date lawsuit first filed. That appears in docket. Also maybe in complaint's heading includes \"Filed 09/19/19\". So we have two distinct values: \"09/19/2019\" and \"09/19/19\". Should we treat them as same? They represent same date but different format. The requirement: Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So both are distinct values. So we need to append both. We need evidence: complaint snippet tokens 2087-2287 includes \"Filed 09/19/19\". We should read that part to capture evidence. But we already have that snippet. But we might need to read again to capture evidence. We have snippet: \"RB   Document 1   Filed 09/19/19   Page 5 of 77\". So evidence text: \"Filed 09/19/19\". We need source_document: \"Complaint\". location: maybe page 5? tokens 2087-2287. We can specify location \"Page 5 of 77\" or token range. Also docket snippet: \"Date Filed: 09/19/2019\". That is evidence. So we need to read that snippet fully. We have snippet. But we need to locate the snippet in docket. The snippet from Docket (001) match 1 includes that. We can read that part to get evidence. We already have snippet. But to be safe, we might read that token range again to confirm.\n\nThus next action: read_document to read the relevant snippet from Complaint and Docket (001). But we can only call one action. We could call read_document on Complaint tokens 2087-2287. That will give the snippet. Then we can append the two values. But we also need docket snippet; we could also read that. But maybe we can use the search_document_regex again to get docket snippet. But we already have snippet. We need to confirm.\n\nWe could also choose to read Docket (001) tokens 0-421 to capture the date. That snippet includes the date. But we also get complaint snippet. We can read both in separate calls, but must choose one per turn. But we could batch? But read_document only one doc. So we need to pick one. Which is more valuable? The docket snippet seems clear and straightforward. The complaint snippet also gives date. But we need both to capture distinct values. We can read docket now, then later read complaint. So next best is to read Docket (001) tokens 0-421. That will give date. Then we will append that. Then next turn we read complaint snippet.

There may be other dates in docket. Let's search Docket (001) for \"Filed\" or \"Date Filed\". Let's read more tokens beyond 421 up to next region maybe 421-1311. There's 1311-1729 already read.

That is likely the filing date. Also other docket maybe also has Date Filed. Docket (002) likely has a date. Let's search Docket (002) for Date Filed pattern. We haven't. So next step: use search_document_regex on Docket (002) for pattern \"Date Filed:\"? Or we can read Docket (002) tokens 0-500 to see. Let's search for \"File\" or \"Filed\". But easier: use search_document_regex on Docket (002) for \"Date Filed\". That will give match.\n\nWe also may need to confirm if Complaint has filing date. \"RB   Document 1   Filed 09/19/19\" indicates \"Filed\" not \"Date Filed\". That could be the filing date. So we should record both: 09/19/2019 and maybe 09/19/2019 is same. But distinct values? It's same date. So only one unique value.\n\nBut we need all distinct values found in any document. So if multiple documents give same date, we only need one entry for that date. But we need evidence from each document? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So if same date appears in multiple docs, we could include evidence from one or multiple docs. But we need evidence for each entry. We can include evidence from one doc for that value. It's okay.\n\nThus we should append filing date 09/19/2019 with evidence from Docket (001) and maybe also from Complaint. But only need one evidence. However better to include both to satisfy \"supporting evidence\". But requirement says \"Each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context included.\" So we could include both doc contexts in evidence array.\n\nThus we need to append check for Filing_Date with value \"09/19/2019\".

So we need to search for other filing dates in all documents. We have partially visited many documents. We might find other dates: maybe earlier filings or subsequent docket entries. The complaint shows \"Filed 09/19/19\". That is same date but 2-digit year. Also docket shows \"Date Filed: 09/19/2019\". So duplicates.

That is same date but format with hyphens. Also maybe other documents like Order 001, 002, etc. Also maybe Joint Notice, etc. We need to find all distinct filing dates. Likely just 09/19/2019. But we should confirm if any other dates exist. For example, Docket (002) shows many entries all 2019-09-19. So same date. So distinct value is 09/19/2019. But need to ensure we capture all. Also maybe Order 001 or 002 might have filing dates. Probably not.\n\nThus we should search all documents for patterns. We already did regex search across all documents and found 55 matches. But we might need to check if any other unique dates appear. But we can just search for Date Filed pattern again. But we might need to ensure we capture unique dates. We should search for \"Date Filed:\" pattern across all documents. But we already did that in Docket (001). Maybe other docs have \"Date Filed:\".\n\nAlso maybe the docket numbers include \"Filed\" lines. E.g., Docket (002) shows \"1 | 2019-09-19 | COMPLAINT.\" That is a filing date. So we may want to capture that too. We have evidence: Docket (002) tokens 0-500 show lines with dates 2019-09-19. So need to extract that. But we already appended 09/19/2019. But we may need to add evidence from Docket (002).\n\nThus we should read Docket (002) for the date. However we already saw tokens 0-500. That snippet includes \"2019-09-19\" lines. But we haven't appended that evidence. We appended from Docket (001) and Complaint. We need to include evidence from Docket (002). So we need to either append new evidence to existing value or update.\n\nWe can append the same value with additional evidence. But we must ensure that for each extracted value, we include all evidence. In the prior append, we had two evidence items for the one value. We can append another evidence to that value. The append_checklist can add new entries or add new evidence for existing values? The spec: \"APPENDS new entries to existing extracted lists for specified keys.\" For each key, you can append multiple extracted values. Each extracted value has evidence. We can add same value again? It's better to append new evidence to the same extracted value? But the schema may treat each extracted as separate. But we should not duplicate values. We can update the existing extracted entry with new evidence. But update_checklist replaces the entire list. That might be easier: we can provide a single extracted entry with all evidence: from Complaint, Docket (001), Docket (002). But we need to ensure we don't lose earlier evidence. Actually we can append new extracted entry: but that entry would have same value but new evidence. That would produce duplicate values. But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So duplicates are not allowed. So we should combine evidence into one entry. So we should update the key with the combined evidence. But we have already appended one entry with two pieces of evidence. Now we need to add a third piece. There's no direct method to add evidence to existing extracted value. We can do update_checklist to replace entire list with one entry including all evidence. That will keep the same value but with all evidence included. Good.\n\nThus we should do update_checklist for Filing_Date with extracted: value \"09/19/2019\" and evidence: 3 items: from Complaint, Docket (001), Docket (002). But we must ensure we include the evidence from Docket (002). Let's identify the exact text snippet. The snippet from Docket (002) lines: \"1 | 2019-09-19 | COMPLAINT.

The list of documents: Complaint, Docket (001), Docket (002), Orders, Joint Notice. We have partially viewed many tokens but not entire. We need to search for filing dates across remaining documents. The date pattern search earlier found 55 matches across all docs. We should search again for \"Date Filed:\" or \"Filed\" maybe other docket entries with dates. But we should consider potential other filing date: maybe in Complaint itself we saw \"File 09/19/19\" (year 2019). Also other docs may have dates like 2019-10-01. But we need filing date of lawsuit, which is usually the earliest filing. We got 09/19/2019. There might be other dates in other documents like \"09/19/2019\" repeated. But distinct value is same. So maybe only one distinct value.\n\nBut need to confirm no other distinct dates exist. We should search through remaining documents for date patterns. Use regex to find patterns of dates. The search_document_regex earlier was performed on all documents and found 55 matches: 10 in Complaint, 10 in Docket (001), 10 in Docket (002) (+4 more docs). So there are matches in 4 additional docs beyond those three. Those presumably could contain dates in other formats. We need to inspect them. Let's identify which documents are remaining: Orders (001-005), Joint Notice, Order Approving Settlements. They might have dates like \"2020-01-15\" etc. But those may be not filing dates. We need to check if any of them contain a filing date. The filing date is likely only in docket and complaint. But to be thorough, we should search for \"Filed\" or \"Date Filed:\" in all remaining docs. We may perform search_document_regex on those docs specifically to ensure no other distinct dates.\n\nGiven that we have only 1 filing date known, we need to confirm if any other distinct filing dates exist. Let's search for pattern \"Date Filed:\" again across all docs. But maybe some documents like Orders or Joint Notice include \"Filing date:\" or \"Filed\". Could also have \"Filed: 09/19/2019\". We could search for \"Filed:\" pattern. Let's search on all docs for pattern \"Filed\\s*[:\\s]*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\". Also pattern \"Filed\\s*\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}\". But we need calendar dates. We'll run search_document_regex on all docs for pattern \\b\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\\b. Already did earlier. But we might want to look at orders. Let's search again on all docs for \"Filed\" maybe. But to keep systematic, we could search for \"Filed\" with date.\n\nWe'll use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern: \"Filed\\s*[:\\s]*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\". We'll also search for \"Filed\\s*\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}\". We'll combine.\n\nBut we might just search for \"Filed\" with date context. Let's do one search for \"Filed\" pattern. Also search for \"Filing fee received\" maybe.\n\nBut maybe simpler: search for \"Filing\" and then check context. Could be \"Filing fee received: $ 400.00\". That is not a filing date though. The filing date may be \"Entered: 09/19/2019\" but the date is in docket entries. That might appear in orders too but not necessarily the filing date. The filing date is the date the complaint was filed. That is 09/19/2019. So we can finalize.\n\nBut to be safe, we need to confirm there's no other distinct date like 10/01/2019 or 12/01/2020. Let's search all documents for \"2020\" or \"2021\" dates. The docket entries show termination dates 02/28/2021, 01/14/2021 etc. But those are not filing dates. So we can stop.\n\nHowever, we must ensure the checklist for Filing_Date includes all distinct values. We have only one. So we can stop. But we need to check if there might be any earlier date like 08/15/2019. But the docket shows 09/19/2019 as first entry. The complaint was filed on 09/19/2019. So okay.\n\nWe should maybe search all orders and joint notice for any date that could be a filing date. But those documents are not part of filing. So we don't need.\n\nThus we can stop. But we must ensure the checklist has the single value with evidence from the documents: we have evidence from Docket (001), Complaint, Docket (002). Already appended and updated. So final state: Filing_Date has 1 value. Good.\n\nThus next action: stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct filing dates have been identified and recorded with supporting evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct filing dates have been identified and recorded with supporting evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4825, "completion_tokens": 1147, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have already appended filing date entries, updated to include 3 values (though duplicates). The filing date appears to be same (\"09/19/2019\") from multiple sources. The requirement: extract every distinct filing date found in any document. It seems only one distinct date: 09/19/2019. Already extracted. We need to verify if any other date exists. We have search results earlier showing 10 matches in Complaint, 10 in Docket (001), 10 in Docket (002). But we only extracted from Docket(001) and (002) and Complaint. But maybe other documents have different filing dates? For example, Order documents may have date filed? But likely same.\n\nWe should confirm that there are no other distinct dates. We could search across all docs with pattern for filing date. We already did search_document_regex on all docs earlier, got 55 matches. The ones we read: Docket(001) had Date Filed: 09/19/2019. Docket(002) entries show 2019-09-19 etc. Complaint had \"Filed 09/19/19\". So consistent.\n\nBut maybe there is a different filing date in other docs? The search earlier found 10 matches in Complaint. Those may have different dates? Likely same. But we can search again focusing on Complaint to confirm there is no other date. Since the current catalog shows Complaint partially visited. We have not read the whole Complaint. But we can search for pattern \"Filed\" or \"Date Filed\" or dates in the Complaint. We can run search_document_regex on Complaint for dates pattern. That would locate potential different dates. The earlier search had 55 matches overall, but we didn't see the specific ones. We can run a targeted search. But the system may have already fetched some. But better to search again to be safe.\n\nThus we should call search_document_regex on Complaint for pattern of dates. But we need to give evidence for any distinct date found.\n\nWe could also include evidence that only 09/19/2019 appears. But we need to confirm no other distinct dates exist. So we should search. So choose action: search_document_regex on Complaint with pattern for dates. The pattern can be same as earlier: \"\\b(?:January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December)\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}\\b|\\b\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\\b\". That will find date strings.\n\nBetter to search for \"Filed\" too. But we can rely on the date pattern. We'll get context.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on \"Complaint\" with pattern for dates. Use context 200 tokens.\n\nAlso we might want to specify top_k=10.\n\nSo: call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Complaint\". Provide pattern.\n\nThen after reading results, we will append if new values found. But currently we have only one value. If we find any other distinct date, we will append. If none, we may conclude done. So next action: search_document_regex.\n\nThus produce function call.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint\",\"pattern\":\"\\\\b(?:January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December)\\\\s+\\\\d{1,2},\\\\s+\\\\d{4}\\\\b|\\\\b\\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{4}\\\\b\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "pattern": "\\b(?:January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December)\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}\\b|\\b\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\\b", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4332, "completion_tokens": 779, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Current status: Filing_Date has 1 value extracted, but the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have only one value so far: 09/19/2019. But maybe there are other filing dates in other documents: e.g., Complaint also has \"File 09/19/19\" maybe same date, but maybe other documents like Order or etc might have other filing dates. Need to ensure exhaustive. We have partial coverage. We should search for more filing dates across documents. There might be other docket entries with filing dates like 08/15/2019 etc. But we need to confirm.\n\nWe want to find all distinct filing dates. We already found 09/19/2019. There might be other dates in the docket entries like 09/19/2019 again but maybe same. The complaint also has \"File 09/19/19\" same. Are there other dates like 09/19/2019? Might be only one. But we need to confirm there are no other dates. Search for pattern of date in all documents to find new matches. There are many date matches already but many are references to articles, not filing dates. But maybe there are other docket entries with \"Filed\" statements.\n\nWe could perform a targeted search for pattern \"Filed\" or \"Date Filed:\" in all documents. We already searched Docket (001) for \"Date Filed: \\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}\". That found 1 match. We could search all documents for \"Filed\" or \"Filed:\" pattern. But to be efficient, we want to search all documents for \"Filed\" plus date.\n\nBetter: search for pattern \"Filed\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}\" or \"Filed\\s+\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}\" etc. But the docket entry shows \"Date Filed: 09/19/2019\". Also complaint shows \"Filed 09/19/19\" 2-digit year. So we should search for \"Filed\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2,4}\" and \"File\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2,4}\". But we also want to capture \"Entered:\" maybe.\n\nBut the requirement: Filing_Date is the calendar date on which lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court. Usually the docket entry for the complaint entry. So likely only one. But to be safe, search all documents for \"File\" or \"Filed\" with date.\n\nWe have some docket entries for Docket (002) 0-500 tokens show \"2019-09-19 | COMPLAINT. Filing fee received: ...\" That's also a filing date. So that's same date.\n\nBut maybe other documents (Orders) might have \"Entered: 09/19/2019\" but that's same.\n\nThus likely only one distinct filing date.\n\nBut we need to verify no other distinct date appears. Search all documents for date patterns maybe outside docket entries. But the complaint has only that date.\n\nWe might search \"2019-09-19\" etc. But we can search for \"2019-09-19\" pattern across all documents. But we don't know.\n\nWe can search for \"Entered:\" pattern but need date.\n\nBut simpler: we could search all documents for date patterns and then manually examine. But we have many matches already.\n\nGiven that we have seen only 09/19/2019 in all visited tokens. The docket entries for all documents show same date. It's likely that the lawsuit was filed on 09/19/2019. So we can finalize.\n\nBut we need to ensure that we have evidence for each distinct value. We have evidence from Docket (002) tokens 0-500, Complaint tokens 2087-2287, Docket (001) tokens 0-165. So we have evidence for 09/19/2019.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have captured all distinct values. If there were any other date, we would need to add. But we don't see any.\n\nThus we can stop. The current status shows 1 extracted value. So we can send stop.\n\nBut we must ensure we didn't miss any. To be safe, we could search all documents for \"Date Filed\" pattern again to confirm no other. But we already did search in Docket (001). But maybe other documents have \"Date Filed:\" like Docket (002) might also have \"Date Filed: 09/19/2019\". But we have evidence from Docket (002) tokens 0-500 with date. So it's same.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nWe should output JSON: decision: stop with reason.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct filing dates (09/19/2019) have been identified and recorded with supporting evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct filing dates (09/19/2019) have been identified and recorded with supporting evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6640, "completion_tokens": 1041, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
