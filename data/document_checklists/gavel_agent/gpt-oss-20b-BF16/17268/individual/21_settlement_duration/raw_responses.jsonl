We have some matches already found. The last search regex \"([0-9]+)\\s*(month|months|year|years|day|days)\" found many matches across documents, but not all necessarily settlement durations. We need to read relevant documents to find settlement obligations durations.\n\nThe key: How_Long_Settlement_will_Last. We need to find durations of settlement obligations, not court orders or judgments. Settlement obligations could be in Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines (notice). That document shows \"joint status report every 60 days\" and possibly other durations. Also maybe Order (002) and other orders mention settlement durations.\n\nWe need to search for patterns like \"for a period of X months\" or \"for X months\" within the settlement context. We can search for \"settlement\" + duration. Use search_document_regex on all docs with pattern like \"(?i)settlement.*?(for a period of|for|during|over|within|until|by) ([0-9]+ (month|months|year|years|day|days))\". But we need to include context to confirm it's a settlement duration. Or read the Joint Notice manually.\n\nLet's examine Joint Notice snippet: lines 14-15: \"The Parties stipulate to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay to keep the Court apprised of the progress of finalizing the pending settlements.\" This indicates a period of 60 days for status reports, not necessarily settlement duration. But settlement obligations include monitoring periods, so this could count as a settlement obligation duration: \"every 60 days during the stay\". That is a duration: 60 days. We need to capture as \"[60 days]: joint status reports during stay\".\n\nAlso Order (002) says \"joint status report every 60 days\". So same info.\n\nThus we need to extract at least that duration.\n\nAlso maybe there are other settlement durations, like \"for 30 days\" etc. Search for \"within 30 days\" maybe in context of settlement. Let's search for \"within 30 days\" in settlement context. There's in Order (003) match 2: \"within 30 days of the court’s order\". But that's a court order, not settlement. So maybe not relevant.\n\nSearch for \"settlement\" in Order (003). The snippet didn't show settlement, but maybe elsewhere.\n\nWe should search documents for \"settlement\" keyword and look for durations. I think we should search all documents for pattern \"settlement.*?([0-9]+ (month|months|year|years|day|days))\". Let's do search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"settlement.*?([0-9]+ (?:month|months|year|years|day|days))\", flags IGNORECASE, MULTILINE.

But those are about negotiations, not settlement obligations.\n\nCheck Joint Notice: lines show \"file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay\". That \"60 days\" is a settlement obligation? It's a monitoring period for the settlement. Yes it's a settlement obligation. So we need to extract \"60 days: joint status report every 60 days\". Also maybe \"30 days\" for status report? Let's read more of Joint Notice beyond tokens 640-840 for full details. We should read more tokens from that doc. The doc is 1,597 tokens, coverage 13% so we can read more. Let's read the entire doc to capture all settlement durations. Use read_document for Joint Notice from token 0 to 1597.

Let's inspect Order (002) snippet: included \"joint status report every 60 days\". That appears in Order (002) as well. But that's same obligation. Might be duplication. But we need all distinct values across documents. So we will have \"60 days: joint status report every 60 days\" extracted once. Also maybe there is \"30 days\" for a particular obligation? Need to scan other docs: Docket entries show extension deadlines but those are negotiation deadlines. They might not be settlement obligations. The settlement obligations in the Joint Notice include \"joint status report every 60 days\". Also maybe \"stay\" deadlines are vacated but not a duration. There's also \"the Parties shall provide a joint status report every 60 days to keep the Court appraised\". That is the same.\n\nAlso maybe Order (003) has some settlement obligations?

The pattern: \"every 60 days\" is a duration, obligation. Also settlement negotiation extensions: \"30 days to August 15\" etc. But the rule: only include settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order or judgment. Settlement obligations: the joint status report? That's a settlement obligation. Also the settlement negotiation deadlines? Those are deadlines, part of settlement negotiations. Should count as settlement obligations. So we need to extract each distinct duration and obligation.\n\nWe have evidence from Joint Notice: \"joint status report every 60 days during the stay\". Also from Docket: \"deadline for fact discovery is extended by 30 days to August 15, 2022. The deadline by which the Parties will engage in good faith settlement negotiations is extended by 30 days to August 22, 2022.\" That is settlement negotiation obligation: \"the deadline by which the Parties will engage in good faith settlement negotiations is extended by 30 days to August 22, 2022.\" Also \"deadline for any depositions ... extended by 30 days to September 19, 2022.\" Not a settlement obligation.\n\nAlso other Docket matches: \"extended by 32 days to September 23, 2022\" for settlement negotiations. So we have durations: \"every 60 days\" (status report), \"30 days\" (settlement negotiations deadline), \"32 days\" (settlement negotiations deadline). Also \"30 days to August 15\"? That's fact discovery, not settlement obligation. So only settlement negotiation deadlines.\n\nAdditionally, there might be other settlement durations in other documents not yet visited; but we can search regex for \"settlement .*?([0-9]+ (?:day|days|month|months|year|years))\" again maybe missed.

We need to read more context around those matches to capture the obligation phrase. We have tokens ranges for each match.

We'll extract that.\n\nThus next action: read_document for Docket (002) tokens 27646-27846 (range 1). Then after we get text, we append. But we should read all four ranges in one call? We can batch multiple read_document calls? No, one function call per action. So we can read one range now.

We have evidence from Joint Notice: says \"file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay\". That is duration of stay? Settlement duration: \"stay to be stayed pending further stipulation or motion of the parties\". But settlement obligations? Maybe the settlement obligations include status reports every 60 days, but that's not a duration. Also Docket shows extension of settlement negotiations deadlines. But the question: \"duration of settlement obligations, including any monitoring periods\". So from Joint Notice: \"file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay\". The stay presumably until final settlements. So duration: \"every 60 days during the stay\". But we need format: '[duration]: [settlement obligation]'. So we could extract \"60 days: file a joint status report\" as a value. Also Docket: \"deadline extended by 30 days to August 22, 2022\" referring to settlement negotiations, but not obligations. Maybe not.\n\nAlso Docket (002) has \"deadline for fact discovery is extended by 30 days to August 15, 2022.

But that's not necessarily a settlement obligation period; it's a reporting obligation. But the instruction says: \"duration of settlement obligations, including any monitoring periods\".

Another approach: search for \"settlement\" and then in the same paragraph maybe \"for a period of\" or \"lasting\" etc. But we can manually search documents. Let's list documents:\n\n- Complaint\n- Docket (002)\n- Order (002)\n- Order (003)\n- Joint Notice (already visited)\n- Docket (001)\n- Order (001)\n- Order (004)\n- Order (005)\n- Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\n\nWe have partial coverage of Complaint and Docket (002). We need to read more of those. Also read other orders.\n\nFirst, maybe the settlement duration appears in the orders approving settlements of minors' claims. Could include settlement obligations. Let's search that document. Since it's unvisited, we can read entire 735 tokens. But might be small. Let's read that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":735}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 735}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6546, "completion_tokens": 462, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Currently we have 1 value extracted: \"60 days: file a joint status report\" from the Joint Notice. Need to check other documents for settlement durations. We have seen Docket (002) entries with 30-day extensions, but those are deadlines for settlement negotiations, not settlement obligations. The definition says: duration of settlement obligations, including monitoring periods, for negotiated agreements between parties that resolve a dispute, as opposed to formal court orders or judgments. So we need settlement obligations that are not part of court orders/judgments. In the Joint Notice, the settlement obligation is to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay. That is a settlement obligation.\n\nOther documents: Complaint maybe has settlement terms? Likely not. Docket entries may have deadlines for settlement negotiations but not obligations. Orders may have settlement approval and terms: e.g., Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims might have terms like \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\" That is a duration for trust placement. That is a settlement obligation (placement of funds into trust until a certain age). So we need to extract that duration: \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25\". But the format requires '[duration]: [settlement obligation]'. For example: \"until age 18, 21, or 25: placement of B.M., B.G., L.A., and G.A.’s portions of the Settlements into pooled minors’ trusts\". So we need to extract that.\n\nAlso maybe other orders have settlement obligations like payment schedules. Need to review other orders: Order (001), (002), (003), (004), (005). We haven't read them. We could search for patterns like \"until\", \"years\", \"months\", \"days\" within orders. But we need settlement obligations, not court orders. But many orders might be approving settlements, so the settlement obligations are in them. We should examine Order (002), (003), (004), (005). Also maybe the Complaint has settlement terms? Likely not.\n\nGiven the current state, we need to read more documents to find other settlement obligations. We have not read Order (002) fully. We have partially visited 316-488 tokens of 488 total tokens. That is 35% coverage. We need to read the remaining tokens 0-315 maybe. Also read Order (001) (2033 tokens, unvisited). Order (004) (5417 tokens, unvisited). Order (005) (6617 tokens, unvisited). Order (003) partially visited 877-1077, 4104-4397, 23352-23552. We need to read those sections that might contain settlement terms.\n\nBut maybe the only settlement obligation beyond the Joint Notice is in the Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims. That has the trust placement until ages. Also maybe other orders have similar obligations, e.g., \"payment over 3 years\", \"installments\", \"monitoring for 12 months\". We need to extract all distinct values.\n\nWe should search across all documents for patterns like \"until\", \"for a period of\", \"for [0-9]+ months\", \"for [0-9]+ years\", \"until\", \"until the age of\", \"until the parties\", etc. But we must ensure it's a settlement obligation, not just a deadline. For example, \"the parties will engage in good faith settlement negotiations\" is not a settlement obligation. So we need to be careful. But I think the orders approving settlements will include obligations.\n\nThus next action: Search for settlement obligations in orders. We can use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern like \"until.*?age|until.*?years?|for a period of [0-9]+ (months?|years?)\" but that may match many. But we should search for \"until\" or \"for a period of\". Let's use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern: \"(until\\s+.*?age|for a period of\\s+[0-9]+\\s+(month|months|year|years))\". But ensure we get context. Then read the matches and extract obligations.\n\nAlternatively, we could individually read Order (002) and Order (003) and see if they contain settlement obligations. Let's inspect Order (002) (488 tokens). It's fully visited? Actually partially visited. We need to read from start 0-315. Let's do that. That might reveal a settlement obligation. Let's read Order (002) tokens 0-315.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order (002)\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":315}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (002)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 315}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5559, "completion_tokens": 998, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We saw search results earlier: Docket (002) has several matches with deadlines extended by days. Those are not settlement obligations? They are deadlines for settlement negotiations, not settlement duration. But might be settlement duration? The key is settlement duration of settlement obligations, including monitoring periods, not incorporated into court orders. We need to find durations of settlement obligations. The Joint Notice probably has a duration. The earlier read gave 1597 tokens; we appended a value. We need to check other documents for such durations. We saw search of settlement.*?months? found 4 matches in Docket (002). Those are extensions of deadlines, not settlement duration. They might not be settlement obligations. But the key may refer to settlement period in the settlement agreement. So we need to check other documents like Order (002), Order (003), Order (004), Order (005), Order (001).

It might have durations. We didn't parse. Should search for durations there. Let's search that order. But we have read it fully. We can search in that doc.\n\nThus we need to gather all distinct durations. Likely durations include \"every 60 days\" (or \"60 days\") and maybe \"for 6 months\" etc.\n\nWe need to extract each unique value formatted as \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\" – The settlement obligation likely the text describing the obligation. For example, \"every 60 days to file a joint status report\". So we need to produce value like \"60 days: to file a joint status report\". So we need to capture obligation description.\n\nThus we need to read the context around the match to extract obligation. The match we have in Joint Notice: \"The Parties stipulate to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay to keep the Court apprised of the progress of finalizing the pending settlements.\" So obligation: \"to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay to keep the Court apprised of the progress of finalizing the pending settlements.\" The duration: \"60 days\". So the value: \"60 days: to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay to keep the Court apprised of the progress of finalizing the pending settlements.\" But maybe we want just \"60 days: to file a joint status report\". But spec says format \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\". So we can include the obligation text.\n\nSimilarly, maybe other obligations like \"for 12 months\" etc.\n\nThus next action: Search for pattern \"settlement.*?(?:[0-9]+ (?:day|days|month|months|year|years))\" in all docs. We already did but only matches in Docket (002). But we should run again with broader context maybe. The earlier search returned only 4 matches. Let's check if any more. But we may need to search for pattern \"every\\s+[0-9]+\\s+(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)\" again. Already did. Only found same. So maybe only 60 days. But there might be other durations like \"for 3 months\" etc that didn't match due to pattern missing \"settlement\" before. Could search just \"for [0-9]+ (?:month|months|year|years|day|days)\" in all docs. That might capture more.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"for\\\\s+[0-9]+\\\\s+(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "for\\s+[0-9]+\\s+(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5494, "completion_tokens": 1094, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Also \"every 60 days during the stay to keep the Court apprised of the progress of finalizing the pending settlements.\" So we need separate entries.\n\nAlso maybe there are settlement durations in Orders.

There may be other settlement durations in other documents. We have some search regex hits but didn't extract. We need to search for settlement durations. We did earlier search pattern \"settlement.*?(?:months?|days?|years?)\" and found 4 matches in Docket (002). But maybe those are for settlement negotiations, not settlement obligations. We need settlement obligations that are not incorporated into court orders or judgments. The settlement agreements likely have monitoring periods, e.g., joint status reports every 60 days during the stay. That was extracted.\n\nBut there may be other settlement durations in other documents like Order (003) referencing Flores settlement agreement, etc. But that might be a different case.\n\nAlso maybe in Order (001) etc. We need to review other documents for settlement durations. The only one fully visited is Joint Notice. Others partially visited. We need to search for settlement durations in other documents.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"settlement.*?every\\s+[0-9]+\\s+(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)\" etc. Already found matches. But maybe there are durations like \"for a period of 60 days\" etc. We should search for \"for a period of [0-9]+\" maybe. Also \"for [0-9]+\".\n\nWe also might need to read other documents to confirm.\n\nWe should search for \"settlement\" and any numeric duration text. Probably we need to extract all distinct durations. Let's search again across all docs for patterns: \"settlement.*?([0-9]+)\\s*(day|days|month|months|year|years)\" which we already did and got 14 matches. Let's parse those matches to see if any represent settlement durations.\n\nBut we only read some of them. We need to read the actual matched texts to extract durations. The search results gave context but not fully. We need to read the specific matches to confirm.\n\nSpecifically, from step 19, the search of all documents found 14 matches. For each match, we need to read the portion to extract. We have the context from step 19 for some matches. For Docket (002), we saw many matches; but those are about extensions of deadlines, not settlement obligations. But they might mention \"settlement negotiations\" and durations like \"by August 22, 2022\". Those are not settlement obligations but deadlines for negotiations.\n\nHowever, the requirement: \"The duration of settlement obligations, including any monitoring periods, for negotiated agreements between parties that resolve a dispute, as opposed to formal court orders or judgments. Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" So we should ignore settlement deadlines that are part of court orders? Actually \"only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" Means if settlement obligations are part of a court order, skip them. So if the settlement is in a court order, skip. But if the settlement is in a joint notice or settlement agreement, include.\n\nThus we likely only need the settlement obligation durations from the Joint Notice and possibly from other settlement documents like Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims (but that is an order approving settlement). That might include settlement obligations but it's a court order. So skip.\n\nThus maybe only the Joint Notice contains settlement obligations. But there could be other settlement agreements in other documents like Order (003) might talk about settlement agreements with durations? But that is an order; skip.\n\nThus maybe we only need the one extracted value: \"every 60 days\" for joint status reports during the stay.\n\nBut we should verify if there are any other settlement durations in the Joint Notice or any other unvisited documents. For example, the other documents may contain settlement agreements with durations. But we didn't read them. Let's search for \"settlement\" \"period\" \"days\" etc. But maybe the other documents like Order (001), Order (004), Order (005) might be orders approving settlements. Those might contain durations. But they are orders, so they are court orders, so skip. But the requirement says \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" So we skip them.\n\nThus only the Settlement obligations in the joint notice might be the only ones. But we need to double-check if the Joint Notice may contain multiple durations: \"every 60 days\" for status reports, maybe \"for a period of 60 days\" for stay? Let's read the Joint Notice fully. It was fully visited. We need to extract all durations present. Let's read the full document again to confirm. We can read from start to finish. It is 1597 tokens. We didn't get all content. We should read the full doc again. We can read entire doc 0-1597.\n\nWe can call read_document for Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines (tokens 0-1597). It was already read fully. But we didn't capture all durations. But we only saw snippet earlier. We need to read the entire doc to capture all durations. Let's do read_document again but include entire range. But we already read it fully; but the snapshot says we read 1597 tokens. The read_document is still valid but we didn't parse all durations. We need to read again to capture all durations. But if we read again, we might duplicate reading? But we can read again; it's fine. However, we might have partially visited? It says fully visited. So we have the entire content. But we need to get the content. The read_document returns the text. We can request again. The system might still provide text. Let's do read_document for Joint Notice 0-1597 again.\n\nBut we need to parse the text for durations.

Check other documents: Docket (002) has \"abeyance for an additional period of sixty (60) days\", \"deadline for fact discovery extended by 30 days\", \"deadline for settlement negotiations extended by 30 days\". Those are durations. They refer to settlement negotiation period. But likely settlement obligations include monitoring of settlement. The Joint Notice includes \"every 60 days during the stay\" which is the monitoring period. Also Order (002) may have settlement period? Let's search for \"settlement\" in Order (002). It may have? But Order (002) is a court order for stay. Might mention settlement. Let's search regex \"settlement.*?([0-9]+ (?:day|days|month|months))\". But we already did.

But only 1 match in Docket (002) had \"for sixty days\". Others might include \"30 days\" etc. Let's examine matches for Docket (002) earlier: We saw match 1: \"abeyance for an additional period of sixty (60) days\". That is a duration. Also match 3: \"deadline for fact discovery extended by 30 days to Aug 15, 2022\" but that's not settlement duration. But settlement negotiations extended by 30 days. That is relevant? The key is settlement obligations, not necessarily negotiation period. But the prompt: \"duration of settlement obligations, including any monitoring periods\". So negotiation period may not be obligations. But the stay periods, abeyance, monitoring period, and settlement period after finalization. The Joint Notice includes monitoring period. The Order (002) includes stay period? Let's check Order (002) text: It states \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date, in this case only, and this action only is stayed pending further stipulation or motion of the Parties or Order of the Court.\" But no explicit duration.

We have extracted 1 value from Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines. But we need to extract every distinct value in any document. We likely need to find other settlement durations. We have searched many patterns, but may have missed some. We need to search for \"settlement\" durations, not just \"settlement.*?\" but also \"for a period of\" etc. Already did many searches. Maybe there is a settlement duration in the Docket (002) for \"60 days\" etc. We saw \"joint status report every 60 days during the stay\". That is not duration of settlement obligations? That is a monitoring period. The key: duration of settlement obligations including monitoring periods for negotiated agreements.\n\nWe need to extract all durations of settlement obligations. In Joint Notice, we have \"stay for 60 days during the stay to keep the Court apprised\" etc. That is a monitoring period of 60 days. That might be a settlement duration? The obligation is to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay. That is a monitoring period of 60 days. We should capture that.\n\nAlso in Docket (002) we saw \"additional period of sixty (60) days\" for abeyance. That is a monitoring period? It's a stay for 60 days.\n\nAlso maybe other durations like \"every 60 days\". There's also \"every 60 days\" in Joint Notice. So we need to extract distinct durations.\n\nWe need to confirm that each value is a separate entry formatted as \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\". So for each duration, we need the obligation text.\n\nWe should read the relevant parts to capture obligation text.\n\nFrom Joint Notice: lines 14-15 mention \"joint status report every 60 days during the stay to keep the Court apprised of progress\". So obligation: \"file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay\". Duration: \"60 days\".\n\nAlso in Joint Notice we might have other obligations: \"the parties will file a stipulation for dismissal of all claims\" but no duration. Also \"stay pending further stipulation\" but no duration.\n\nAlso in Docket (002) we saw \"additional period of sixty (60) days\" for the abeyance. That is a duration of 60 days for the abeyance of deadlines. It's a monitoring period? It's a stay. So obligation: \"held in abeyance for an additional period of sixty (60) days\".\n\nAlso in Docket (002) we saw \"deadline for fact discovery is extended by 30 days to August 15, 2022\". But that's a deadline extension, not settlement duration.\n\nAlso we saw \"deadline by which the Parties will engage in good faith settlement negotiations is extended by 30 days to August 22, 2022\". That is about settlement negotiations; maybe not settlement obligations.\n\nAlso \"deadline for any depositions of current or former Cabinet level officials is extended by 30 days\". Not settlement.\n\nWe need to search for \"settlement\" durations. We saw one search that found \"settlement.*?for\\s+([0-9]+)\\s+(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)\" and found only one match in Docket (002) for \"additional period of sixty (60) days\". That is the match we already have.\n\nBut there may be other \"settlement\" durations not captured by that pattern. Maybe \"settlement negotiations\" durations? But the key is settlement obligations. The monitoring period of settlement obligations. The \"joint status report every 60 days\" is a monitoring obligation. Also \"additional period of sixty days\" for abeyance of deadlines is a monitoring period.\n\nAlso maybe in Order (003) or others there is \"settlement agreement\" with a duration. Let's search for \"settlement\" and \"month\" etc. But we can use search_document_regex to search for \"settlement.*?(?:month|months|day|days|year|years)\". Already did that earlier but might not have captured \"settlement... for 60 days\". That pattern might be \"settlement.*?(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)\" - but earlier we found matches in Docket (002). But maybe there's also \"settlement agreement\" in other docs.\n\nLet's search in all documents for \"settlement.*?(?:month|months|day|days|year|years)\". That might find more. Also maybe \"settlement period\" etc. But we can search for \"settlement.*?(?:period|duration|term|time|time period)\" but not needed.\n\nThe key requirement: extract every distinct value of settlement duration. So we need to find all durations.\n\nWe have 1 from Joint Notice (60 days). We have 1 from Docket (002) (60 days). But those are the same duration (60 days). Distinct value means each unique duration? Actually each distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. If we have two entries of same duration but with different obligations, they should be separate entries because they are distinct obligations. The key format: \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\". So we need distinct entries for each obligation. So we need separate for each distinct obligation.\n\nSo we need to extract from Joint Notice: \"60 days: file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay to keep the Court apprised of progress\". And from Docket (002): \"60 days: held in abeyance for an additional period of sixty (60) days, until November 30, 2021\".\n\nBut we need to verify the exact text for obligation. Need to read the Docket (002) portion for the 60 days. We saw snippet in Step 18. The snippet includes \"ORDER granting 112 Motion to Stay. This action is to be held in abeyance for an additional period of sixty (60) days, until November 30, 2021\". That is the obligation. So we need to capture that.\n\nWe also need to confirm if there are any other durations. We should search again for \"settlement.*?for [0-9]+ (days|months|years)\" maybe we already did. But maybe there are other obligations in other docs not yet visited: Docket (001), Order (001), Order (004), Order (005). We haven't visited those. They might contain settlement durations. We should search there. Let's search for \"settlement.*?(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)\" again but for all docs? We did earlier and found only 4 matches in Docket (002) from earlier search. But maybe we didn't search in those unvisited docs. So let's run search_document_regex on all docs with that pattern again. It will search all docs. That might reveal matches in other docs.\n\nLet's do: search_document_regex doc_name=\"all\" pattern=\"settlement.*?(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)\" flags ignorecase? We can add IGNORECASE. That will find any durations in all docs. We'll do a top_k maybe 10.\n\nWe'll then check results.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"settlement.*?(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "settlement.*?(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9830, "completion_tokens": 1556, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We saw matches: 30 days, 32 days, etc. Those are settlement negotiation deadlines. Also there is a 60 days stay in the order? In Joint Notice, the stay period? It says \"joint status report every 60 days during the stay\". But that's a reporting schedule, not settlement duration. Need to capture durations of settlement obligations: \"conditional settlements of all claims\" but duration maybe the period of stay? The rule: duration of settlement obligations, including monitoring periods. So the settlement obligations likely include the stay period? In Conditional Settlement, parties want stay pending further stipulation or motion. But settlement obligation includes \"settlement negotiations extended by 30 days\" etc. Those are durations of settlement negotiation deadlines.

Might be considered settlement obligation: they agreed to stay the action pending further stipulation or motion. So duration of stay: not explicitly stated, but the order says the action is stayed pending further stipulation or motion. No duration mentioned. So not a duration.\n\nThus we need to extract durations from Docket (002) matches. Also maybe from Joint Notice: \"every 60 days during the stay to keep the Court apprised of the progress of finalizing the pending settlements.\" That's a reporting obligation, not settlement duration. But the settlement obligation might be the period of stay? The stay is indefinite until further stipulation. So no definite duration.\n\nThus we need to gather values:\n\n- 30 days: deadline for fact discovery extended by 30 days to Aug 15, 2022. Also deadline by which parties will engage in good faith settlement negotiations extended by 30 days to Aug 22, 2022. Also deadline for depositions extended by 30 days to Sep 19, 2022.\n\n- 32 days: similar for Aug 16? extended by 32 days to Sep 23.\n\n- 14 days: extended by 14 days to Oct 3.\n\nAlso the earlier \"60 days\" stay? Actually the Joint Notice mentions \"stay pending further stipulation or motion\". No duration.\n\nAlso maybe other documents have settlement durations like \"60 days\" or \"30 days\" etc. We should search again for \"extended by\" or \"deadline for\" with durations. But we already have those from Docket (002) matches. Also maybe other documents like Order (003) mention settlement durations? Search earlier. But we had no matches.\n\nThus we should append all these values.\n\nWe need to format each value: '[duration]: [settlement obligation]'.\n\nExamples from earlier: \"60 days: deadline for fact discovery extended by 60 days\" but that is a duration of the extension. But we need the settlement obligation: maybe \"deadline for fact discovery extended by 30 days to Aug 15, 2022\".\n\nBut the format: [duration]: [settlement obligation]. So we should maybe use just the duration number and unit, then the obligation. For each match:\n\n- \"30 days: deadline for fact discovery is extended by 30 days to August 15, 2022\"\n\n- \"30 days: deadline by which the Parties will engage in good faith settlement negotiations is extended by 30 days to August 22, 2022\"\n\n- \"30 days: deadline for any depositions of current or former Cabinet level officials, heads of agencies, or White House officials and advisors is extended by 30 days to September 19, 2022\"\n\nSimilarly for 32 days, 14 days.\n\nAlso earlier match: \"60 days: stay pending further stipulation or motion\"? Not present.\n\nAlso Joint Notice: \"stay pending further stipulation or motion of the Parties or Order of the Court.\" No duration.\n\nAlso Joint Notice: \"joint status report every 60 days during the stay\". That is a reporting obligation, not settlement duration; but maybe still considered settlement obligation? But it is a monitoring period: every 60 days. That counts. So we could add \"60 days: joint status report every 60 days during the stay\".\n\nAlso the Joint Notice had \"stay pending further stipulation\". But period of stay unspecified.\n\nThus we have at least 5 durations: 30 days (3 obligations), 32 days, 14 days, 60 days (reporting). Also maybe 30 days again appears for depositions.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't duplicate identical obligations. We can include each unique obligation. But we should include each distinct duration: 30 days with its obligations: we could have separate entries for each obligation.\n\nThus we will append 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 entries.\n\nWe need evidence: The text snippets from Docket (002). We have the context from matches earlier. We should provide evidence for each.\n\nWe need to read tokens for each match to get full context. We have lines of context from the earlier search. But we might need to read more precisely. But we can use the search results as evidence because they include context. The search_document_regex results contain context tokens. We can use those for evidence. The evidence requires text, source_document, location. We can use the snippet as text, and location as token range.\n\nThus we will create append_checklist with key How_Long_Settlement_will_Last, extracted list of entries, each with evidence.\n\nWe'll use the match texts from earlier Step 23. Provide the snippet for each.\n\nLet's gather snippets:\n\nMatch 1 (tokens 27646-27846) includes:\n\n\"ORDER granting 260 Joint Motion to Extend Deadlines for Completion of Fact Discovery and Settlement Negotiations. The deadline for fact discovery is extended by 30 days to August 15, 2022. The deadline by which the Parties will engage in good faith settlement negotiations is extended by 30 days to August 22, 2022. The deadline for any depositions of current or former Cabinet level officials, heads of agencies, or White House officials and advisors is extended by 30 days to September 19, 2022.\"\n\nSo we can extract:\n\n- \"30 days: deadline for fact discovery is extended by 30 days to August 15, 2022\"\n\n- \"30 days: deadline by which the Parties will engage in good faith settlement negotiations is extended by 30 days to August 22, 2022\"\n\n- \"30 days: deadline for any depositions of current or former Cabinet level officials, heads of agencies, or White House officials and advisors is extended by 30 days to September 19, 2022\"\n\nMatch 3 (tokens 28367-28567) includes:\n\n\"deadline by which the Parties will engage in good faith settlement negotiations is extended by 32 days to September 23, 2022. The deadline for any depositions of current or former Cabinet level officials, heads of agencies, or White House officials and advisors is extended by 14 days to October 3, 2022.\"\n\nSo entries:\n\n- \"32 days: deadline by which the Parties will engage in good faith settlement negotiations is extended by 32 days to September 23, 2022\"\n\n- \"14 days: deadline for any depositions of current or former Cabinet level officials, heads of agencies, or White House officials and advisors is extended by 14 days to October 3, 2022\"\n\nAlso earlier match 2 (tokens 27695-27895) is similar to match 1? It's the same content? Actually match 2 shows same text. But we can ignore duplicate.\n\nNow Joint Notice includes: \"The Parties stipulate to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay to keep the Court apprised of the progress of finalizing the pending settlements.\" So entry:\n\n- \"60 days: joint status report every 60 days during the stay to keep the Court apprised of the progress of finalizing the pending settlements.\"\n\nAlso maybe \"stay pending further stipulation or motion\" but no duration.\n\nThus we will append 5 entries (3 from 30 days, 1 from 32 days, 1 from 14 days, 1 from 60 days) = 6 entries? Wait we have 3 entries from 30 days, 1 from 32 days, 1 from 14 days, 1 from 60 days. That's 6 entries. Good.\n\nWe also need to ensure we provide evidence. For each, we can use the snippet from Docket (002) which we have. For the 60 days entry, we use snippet from Joint Notice. Provide location tokens e.g., tokens 14-15 lines or token range 14-17? We can approximate location as page 2 of 4? We can use the snippet lines. Provide location as \"Page 2 of 4\".\n\nThus create append_checklist patch.\n\nWe must ensure we don't duplicate previous value. Previously we appended one value from Joint Notice: maybe \"60 days: stay pending further stipulation\"? Actually we appended something earlier. Let's check: Step 7: append_checklist (How_Long_Settlement_will_Last) with 1 value from Joint Notice. The content of that value? Not provided. We need to review earlier append. But we don't know what it was. Could be the \"60 days\" or \"joint status report\". But we don't know. To avoid duplication, we can check that we haven't appended that same entry. But we can't see previous. But we can assume we appended maybe \"60 days: joint status report\". So we may duplicate. To be safe, we might need to update or replace? But we don't know. We could retrieve current checklist: get_checklist. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.get_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"item\":\"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "get_checklist", "args": {"item": "How_Long_Settlement_will_Last"}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10546, "completion_tokens": 2157, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Current status shows 1 value extracted from Joint Notice. But we likely have more in other documents like Docket (002) contains settlement durations. We have matches in Docket (002) from step 23, but they didn't extract? The append in step 7 added 1 value from Joint Notice. But likely there are other settlement durations, e.g., in Docket (002) orders for extensions of deadlines or settlement negotiations. Are those considered settlement durations? The definition: duration of settlement obligations, including monitoring periods, for negotiated agreements between parties that resolve a dispute, as opposed to formal court orders or judgments. Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment. So settlement obligations like \"joint status report every 60 days\" is a monitoring period. Also \"settlement negotiations extended by 30 days\" might not be a settlement obligation; it's a deadline extension for negotiations, not settlement obligations. But the \"joint status report every 60 days\" is a settlement obligation: parties must file a status report every 60 days during the stay. That is a duration: every 60 days. Also if there's an \"additional period of sixty (60) days\" for stay, but that's a court order? That might be a hold period, but not a settlement obligation? Actually the stay might be a settlement obligation? The stay is a court order, not settlement obligation. The joint status report is settlement obligation.\n\nAlso Docket (002) has orders about \"deadline for fact discovery extended by 30 days\" etc. Those are not settlement obligations.\n\nAlso \"the Parties will file a stipulation for dismissal of all claims\" after settlement, but no duration.\n\nThus we likely need to extract:\n- \"every 60 days\" from Joint Notice.\n- Maybe \"for a period of sixty (60) days\" from the Motion to Compel? That was a stay by the court; not settlement obligation.\n\nAlso maybe there are other settlement durations in other documents like Order Approving Settlements, but that order is a court order. Not settlement obligation.\n\nThus maybe only one value: \"every 60 days: joint status report\".\n\nBut earlier search: Step 20 extracted \"joint status report every 60 days\". That was appended. There may be other durations in other documents: e.g., \"for a period of 60 days\" in the Order (002) or (003) maybe. But those are court orders.\n\nThus we need to check if any other settlement obligations exist: maybe in Docket (001) or other orders. But we haven't visited those. We should search for pattern \"every [0-9]+ days\" maybe in all documents, but we already did that (step 14, 16, 17). That found matches in Docket (002) and Joint Notice. The only match was in Joint Notice. So likely only one.\n\nBut we need to also consider \"duration of settlement obligations, including any monitoring periods, for negotiated agreements that resolve a dispute\". The Joint Notice contains settlement obligations: \"The Parties stipulate to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay\". That is a settlement obligation. So value: \"60 days: joint status report\".\n\nAlso maybe \"the Parties will engage in good faith settlement negotiations for 30 days\" is not settlement obligation. It's negotiation period.\n\nThus we may have only one value.\n\nBut to be thorough, we should search Docket (001) and other orders for settlement obligations. But the current status shows Docket (001) unvisited. But maybe no settlement obligations. Let's quickly search for \"settlement\" in Docket (001). But we haven't. But we could run search_document_regex on Docket (001) for \"settlement.*?every\\s+[0-9]+\\s+(day|days|month|months|year|years)\". But we already did for all documents and found only matches in Joint Notice and Docket (002). So there's no other.\n\nThus we may have only one value. But the check says 1/1 filled, 0 empty. But we might need to confirm if there are any other durations in other documents. Let's search for \"every [0-9]+\" in all documents. Step 14 and 16 found 2 matches: one in Docket (002) and one in Joint Notice. Possibly the Docket (002) match had \"every 60 days\" as well? Let's examine the Docket (002) matches: The text snippet from step 23 shows \"The deadline for fact discovery is extended by 30 days to August 15, 2022. The deadline by which the Parties will engage in good faith settlement negotiations is extended by 30 days to August 22, 2022.\" No \"every\". So no.\n\nThus only Joint Notice.\n\nThus we have all values. So we should set the checklist to contain only that value, but we must ensure no other values. The current checklist shows 1 value. We need to verify that no other values exist. The search results step 23 matches 4 in Docket (002) but not \"every\". The search step 21 for \"settlement.*?for\\s+([0-9]+)...\" found one match: \"60 days\" maybe? Actually step 21 shows a match from Docket (002) with \"sixty (60) days\". But that is part of a stay order. That may not be settlement obligation. It's a stay by court. So not include.\n\nThus final answer: we already have the one value.\n\nBut we must ensure the value is properly formatted as \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\". The extracted value likely is \"60 days: joint status report\". We need to confirm the exact phrasing: The text: \"The Parties stipulate to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay\". So duration \"60 days\" and obligation \"joint status report\".\n\nThus we need to append that entry. But we already appended in step 7. But the check shows 1 value. But we need to verify if there were any other values appended incorrectly or missing. Let's review step 7: \"append_checklist\" (How_Long_Settlement_will_Last) → 1 value from Joint Notice. So the entry exists. But do we need to update or confirm? The current status says 1/1 filled, 0 empty. So it's done. But we need to ensure that no other values exist across all documents. We can do search_document_regex for \"every\\s+[0-9]+\\s+(day|days|month|months|year|years)\" again across all docs; we already did. But maybe we missed \"every 60 days\" in Docket (001). But we didn't search. Let's search again but only for Docket (001). But maybe we can search all documents again; maybe there is another match we didn't see.\n\nBut the step 23 search for \"settlement.*?(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)\" found 4 matches in Docket (002). That includes \"30 days\" etc. But none \"every\". So no.\n\nThus likely only one value.\n\nThus we should stop.\n\nBut we need to double-check that the entry is correctly formatted. The requirement: format as '[duration]: [settlement obligation]'. So we need to produce that string. The value extracted earlier probably is \"60 days: joint status report\". Ensure we capture the exact text: \"every 60 days during the stay\" is the obligation. But we need to phrase as \"60 days: joint status report\".\n\nThus we can issue update_checklist to replace the current extracted list with the correct entry? But we already appended that entry. But maybe we need to update it to correct format. But the earlier appended entry might have the same text. We need to confirm. The step 7 appended a value. But we don't know its formatting. We can check the appended value content. But we don't have that. But we can update it to ensure correct format.\n\nTherefore the next action should be update_checklist for key How_Long_Settlement_will_Last with a single extracted entry: \"60 days: joint status report\". Provide evidence: text snippet, source document Joint Notice, location page 2 line 14-15? Actually location: page 2, lines 14-15: \"The Parties stipulate to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay\". So location: page 2 of Joint Notice. Provide evidence snippet.\n\nThus we should call update_checklist.\n\nLet's compose the JSON.\n\nWe need to supply patch array with key \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" and extracted array with one entry: value \"60 days: joint status report\", evidence array with text snippet.\n\nLet's produce evidence: text: \"The Parties stipulate to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay\". source_document: \"Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines\". location: \"Page 2 (lines 14-15)\".\n\nThus call update_checklist.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"60 days: joint status report\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"The Parties stipulate to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 2, lines 14-15\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "How_Long_Settlement_will_Last", "extracted": [{"value": "60 days: joint status report", "evidence": [{"text": "The Parties stipulate to file a joint status report every 60 days during the stay", "source_document": "Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines", "location": "Page 2, lines 14-15"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7312, "completion_tokens": 2030, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

There may be other durations in other documents: e.g., Docket (002) has \"30 days\" for deadlines, but those are deadlines, not settlement obligations? The requirement: settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment. So perhaps only settlement agreements or stipulations. Docket (002) appears to be a docket entry describing orders and deadlines; but it might be order granting extension of deadlines for settlement negotiations. But that might be part of a court order. The requirement says: \"negotiated agreements between parties that resolve a dispute, as opposed to formal court orders or judgments.\" So docket entries are court orders. So only settlement agreements.\n\nWe have Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines (a settlement). There might be other settlement documents: maybe Order 001, 004, 005, 003? Those are orders. Not settlement agreements.\n\nMaybe Complaint includes a settlement clause? Probably not.\n\nHowever, there could be other settlement documents in the corpus not yet visited, like Order (001), (004), (005) maybe are orders but could be orders of settlement?

They may be orders, but could include settlement details. But they are labeled Order/Opinion. Likely court orders. So not settlement.\n\nThus maybe only one value.\n\nHowever, we should double-check if there is any other settlement document like \"Settlement Agreement\" etc. Not in list.\n\nThus we already have 1 extracted value.

Are there any other settlement durations like \"30 days\" etc. That might be settlement deadlines but part of a court order.

The user wants \"Extract the settlement duration from the legal documents.\" Step 26 had 1 value \"60 days: joint status report\" extracted. But we need to verify if there are other settlement durations in other documents. The search history found many matches earlier with durations: e.g., in Docket (002) we saw \"30 days\" extensions etc. But those are deadlines for discovery and negotiation; but the checklist item: \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last: The duration of settlement obligations, including any monitoring periods, for negotiated agreements between parties that resolve a dispute, as opposed to formal court orders or judgments. Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment. Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [settlement obligation].'\"\n\nThus we need to capture settlement obligations durations. Are there any other settlement durations? The Joint Notice had \"joint status report every 60 days\". That is a settlement obligation. Other documents may have settlement obligations like \"the parties will provide a joint status report every 60 days\" - that's captured.\n\nBut maybe other documents (e.g., Order (002) etc.) might have settlement obligations. Let's scan the catalog for potential settlement durations.\n\nDocuments left unvisited: Docket (001), Order (001), Order (004), Order (005). There may be settlement durations in them.\n\nWe should search for patterns like \"settlement\" + \"days/months\" in those documents. Already searches on all documents found matches earlier. But maybe some matches were missed because the search pattern didn't capture them. We saw earlier Step 23: search pattern \"settlement.*?(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)\" found 4 matches in Docket (002). That may not include other documents. But maybe there are settlement durations in Order (001) etc. We need to check.\n\nAlso we might search for \"joint status report\" etc. But we only captured one. Could there be others? The user only wants settlement durations. So we should review each unvisited document for settlement obligations.\n\nWe can search all documents again with pattern \"settlement.*?(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)\" but we already did earlier. But maybe we didn't search Order (001) etc. But the search was on all documents, so it should have returned matches in those too. It returned 4 matches only in Docket (002). That suggests no other matches.\n\nBut we also had earlier search \"settlement.*?([0-9]+)\\s*(day|days|month|months|year|years)\" etc. That found 14 matches across documents: 3 in Complaint, 7 in Docket (002), 1 in Joint Notice, plus 2 more docs. So there were matches in Complaint but maybe not settlement obligations? Let's inspect those matches. We didn't read those tokens. We need to check if they represent settlement obligations durations. For example, in Complaint, there might be a claim like \"the parties will pay within 30 days\" but that's not settlement.\n\nWe need to differentiate: settlement obligations are obligations under negotiated agreements not court orders. The Complaint is a claim, not agreement. So durations in Complaint might refer to claim deadlines but not settlement. So we should ignore.\n\nBut we should check if there are any settlement durations in Order (001-005). Those are orders, but may contain settlement obligations. The instruction says: \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" So if an order includes settlement obligations, we should not count them. So we should skip orders.\n\nThus the only settlement obligation we found is the joint status report. Are there any other settlement obligations in documents not yet visited? Possibly in Docket (001) or other orders. But if they are orders, we exclude. Docket is not an order; it's a docket of filings. Might contain settlement agreements filed. We searched all documents and only found matches in Docket (002). But maybe we missed Docket (001) because search may not have covered all tokens? But we searched all docs, it should cover Docket (001). But maybe the token coverage for Docket (001) is unvisited entirely; search would scan all docs regardless of visited status. So it should have found matches if present. So if no matches in Docket (001), it's likely no settlement durations.\n\nThus we might be done. But we should double-check that the Joint Notice contains only one settlement duration. The extracted value: \"60 days: joint status report\". Are there other obligations? The Joint Notice might include other durations like \"the parties will provide a joint status report every 60 days during the stay\". That's the same. No other durations. Let's verify.\n\nWe can read the document to confirm. We already read it fully; we can search for \"days\" etc. But we can check again.\n\nGiven the status shows that the checklist has 1 value extracted, no other values. We might consider that all settlement durations have been captured. But we should be cautious: The Docket (002) includes multiple deadlines for settlement negotiations etc. Are those settlement obligations? Those are deadlines for negotiation, but not part of a settlement agreement; they are part of judge orders. The instruction says \"Only include settlement obligations that are not incorporated into a court order or judgment.\" They are in a judge order. So exclude.\n\nThus we are likely done.\n\nBut to be safe, we might search for \"settlement\" in Order (001-005) to see if any settlement obligations are included. But orders are court orders, so they are not included. But to be thorough, we could do search on those orders for \"settlement\" + days. But we can check quickly.\n\nWe can do a search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"settlement.*?(?:day|days|month|months|year|years)\" again. Already did step 23. It found 4 matches in Docket (002). So no matches elsewhere. So we can stop.\n\nThus next action: stop.\n\nLet's produce final JSON: decision: \"stop\", reason: \"All settlement durations identified\".<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All settlement durations identified\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All settlement durations identified", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5485, "completion_tokens": 1302, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
