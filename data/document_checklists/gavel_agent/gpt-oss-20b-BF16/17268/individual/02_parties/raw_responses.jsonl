It shows plaintiffs names, but not formatted 'Plaintiff: [description]'. We need to extract parties. We have partial info: plaintiffs: list of names. Also defendants: United States of America. Also maybe others? There are other parties: OSBORN MALEDON, P.A. is counsel for plaintiffs. But parties are plaintiffs and defendants. We need distinct values: \"Plaintiff: [description]\" and \"Defendant: [description]\". So probably we need to extract each plaintiff and defendant. The complaint likely lists plaintiffs: eight? Let's examine the snippet: lines:\n\n1  David B. Rosenbaum, 009819 \n2 Emma J. Cone-Roddy, 034285 \n3 OSBORN MALEDON, P.A. \n4 2929 North Central Avenue, 21st Floor \n5 Phoenix, Arizona 85012-2793 \n6 (602) 640-9000 \n7 drosenbaum@omlaw.com  \n8 econe-roddy@omlaw.com \n9 (Additional Counsel for Plaintiffs Listed on the Following Page) \n10 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n...\n14 Plaintiffs, \n...\n17 United States of America, Defendant. \n...\n\nAlso later we see list of plaintiffs: \"C.M., on her own behalf and on behalf of No. her minor child, B.M.; L.G., on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child, ...\". So many plaintiffs. There might be 10 plaintiffs. We need to extract each distinct party. Best to search for \" Plaintiffs,\" or \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\". We already searched pattern \"Plaintiff[s]*:\" but found no matches. Perhaps the patterns in the document use \"Plaintiffs,\" not \"Plaintiff:\".\n\nSo we should search for \"Plaintiffs,\" or \"Defendant\" lines. Use search_document_regex on Complaint with pattern \"Plaintiffs,\" or \"Defendants,\". But \"Defendant.\" appears with period. Let's search for \"Defendant\". Use search_document_regex doc_name=\"Complaint\" pattern \"Defendant\" flags IGNORECASE. That should find lines with \"United States of America, Defendant.\" Also maybe \"Defendants\". But we only need parties.\n\nWe need to extract each plaintiff separately. There might be a list of plaintiffs names separated by commas. Let's scroll further. The snippet after the partial list might be truncated. But we can read more tokens of the Complaint to capture all plaintiff names. We saw some names: David B. Rosenbaum, Emma J. Cone-Roddy, maybe C.M., L.G., etc. We need to capture each one.\n\nBetter approach: Search for pattern \"C.M., on her own behalf\" etc. But maybe easier: Use search_document_regex for \" on her own behalf\" pattern to capture each plaintiff name. Or we could read the rest of the Complaint to find all names. Let's read next 2000 tokens from offset 2000-4000. That will include more plaintiff names.

We already have some from Complaint. We need all distinct values. Possibly other documents contain parties info. But likely Complaint contains all parties. But there might be other documents like Docket may list parties. We should search for \"Plaintiff\" occurrences. We already saw many. But we need to extract distinct parties: Plaintiffs C.M., L.G., M.R., O.A., V.C. and their children B.M., B.G., J.R., L.A., G.A. Also Defendant United States. Also maybe other parties like \"United States of America\" etc. Also there might be plaintiffs' counsel, but that's not parties. So we need to extract all parties information: Plaintiff: C.M. mother of B.M., Plaintiff: L.G. mother of B.G., etc. Also Defendant: United States of America. Also maybe \"United States of America\" referenced as defendant.\n\nWe need evidence snippets. We have evidence from Complaint pages 6-7. We should read those ranges. They already loaded tokens 2000-4000 covering pages 6-7. We need to capture each party description.\n\nWe can append multiple entries for key Who_are_the_Parties.\n\nWe should ensure each entry includes evidence. Provide location: e.g., \"Complaint\", page 6, \"Page 6 of 77\" etc.\n\nWe will use append_checklist with patch for key Who_are_the_Parties, multiple extracted entries.\n\nWe need to extract distinct values: For each plaintiff, we should produce 'Plaintiff: [description]'. The description maybe the sentence: \"Plaintiff C.M., now 29 years old, was 27 years old at the time of the forced separation described in this Complaint. She is the mother of Plaintiff B.M., now seven years old, who was five years old at the time of the separation.\" But we can condense to key info: Plaintiff C.M., mother of B.M. Probably we should include full description. The requirement: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\" So each value is a string formatted accordingly. We should include at least name and role. Maybe include age? But minimal.\n\nWe need to include evidence snippet. Possibly we can provide snippet containing \"Plaintiff C.M., now 29 years old, was 27 years old at the time of the forced separation described in this Complaint. She is the mother of Plaintiff B.M., now seven years old, who was five years old at the time of the separation.\" That's from page 6.\n\nAlso similar for others.\n\nWe also need Defendant: \"Defendant United States of America is the appropriate defendant under the FTCA.\" That's from page 7.\n\nAlso maybe \"United States of America\" also appears earlier. But we can use that.\n\nAlso maybe parties include \"United States of America\" as defendant, maybe \"United States\" singular. We can use that phrase.\n\nNow we need to ensure we have evidence for each. We'll use the snippet from page 6 and 7.\n\nWe have tokens 2000-4000 already read. That includes page 6 and 7. So we can refer to that.\n\nWe need to construct evidence objects: text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe will create entries:\n\n1. \"Plaintiff: C.M., mother of B.M.\" with evidence snippet from page 6.\n\n2. \"Plaintiff: B.M., child of C.M.\" maybe not necessary as child described in plaintiff description but maybe we need separate? The requirement: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" The child is a party? They are plaintiffs? They are child plaintiffs. They are plaintiffs too. The complaint lists them as plaintiffs? The text says \"Plaintiff C.M., ... She is the mother of Plaintiff B.M.\" So B.M. is also plaintiff. So we need separate entry for B.M. \"Plaintiff: B.M., child of C.M.\" with evidence snippet.\n\nSimilarly for L.G., B.G., M.R., J.R., O.A., L.A., V.C., G.A.\n\nWe might need to include each. The snippet includes each description.\n\nThus 10 plaintiff entries (5 mothers + 5 children) and 1 defendant entry.\n\nWe need to ensure unique values. Yes.\n\nWe need evidence snippet for each from page 6-7. We have to provide snippet text. We can provide a short excerpt that contains the key info.\n\nWe need to ensure evidence location indicates page number. We can say \"Complaint, page 6 of 77\" or \"page 6\" etc.\n\nWe need to confirm that the snippet includes the description of each party. Let's review page 6 snippet:\n\nFrom read_document tokens 2000-4000:\n\nLines 26-35 show description of C.M. and B.M. Then L.G. and B.G. Then M.R. and J.R. Then O.A. and L.A. Then V.C. and G.A. Then page 7 shows Defendant and mention of defendants. Also section 13-18 mention DHS employees etc.\n\nThus we can extract each.\n\nWe should create evidence text exactly as snippet. We can use the text from the snippet. For example for C.M. entry: \"Plaintiff C.M., now 29 years old, was 27 years old at the time of the forced separation described in this Complaint. She is the mother of Plaintiff B.M., now seven years old, who was five years old at the time of the separation.\" That's a good snippet.\n\nFor B.M. entry: maybe \"Plaintiff B.M., now seven years old, who was five years old at the time of the separation.\" But we might want to include the preceding sentence about mother. But separate snippet can be \"Plaintiff B.M., now seven years old, who was five years old at the time of the separation.\" That is part of the same paragraph. We can use that.\n\nSimilarly for L.G. entry: \"Plaintiff L.G., now 24 years old, was 23 years old at the time of the forced separation described in this Complaint. She is the mother of Plaintiff B.G., now eight years old, who was seven years old at the time of the separation.\" etc.\n\nFor B.G. entry: \"Plaintiff B.G., now eight years old, who was seven years old at the time of the separation.\"\n\nSame pattern for others.\n\nDefendant entry: \"Defendant United States of America is the appropriate defendant under the FTCA.\"\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each from snippet. We'll use exact text from snippet. We need to capture location: \"Complaint\", \"page 6 of 77\" or \"page 7 of 77\" accordingly.\n\nWe should verify that the snippet lines show page 6 and 7. The snippet includes \"Page 6 of 77\" and \"Page 7 of 77\". We'll use those.\n\nThus we can append.\n\nWe must ensure we don't duplicate. And we must not set Not Applicable.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with patch for key Who_are_the_Parties with 11 entries.\n\nLet's craft JSON.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Who_are_the_Parties\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: C.M., mother of B.M.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Plaintiff C.M., now 29 years old, was 27 years old at the time of the forced separation described in this Complaint.

Possibly the other documents could list other parties like attorneys, but the checklist item is Who_are_the_Parties describing plaintiffs and defendants.

However, maybe the Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims could mention parties. But the requirement is to extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. We need to ensure we have all parties.\n\nCheck if other documents contain additional defendants or plaintiffs. The Complaint lists the United States as defendant. There might be other defendants like \"Department of Homeland Security\" or \"Department of Health and Human Services\" but those are not defendants; they are agencies referenced. The question: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" So we should list all plaintiffs and defendants. The Complaint lists plaintiff parties (C.M., L.G., M.R., O.A., V.C.) and their children. The defendant is United States of America.\n\nBut the complaint also mentions \"United States of America\" as defendant. Are there other defendants like \"Department of Homeland Security\" considered as defendant? In the complaint, they are referenced as agencies but not defendants. The parties section lists only the U.S. as defendant. So we likely captured all.\n\nHowever, check if the Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims might mention \"United States of America\" again, but that's same.\n\nThus we have all parties.

Also there might be other parties like \"United States\" and \"DHS\" etc. But the checklist item is \"Who_are_the_Parties\" and we should extract all distinct parties. It might want to capture each party's role. We captured plaintiffs and defendants. Did we capture the child parties as plaintiffs? Yes, we considered them as \"Plaintiff: B.M.\" etc. But are the child defendants? They are plaintiffs too. So we captured all.\n\nDouble-check if any other parties like attorneys or counsel appear.

The task: extract parties involved from legal documents. We have 10 documents. We already extracted from Complaint. But there may be other parties in other documents: e.g., the docket entries, orders, settlement orders, etc. The parties might include the defendant (U.S.) and plaintiffs as listed. Possibly also counsel? But \"parties\" refers to plaintiffs and defendants. But some documents might list additional parties, e.g., \"United States of America\" as defendant, maybe other parties like \"United States Department of Homeland Security\" or \"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\" could be considered parties? In the complaint, the defendant is the United States of America. In orders or settlement orders, there might be \"United States\" and maybe \"United States of America\" again. The parties are likely the same across documents.\n\nBut check if any other documents mention additional parties that are not included, e.g., \"United States Department of Homeland Security\" could be a party in the order approving settlements. The task says: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\" So include roles etc. The earlier extraction includes many plaintiffs with mothers and children, but maybe we omitted the roles like being a mother of child. Also we didn't include the defendant details beyond \"United States of America\". But the defendant is a single entity.\n\nWe need to double-check if other documents include additional parties beyond these 11. The docket might list parties in docket entries, but likely the same. But maybe the docket includes \"United States of America\" and the plaintiffs. But no new parties.\n\nWe should search for \"Defendant\" or \"Plaintiff\" across all documents to confirm no new parties. The search_document_regex can search across all documents for \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\". But we should be efficient: maybe search for the pattern \"Defendant:\" or \"Plaintiff:\" but earlier search didn't find matches because the complaint had no such headings. But the other documents might have \"Defendant\". Let's search across all documents for \"Defendant\". Use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"Defendant\" ignoring case. But we need to parse the results. However the system will return matches with context. But the search may produce many matches, but we can scroll through.\n\nAlternatively, we could read some other documents partially, but likely no new parties. But check \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" might mention the parties. But maybe not. The settlement doc might mention \"United States of America\" and \"the Plaintiffs\" but not list names. But we can search for \"United States\" or \"United States of America\" to see if any other parties appear. But we may not need to read further if we are confident no new parties.\n\nHowever, we must ensure all distinct parties are captured. The complaint includes 5 plaintiffs (C.M., L.G., M.R., O.A., V.C.) and 5 child plaintiffs (B.M., B.G., J.R., L.A., G.A.) and one defendant (United States). That's 11 distinct parties. But maybe the plaintiffs are considered 5 separate parties and the children are also parties? The extraction earlier included 11 entries: each mother and child separately. But the instruction: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices. The extracted value should be formated as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\"\n\nSo each party is separate. So we should include each child as a plaintiff. That is correct. Also the mother as plaintiff. So 11 entries.\n\nBut maybe there are also other parties like \"United States Department of Homeland Security\" that might be a party in the order approving settlements. But the order might be between the United States and the plaintiffs. Possibly the order is between the United States and the Plaintiffs (as parties). But the parties are still the same: United States of America and Plaintiffs.\n\nBut the order may refer to \"the United States\" or \"the United States of America\" again. But no new names.\n\nThus maybe we are done.\n\nBut let's double-check if any other documents mention \"United States Department of Homeland Security\" as a party. That may be the defendant's agency. But it's not a party to the lawsuit; it's an entity within the defendant. The instruction: \"Describing each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" So could include \"United States of America – Federal Government\" or \"United States of America – Defendant\". But we already have \"Defendant: United States of America\". That covers.\n\nBut we might need to include \"United States Department of Homeland Security\" or \"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\" as parties? They are not parties, but part of the defendant. But the instruction maybe includes them as parties (capabilities). But likely not.\n\nThus we can stop. But we must ensure we have not missed any party names in other documents. Let's search for \"Plaintiff\" across all docs quickly. Use search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Plaintiff\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Plaintiff", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8581, "completion_tokens": 1142, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But we need to ensure all parties in all documents. The other documents may contain additional parties, e.g., other plaintiffs? The complaint lists plaintiffs C.M., L.G., M.R., O.A., V.C. and their children B.M., B.G., J.R., L.A., G.A. Defendant United States of America. The docket also lists plaintiffs and maybe attorneys. But the parties list is same. There might be other documents with additional parties like counsel etc. But the checklist requires parties involved: descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices. So we need to include each party: plaintiff: description, defendant: description. The complaint already includes plaintiffs and defendant. But maybe other documents include the same parties but maybe with more details such as \"United States of America\" (defendant). Also maybe \"United States Department of Homeland Security\" etc? But those are not parties; they are government agencies referenced. The parties are plaintiffs and defendant. The docket and other documents may mention \"United States\" as defendant. There might be other parties like other defendants, but not likely. So we likely have all parties.\n\nBut we must check other documents for any other parties like \"United States\" repeated; maybe \"United States of America\" appears. But we already have that.\n\nAlso \"Plaintiff: C.M.\" etc. The complaint has a full list. But we should verify if there are any other parties: maybe \"Plaintiff: B.M.\" etc. They are plaintiffs too. So all parties are the same.\n\nBut we must ensure we extracted all parties in the complaint. We have 11 entries: 5 mothers (C.M., L.G., M.R., O.A., V.C.) and 5 children (B.M., B.G., J.R., L.A., G.A.) plus defendant United States. That is 11.\n\nWe need to check if there are any other parties in other documents. For example, the docket might list \"United States of America\" as defendant, but we already captured. The docket also lists \"C.M. represented by ...\". But that's counsel. Not a party.\n\nThe Joint Notice shows parties again; same.\n\nThus we likely have all parties.\n\nNeed to check if any document lists \"United States\" or \"U.S.\" as defendant, maybe with different wording. But we can keep the same entry.\n\nWe should confirm we didn't miss any parties. Let's search for \"Plaintiff:\" pattern again or \"Defendant\". But we already saw complaint. But maybe other docs mention \"Plaintiff\" too. But the parties list is the same.\n\nGiven the exhaustive search earlier, we saw all parties. The complaint is the source of all parties. So we can finalize.\n\nThus our next action is likely to `stop` because all keys are filled. But we must check if any other party missing: The docket may mention \"United States of America\" again but we already have it. No other parties.\n\nAlso the checklist: \"Who_are_the_Parties\" expects a description for each party. We have \"Plaintiff: C.M., mother of B.M.\" etc. That meets requirement. The defendant entry: \"Defendant: United States of America\" is okay.\n\nWe should verify that each value is unique. We have 11 unique values.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut double-check: The complaint had \"Plaintiff: B.M., child of C.M.\" etc. That's fine.\n\nThus next action: `stop`.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All parties identified and extracted from the Complaint, covering plaintiffs (C.M., L.G., M.R., O.A., V.C. and their children B.M., B.G., J.R., L.A., G.A.) and defendant (United States of America).
