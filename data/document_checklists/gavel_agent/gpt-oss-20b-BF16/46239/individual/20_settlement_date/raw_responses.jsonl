Is that correct? The checklist says: Do not include any date once the settlement is incorporated into a judgment or order. But dismissal without prejudice: no settlement has been made. So Date_of_Settlement may be Not Applicable. But we must ensure there isn't an earlier settlement date elsewhere. We need to confirm that there is no settlement. This may have been an attempt at settlement? Checking documents for \"settlement\" search returned none. Also \"settle\" returned none. So no settlement. So Date_of_Settlement Not Applicable seems correct. But we must ensure that we don't mistakenly mark as Not Applicable if there's a settlement. But we saw no settlement. We should double-check other documents for settlement. We might search for \"settle\" again or \"settle\" or \"settlement\" case. But earlier searches returned none. But maybe the settlement was not referenced. However the case was dismissed, so likely no settlement. So we can stop.\n\nWe should decide to stop.

The docket shows dismissal without prejudice. But the settlement date may be earlier. We have not searched the other documents for settlement. The defendant's opposition and motion for injunction might mention settlement? But nothing likely. The settlement date might be in the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" which may contain a settlement date. We should read that. Also, the docket indicates dismissal but that does not mean there is no settlement. The settlement could have occurred before dismissal. So we need to verify: search for \"settlement\" again? But earlier search didn't find. But the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" may not contain settlement. But we should read it fully. Also, \"Defendants’ Opposition\" might contain settlement. But we haven't read beyond token 4000. It might contain settlement info later. We should read more of that. The \"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" might mention settlement. But likely not.\n\nWe should read the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. Let's do read_document tokens 0-386. It was already read 386 tokens. But we didn't parse it. We should read it fully again or retrieve its content. But we already have content: earlier read_document gave 386 tokens. We should re-read? The content is not stored. We need to read again. So call read_document on Notice of Voluntary Dismissal tokens 0-386. That will show the content. Then parse for settlement dates. Likely it says \"Dismissed without prejudice\" but may mention settlement date? Unlikely. But we should check.\n\nAlso the Defendants’ Opposition still partially visited. We may need to search for settlement date. But earlier search failed. But maybe the pattern \"settled\" or \"settlement\" didn't show because not present. Could be present in a later portion. But we should read more. We need to determine if there's any settlement.\n\nThe Docket shows dismissal without prejudice, which does not preclude settlement. Settlement could have been reached earlier and then dismissed? But if settlement existed, the case would be dismissed with prejudice? Actually settlement could be before dismissal. But the docket entry \"Dismissed without prejudice\" indicates the case was dismissed, but not that there was no settlement. The settlement could have been reached but not entered as an order. We need to find any settlement date. The instructions: \"Do not include any date once the settlement (in whole or in part) is incorporated into a judgment or order.\" So if settlement was incorporated into an order, we ignore. But if settlement existed but not incorporated, we include.\n\nThus, we must search for any settlement date in documents. Likely it's not present. But we need to confirm by reading maybe the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" which may mention \"settlement\" or \"agreement\" but not likely. But let's read. Also read the remaining parts of the Defendants' Opposition beyond 4000, maybe there is settlement.\n\nWe could search for \"settlement\" again but earlier search didn't find. But that search was across all documents but maybe not covering the rest of opposition. But search_document_regex should find matches across all docs. It previously didn't find. But maybe because the pattern \"settlement\" requires exact. But we can search for \"settled\" or \"agreement\" or \"settlement date\". But maybe the settlement date appears earlier. Might be in the \"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" maybe there's mention of \"settlement\" as part of background. But earlier search didn't find.\n\nThus, likely no settlement. So we can mark Not Applicable as earlier. But careful: we must provide evidence of Not Applicable. We already have evidence from docket entry: \"Case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" But is that evidence that settlement does not exist? No, the docket indicates dismissal. But it doesn't necessarily preclude settlement. But instructions: Not Applicable only if explicit evidence that settlement does not exist or is incorporated. But \"Dismissed without prejudice\" does not say there was no settlement. The docket only indicates the case was dismissed. But settlement could have been reached but not incorporated. But we need evidence that settlement date is not present.\n\nBetter to search for settlement in all documents. Since earlier search didn't find, we can be confident no settlement. But we should do another search with pattern \"settlement\" or \"settled\". Already done. But maybe the settlement date appears as \"Settlement Date: ...\" But pattern \"Settlement Date\" may appear. But earlier search didn't find. So we can conclude none.\n\nWe must confirm by reading the rest of the Defendants' Opposition to see if any mention of settlement. The read_document of 4000 tokens only covered early part. We should read further. But we can search for \"settlement\" again. That search didn't find. So likely none.\n\nThus we can mark Not Applicable. But we must ensure we have evidence of Not Applicable. The evidence is that no document contains any settlement date. But we need explicit evidence. The docket entry \"Case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" That indicates no settlement date? Might be considered evidence that there was no settlement. But maybe the dismissal was without prejudice, meaning no settlement. But unclear. But we can use that as evidence.\n\nWe also should read the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. It likely says \"Dismissed without prejudice\" too. That indicates no settlement. But we should read it.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Notice of Voluntary Dismissal tokens 0-386. Then parse. That will confirm no settlement date. Then we can update checklist to Not Applicable if still. But we already updated earlier. But we can confirm.\n\nBut we might need to provide evidence for Not Applicable. The evidence we already have: docket entry. But we might need to provide evidence from the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal too.\n\nThus we should read that. So next action: read_document on Notice of Voluntary Dismissal tokens 0-386.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":386}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Notice of Voluntary Dismissal", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 386}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6924, "completion_tokens": 1283, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The prior steps determined Date_of_Settlement is Not Applicable based on docket dismissal. But maybe that dismissal means no settlement. However, the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We need to review all documents to find settlement dates. We have partially visited Opp and Motion. But we need to check if there is any settlement date. Possibly there is a settlement agreement or dismissal. The docket shows dismissal without prejudice. That indicates no settlement. But we must consider if any other document contains settlement date: maybe in the motion or opposition there is mention of settlement. The earlier search for \"settlement\" in all documents returned no matches. But maybe the search didn't find because the word \"settlement\" appears but not matched due to case or formatting. They searched with pattern \"settlement\" and \"settle\" with no matches. So perhaps there are no settlement dates. The only evidence is the dismissal and no mention of settlement. The earlier step 24 updated Date_of_Settlement to Not Applicable based on evidence. That seems correct. But we need to ensure no settlement dates exist. The problem: they have partially visited the Opposition and the Motion. They haven't fully read them. But earlier searches for \"settlement\" returned no matches. But maybe the settlement is spelled \"settlement\" but not found? Possibly not. But we should still confirm no settlement date exists by reading the remaining documents. But the instruction: we need to extract all settlement dates. If none found, we can set Not Applicable. But we must be sure there's no settlement date in the remaining documents. Since we haven't fully read them, we might risk missing. But the search regex pattern \"settlement\" returned no matches across all documents. That includes the partially visited ones. So likely no settlement date. But to be safe, we might read a chunk of the remaining documents to confirm that there is no settlement date. But we can also use search_document_regex again with patterns \"settle\" or \"settlement\" to be sure. But they already ran many. But maybe the word \"settlement\" appears in a line but the regex didn't match due to formatting? For example, \"settlement\" may be hyphenated or multi-line. But improbable. But we can search again for \"settle\" or \"settlement\" with IGNORECASE. Already did. But perhaps the settlement date might be in the form of \"settlement date\" or \"settled on...\" But the regex \"settle\" would catch \"settlement\", \"settle\", \"settling\". So likely none.\n\nWe also might search for \"dismissed\" or \"dismissal\" but not relevant.\n\nHowever, the instruction: \"Do not include any date once the settlement (in whole or in part) is incorporated into a judgment or order.\" In this case, it's dismissed without prejudice. So no settlement.\n\nThus we can stop. But we need to ensure that the key is fully marked Not Applicable, which it is. The current status shows \"Keys Marked as Not Applicable (1): Date_of_Settlement: Not Applicable (evidence from Docket)\". So all keys are done. So we can stop.\n\nDouble-check: The only key is Date_of_Settlement. It's not empty.
