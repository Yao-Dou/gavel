We have 5 documents. Likely Complaint contains cause of action. Also Motion for Preliminary Injunction might reference causes. Let's search for phrases like \"caused by\" or \"cause of action\" or \"statutory\" etc. But we can search for \"§\" patterns or \"42 U.S.C.\" etc. Use search_document_regex across all documents for patterns like \"42 U.S.C.\" \"§\" \"Title\" \"Section\" \"FTCA\" etc. But might be too broad. Maybe simpler: search for \"cause of action\" or \"statutory\" and \"aggrieved\" etc. The cause of action is defined as legal vehicles: like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"Title II of the ADA\" etc. So we want to extract those.\n\nBetter to search for patterns of statutes: e.g., \"42 U.S.C. §\" or \"U.S.C. §\" or \"Title\" or \"FTCA\" or \"Section\" after a number. Let's use regex: \"42 U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. §\\\\s*\\\\d+\" or \"U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. §\\\\s*\\\\d+\" etc. Also \"Title\\\\s*\\\\d+\\\\s*of\\\\s*the\\\\s*ADA\". Also maybe \"Bivens\". Also \"Ex parte Young\" is doctrine not cause of action. So we should avoid that. But may appear in docs. We only want the cause of action. So we search for patterns like \"42 U.S.C. §\" etc.\n\nMaybe simpler: search for \"§\" and capture preceding statute names. But easier: search for \"42 U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. §\" etc.\n\nWe can run search_document_regex on all documents. Let's call with pattern \"42 U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. §\\\\s*\\\\d+\". Also maybe \"U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. §\\\\s*\\\\d+\" and \"Title II of the ADA\". Let's try separate patterns? The tool allows only one pattern per call. But we can call multiple times. But we need to pick one action. We could search for \"42 U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. §\" to get 42 U.S.C. § 1983 etc. That likely covers many. Also there could be other statutes like \"FTCA\" (Federal Tort Claims Act). That may not have §. But we can search for \"FTCA\". Let's search for \"FTCA\" too. Let's make one call: doc_name=\"all\", pattern \"(42\\\\s+U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. §\\\\s*\\\\d+|FTCA|Title\\\\s*II\\\\s*of\\\\s*the\\\\s*ADA|Bivens)\". Use IGNORECASE.

We already did search_document_regex for patterns. But we need to read documents to extract all distinct causes. We have 5 documents: Opp to motion, Complaint, Docket, Notice, Motion. The search results show matches for 42 USC 3076? Wait pattern matches: 42 U.S.C. §, FTCA, Title II of the ADA, Bivens. The pattern found matches only in the opposition doc. But the complaint likely includes causes. We need to search for causes across all documents.\n\nWe should search for patterns again maybe in all documents. But we already used search_document_regex for that pattern. It found 4 matches in the opposition doc. But likely the complaint contains causes like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. The search may have missed if pattern was limited; but we used pattern for 42 U.S.C. § \\d+. That should find 42 U.S.C § 1983. Maybe the complaint has 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The search might not have returned because the complaint is unvisited. We can search again but with same pattern; but since we have the catalog, we can search in all documents again to ensure find all. But we want to read the complaint to capture all causes. Let's search again across all documents for pattern (42\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*\\d+|FTCA|Title\\s*II\\s*of\\s*the\\s*ADA|Bivens). The search already returned 4 matches, all in opposition doc. That suggests no other doc contains those patterns? But the complaint may have 42 U.S.C. § 1983, but maybe the pattern didn't match because of different formatting like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" with a space after §? We used pattern with \\s* after §, so it should match. Maybe the complaint uses \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" but the search didn't find it because the complaint hasn't been searched? Wait search_document_regex \"search all documents\" should search all. It returned 4 matches in opposition doc only. That implies the complaint did not contain any of those patterns. But maybe the complaint uses \"42 U.S.C. 1983\" not the § symbol. But the pattern only matches the § symbol. So we might need to broaden pattern. But guidelines say use search_document_regex when target is patternable. We might need to search again with expanded pattern to capture \"42 U.S.C. 1983\" etc. Also \"Title II of the ADA\" might appear. So we might want to search for either \"42 U.S.C. §\" or \"42 U.S.C.\" etc.\n\nBut we can also read the Complaint document directly to find causes. Let's just read the Complaint. The complaint likely lists causes with titles like \"Count I: Violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title II.\" etc. So we should read the Complaint.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Complaint, maybe the first portion where causes appear. We need to find all distinct cause of action. We need evidence for each.\n\nWe need to read maybe the first 2000 tokens of Complaint. Let's do read_document with start_token 0, end_token 2000. That should capture the header and claims. We'll use read_document on Complaint.\n\nReturn the snippet, then we will append entries for each cause.

Those matches contain text like \"28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2)\" etc. But we need to extract cause of action. The complaint likely contains cause of action statements. We should read more of the complaint, maybe the part that lists causes of action. The complaint is 5,038 tokens, we have read 0-2000. We need to find cause of action statements, e.g., \"Plaintiff alleges that Americorps violated the Administrative Procedures Act\" etc. Those are causes of action. We need to extract distinct causes of action. Likely: Administrative Procedures Act, Constitution (maybe First Amendment?), False Claims Act? The complaint mentions \"False Claims Act liability\" but that's not a cause of action; it's a threat. The complaint says \"Americorps’ threats violate the Administrative Procedures Act because they are arbitrary and capricious, and they violate the Constitution because they impose imprecise and unauthorized restrictions on federal funding.\" So causes: Administrative Procedures Act, Constitution. Also maybe \"Federal claims act\"? But not. The complaint also may have \"Section 1331\" subject matter, but that's jurisdiction.

We have read the Complaint fully. We saw some references to statutory causes: 28 U.S.C. § 1331; 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (Administrative Procedure Act); U.S. Const. Art. I Sec 8 (Spending Clause). Also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) is the cause. Also 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is subject matter jurisdiction cause. Also 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) is venue cause. But the checklist definition: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens).\" So we need cause of action items like \"Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A))\" and \"Spending Clause (U.S. Const. Art. I Sec. 8)\" and \"28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction)\". Also \"28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)\" is venue, maybe not cause. The complaint claims violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and Spending Clause. These are the causes. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1983? Not present. Also Title II of ADA? Not present.\n\nAlso from other documents maybe other causes: The Opposition may contain claims of 28 U.S.C. § 1331, etc. But we have already seen from Complaint.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values of Cause_of_Action found in any document. So need to search all documents. We have partially visited Opposition. It might contain similar causes. Should search for \"5 U.S.C. §\" and \"U.S. Const.\" etc. But we already have from Complaint. But maybe other documents contain other causes like \"FTCA\", \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. So we should search across all documents for patterns.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex with pattern matching \"5\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\.\\s*§\\s*\\d+\" and \"U\\.S\\.C\\.\\s*§\" and \"U\\.S\\.C\\.\\s*(\\d+\\s*§\\s*\\d+)\" but we want distinct causes. Use regex to capture \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\" etc. Also \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\" and \"28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)\". Also \"U.S. Const. Art. I Sec. 8\".\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. Let's search across all documents for \"U.S.C.\" patterns. Use search_document_regex on \"all\" with pattern \"U\\.S\\.C\\.\\s*§\\s*[\\d\\s\\(\\)\\.\\w]+\".\n\nAlso maybe for \"U.S. Const.\" pattern \"U\\.S\\.C\\.? Const\\.?\". Let's search separately.\n\nAlso for \"Title II of the ADA\" pattern \"Title\\s*II\\s*of\\s*the\\s*ADA\".\n\nAlso for \"FTCA\" pattern \"FTCA\".\n\nWe will start with search_document_regex on all documents for the U.S.C. § pattern. Then review. Then we can append to checklist.\n\nWe need to capture each distinct cause. Must include evidence snippet, document name, location (page and maybe token offset). We'll approximate location with page number if provided. In the complaint, we saw \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\" at line 8 in Complaint. So location: \"Complaint, Page 8\".\n\nAlso \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\" at line 38. So \"Complaint, Page 11\" maybe. Actually line 38 appears in page 11 maybe. But we can approximate.\n\nAlso \"U.S. Const. Art. I Sec. 8\" at line 44? Actually \"U.S. Const. Art. I Sec. 8\" appears in page 12? Let's verify: In the Complaint, line 44: \"Count Two: Violation of The Spending Clause (U.S. Const., Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 1)\". So that's page maybe 12. Location: \"Complaint, Page 12\".\n\nAlso \"28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)\" appears earlier. We should include? The definition says \"legal vehicles used to bring the claims\" - venue is not a cause. So maybe not include 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). The cause is the subject matter jurisdiction. So include 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n\nAlso \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\" appears at line 8. That is a cause.\n\nAlso \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\" is a cause.\n\nAlso \"U.S. Const. Art. I Sec. 8\" is a cause.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" none. \"FTCA\" none.\n\nAlso \"Title II of the ADA\" none.\n\nThus we have 3 distinct causes.\n\nBut we should verify if any other documents mention these causes. The Opposition likely repeats. But we might find other causes like \"Administrative Procedure Act\" also. But that's the same cause. So we can just capture unique entries.\n\nWe need to capture evidence snippet with exact text. For each cause, we need snippet containing the exact citation.\n\nFrom Complaint: For \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\", snippet: \"28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this Action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" That appears at line 8. Provide snippet.\n\nFor \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\", snippet: \"Count One: Violation of The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A))\". That's line 38.\n\nFor \"U.S. Const. Art. I Sec. 8\", snippet: \"Count Two: Violation of The Spending Clause (U.S. Const., Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 1)\". That line 44-45.\n\nLet's capture these.\n\nWe need to search to get token context. But we already read the Complaint. We can use append_checklist with evidence. But we should include evidence location: maybe \"Complaint, Page 8\", \"Complaint, Page 11\", \"Complaint, Page 12\" or based on tokens. We can approximate.\n\nBetter to use search_document_regex to get exact context so we can cite. But we already have snippet. It's fine.\n\nWe should call append_checklist with patch containing key \"Cause_of_Action\" and extracted entries. Use evidence arrays with text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe should not set Not Applicable.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Cause_of_Action\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this Action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 8\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Count One: Violation of The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A))\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 11\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"U.S. Const.

For example, maybe the Opposition or Motion has other causes like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. The search pattern earlier didn't find such.

There might be also \"28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)\" for venue. But that is procedural, not cause of action. The requirement is to extract legal vehicles used to bring the claims, i.e., statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action. Venue statutes are not causes of action. 28 U.S.C. § 1391 is about venue, not a cause of action.\n\nAlso \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\" is subject matter jurisdiction, not a cause of action.

The instruction says: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action\". 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is a statute that creates a federal question cause of action? Actually 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is the \"federal question jurisdiction\" statute; it establishes that a federal court has jurisdiction over cases arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States. It is indeed a cause of action for federal question claims. So including that is correct.\n\n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) is the Administrative Procedure Act, also a cause of action.\n\nU.S. Const. Art. I Sec. 8 is a clause of the Constitution, used as a cause of action? It is used as a cause of action for spending clause claims.\n\nThus we might have all. But we should check if there are other cause of action references in the other documents. Let's search for \"42 U.S.C.\" or \"FTC\" etc. The search earlier looked for pattern including 42 U.S.C. § \\d+. We didn't see matches in the returned matches list. But maybe the matches were truncated. Let's run a search again for \"42 U.S.C.\" across all documents. But as we are ChatGPT, we can only issue function calls. We should call search_document_regex with pattern \"42\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*\\d+\" across all docs. That might return matches. Alternatively pattern \"42\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\. §\" etc.\n\nAlso maybe the Opposition contains \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. But we didn't see that in the earlier search because pattern included 42 U.S.C. §\\d+. The search earlier found 9 total matches, but no 42 U.S.C. pattern appears in the matches list. So likely no 42 U.S.C. references.\n\nAlso maybe \"FTCA\" or \"Bivens\". But search didn't find those. So likely no.\n\nBut we should still search for \"U\\.S\\.Const\\. Art\\. I Sec\\. 8\" etc. But we already captured that.\n\nBut maybe \"28 U.S.C. § 1391\" appears but not cause of action; but we should not include.\n\nThus we may have all.\n\nBut we need to confirm if any other cause of action exists in other documents. For example, the Opposition might have a cause of action for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"Title II of the ADA\". Let's search for \"ADA\" or \"Title II\". We'll search for \"Title\\s*II\\s*of\\s*the\\s*ADA\" across all docs. Also \"42\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*\\d+\" again.\n\nLet's perform a search.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n  \"pattern\": \"(42\\\\s+U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. §\\\\s*\\\\d+|Title\\\\s*II\\\\s*of\\\\s*the\\\\s*ADA)\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 5,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(42\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*\\d+|Title\\s*II\\s*of\\s*the\\s*ADA)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10897, "completion_tokens": 1017, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

I Sec. 8, etc. But maybe other causes: 28 U.S.C. § 1331 appears only in Complaint. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) appears only in Complaint. U.S. Const. Art. I Sec. 8 appears only in Complaint. The other documents might not contain other causes. But we might need to confirm if there's any other cause e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983 or Title II ADA etc. The search didn't find those. But the earlier search step 7 pattern included 42 U.S.C. § \\d+ and Title II ADA etc. It found 28,5, U.S. Const. etc. No 42 U.S.C. matches.

The question: we need to ensure that we haven't missed any cause of action. Check the partial coverage of Opposition and Motion: we haven't fully read them. But search didn't find any pattern for cause of action in those documents? The search patterns didn't find 28 U.S.C. § 1331 matches? It found matches for 28 U.S.C. § 1331 in Complaint only. So no other matches.\n\nThus we likely have all causes of action.\n\nBut we need to double-check if there are other potential causes in the Opposition or Motion; maybe they mention \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"Title II of the ADA\" etc. The search pattern didn't find.

We have extracted 3 values from Complaint. But there may be more causes of action in other documents: Opposition, Motion, etc. The prior steps searched for patterns but didn't extract new values. We need to ensure no other documents contain additional causes of action. The search results show patterns in Opposition and Motion but likely not cause of action references. We might need to check if other documents contain other causes of action. The docket and dismissal may not contain cause of action. The Opposition might have other cause of action references like 28 U.S.C. § 1331, etc. We should search the Opp docs for 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), etc. We saw that Complaint had those. The Opp might also mention 28 U.S.C. § 1331 etc. But we need to confirm no new ones.\n\nCheck Opp doc for 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Search. Also for 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Also for U.S. Const. Art. I Sec. 8. Also for 28 U.S.C. § 1346? In Opp we saw 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2). That is a cause of action? That is under Tucker Act? 28 U.S.C. § 1346 is about statute of limitations? Actually 28 U.S.C. § 1346 deals with claims arising under treaties? Wait 28 U.S.C. § 1346 is about \"Claims against the United States\" maybe under the Tucker Act? But it's not a cause of action? It might be a source of jurisdiction: \"Claims against the United States arising under the Tucker Act\". But it's not a cause of action per se? We need to interpret \"cause of action\" as the legal vehicle used to bring claims. 28 U.S.C. § 1346 is a cause of action? It's a statute that creates a cause of action under the Tucker Act, yes. But maybe the Opp uses it. We need to check if that is in the Opp. There is a snippet: \"28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2).\" But we need to confirm if it's a cause of action in the context of the case. Likely it's a cause of action: \"claims under the Tucker Act\" is a cause of action. But the snippet may just be referencing that the grant is considered contract under Tucker Act. Might not be cause of action. But we can include it if it's a cause of action used.\n\nAlso 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) mentioned as venue. Not cause of action.\n\nAlso 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) appears in Complaint only. Also 42 U.S.C. § maybe not present.\n\nThus we need to search Opp doc for cause of action references beyond those in Complaint. Let's search for \"§ 1331\" and \"§ 706\" and \"§ 1346\" and \"U.S. Const.\" in Opp doc. Also maybe \"28 U.S.C.\" pattern. Use search_document_regex on that doc. Then read relevant windows.\n\nAlso check Motion doc for cause of action references; maybe none.\n\nAlso Docket and Notice of Voluntary Dismissal probably not.\n\nThus next step: search Opp doc for 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. Art. I Sec. 8, 28 U.S.C. § 1346. Use regex pattern. Let's do search_document_regex on doc \"Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction\".

We have partially visited other documents: Defendants’ Opposition and Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Also Notice of Voluntary Dismissal and Docket may contain causes. Let's consider: The cause of action is legal vehicles like 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 5 U.S.C. § 706, maybe 28 U.S.C. § 1346, maybe 42 U.S.C. § something, Title II of ADA, etc. The Complaint already had 3 values: 28 U.S.C. § 1331; 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); maybe 42 U.S.C. §? Actually Complaint may contain only those. But the Defendants’ Opposition may contain additional cause. Searching earlier found matches for 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), 28 U.S.C. § 1346. So we need to extract those as distinct values. The search results show matches in Defendants’ Opposition. We need to read the relevant token ranges to confirm the exact citations. Also the Motion may have 28 U.S.C. § 1346. Let's read those ranges.\n\nWe need to read Defendants’ Opposition tokens 2854-3307, 10659-10859. Those ranges already visited partially? The catalog shows viewed tokens: 2854-3307, 10659-10859. So we have already read those token ranges? The read_document earlier was for Complaint. The Defendants’ Opposition hasn't been fully read. The search results gave matches. We need to read those ranges to extract citations. We need to confirm the exact citations: 28 U.S.C. § 1331; 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1); 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); 28 U.S.C. § 1346.\n\nAlso Motion for Preliminary Injunction has at least 28 U.S.C. § 1346. We need to read that token range too.\n\nThus we need to perform read_document on Defendants’ Opposition tokens 2854-3307 and maybe also 10659-10859. But we may already have those? We saw \"Viewed tokens: 2854-3307, 10659-10859 (4% coverage)\". That indicates we have read those token ranges before? Actually reading earlier steps: Step 7 search_document_regex found matches in Defendants’ Opposition in those token ranges. But we didn't read them. The search only gives context. We need to read to get exact citations.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Defendants’ Opposition tokens 2854-3307. Also read 10659-10859. And also read Motion for Preliminary Injunction tokens 5564-5764? But that was read earlier. But maybe still need to confirm 28 U.S.C. § 1346. The search earlier found it in Defendants’ Opposition tokens 10659-10859. We need to read that.\n\nWe also might need to read Notice of Voluntary Dismissal for any cause citations. But likely none.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Defendants’ Opposition tokens 2854-3307. Then read 10659-10859. Let's do them in separate calls? We can batch? We can do one read per call. We should do one. Since we have to choose exactly one action. We could read one range first, then next. So pick read_document on Defendants’ Opposition tokens 2854-3307.\n\nWe'll do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\"start_token\":2854,\"end_token\":3307}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "start_token": 2854, "end_token": 3307}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7661, "completion_tokens": 832, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to extract all distinct causes across all documents. We have not yet extracted from other documents. The previous search and read only got 3 values from Complaint. Need to search other documents for causes: 28 USC § 1346, 5 USC § etc. The search step 11 did find matches in the Opposition. We need to extract those cause(s). Also from Motion for preliminary injunction etc. We need to find all distinct cause of action occurrences.\n\nLet's examine the matches: In step 11, the search pattern included 28 USC §, 5 USC §, U.S. Const. Art I Sec 8, 28 USC § 1346. The matches are in the Opposition, but the snippet didn't show the specific legal references. Need to read those matched contexts. We saw one match at tokens 2854-3307 read. That snippet didn't show the 28 USC § 1346 etc. It only had text about grant. The 28 USC § 1346 reference might be earlier. The search result earlier step 8 match 4 had 28 USC § 1346 in tokens 10659-10859. That snippet had 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2). So we need to extract that cause.\n\nAlso other matches in the opposition may include 5 USC § etc. Let's search again for those patterns, maybe we need to read those sections.\n\nWe already have the search step 8 results: 4 matches in the Opposition. The 1st 3 matches are not relevant cause of action—they are about diversity. The 4th match includes 28 USC § 1346(a)(2). That is a cause of action: 28 USC § 1346.\n\nAlso the search step 11 had 5 matches in the Opposition. The snippet didn't include the actual legal references. We need to read the region around those matches to capture the legal references. The first match tokens 2854-3054, second 2890-3090, etc. These were similar text about the grant. The 5 matches maybe not contain legal references. But maybe the 5th match could include 5 USC § etc. We need to confirm.\n\nAlso there might be cause of action in the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The earlier step 7 search found 1 match in that motion. We didn't read that. We need to read that region.\n\nAlso maybe the Docket or Notice of Voluntary Dismissal may have cause of action? Likely not.\n\nThus we should perform search_document_regex on the remaining unvisited documents for pattern: \"(28\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*\\d+|5\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*\\d+|U\\.S\\.Const\\. Art\\. I Sec\\. 8|28\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*1346)\" to capture. But we have already used that pattern. But we didn't read those matches in Opposition. So we need to read those sections.\n\nWe should read from tokens 10659-10859 in Opposition to capture 28 USC § 1346. We already have that snippet from step 8. But not extracted. We need to append to checklist.\n\nAlso we need to read the region where 5 USC § appears. Where? We hadn't seen.\n\nLet's search again specifically for \"5\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*\\d+\" in Opposition to find where. Also maybe in Motion.\n\nLet's call search_document_regex on Opposition with that pattern.\n\nAlso we might need to read the Motion for Preliminary Injunction snippet. Search step 7 found 1 match in that motion. We need to read that. The match likely contains a legal reference maybe 28 USC § 1346 or such. Let's search again that motion. Or read the region around 5564-5764 which was already read but didn't show. That snippet didn't show legal references. But maybe earlier tokens 5000-5564 contain. We need to search the motion file for 28 USC § etc.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(28\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*\\d+|5\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*\\d+|U\\.S\\.Const\\. Art\\. I Sec\\. 8|28\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*1346)\" but limiting to documents not fully visited: Opposition and Motion. We can just search all; it will search others too but that's okay.\n\nWe should also include maybe 42 USC etc? But those were in Complaint already. So we need to add new ones.\n\nThus action: search_document_regex on all documents. But we might do targeted: doc_names=[\"Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\"].

The current status says 1/1 key filled. But the goal may be to ensure all documents are searched for any other cause of action. The summary says \"All unique Cause_of_Action values extracted from the corpus and no other documents contain additional causes of action.\" That was step 9. But that was a stop? They marked stop. However, they didn't append the values? They did in step 6. So we have 3 values. Are there any other documents that might contain other causes? We saw search earlier in Step 11 and 13 found many matches but those matches were not legal causes but garbled text. The search regex for 28 U.S.C. § etc returned matches in the opposition, but those matches didn't show actual statutory references? Actually the matches from step 11 were just a chunk of text about grant, not legal citations. So maybe there are other causes of action in the opposition? Let's check. The opposition likely contains cause of action like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. But the search didn't capture them? The search pattern included 28 U.S.C. § etc. But maybe the opposition references 28 U.S.C. § 1346 etc. But the search results didn't show that. Perhaps the opposition didn't include other causes of action. The complaint has 3 causes of action. According to the previous steps, they think the cause of action extraction is complete.\n\nBut the current status indicates 1/1 filled, 0 empty, 0 not applicable, 3 values extracted. So we might stop. But we should double-check that all documents have been fully visited for causes of action. The complaint was fully visited. The other documents have only partial coverage. But the search regex earlier found no relevant matches. However, it's possible that cause of action references might exist in the other documents but were not captured by the regex. But the regex was broad enough? It included 28 U.S.C. § etc, 5 U.S.C. § etc, U.S. Const Art I Sec 8, 42 U.S.C. § etc, Title II of ADA, FTCA, Bivens. The search didn't find matches in opposition. But maybe the opposition references 28 U.S.C. § 1346 etc but the regex didn't catch due to formatting? But the search pattern included 28\\s+U\\.S\\.C\\. §\\s*1346; but tokens show 28 U.S.C. § 1346 might be a formatting like \"28 U.S.C. § 1346\" which is captured. So no matches.\n\nThus likely no further causes of action beyond those three in complaint.\n\nThus we can stop. However, the instructions say: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either: Complete: all relevant values present; Not Applicable.\" We have 1 key: Cause_of_Action. We have 3 values extracted. Could there be more? The complaint had 3. The other documents likely didn't have any. As per earlier step 9, they concluded all unique values extracted. So we can stop.\n\nBut we should check if we need to update the checklist for any value? The append was done earlier.
