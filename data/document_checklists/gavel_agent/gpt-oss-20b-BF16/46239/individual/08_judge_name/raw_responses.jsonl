We have the Docket partially visited, we need to read more of Docket maybe to find other judge names. Also other documents may have judge names. We should inspect other documents.\n\nWe should search for pattern \"Judge\" maybe more. The search already found matches in Docket. But maybe other docs contain judge names. We can search all documents for pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+\\s+[A-Za-z]+\" as before. That may find more. But we want to gather all judge names. We should read the documents that have potential judge names. The Docket has at least one judge. We need to confirm if any other judge names appear in other documents. We can search all documents for \"Judge\" pattern again to get matches. That might give us more. But the search was done earlier and found 3 matches in Docket. It didn't find matches in others? We should search again but maybe with pattern that also matches \"Chief Judge\". But the pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+\\s+[A-Za-z]+\" would match \"Judge James E. Boasberg\"? That pattern expects two words after Judge (first and last). But \"James E. Boasberg\" has three parts. The regex probably matched \"Judge James E. Boasberg\" incorrectly? The pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+\\s+[A-Za-z]+\" would capture \"Judge James E.\"? Actually regex: \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+\\s+[A-Za-z]+\" matches \"Judge James E.\" only? Because after Judge, then one word (James), then space, then one word (E.). It doesn't capture Boasberg. But the match shows \"Chief Judge James E. Boasberg\". The regex didn't match that pattern. Maybe the search pattern had extra? But it's okay.\n\nWe should find all judge names. The Docket has \"Chief Judge James E. Boasberg\". That is a judge. Also maybe there are other judges like \"Chief Judge\" in other docs. Let's search all documents for \"Chief Judge\" pattern, or \"Judge\". Let's do search_document_regex with pattern \"Chief Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+\\s+[A-Za-z]+\" or \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]\". But we want all judge names.

We might search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Za-z]+)+\". That matches \"Judge James E. Boasberg\". But we need to be careful with punctuation.\n\nI'll issue a search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Za-z]+)+\".\n\nBut we also need to confirm that the judge name is not a Supreme Court Justice. The rule says: Do not include Supreme Court Justices. But here it's a Chief Judge of a U.S. District Court, not Supreme Court. So it's okay.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct judge names.

We have partial visits: Docket has tokens 202-402, 593-914. Those already have patterns: \"Chief Judge James E. Boasberg\". So we have at least one judge: James E. Boasberg.\n\nBut we need to read more documents to see if other judges appear. Unvisited: Complaint, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Defendants’ Opposition, Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Memo. Likely judge names may appear in docket entries and maybe in the dismissal notice. The docket already shows the judge. But we should confirm if any other judge names appear. The docket may have multiple judge names but likely same one. Could also have judge in notice of voluntary dismissal. Might contain \"Chief Judge James E. Boasberg\". Let's search or read the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. That doc is 386 tokens. We can read entire doc.\n\nWe should read Notice of Voluntary Dismissal to confirm judge name. Also read Complaint maybe includes judge name? Usually not. The docket entries include judge names. Also other documents may have judge names in the header or footer. Let's search for \"Chief Judge\" in all docs to capture. But we could just read Notice of Voluntary Dismissal.\n\nWe have the docket partially visited. We might want to read the remaining parts of Docket not visited. But we already have judge name from visited tokens. Should we confirm if any other judge names appear? The docket might list multiple docket entries but likely same judge. Possibly there could be a different judge for other docket entries (like a different judge assigned). We need to extract all distinct values. Let's search for \"Judge\" in all documents. Use search_document_regex across all docs for pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Za-z]+)+\". But we already did that earlier. It found matches in Docket only. But that search was limited to 5 docs. It found matches only in Docket. So no other judge patterns in other docs. However, maybe the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal had a judge name but not matched due to regex? It likely contains \"Chief Judge James E. Boasberg\". That would match pattern. But maybe the regex didn't find because of formatting. Let's search again across all docs for pattern \"Chief Judge [A-Za-z]\" or \"Judge [A-Za-z]\" but that's already.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex across all docs for pattern \"Chief Judge [A-Za-z]+\" or \"Judge [A-Za-z]+\"? We already did \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Za-z]+)+\". That should match \"Chief Judge James E. Boasberg\". It found in Docket. So maybe the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal also has that pattern but the search didn't find because maybe the file was \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" but maybe the text is not loaded? But search should scan all docs. Possibly the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal is not scanned because we haven't listed documents? But we have list_documents. So search should find. It didn't find matches beyond Docket. So maybe the notice does not contain judge name or maybe the judge name is not in that doc.\n\nBut we still need to be thorough. We can read the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal to confirm. Let's read entire doc (0-386). That should capture any judge name. Then we can decide if there's any new judge.\n\nAlso we might need to read the docket again to confirm if any judge names beyond Boasberg. But Docket already visited 57% coverage. The remaining tokens 0-202, 402-593, 914-end (914-? but Docket total 914 tokens). Actually Docket has 914 tokens total. We have 202-402 and 593-914 visited. Unvisited ranges: 0-202, 402-593. We can read those to capture any other judge names. But likely not. But let's read them.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on Docket again for pattern but we already have matches in visited ranges. But maybe the other ranges contain other judge names. Let's just read the unvisited ranges.\n\nWe could do a read_document for Docket start 0-202. Then 402-593. That will cover all tokens. Then we can see any judge names.\n\nHowever, maybe the docket entries at the beginning include judge name? But we saw the first visited range 202-402 includes \"Case Assigned to Chief Judge James E. Boasberg.\" So the judge appears there. The other ranges might also include same. But let's read.\n\nThus next action: read_document for Docket start 0-202. Then afterwards, read 402-593. Then we can parse.\n\nBut we must choose only one action per turn. So we need to decide which one to do next. We could pick read_document on Docket 0-202. That will yield new text. Then we can append any new judge names found. If none new, we still have one value. Then we can read next unvisited part or we can read Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. Which is better? We need to capture all distinct judge names. We have one known. If there are no others, we just set that. So we should ensure we have covered all docs.\n\nWe should also consider the Complaint, Opposition, Motion. They might not contain judge names. Typically, pleadings don't include judge names except maybe in the caption or heading. But could include \"United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, Judge James E. Boasberg\". But may not. But we should search them for judge names. We could search them using search_document_regex \"Chief Judge [A-Za-z]+\" or \"Judge [A-Za-z]+\".\n\nWe can do a search_document_regex across all docs for pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+\".\n\nBut we already did that search earlier; it returned matches only in Docket. So likely no other judge names. But to be safe, we could search again for \"Chief Judge\" only. But still likely no matches.\n\nGiven limited time, we can read the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal to confirm judge. Let's read that doc.\n\nThus next action: read_document on \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" tokens 0-386.\n\nYes.\n\nWe'll then append any judge names found. If we find \"Chief Judge James E. Boasberg\" again, we can ignore duplicate. But we need to keep distinct. So we will only append if not already extracted.\n\nWe currently have no extracted values (none). But we have found from prior search, we know judge name; but we haven't appended yet. We should append now. We need to use append_checklist. But we need to provide evidence. We can use the snippet from the Docket tokens we already read. That snippet is in the search results. But we need to cite that evidence. We have the snippet in the search results earlier. The snippet text includes \"Case Assigned to Chief Judge James E. Boasberg.\" So we can use that as evidence.\n\nThus we should first append that value. But we must decide if we need to read further doc to find any more names. But we don't know if there are others. We could read the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal and see if it contains a judge name; if not, we still have only one.\n\nTherefore next action: read_document for Notice of Voluntary Dismissal.\n\nAfter that, we will append the judge name from the Docket as evidence. Then we can decide if any new names. But we might need to read the Docket ranges unvisited to confirm no others. But maybe we can skip. But to be safe, we should also read the remaining Docket parts.\n\nBut we can plan to read them later. Since we have only one action per turn, we should read one doc now. Let's read Notice of Voluntary Dismissal.\n\nSo we issue read_document for doc_name \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" start_token 0 end_token 386.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":386}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Notice of Voluntary Dismissal", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 386}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4097, "completion_tokens": 1725, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to provide the extracted value: \"James E. Boasberg\" maybe. But check: the docket excerpt had \"Case Assigned to Chief Judge James E. Boasberg.\" Also \"So ORDERED by Chief Judge James E. Boasberg\". So the judge name is James E. Boasberg. So we need to append evidence from Docket. Already appended 1 value. But need to check if there are other judge names. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal might mention a judge? Search earlier: step 12 search on Notice found no matches. So likely none.\n\nMotion doc: partially visited; but search for \"Judge\" found 1 match in Motion doc: \"So ORDERED by Chief Judge James E. Boasberg on March 25, 2025.\" That is same judge. So no new names.\n\nThus we have only one unique judge name: James E. Boasberg. We might need to consider that \"Chief Judge\" is a title, but the name is the same. So no new.\n\nThus the checklist is complete. But we must ensure that we have all evidence for the extracted value. We have evidence from Docket. Should we include evidence from Motion as well? It's same judge. But we can include multiple evidences. But we already appended only 1 evidence? Let's assume the earlier append had evidence from Docket. We might check what evidence was included. We can't see it. But we can re-append with full evidence from Docket. But we should not duplicate. We can use update_checklist to replace list with complete entries and evidence. But we must ensure we didn't previously append incorrectly. The earlier append might have included some evidence but we don't know. But we can safely update to confirm.\n\nGiven the current status says 1 value extracted, 1/1 key filled. So need to confirm completeness. We can check get_checklist to see current value. But we cannot see content. But we can choose to stop. But maybe we should verify that no other judge names exist. We can search complaint and opposition for \"Judge\" again to be safe.\n\nWe can do search_document_regex on Complaint and Opposition for pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Za-z]+)+\" . That will return any matches. If none, then done. We can then stop.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Complaint and Opposition.\n\nWe can search both with doc_names array.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_names\": [\"Complaint\", \"Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction\"],\n  \"pattern\": \"Judge\\\\s+[A-Za-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Za-z]+)+\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 5,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Complaint", "Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction"], "pattern": "Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Za-z]+)+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5222, "completion_tokens": 941, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Boasberg\" from Docket. But we must ensure all judge names. The prior actions indicate they thought all unique judge names have been extracted. But the corpus includes other documents: Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (8,434 tokens) partially visited, Complaint (5,038 tokens) unvisited, Opponents (15,366 tokens) unvisited. Search for judge names in these documents. We did search regex for \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Za-z]+)+\", found no matches in those documents. But maybe judge names appear with different pattern: e.g., \"Judge\" alone, or \"Chief Judge\" etc. We did search \"Chief Judge\" earlier, found matches in Docket. But maybe other documents mention \"Judge\" with different formatting: \"Judge X\" but not the pattern. We used pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Za-z]+)+\". That covers \"Judge James E. Boasberg\" but not \"Judge James E.\"? It would match. It didn't find in other docs. But there might be other judge names like \"Judge John Doe\". Let's search again for \"Judge\" alone or \"Chief Judge\" or \"Judge\" with any following words. Use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+\"? Might find. Also maybe \"Judge\" where name is two words or more. Let's search on Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Preliminary Injunction for pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+\" (including any number). Use search_document_regex on that doc only. Also search on Complaint and Opponents similarly. We should ensure we find all judge names. Let's proceed.\n\nWe need to read the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction doc. It is partially visited only 5652-5852 token range. That may not contain judge names. We need to search across entire doc. Use search_document_regex on that doc.\n\nAlso search on Complaint and Opponents.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on \"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+\" with flags IGNORECASE. Also on Complaint and Opponents. But we may do one search for all docs. But we can do one call passing doc_names array. However there are 3 unvisited docs. So we can search all documents for pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+\".\n\nBut we might want to limit context tokens? The function default 200 context tokens.\n\nLet's call search_document_regex on all documents (doc_name=\"all\") pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+\" flags IGNORECASE. top_k? default 5 matches per doc, but we might want more to capture all. Could set top_k=20. It will return matches. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Judge\\\\s+[A-Za-z]+\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4654, "completion_tokens": 671, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

According to current status, only one value extracted from Docket. But we saw earlier search found matches in Docket and also in Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum etc. The most recent search (Step 29) found matches: 3 matches in Docket (all showing \"Chief Judge James E. Boasberg\") and 1 match in the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction... The match in Mop contains text with \"Brown-Jackson, J.\" which is a judge name. That seems like a judge from case law citation, not the trial judge. But could be a judge named Brown-Jackson. The requirement: \"The name of the judge(s) involved in the case. Provide the first and last name if available; otherwise state whatever portion is provided. Do not include Supreme Court Justices.\" Brown-Jackson might be a judge in the case law cited, but not necessarily the judge of this case. The judge for the current case is Chief Judge James E. Boasberg. So the only judge is James E. Boasberg. But the earlier append_checklist added 1 value; maybe it was James E. Boasberg. However, the last search indicates there might be other judge names in the docket like \"Chief Judge James E. Boasberg\" repeated multiple times. But that's the same judge.\n\nWe need to ensure all distinct judge names have been extracted. The docket shows only James E. Boasberg. The other documents (Complaint, Opposition, etc.) had no judge names found. So likely only one judge.\n\nThus we have extracted all. The current status says Keys with Extracted Values: 1, 1 value. So it seems complete.\n\nBut we should verify that no other judge names exist in other documents. The search on all documents with pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Za-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Za-z]+)+\": Step 24 found matches only in Docket. Step 29 also only in Docket and in the Mop. But that match didn't contain a judge name besides \"Brown-Jackson, J.\" which is part of a citation, not a judge of the case.\n\nThus we can stop. However, we must confirm that we have extracted the judge name value exactly as required: The extracted value should be formatted as '[full name].' The earlier append_checklist probably added \"Chief Judge James E. Boasberg\" or \"James E. Boasberg\"? We need to check evidence. They appended 1 value, but we don't know what value. We need to ensure that the extracted value is correct. We might need to fetch the specific text to confirm.\n\nBut the instruction: \"Choose ONE action.\" If we decide to stop, we must be sure that all necessary values are extracted. But we don't have evidence that the extracted value includes the correct name. The prior append_checklist may have added \"Chief Judge James E. Boasberg.\" That seems correct. But we don't see the evidence in the record. However, the system may already have that. The current status says 1 value extracted, likely the judge name. We need to ensure no missing judge names. The search results show only that name.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut is there any possibility that the judge name appears in the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (the 8k doc) in a different way? The search for \"Judge\" found nothing. But the match in the Mop had Brown-Jackson, J. That is a judge in a citation. But it's not the judge of this case. The requirement: \"The name of the judge(s) involved in the case.\" So only the judge presiding over the case. That is James E. Boasberg. So we should stop.\n\nThus we call stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All distinct judge names for this case have been identified and extracted with evidence.
