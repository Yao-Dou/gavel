We have seen some orders in Docket: one minute order says case dismissed without prejudice. Also minute order lists some orders: defendant file opposition, plaintiff file reply, parties appear hearing. But these are orders, but not decrees? \"decree\" terms may refer to court orders. But the checklist item: significant terms of decrees: substantive obligations ordered by court, including consent decrees, stipulated judgments/injunctions as court orders. So any court order that imposes obligations. We have the minute order: \"Defendants shall file their Opposition ...; Plaintiff shall file its Reply ...; parties shall appear ...\". These are obligations. Also the dismissal without prejudice order is also a court order, but does it impose obligations? Dismissal without prejudice mostly ends the case; maybe no obligations. So we may include that as a term: case dismissed without prejudice. But is that substantive obligation? It's a decree that the case is dismissed; that is a key term. We should extract that.\n\nAlso other documents likely contain orders: e.g., \"Text of Proposed Order\" in motion. But we haven't read those. We should search for \"MINUTE ORDER:\" and \"ORDERS\" in other documents. But we have seen minute order in Docket. We could extract the obligations.\n\nWe need to read the text around match 1 in Docket (tokens 490-690). That snippet shows the minute order. We saw it in step 11. We need to read that range fully. The snippet we saw is partial; we need full context. Use read_document on Docket tokens 480-700 to capture full minute order text. Then we can extract obligations. Also maybe other orders exist elsewhere. Let's search for \"ORDER\" or \"ORDERS\" in all documents again but maybe focusing on \"MINUTE ORDER:\" or \"ORDER:\".\n\nBut step 8 found match for \"Text of Proposed Order\" in Docket. That might include the full proposed order text, which might contain obligations. But we didn't read it fully. Step 4 read 400-700 tokens. That probably includes some of it. We need to see the \"Text of Proposed Order\" content. Let's search for \"Text of Proposed Order\" again but maybe get context. Use search_document_regex on Docket with pattern \"Text of Proposed Order\" - we already did step 8 and found match at tokens 427-627. That snippet shows the header but not actual order content. Might need to read beyond. So read Docket tokens 627-800 to capture the order text. Let's do that.\n\nAlso we should search for \"ORDER:\" or \"ORDERS\" in other documents: Complaint, Defendants’ Opposition, Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Might be many matches. But we need all distinct terms. We might extract obligations from each order. But maybe there are only few.\n\nGiven time, let's search all documents for \"MINUTE ORDER:\" to get other orders. Use search_document_regex on all docs with pattern \"(?i)MINUTE ORDER:\" to catch all. Also search for \"ORDER:\" maybe.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on all docs for \"(?i)MINUTE ORDER:\" to capture all minute orders. Then we can read each matched region. But we might get many. But we only need obligations. We can read each region.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"ORDERS\" maybe too broad. Let's search for \"ORDER\" as a separate word.\n\nGiven we have limited time, we can start with reading Docket tokens 627-800 to capture the \"Text of Proposed Order\" content. Then search for other minute orders.\n\nLet's do read_document on Docket tokens 627-800.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":627,\"end_token\":800}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 627, "end_token": 800}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4025, "completion_tokens": 801, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Might contain terms. Also we have not yet seen the Complaint or other documents. But we need all distinct decree terms. The question: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders.\" So we need all terms ordered by the court. These terms are likely orders like \"Defendants shall file their Opposition...\" etc. We need to extract each distinct term as separate value. So we need to capture each obligation. Also we saw \"case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\" which is an order. Also \"The parties shall appear for a hearing on the Motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m.\" is an order. And \"Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025\" is an order. \"Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025\" is an order. Also earlier: \"The Court ORDERS that: (1) Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025; (2) Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025; and 3) The parties shall appear for a hearing on the Motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m.\" This is one order with multiple sub-terms. We might treat each sub-term as distinct value. The question: \"Extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So each distinct term. So we need separate entries for each obligation. So we have:\n\n1. Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025.\n2. Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025.\n3. The parties shall appear for a hearing on the Motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m.\n4. The case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n\nAlso maybe earlier: \"The Court ORDERS that the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" That's one term.\n\nWe need evidence for each. We need to read more context to capture the text verbatim. We have seen partial text from Docket. We should read the relevant parts fully. We have tokens 490-690 showing the order. We have tokens 627-800 showing some of it. We may need to read tokens around 490-690 to capture the full order. Also maybe there is an earlier order we haven't captured: \"The Court ORDERS that: (1) Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025; (2) Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025; and 3) The parties shall appear for a hearing on the Motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m.\" That's in Docket. We should read tokens 490-690. But we already read 627-800. Let's read 490-690 again to capture the order fully.\n\nAlso we saw \"The Court ORDERS that the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" That appears in tokens around 700-914. Let's read 700-914 again, but we already have that part. But to capture evidence, we need full sentence. We have the snippet: \"MINUTE ORDER: Per Plaintiff's 8 Notice, the Court ORDERS that the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. So ORDERED by Chief Judge James E. Boasberg on April 14, 2025.\" That is enough.\n\nAlso earlier part: \"The Court ORDERS that: (1) Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025; (2) Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025; and 3) The parties shall appear for a hearing on the Motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m.\" That is in the snippet at 490-690. We need to capture exactly. Let's read tokens 490-690 again. Also we might want to read tokens 490-700 to capture entire order.

We should search for decrees or orders in documents, especially those that are court orders. The docket has a minute order. Also complaint may have some orders? But we need terms of decrees (substantive obligations). The docket's minute order includes deadlines for filing and hearing. Those are terms. Also other documents may have orders: maybe in Defendants’ Opposition? Let's search for \"ORDERS\" pattern again. But we already did. Maybe check for \"The Court ORDERS\" etc. Let's search in all docs for \"The Court ORDERS\" maybe other matches not captured. We'll search for \"The Court ORDERS\". Also \"ORDER\" maybe not captured. Let's search for \"ORDER\" again with flags IGNORECASE etc. But we already did. But maybe we need deeper. Let's do a regex search for \"The Court ORDERS\" in all docs. Also \"COURT ORDERS\". Let's do search_document_regex across all docs for pattern \"(?i)court orders?\" or \"court orders\" etc. But we need to capture the terms. We have a minute order that includes: \"Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025; Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025; The parties shall appear for a hearing on the Motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m.\" Those are obligations. Also there was a dismissal order: \"case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\". That is a decree term: dismissal. So we need to extract those.\n\nAlso maybe there are other orders: The docket shows \"2025-04-14 | .Order AND Terminate Hearings\" unclear. And earlier \"2025-03-25 | Order\" etc. But we need to extract terms of decrees. So we need to find all court orders in documents. Let's search all docs for \"ORDER\" again maybe find \"MINUTE ORDER\" etc. But we could also read the other documents partially visited to see if there are any orders. Let's search only in the \"Defendants’ Opposition...\" for \"ORDER\". We'll call search_document_regex on that doc.\n\nAlso search in \"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" for \"ORDER\" maybe there are orders within the text. The earlier search didn't find \"ORDER\" in that doc? It found 5 matches earlier. But we might need to read those matches. But we already have matches for \"Text of Proposed Order\" which didn't exist. But \"The Court ORDERS\" didn't exist. But we saw earlier \"search_document_regex on Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (pattern: \"(?i)ORDER\") found 5 matches.\" So those matches likely contain \"ORDER\" somewhere. Let's get them. We'll search again but with context maybe 200 tokens. We'll call search_document_regex for that doc with pattern \"ORDER\" again. But we need to ensure we capture the terms. But maybe easier: Use search_document_regex for \"The Court ORDERS\" again across all docs.\n\nWe need to gather all distinct values of terms. We need to extract each term separately. So we need to parse each order.\n\nThus next step: search_document_regex on \"Defendants’ Opposition\" and \"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" for \"ORDER\" maybe \"The Court ORDERS\".

We have seen some orders: Docket minute orders, dismissal without prejudice, etc. We need to find substantive obligations ordered by the court. Terms: e.g., \"Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025; Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025; parties shall appear for a hearing via Zoom on April 25, 2025 at 3:00 p.m.\" That's a court order. Also dismissal without prejudice. Also maybe other orders like \"case is dismissed without prejudice\". Also \"case is dismissed\" is a decree. Also maybe other orders: in the docket, there might be other orders.\n\nWe need to extract each distinct value: each term as separate value. For a decree, each substantive obligation. We need to collect all distinct obligations. So from the minute order: three obligations. We should extract each separately. Also the dismissal is a decree: \"case is dismissed without prejudice.\" That is a term.\n\nWe should also search for any other orders. The search results show 21 matches earlier. But we haven't read other docs where there might be orders, e.g., in the Complaint? The Complaint likely includes allegations, not orders. But maybe the motion includes a proposed order? But we didn't find matches. Maybe in the Defendant's Opposition there are orders? Unlikely.\n\nThus, likely only the minute orders and dismissal.\n\nWe should ensure we capture all obligations. Also we should check if the dismissal is part of the court order: the minute order says \"the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\". That is a term.\n\nWe also need to ensure we capture evidence: text snippet, source_document, location. For each obligation, evidence snippet.\n\nWe need to read the relevant part of Docket to capture all obligations. We have read tokens 490-700 and 627-800, but we might need to read earlier tokens where the dismissal order appears. The dismissal appears in tokens 736-914. We have read that portion partially? In Step 14, we saw the dismissal order between tokens 736-914. But we might need to read that region fully to capture the exact text. We have seen snippet but maybe need to capture full.\n\nWe can call read_document on Docket tokens 736-914 to get the full text. But we already have snippet. But to be thorough, we should read that range.\n\nAlso for the minute order obligations, we have snippet at tokens 490-700. Might need to read to get full text. We can read tokens 490-700 (already read). But we need to ensure we capture the entire obligations list. The snippet shows obligations, but we should include the exact wording.\n\nThus, we should read Docket tokens 490-700 to get precise text. We have that in step 13. But we might want to re-read to confirm offsets. But maybe we can rely on snippet.\n\nWe need to produce append_checklist with multiple entries for the key Significant_Terms_of_Decrees. Each entry: value: the obligation text; evidence: snippet.\n\nLet's extract:\n\nFrom minute order (March 25, 2025):\n\n- \"Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025;\"\n- \"Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025;\"\n- \"The parties shall appear for a hearing on the Motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m.\"\n\nAlso from dismissal order (April 14, 2025):\n\n- \"the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\"\n\nWe should include each as separate extracted value.\n\nAlso check if any other orders exist: earlier in the docket we have \"Order\" lines: e.g., 2025-04-04 \"Memorandum in opposition to re 5 Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" - that's a memorandum, not an order. Also \"Order AND Terminate Hearings\" maybe an order? But not captured in snippet. We could search again for \"(?i)Order AND Terminate Hearings\" but might be an order. But it's likely an order. But maybe we don't have full text. But maybe it's a separate order with a term. But we need to capture all distinct terms of decrees. This includes any order that imposes obligations. The \"Order AND Terminate Hearings\" might be a separate order. It's likely an order that terminates hearings. That is a substantive obligation: \"Terminate Hearings\". We need to capture that too.\n\nBut we don't have the exact text. We could search for that phrase. The search results didn't show. But we saw in step 10 snippet: \"None | 2025-04-14 | .Order AND Terminate Hearings\". That appears to be a docket entry: maybe a separate order. We need to read that entry to capture the text. We can read the Docket tokens around that entry. We have currently viewed tokens 736-914. The snippet includes that. Let's read tokens 736-914 again fully.\n\nWe need to read from 736-914. We can request read_document Docket start 736 end 914. That will give the full text.\n\nWe also might need to read earlier tokens for the \"Order AND Terminate Hearings\" exact words. But we don't have the full content; maybe it's just the docket entry title. But the actual order text may be elsewhere.\n\nBut the docket entry \"Order AND Terminate Hearings\" might not contain the text of the order; it might just be the docket entry. The actual order might be a separate document. But we don't have it.\n\nThus, we might not be able to extract that. We should focus on the minute orders and dismissal.\n\nAlso check for any other orders: the complaint didn't contain orders. The motion didn't have orders. So our list may be just those.\n\nThus, we will append entries for each obligation.\n\nWe need to include evidence: text snippet, source_document \"Docket\", location maybe \"tokens 490-700\" for minute order, and \"tokens 736-914\" for dismissal.\n\nThus, next action: append_checklist with those entries.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025;\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"(1) Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025;\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 490-700\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025;\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"(2) Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025;\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 490-700\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"The parties shall appear for a hearing on the Motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"(3) The parties shall appear for a hearing on the Motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 490-700\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 736-914\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Significant_Terms_of_Decrees", "extracted": [{"value": "Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025;", "evidence": [{"text": "(1) Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025;", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 490-700"}]}, {"value": "Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025;", "evidence": [{"text": "(2) Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025;", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 490-700"}]}, {"value": "The parties shall appear for a hearing on the Motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m.", "evidence": [{"text": "(3) The parties shall appear for a hearing on the Motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m.", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 490-700"}]}, {"value": "the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.", "evidence": [{"text": "the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 736-914"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4713, "completion_tokens": 1709, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The Docket includes a dismissal order; also possibly other orders in the Docket like \"MINUTE ORDER: The Court ORDERS that ...\". We might have other orders in other documents. For example, in the Defendant's Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, likely there is a \"MINUTE ORDER\" or \"The Court ORDERS\" for the preliminary injunction. We partially viewed tokens 0-373, 489-689, 3273-3557. Could contain orders. We should search for \"The Court ORDERS\" within that document. Use search_document_regex on that doc. Also search for \"MINUTE ORDER\" or \"ORDER:\" etc. Also check Notice of Voluntary Dismissal for any order. Also the Complaint might contain a \"Consent Decree\" or \"Judgment\" but likely not. Let's search for pattern \"(?i)The Court ORDERS\" in Defendants’ Opposition. Also maybe search for \"ORDER\" with \"The Court ORDERS\" in Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. Let's do search_document_regex on Defendants’ Opposition for pattern \"(?i)The Court ORDERS\". Also maybe search for \"MINUTE ORDER\" on same.

Let's find the specific matches: Step 6 found 5 matches in the motion. We didn't read them. We need to read those matches. So choose read_document on the motion at those token ranges. We need token ranges for the matches. The search_document_regex would provide context tokens. We didn't capture those. We need to run search_document_regex again for the motion to get the matches with context tokens. Then read the matched windows to extract the terms. So next action: search_document_regex on Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Preliminary Injunction with pattern \"(?i)The Court ORDERS\". We already did step 6 and found 5 matches. But we might need to get the context tokens to read them. We need to request with context_tokens maybe 200. Use search_document_regex with doc_name specifying the motion doc. Then read the token ranges from the results.

We should search in remaining documents for patterns of \"The Court ORDERS\" or \"ORDERS that:\" etc. Already searched for \"The Court ORDERS\" and found none in Opp and Motion. But maybe other terms in Complaint? Complaint may have a \"court orders\" if there is a consent decree or something. Let's search for \"ORDERS\" or \"ORDER\" or \"DECREES\" in Complaint. Use search_document_regex on Complaint for pattern \"(?i)ORDERS that:\"? Also search for \"decree\" maybe. Let's search for \"decree\" or \"consent decree\" in Complaint. But we need terms that are substantive obligations ordered by court. Consent decrees are court orders, but they must be in docket or order documents? The complaint may not contain a decree; but maybe a \"consent decree\" is attached. But only documents listed: Complaint, Docket, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Opp, Motion. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal may have a dismissal order. That was in Docket. But the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal document itself may contain its own order text? It's a notice, but might contain \"the case is dismissed without prejudice\" maybe. But that is already captured from Docket. However, the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal may have a separate section \"the court orders that the case is dismissed\" but that's in the docket. But the Notice might not have that text. But we should search.\n\nAlso Opp might contain \"the court orders\" if there was an order on that. But search didn't find. But maybe the Opp contains a clause \"the court orders that\" but search pattern didn't match. Let's search for \"ORDER\" or \"ORDERS\" in Opp. Use search_document_regex on Opp for pattern \"(?i)ORDER\". We might find \"Order\" but not necessarily the court orders. But we need to extract each term.\n\nWe should search the Opp for \"the case is dismissed\" maybe. But that is a dismissal order, but that is in docket. So we might not need to extract from Opp.\n\nAlso Motion may have a \"Text of Proposed Order\" that contains terms. But search didn't find pattern \"Text of Proposed Order\" but maybe \"Proposed Order\" appears. But we already searched \"Proposed Order\" in Motion - found none. However, the Motion may include \"The Court ORDERS that\" pattern. Search didn't find. But maybe the motion contains \"The Court ORDERS that the parties appear\" etc. But we didn't find.\n\nWe might search for \"ORDERS\" or \"ORDER\" in the Motion. But we already did \"The Court ORDERS\" and found none. But we could search for just \"ORDER\" to see if there's any \"ORDER\" that is a decree. But \"ORDER\" could be generic. But we can search for pattern \"(?i)ORDER\" and then manually filter. But the instruction says to use regex for patterns that are clearly patternable. \"ORDER\" might be too generic. But we can try.\n\nAlso the Complaint may have a consent decree phrase \"the court orders that\" or \"the court decrees that\". Let's search.\n\nWe should read more of the Complaint to see if there are any court orders. But we currently have only 368-749 tokens. We need to read more parts of Complaint. Let's read from 750 tokens onwards. That might bring more. But we need to ensure not to re-read tokens already read. So we need to read from 750 to maybe 1500 or full length. But token count is 5038. So we can read a chunk. Let's read tokens 750-1500. That is 750 tokens. We can read 750-1500. Let's do that.\n\nAlso we might need to read the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. Already have 146-346. But maybe the dismissal order appears earlier or later. We can read more of that doc: 0-145 and 347-386. Let's do that.\n\nAlso Opp has partial coverage; we might read more of Opp. But maybe no orders. But let's read more of Opp: 0-373, 489-689, 3273-3557 are visited. We might read 3558-5000? But Opp length 15366. We can read maybe 4000-5000 to see if there are orders.

We have 4 values extracted from Docket. Are there other decree terms? The prompt: \"Extract the decree terms from the legal documents. ... Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have Docket entries: 4 terms extracted. Need to check other documents: Complaint, Docket, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Defendants’ Opposition, Motion for Preliminary. The decree terms are court orders, so the Docket has the orders. Also maybe Docket had other orders. We saw two matches: first match had 3 items plus dismissal. Second match had dismissal. There may be more orders elsewhere? Let's search for \"ORDERS\" in other documents to see if there are other court orders. The prior search found matches only in Docket. But maybe there are other orders like \"MINUTE ORDER\" etc. The search pattern \"(?i)The Court ORDERS\" found only in Docket. But maybe other orders are \"MINUTE ORDER\" or \"ORDER\" but not preceded by The Court ORDERS. But the requirement: significant terms of decrees: substantive obligations ordered by the court. So any order, including \"MINUTE ORDER: The Court ORDERS ...\". So we should capture all terms in any order. We already captured three terms and dismissal. Are there any other orders in other documents? For example, the Docket might have other orders beyond those two matches? The Docket had tokens 490-700, 700-914, 627-800, 490-700 again. The search results show two matches in Docket. But maybe there are orders in other documents, like \"The Court ORDERS\" in other documents? Search again for \"The Court ORDERS\" across all documents; we already did step 14, it only found Docket. So only Docket has orders. Are there other orders in Docket outside those matches? The search pattern might not capture orders not starting with \"The Court ORDERS\". But we may check for \"ORDER:\" or \"ORDER:\" but we want substantive obligations. The Docket also had \"MINUTE ORDER: The Court ORDERS\" patterns. The search pattern might miss orders with \"MINUTE ORDER:\" but we saw two matches: first is \"MINUTE ORDER: The Court ORDERS that:\" and second is \"MINUTE ORDER: Per Plaintiff's 8 Notice, the Court ORDERS that the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" So we captured them.\n\nAre there any other orders like \"ORDER: The Court ORDERS that\" etc. Maybe there are orders in other documents that are court orders but not starting with \"The Court ORDERS\". For example, the \"Motion for Preliminary\" might have \"ORDER\" in it? But we searched for \"ORDER\" in that document and found 5 matches, but those might be within the motion text, not actual court orders. But we probably need to check.\n\nThe \"search_document_regex\" on Motion found 5 matches for \"ORDER\". But we didn't read those. We need to review them to ensure no orders.\n\nBut the key is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" are the substantive obligations ordered by the court. These include consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions. So we need to check if there are consent decrees or injunctions in the documents. The Docket likely has the order. The other documents may have consent decrees? But we haven't seen any. The Complaint might contain a settlement? But it's a complaint, not a decree. The \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" might not contain orders. The \"Defendants’ Opposition\" likely contains pleadings, not orders. The \"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" is not the order.\n\nThus, likely only the Docket has the decree terms. We have captured all 4 terms. But we need to verify if there are any more in Docket. Did we capture all terms? The first match: 3 terms. The second match: dismissal. We might need to capture the entire text of each term, including the preceding \"Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025;\" etc. We captured them. But need to check if the terms include semicolons or punctuation. The extracted values are given. They are distinct. We should confirm if there are any other obligations in the same order: maybe the order also includes \"Defendants shall file their Opposition...; Plaintiff shall file its Reply...; The parties shall appear...\" We captured all three. Good.\n\nBut maybe there is also a \"The Court ORDERS\" that had \"the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" That we captured.\n\nAre there any other orders in the Docket? Let's search for \"ORDERS\" in Docket again but perhaps with different pattern. We can use search_document_regex with pattern \"(?i)ORDERS\". But that might return many. But we can refine: \"ORDER:\" maybe. But let's search for \"ORDER\" again but with context. But we already saw 5 matches for \"ORDER\" in the Motion; not Docket. But maybe Docket has others.\n\nLet's run a search in Docket for \"ORDER:\" or \"ORDER\" within Docket. We'll do search_document_regex on Docket with pattern \"(?i)ORDER\". That might return many. But we need to look at context. Alternatively, we can search for \"The Court ORDERS\" again but we saw only those. But maybe there are orders that don't start with \"The Court ORDERS\" but have \"The Court ORDERS that the case is ...\" The search pattern might capture those. But we saw the dismissal order matched \"MINUTE ORDER: Per Plaintiff's 8 Notice, the Court ORDERS that the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" That matched. So we got it.\n\nThus, likely we have all terms.\n\nBut we should still verify there are no other orders in Docket not captured. Let's search for \"MINUTE ORDER\" in Docket. We'll do search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"(?i)MINUTE ORDER\". That might show any other minute orders. But we can search.\n\nAlso maybe there is a \"DECREES\" in other documents? The search for \"decree\" found many matches, but they might be in pleadings. But we need to check if any of those are orders. But the pattern \"(?i)decree\" might catch \"consent decree\" etc. But we need to see if any \"consent decree\" is in the docket? Probably not.\n\nThus, we think we have all terms.\n\nWe need to confirm the evidence for each extracted value: we have evidence from Docket tokens 490-700 and 736-914. We should include evidence with text snippet, source_document, location. We need to include token offsets or page numbers. We have tokens. For each value, we need evidence that includes the excerpt with the term. We might need to provide location: token offset or page. But we can provide token range or page.\n\nWe need to verify the text snippet is correct. The excerpt from Docket tokens 490-700 includes \"(1) Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025;\" etc. But we need to confirm correct phrasing. The snippet: The snippet in the search result shows \"(1) Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025;\". The actual text might have \"Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025;\" The snippet had \"5 Motion\" maybe a typo. We should double-check by reading the section.\n\nThus, we should read the relevant portion of the Docket to capture exact wording. We should read tokens 490-700 or the region containing the order. We have read 490-700 previously, but we might need to confirm the exact text. The snippet in step 15 shows the extracted values. But we might want to confirm the exact text.\n\nWe should read again the Docket tokens 490-700 to verify the exact wording. That is a new read_document action. The Docket is partially visited with tokens 0-173, 351-914. So we have tokens 351-914. But we need 490-700; tokens 351-914 are already visited, so we have already read that range? The catalog shows \"Viewed tokens: 0-173, 351-914\". So we have read tokens 351-914, which includes 490-700. So we already have that text. But we didn't store the exact text; we only have the excerpt from step 15. But we need evidence snippet. We need to provide the exact text snippet from the Docket. We can provide the snippet we saw. But we might want to confirm the snippet is correct.\n\nNow, we need to provide evidence. We have evidence from Docket tokens 490-700 with snippet \"(1) Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025;\". Similarly for others. For the dismissal, snippet \"the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" We can include those with location tokens 736-914.\n\nWe should also consider whether the snippet includes \"MINUTE ORDER:\" prefix. But the checklist item is the substantive obligations, the terms themselves, not the heading. So we can provide the obligations only.\n\nThus, we have 4 values. We need to confirm if any other obligations exist. Perhaps the dismissal order also includes \"the case is dismissed without prejudice.\" That's one.\n\nThus, we can finalize: We have all values for the key. Now we need to ensure that all values are appended. We already appended them. But we need to check if there are more values. If none, we can stop.\n\nBut the system expects \"Check all documents for any other terms.\" Did we fully search all documents? We searched for \"The Court ORDERS\" across all docs. Only Docket had matches. But maybe there are orders not using that phrase. But we might search for \"ORDER\" across all docs. Let's search for \"ORDER\" in all docs to see if any other orders exist. But many results might be within pleadings. But we can search for \"ORDER\" with pattern that includes \"The Court\" or \"ORDER\" and then \"that\" maybe.\n\nAlternatively, search for \"ORDER\" with preceding \"MINUTE\". But we did.\n\nWe can search for \"MINUTE ORDER\" in all docs. That might return only one match in Docket.\n\nLet's run search_document_regex on all docs for pattern \"(?i)MINUTE ORDER\". We'll do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)MINUTE ORDER\",\"flags\":[],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)MINUTE ORDER", "flags": [], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5096, "completion_tokens": 2302, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have found 4 items: filings deadlines, hearing date, and dismissal. Are there any other court orders in other documents? The search earlier found matches in other documents? Step 15 shows 4 values from Docket. Step 16-17 no matches in opposition or motion. Step 18 read Complaint but no orders. Step 19 found minute orders in Docket only. There might be other court orders in \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" but that order is likely part of Docket. It may contain \"case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\" which we already captured. But check if any other orders in the other documents: The \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" is a form; might contain \"The Court ORDERS that the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" But that's same as Docket. However, we might consider separate entries per each unique value. Already have that. Are there any other terms like \"The parties shall appear for a hearing on the Motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m.\" already captured. Also \"Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025;\" and \"Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025;\". Did we miss any other obligations? Possibly the dismissal order itself: \"the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" Already included. So likely complete.\n\nBut we must confirm that there are no other significant terms in other documents. Let's search again for \"The Court ORDERS\" across all documents. Step 14 found matches only in Docket. Step 16 found none in opposition. Step 17 none in motion. So only Docket contains orders. But there might be \"Proposed Order\" in Docket but we captured the terms. Are there any other \"Orders\" in Docket like \"Order AND Terminate Hearings\"? Step 19 shows match 2 tokens 724-914 has \"Order AND Terminate Hearings\" but the minute order says \"the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" That is also captured. The \"Order AND Terminate Hearings\" may be a separate order content but not captured: it might be a separate \"Order\" within the dismissal. But the minute order text: \"MINUTE ORDER: Per Plaintiff's 8 Notice, the Court ORDERS that the case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\" The other \"Order AND Terminate Hearings\" might refer to termination of hearings. But that might be part of the dismissal order. But the text may not contain content beyond dismissal. There's no distinct obligations stated there. So we have captured all.\n\nThus the checklist is complete. But need to ensure no duplicates; each distinct value. We have 4 distinct values. Good.\n\nWe must ensure we didn't miss any obligations like \"The parties shall appear for a hearing on the Motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m.\" yes.\n\nCheck if \"Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025;\" maybe should be \"Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025\" Note maybe the formatting: \"Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025;\" includes semicolon. Good.\n\nNow we need to stop. Confirm that the checklist key is filled with 4 values, no missing. We should call get_checklist to confirm. But if we stop, we need to ensure that extraction is complete. It's the only key. It's filled with 4 values. So we can stop. However, we must ensure that no further values exist.

The checklist: Significant_Terms_of_Decrees. We have 4 values extracted from Docket. But we must ensure all significant terms in any court order are extracted. The Docket had some minute orders. Could there be other decrees in other documents? Possibly other orders: In Complaint, there may be a proposed order? But the complaint is a pleading, not a decree. There might be a dismissal order that is in the Docket. We have 4 values: from Docket: likely \"Defendants shall file their Opposition to Plaintiff's 5 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction by April 4, 2025; Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025; parties appear for hearing on motion via Zoom on April 25, 2025; case dismissed without prejudice.\" Are there other orders? The Docket also might have the \"Text of Proposed Order\" match. But that might be a proposed order, likely not a decree.\n\nWe must check if there are any other court orders in other documents like \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" or \"Defendants' Opposition\" or \"Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" etc. The \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" is a notice, not an order. But maybe the dismissal without prejudice is in the Docket. Also the \"Defendants' Opposition\" might have an order? Probably not. The \"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" likely contains the court's orders, but we haven't read those documents beyond some parts. But the search results found matches for \"The Court ORDERS\" in the Docket only. The search for \"The Court ORDERS\" in other documents returned no matches. So probably the only court orders are in the Docket. The 4 values extracted likely represent all significant terms. But we should double-check that no other orders exist in other documents: maybe the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" might contain an order? But it's a notice, not an order.\n\nThus we likely have all. But we need to verify that the extraction of 4 values is correct and complete. The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We must ensure we captured all distinct values. The Docket had two minute orders: one on March 25, 2025 with specified deadlines and hearing; one on April 14, 2025 with dismissal. Are there any other orders? The search for \"MINUTE ORDER\" found only those two. So we have exactly 2 orders. But the first order had 3 sub-terms: \"Defendants shall file their Opposition... by April 4, 2025; Plaintiff shall file its Reply by April 11, 2025; parties appear for hearing on April 25, 2025.\" Should we treat each as separate value? The definition: \"extract each term as a separate value.\" So each distinct obligation is a separate value. So first order has 3 terms; second order has 1 term: \"case dismissed without prejudice.\" So total 4 terms. That matches the extracted 4 values.\n\nThus likely complete. We should confirm evidence: we need to provide evidence for each value: the extracted text, source_document, location. We have evidence from step 19 matches, but we didn't include them in the append_checklist. We need to check if the 4 values are already appended. Step 15 appended 4 values. We need to confirm the evidence. Might be satisfactory. But we should double-check if the evidence is correct: the evidence likely from Docket tokens where the orders appear. We should retrieve those to confirm. But the user didn't ask to re-check. The system's last step 21 shows 4 values extracted. We should decide if we need to update anything.\n\nGiven the last instruction: \"Your Next Action: Choose ONE action.\" We can either stop or maybe double-check evidence. But the instruction: \"Your task: Extract the decree terms. Requirements: ...\". We have done extraction. The system's last status: all keys filled, no empty keys. So we can stop. The system has already called get_checklist and reported 4 values.\n\nThus the best action is to stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All significant terms of decrees have been extracted from the Docket; no further court orders exist in the remaining documents.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All significant terms of decrees have been extracted from the Docket; no further court orders exist in the remaining documents.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5048, "completion_tokens": 923, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
