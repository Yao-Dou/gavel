Include requests from both plaintiffs and defendants. Each requested remedy as separate value, formatted as: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]' or 'Defendant: [remedy].'\"\n\nWe need to read the complaint for plaintiff's remedies, and possibly the defendants' opposition or motion may contain their requested remedies. But the remedy sought is likely in the complaint. The motion for preliminary injunction may request relief as well, but it's a pleading. Might also contain remedy sought.\n\nWe should search for \"remedy\" pattern. Or \"seek\" pattern but we already did some. But we need to capture all remedy requests. Maybe \"injunctive relief\", \"declaratory relief\". We need to capture each distinct remedy.\n\nWe could search for \"injunctive relief\" or \"declaratory relief\" or \"reimbursement\" etc. But maybe the complaint lists multiple remedies: injunctive relief, declaratory relief, damages, attorney fees, etc.\n\nLet's search documents for \"injunctive\" and \"declaratory\" and \"damages\".

We'll read maybe 2000 tokens covering that match. Let's call read_document on Complaint tokens 600-1200 or similar. Actually we saw tokens 708-908. Let's read 600-1200 to include context. We'll need to verify the remedy phrasing. Also maybe there are other remedies later in the complaint. Let's search within the Complaint for other remedy requests. But simplest: read entire Complaint? That's 5,038 tokens, but that's too large. Let's read targeted ranges for the complaint to find remedy requests.\n\nWe can search the Complaint for \"injunctive\" pattern.

We need format: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]'. So we should create two entries: 'Plaintiff: injunctive relief' and 'Plaintiff: declaratory relief'. But might need to capture exact phrasing. Possibly \"injunctive and declaratory relief\". Might combine? But requirement: each requested remedy as separate value. So two separate.\n\nAlso maybe other documents contain remedies. We should search other documents for \"remedy\" or \"relief\" or \"injunctive\". The search already found many matches across documents. But we should read more to confirm. Let's search specific doc for \"relief\" or \"remedy\". But we have search results for \"injunctive\" in Complaint only. We might need to find remedies sought by defendants (unlikely, but maybe). Let's search \"remedy\" in all documents. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"remedy\" maybe. But we also might search for \"relief\" maybe. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents for \"injunctive relief\" or \"injunctive\" to capture more. But we already did injunctive search in Complaint.

We have seen some remedy requests in Complaint, Motion, and Opposition. We need to capture each distinct remedy requested by either plaintiff or defendant, separate entries with evidence. Likely remedies: for plaintiff: preliminary injunction to stop enforcement of executive orders, immediate release of funds, etc. For defendant: maybe to deny plaintiff's motion, to post security, etc.\n\nWe need to read more targeted sections. We could use search_document_regex to find \"preliminary injunction\" or \"injunction\" etc. But we need remedy requests. Let's search for \"injunction\" in Complaint, but we already saw. In Motion, we saw plaintiff requesting preliminary injunction. In Opp, we saw defendants request denial of plaintiff's motion. Also maybe defendants request no injunctive relief? Let's search for \"injunctive relief\" or \"injunction\" in Opp.\n\nAlso maybe the Complaint requests injunctive relief. We saw in the Complaint: \"Erie County brings this action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief\". That is remedy. Also \"declaratory relief\" maybe not counted? But request is injunctive and declaratory. So remedy: injunctive relief. Also \"declaratory relief\" maybe separate.\n\nAlso in Motion: plaintiff requests \"preliminary injunction that orders Defendants to determine Plaintiff is in compliance... and to disburse immediately any funds...\" So remedy: preliminary injunction (specific). Also maybe \"immediate disbursement of funds\". That is a remedy.\n\nAlso in Opp: defendants request denial of plaintiff's motion. That is remedy: denial of motion. Also \"post security\" maybe remedy: order plaintiff to post security. They ask for that.\n\nAlso maybe defendants request \"no injunctive relief\" or \"denial of preliminary injunction\". Also might request \"deny plaintiff's motion\" and \"order plaintiff to post security\".\n\nAlso maybe defendants request \"no injunctive relief\" etc.\n\nAlso maybe the Complaint includes \"declaratory relief\" which is a remedy. So we need separate entries: Plaintiff: injunctive relief; declaratory relief; preliminary injunction; immediate disbursement of funds; maybe also \"specific performance\" but not.\n\nAlso defendants: deny plaintiff's motion; order plaintiff to post security; maybe request for \"no injunctive relief\".\n\nBut we need to extract from the text. We have the text of Complaint and Motion, and Opp. We can search for \"seek\" or \"seeking\" or \"requests\" etc.\n\nTo capture remedy entries, we should parse the text. We can use search_document_regex to find patterns like \"seeks (.*? relief)\" or \"request (.*? relief)\". But easier is to read the relevant sections.\n\nWe have already read Complaint tokens 910-5038. It includes the remedy request: \"Erie County brings this action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief\". So we can extract: \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\" and \"Plaintiff: declaratory relief\". Provide evidence snippet.\n\nAlso the Motion includes the remedy: \"Plaintiff ... requests a preliminary injunction that orders Defendants to determine Plaintiff is in compliance ... disburse immediately any funds ...\". So \"Plaintiff: preliminary injunction\" maybe also \"Plaintiff: immediate disbursement of funds\". But the remedy \"preliminary injunction\" covers that. But we can include \"Plaintiff: immediate disbursement of funds\" as separate remedy? The requirement is to extract remedies the party asks the court to grant. So yes, that is a remedy: \"immediate disbursement of funds\". So we need separate entries.\n\nAlso the Opp: defendants request denial of plaintiff's motion: \"Defendants submit that the Court can and should deny Plaintiff’s motion in its entirety.\" So \"Defendant: denial of Plaintiff’s motion\". Also \"Defendant: order Plaintiff to post security\". Also maybe \"Defendant: deny injunctive relief\" but that is same as denial of motion.\n\nAlso maybe the defendants request \"no injunctive relief\" but same.\n\nThus we need to append entries for each.\n\nWe should ensure each entry has evidence snippet. We need to provide source_document and location: maybe page numbers. We have page numbers: Complaint has page 13 of 13. We can specify location \"Page 13 of 13\" or token offsets.\n\nSimilarly, Motion page 2 and 3 etc. Opp page 28-29.\n\nWe need to use append_checklist to add these entries.\n\nBut before that, we need to confirm we have evidence text. Let's capture text snippets:\n\nFrom Complaint:\n\n\"Erie County brings this action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief requiring Americorps to comply with its own rules and the United States Constitution.\" Also earlier: \"Erie County brings this action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief requiring Americorps to comply with its own rules and the United States Constitution.\" That includes injunctive and declaratory.\n\nFrom Motion:\n\n\"Plaintiff Erie County New York hereby moves this Court for a preliminary injunction that orders Defendants to determine Plaintiff is in compliance with all relevant grant requirements for existing RSVP grants, and to disburse immediately any funds to which it is entitled, without Plaintiff needing to certify that “RSVP of Erie County, 24SR260017 complies with all administration Executive Orders and does not include any activities that promote DEI activities,” or make any other substantially similar certification...\"\n\nThus remedy: preliminary injunction; immediate disbursement of funds.\n\nFrom Opp:\n\n\"Defendants submit that the Court can and should deny Plaintiff’s motion in its entirety.\" That is denial of motion.\n\n\"Defendants submit that the Court can and should deny Plaintiff’s motion in its entirety.\" Also \"Defendants also request that the Court order Plaintiff to post security in connection with any temporary injunctive relief.\" Actually the snippet: \"Defendants submit that the Court can and should deny Plaintiff’s motion in its entirety. However, should the Court be inclined to order any injunctive relief, the Court should also order Plaintiff to post security.\"\n\nThus remedy: Denial of plaintiff's motion. Remedy: order plaintiff to post security.\n\nThus we need 4 plaintiff entries: injunctive relief, declaratory relief, preliminary injunction, immediate disbursement of funds. And 2 defendant entries: denial of plaintiff's motion, order plaintiff to post security.

We already appended 6 values: 2 from Complaint, 2 from Motion, 2 from Opposition. But are we missing any? We should search for other remedy requests. The complaint had \"injunctive and declaratory relief\" and \"preliminary injunction\" maybe. The motion had \"preliminary injunction\" and \"immediate disbursement of funds\" (maybe). The opposition had denial of motion and order plaintiff to post security. But maybe there are other remedy requests elsewhere, e.g., in the Complaint there might be \"injunctive and declaratory relief requiring Americorps to comply with its own rules and the United States Constitution\" which is captured. The motion also had \"preliminary injunction\" and \"immediate disbursement of funds\" but maybe also \"injunctive relief\" or \"injunctive relief\" etc. But the motion says \"preliminary injunction that orders Defendants to determine Plaintiff is in compliance with all relevant grant requirements for existing RSVP grants, and to disburse immediately any funds to which it is entitled\". So remedy: \"preliminary injunction\" and \"immediate disbursement of funds\". The complaint also might mention \"enjoin and set aside\" etc. But maybe there is also a request for \"declaratory relief\" in the motion? No. The opposition might request \"denial of motion\" and \"order plaintiff to post security\". Also maybe the complaint includes \"injunctive and declaratory relief\" and also \"a preliminary injunction\" maybe. But we might have duplicates. Let's scan the complaint for other remedy requests: The last part of the complaint (Prayer for Relief) lists 3 bullet points: \"enjoin and set aside\", \"enjoin Defendants ... from imposing grant requirements limiting the promotion of 'DEI' ... \", \"All other relief that this Court deems just and proper.\" So there is an \"enjoin\" request (injunctive relief). Also \"set aside\" request (which is a preliminary injunction? Actually it's a request for a preliminary injunction to set aside the action). But we might treat \"set aside\" as a remedy (injunctive relief). But we have \"injunctive relief\" already. But maybe we should capture \"set aside\" as a remedy separate? The instruction: \"Extract each requested remedy as a separate value, formatted as: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]' or 'Defendant: [remedy].'\" So we should list each remedy separately. So we need to list all remedies requested by both parties. That means we need to capture:\n\nFrom Complaint (Plaintiff):\n- injunctive relief (enjoin and set aside)\n- declaratory relief\n- preliminary injunction (maybe separate but it's part of injunctive)\n- immediate disbursement of funds? Wait complaint didn't request immediate disbursement; that's in the motion. The complaint had only \"injunctive and declaratory relief\" and \"enjoin ... set aside\" and \"all other relief.\" The motion has \"preliminary injunction\" and \"immediate disbursement of funds.\" The opposition has \"denial of motion\" and \"order plaintiff to post security.\"\n\nAlso the complaint may have \"injunctive relief\" and \"declaratory relief\" and \"preliminary injunction\" might be encompassed. But we might need to list each distinct remedy phrase as separate value. So we need to not duplicate the same remedy across documents? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So duplicates across documents are okay? It says \"EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" That means if the same remedy appears in multiple documents, we only need to list it once? Distinct value across documents. So if \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\" appears in complaint and motion, we only need one. But we have captured \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\" from complaint. We also captured \"Plaintiff: preliminary injunction\" from motion. We captured \"Plaintiff: immediate disbursement of funds\" from motion. We captured \"Defendant: denial of Plaintiff’s motion\" from opposition. We captured \"Defendant: order Plaintiff to post security\" from opposition. We captured \"Plaintiff: declaratory relief\" from complaint.\n\nBut maybe the complaint also requests \"injunctive relief\" and \"preliminary injunction\" as separate. But the complaint might not specifically request \"preliminary injunction\" separately. It says \"injunctive and declaratory relief requiring Americorps to comply with its own rules.\" That is injunctive relief. The motion specifically requests \"preliminary injunction\", so we have that. So we have distinct values:\n\n- Plaintiff: injunctive relief\n- Plaintiff: declaratory relief\n- Plaintiff: preliminary injunction\n- Plaintiff: immediate disbursement of funds\n- Defendant: denial of Plaintiff's motion\n- Defendant: order Plaintiff to post security\n\nBut are there other remedies requested? The complaint's prayer may also request \"set aside\" or \"enjoin\" which is injunctive relief. Already captured. \"All other relief that this Court deems just and proper.\" That is generic, maybe not a specific remedy.\n\nThe motion also might request \"immediate disbursement of funds\" but that might be part of the injunction. Already captured.\n\nAre there any other remedies in the opposition? It says \"Defendants submit that the Court can and should deny Plaintiff’s motion in its entirety.\" That is a remedy request. Also \"order Plaintiff to post security.\" Already captured.\n\nWe should also check if the complaint or motion or opposition mention \"injunctive relief\" or \"injunction\" etc. There may be \"injunctive relief\" in the complaint. We captured. There may be \"injunction\" in the motion. We captured. There may be \"injunction\" in the opposition? Not that I recall. The opposition may also request \"denial of Plaintiff's motion\" which is already captured.\n\nThus we have all distinct remedies. We need to confirm no duplicates.\n\nWait, we also have \"Plaintiff: immediate disbursement of funds\" which is a remedy. But the complaint didn't request that. The motion did. So unique.\n\nNow check if there is any remedy requested in the Defendants' Opposition that is not captured. They also might request \"order Plaintiff to post security\" which we captured. They may also request \"denial of Plaintiff's motion\" which we captured.\n\nAlso, the complaint's prayer might also request \"injunctive relief\" and \"declaratory relief\" and \"preliminary injunction\" maybe. But we captured those.\n\nBut we might also have a remedy request \"enjoin and set aside\" but that is injunctive. Already covered.\n\nNow, we should confirm if any other documents contain remedy requests. The docket or dismissal notice likely not. But maybe the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal might have \"voluntary dismissal\" which is not a remedy. But not relevant.\n\nThus we likely have all distinct remedies.\n\nNow we need to update the checklist to ensure no duplicates. We appended 6 values. But if some values are duplicates across documents, we might need to dedupe. But the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So duplicates across documents should be omitted. We must ensure no duplicates. The appended values: \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\", \"Plaintiff: declaratory relief\", \"Plaintiff: preliminary injunction\", \"Plaintiff: immediate disbursement of funds\", \"Defendant: denial of Plaintiff’s motion\", \"Defendant: order Plaintiff to post security\". All are distinct.\n\nHowever, check that \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\" appears also in the motion? The motion text \"Plaintiff Erie County New York hereby moves this Court for a preliminary injunction that orders Defendants...\" That's not \"injunctive relief\", but \"preliminary injunction\". So only the complaint had \"injunctive relief\". So fine.\n\nNow we need to verify that we have evidence for each. We have evidence in the appended values. But we should ensure that the evidence matches. In the appended output we saw evidence for each. But we need to confirm the evidence text: we saw for \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\" evidence from Complaint (Page 13). For \"Plaintiff: declaratory relief\" same evidence. For \"Plaintiff: preliminary injunction\" evidence from Motion. For \"Plaintiff: immediate disbursement of funds\" evidence from Motion. For \"Defendant: denial of Plaintiff’s motion\" evidence from Opposition. For \"Defendant: order Plaintiff to post security\" evidence from Opposition. Those are correct.\n\nWe might need to check if there are any other remedy requests in the complaint or motion that we haven't captured. For example, the complaint's prayer also says \"enjoin and set aside\" and \"enjoin Defendants ... from imposing grant requirements limiting the promotion of 'DEI' ...\". That's also injunctive relief. We captured as \"injunctive relief\". But maybe we could also capture \"enjoin\" as separate? But it's the same remedy. The instruction says \"Each requested remedy as a separate value, formatted as: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]' or 'Defendant: [remedy]'.\"\n\nThus we are correct.\n\nHowever, we should check if there is a remedy request for \"immediate disbursement of funds\" in the complaint? No.\n\nAlso, the motion's remedy request might include \"immediate disbursement of funds\" and \"preliminary injunction\". Good.\n\nNow, we might also need to consider if the motion requested \"injunctive relief\" in addition to the preliminary injunction? The motion text: \"Plaintiff Erie County New York hereby moves this Court for a preliminary injunction that orders Defendants to determine Plaintiff is in compliance with all relevant grant requirements for existing RSVP grants, and to disburse immediately any funds to which it is entitled, without Plaintiff needing to certify...\" So the remedy is the preliminary injunction with immediate disbursement. So \"preliminary injunction\" covers that.\n\nNow, the opposition might request \"denial of Plaintiff's motion\" and \"order plaintiff to post security\". So we have those.\n\nThus we have all distinct remedies.\n\nBut we need to verify if any other remedy request appears in the Complaint that we didn't capture: The complaint's prayer lists 3 bullet points. The third bullet \"All other relief that this Court deems just and proper.\" That is not a specific remedy. The first bullet \"enjoin and set aside\" we covered as injunctive relief. The second bullet \"enjoin Defendants ... from imposing grant requirements limiting the promotion of 'DEI' ... \" that's also injunctive relief. The complaint also earlier on might request \"injunctive relief\" and \"declaratory relief\" as we captured.\n\nThus all remedies are captured.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that the checklist is complete. The only key is Remedy_Sought. It's fully extracted. We have 6 values. We need to confirm if any duplicates or missing values. I think it's fine.\n\nNow, we need to decide next action. We already appended the values. But we must check if the checklist extraction has any missing values. Let's do a get_checklist to confirm. But we can also just stop, but let's double-check that there are no other remedy requests. Maybe the complaint also requests \"immediate disbursement of funds\"? No. The motion does. The opposition does not. So done.\n\nHowever, the complaint's prayer might also request \"injunctive and declaratory relief requiring Americorps to comply with its own rules\" which we captured as \"injunctive relief\" and \"declaratory relief\". The complaint also requests \"enjoin and set aside\" which we captured. The motion requests \"preliminary injunction\" and \"immediate disbursement of funds\". The opposition requests \"denial of motion\" and \"order plaintiff to post security\". So all covered.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut let's double-check that the evidence for each value is included. The appended values had evidence. But we need to verify that the evidence is correct. The appended values show evidence from Complaint, Motion, Opposition. They look correct.\n\nOne potential issue: The evidence for \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\" and \"Plaintiff: declaratory relief\" is from Complaint (Page 13). That text: \"Erie County brings this action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief requiring Americorps to comply with its own rules and the United States Constitution.\" That covers both. That's fine.\n\nThe evidence for \"Plaintiff: preliminary injunction\" is from Motion (Page 2). The text: \"Plaintiff Erie County New York hereby moves this Court for a preliminary injunction that orders Defendants to determine Plaintiff is in compliance with all relevant grant requirements for existing RSVP grants, ...\". Good.\n\nThe evidence for \"Plaintiff: immediate disbursement of funds\" is from Motion (Page 2). That's the same text. That's fine.\n\nThe evidence for \"Defendant: denial of Plaintiff’s motion\" is from Opposition (Page 28). Good.\n\nThe evidence for \"Defendant: order Plaintiff to post security\" is from Opposition (Page 28). Good.\n\nThus all evidence is present.\n\nNow we need to ensure that we have used correct formatting: we must output JSON with action field. But we already executed an append_checklist. That was the last action. Now we need to decide next.\n\nWe might do a get_checklist to confirm that all values are present. But we could also stop. But maybe we should double-check that there are no other remedy requests. Let's search for \"injunct\" again to see if any other matches were missed. We can do search_document_regex on all documents for \"injunct\" but we attempted earlier and got error due to context_tokens. We can set context_tokens to 200, which is allowed. Let's do that. That might reveal other remedy requests. But maybe better: we can search for \"injunctive\" or \"injunction\" but we already captured. But there might be \"injunctive relief\" in the motion? The motion only has \"preliminary injunction\". But maybe the complaint also has \"injunctive relief\" and \"declaratory relief\". We captured both. No other remedy requests.\n\nBut maybe there's \"disburse immediately\" or \"immediate disbursement\" is a remedy. We captured that. But maybe there's \"immediate disbursement of funds\" again in the complaint? No.\n\nThus we are done.\n\nJust to be safe, we can run get_checklist to confirm. But we can also stop. But I think we should stop.\n\nThus final action: stop.\n\nWe should output JSON with decision: stop, reason: all checklist items extracted.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All Remedy_Sought values have been extracted with supporting evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All Remedy_Sought values have been extracted with supporting evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 17920, "completion_tokens": 3124, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to check if any missing. The requirement: every distinct value found in any document. We have 5 documents: Complaint, Defendants’ Opposition, Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, Docket, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. Docket and Notice likely no remedy sought. We should scan Complaint for other remedy requests maybe \"declaratory relief\", \"injunctive relief\", \"preliminary injunction\", \"immediate disbursement of funds\" captured. Maybe also \"declaratory relief\" also \"injunctive relief\". Could there be \"injunction\" or \"injunctive relief\" repeated. Check Motion: maybe \"temporary restraining order\"? But likely same.\n\nCheck Defendants’ Opposition: they request denial of Plaintiff’s motion, order plaintiff to post security, possibly also \"denial of injunctive relief\" etc.\n\nWe might have missed \"preliminary injunction\" and \"immediate disbursement\" from Motion. Also \"injunctive relief\" and \"declaratory relief\" from Complaint. Also \"denial of motion\" and \"order plaintiff to post security\" from Opposition.\n\nAre there any other remedy requests? Maybe \"temporary restraining order\" or \"stop funds\" etc. Could also include \"injunction to prevent further disbursements\" maybe.\n\nWe might need to verify if any other remedy is requested elsewhere. Let's search for \"remedy\" or \"relief\" in documents. But we cannot search again? We can search. Let's run search_document_regex for pattern \"request|seek|seek|seeking|relinquish\" etc. But we need to ensure we thoroughly capture all remedy requests.\n\nThe requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we must be exhaustive.\n\nWe have 5 documents. The Docket likely just docket entries, no remedies. Notice of Voluntary Dismissal likely no remedies.\n\nWe should inspect Complaint for any other remedy requests beyond injunctive and declaratory. Search for \"injunctive\" we already captured. Also search for \"declaratory\" captured. Also \"preliminary injunction\" captured. Also \"immediate disbursement of funds\" captured.\n\nMaybe \"injunction\" appears multiple times but same remedy. The remedy list should be distinct values. So duplicates removed.\n\nCheck if \"injunctive relief\" and \"injunction\" considered same? They are distinct phrasing but same remedy. But requirement is each distinct value of this checklist item. The remedy statements may be expressed in different ways; we should capture them as separate values? They said \"each requested remedy as a separate value, formatted as: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]' or 'Defendant: [remedy]'\" So we need to capture each distinct remedy request. We have 6 values. Are there any others? Maybe \"injunctive relief\" vs \"injunction\" might be considered distinct, but we treat them as same remedy? The examples: \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\" is a remedy. \"Plaintiff: preliminary injunction\" is another remedy. \"Defendant: denial of Plaintiff’s motion\" is a remedy request. \"Defendant: order Plaintiff to post security\" is another. \"Plaintiff: immediate disbursement of funds\" is a remedy. \"Plaintiff: declaratory relief\" is a remedy. So we have 6 distinct remedy requests.\n\nCould there be \"injunction\" or \"injunctive relief\" requested by Defendant? Not likely.\n\nCheck if the defendant seeks \"injunctive relief\" to block something. Not likely.\n\nCheck if the complaint also requests \"injunctive relief\" and \"declaratory relief\". Already captured.\n\nCheck if the Motion includes other remedies: maybe \"temporary restraining order\" or \"injunctive relief\" etc. The motion is a request for preliminary injunction. Already captured.\n\nThus likely all remedies captured.\n\nWe also need to ensure we have evidence for each value. The system shows evidence for each of 6 values. But we need to confirm if all evidence is correct. The extracted values in step 8 show evidence from documents but we need to verify if the text included the remedy statement and location. For example, \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\" evidence text: \"Erie County brings this action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief requiring Americorps to comply with its own rules and the United States Constitution.\" That's correct.\n\n\"Plaintiff: declaratory relief\" same evidence.\n\n\"Plaintiff: preliminary injunction\" evidence: \"Plaintiff Erie County New York hereby moves this Court for a preliminary injunction that orders Defendants to determine Plaintiff is in compliance with all relevant grant requirements for existing RSV...\" Good.\n\n\"Plaintiff: immediate disbursement of funds\" evidence: same.\n\n\"Defendant: denial of Plaintiff’s motion\" evidence: \"Defendants submit that the Court can and should deny Plaintiff’s motion in its entirety.\" Good.\n\n\"Defendant: order Plaintiff to post security\" evidence: \"Defendants submit that the Court can and should deny Plaintiff’s motion in its entirety. However, should the Court be inclined to order any injunctive relief, the Court should also order Plaintiff to ...\" Good.\n\nBut the requirement: \"Include requests from both plaintiffs and defendants. Extract each requested remedy as a separate value, formatted as: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]' or 'Defendant: [remedy].'\" The values are correct.\n\nWe just need to decide whether final stop is appropriate. The system says we can stop if satisfied. It already indicates 6 values. We should double-check if any other remedy requests exist. Let's search for \"seek\" or \"request\" in the Motion. But we captured preliminary injunction; maybe also \"immediate disbursement of funds\" but maybe also \"injunctive relief\" not described separately. So no.\n\nThus we can stop. But we must ensure that no other remedy is present in other documents. Let's quickly check Docket: likely docket entries like \"Filed 04/04/25\" etc. No remedy.
