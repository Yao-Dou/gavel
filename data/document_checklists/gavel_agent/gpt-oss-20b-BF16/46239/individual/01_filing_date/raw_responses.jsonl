That is a filing date but not necessarily the lawsuit filing date; it's the dismissal filed date? The \"Filed 04/14/25\" likely refers to the dismissal filing date. But we need the filing date of the lawsuit. We need to check the Complaint for the original filing. Likely in Complaint, there will be a line \"Filed [date]\" or \"Filed 2025\" etc. We should search Complaint for \"Filed\" date. Could use regex \"Filed\\s+(on\\s+)?[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}\" or \"Filed\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}\". Since we only got one match in Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, we should search more documents. The search regex earlier only looked for pattern \"Filed\\s+(on\\s+)?[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}\" which may not match other date formats. So we need to search Complaint for \"Filed\" date. Let's use search_document_regex for Complaint with pattern \"Filed\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}\" or \"Filed\\s+(on\\s+)?[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}\". But we might get multiple matches. We must be careful to only get the filing date. In Complaint, the date is likely \"Filed 04/20/2025\" or similar. Let's search with pattern \"Filed\\s+(on\\s+)?[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}\". But that pattern won't match numeric dates like \"04/20/2025\". We need to include both. Let's perform search for numeric date pattern: \"Filed\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}\". We can search for \"Filed\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}\". But the date might be \"Filed 04/21/25\" with 2-digit year. Let's search \"Filed\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}\". Also \"Filed\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}\". Let's combine both. We can just search for \"Filed\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\" and then filter. Let's search for \"Filed\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\". Use regex \"Filed\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\". That will match numeric date. We'll search in \"Complaint\" only. Also search in \"Docket\" maybe. But the filing date likely in Complaint. Let's do search_document_regex with doc_name \"Complaint\" pattern \"Filed\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\". Also maybe include \"Filed\\s+on\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" but that's second. Let's do two separate searches? We can do one with regex that covers both: \"Filed\\s+(?:on\\s+)?(?:[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4})\". That covers both numeric and word date.

So two dates: March 17, 2025 (03/17/25) and April 14, 2025 (04/14/25). But need evidence. We have partial reads. We saw the text snippet in the search results, but we need evidence from full documents. We have seen snippet for Notice of Voluntary Dismissal: \"Filed 04/14/25\". That snippet is available from the search result context. For Complaint, we saw \"Filed 03/17/25\" in multiple matches. But we might need to read the document to confirm. We have partial coverage of Complaint: tokens 0-238 includes the first match. Also tokens 509-709 includes second match. But we saw the snippet in those matches. The snippet includes \"Filed 03/17/25\". So we have evidence. But we need evidence with source_document, location. We can cite token ranges for each. For Complaint, match 1 tokens 0-109: snippet includes the date. That is evidence. For Complaint, possibly other matches also include same date. But we need unique value.

The checklist only has Filing_Date key. We already extracted 2 values: 03/17/25 from Complaint and 04/14/25 from Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. Are there other documents that might contain filing dates? The Docket may contain filing date. The other pleadings may show docket entries with filing dates. The Filing_Date key expects the calendar date on which lawsuit was first filed/initiated. That likely is the earliest filing date of the suit. In Complaint we have \"Filed 03/17/25\". In Notice of Voluntary Dismissal we have \"Filed 04/14/25\" which is later. So maybe we should confirm if any other documents have earlier filing dates? The Complaint date is likely the filing date. But there could be earlier docket entry indicating the same date. But we might want to ensure no earlier date exists. Should we read the Docket to confirm? The Docket likely lists docket entries with dates, maybe the complaint date is same. But we already extracted from Complaint. We should ensure no earlier date appears. It may be possible that the docket entry for the complaint shows the same date. But no earlier. So maybe we don't need to extract more. But we should check the Docket and other pleadings to confirm if any other filing dates exist that might be earlier or the same. But we might not need to add duplicates. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need each distinct filing date. We have two dates. If docket entry shows same date 03/17/25, that's duplicate; we don't need to add duplicate. If docket shows 04/14/25, duplicate. So we can stop. But we should verify there are no other filing dates; but we can't guarantee without reading Docket. But we might check with search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"Filed\" or \"04/14/25\" etc. But we already have 04/14/25. Maybe other documents have \"Filed\" but with other dates. To be thorough, we might search Docket for \"Filed\" pattern. Let's do search_document_regex on Docket for pattern: \"Filed\\s+(\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4})\". That may reveal dates. Alternatively search for \"Filed\" general. But the docket may not use \"Filed\" but \"Filed\" might be present. Let's search all documents for \"Filed\". But we already searched all docs and found two matches. That includes Docket? The earlier search was on all documents with pattern including month name or slash. It found 1 match in Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. It didn't find any in Docket. But maybe the docket uses a different format like \"03/17/2025\" with 4-digit year? Our pattern included \\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2} or \\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}. That covers 03/17/2025 as well. So if docket had 03/17/2025, search would find it. It didn't find. So maybe docket doesn't have \"Filed\". But maybe docket uses \"Filing Date:\" or \"Filed:\" but we didn't capture. But still unlikely.\n\nThus we can stop. But we need to ensure that the extracted values are complete. We have two values. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have two distinct values. That seems correct.\n\nThus we can stop. However, we might want to double-check if any other documents have filing dates that might be earlier or same. For example, the Motion for Preliminary Injunction may have a docket entry with earlier date, but that's a subsequent filing. But Filing_Date may refer to the court filing of the lawsuit. That is the complaint. So only complaint's date counts. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal is a later filing. But the requirement is to extract every distinct filing date found. That includes both.

We need to check if other documents might contain filing dates. The documents list: Docket, Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum... They might have filing dates. We should search those documents for filing dates patterns. So we should continue extraction.\n\nWe need to call search_document_regex on remaining unvisited documents: Docket (914 tokens), the two large pleadings (15k and 8k tokens). But we can search all documents again or targeted. We can search all documents for pattern \"Filed\\s+(on\\s+)?[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}\" or \"Filed\\s+\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2,4}\".

Then check returned matches for new filing dates. We should also consider that some documents may not have \"Filed\" phrase, but they could have \"Filed\" in docket entries? But the docket may not have. But we search anyway.\n\nGiven the system states that Docket unvisited, the other two documents unvisited.

But we may have other filing dates: In the search results we saw Filing dates for other documents:\n\n- Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction: Document 7 (Case 1:25-cv-00783-JEB) – Filed 04/04/25.\n- Motion for a Preliminary Injunction: Document 5 – Filed 03/21/25.\n- Possibly other documents may have filing dates. Also Docket may have filing dates? The Docket probably shows docket entries with dates. The \"Docket\" doc could contain filing dates of filings (e.g., Complaint filed 03/17/25, etc.). But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need all distinct filing dates across all documents. We have seen at least 4 distinct dates: 03/17/25, 04/04/25, 03/21/25, 04/14/25. Are there any others? Review search results: Complaint shows 03/17/25. Notice shows 04/14/25. Defendants’ Opposition shows 04/04/25. Motion for a Preliminary Injunction shows 03/21/25. Also the docket might have other filings (like maybe docket entries for other documents). But likely these are the only ones. Let's check Docket: 914 tokens, unvisited. It might contain docket entries with dates. We should search Docket for \"Filed\" or dates. Since the docket may include entries like \"Filed 03/17/25\" or similar. But the docket is unvisited, we should inspect it. We need to read the docket or search. Best approach: search the Docket for \"Filed\" pattern. Use search_document_regex on doc_name \"Docket\" pattern. That will return matches. The regex can be \"Filed\\s+(?:on\\s+)?[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}\". Actually the pattern is used before. We can search for date patterns. But the docket may have dates in other formats like \"03/17/2025\". The regex used earlier covers that. We'll search Docket for regex \"Filed\\s+(?:on\\s+)?(?:[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4})\". That should capture. But docket might not have \"Filed\" words. But we can search for dates. Let's search for \"03/17/25\" etc. But simplest: search for dates pattern. We can use the same regex but not anchored to \"Filed\". Actually we want distinct filing dates: we can search for any date-like tokens. But we may capture other dates like \"March 21, 2025\". The docket may contain \"March 21, 2025\" or \"03/21/25\". The regex earlier covers those patterns. So let's search Docket with that regex. That will show matches. But maybe docket entries like \"03/17/25 1 1\" etc. Let's search. We'll call search_document_regex with doc_name \"Docket\". Provide pattern same as earlier but not anchored to \"Filed\"? The earlier pattern anchored to \"Filed\". The docket may list docket entries like \"March 21, 2025 1\". So we should search for dates pattern only, not \"Filed\". But we need filing dates. The docket may list docket entries for each filing with dates. So yes, we should search for all dates. But to avoid capturing other dates like hearing dates, we could search for lines that contain \"Filed\". But the docket might not say \"Filed\". But typical docket entries: \"3/17/25 1 1\" etc. But to be safe, we can search for dates and then read the context to confirm it's a filing date. We can read the docket entries for each match. Let's search for dates pattern e.g., \"\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}\". That will capture all dates. But we need to confirm if they are filing dates. The docket may contain hearing dates with same format. But we can read the lines around each match to see if it says \"Filed\" or \"Filed:\", etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can open the docket fully and parse. But 914 tokens, so reading the entire docket is fine. Let's just read entire docket. But the rule: read_document maximum 10k tokens; 914 tokens is fine. So we can read_document entire docket tokens 0-914. That will give all docket entries. Then we can parse for filing dates. But the docket may contain many dates; we need to identify which ones are filing dates. Typically docket entries list \"Filed 03/17/25\" or \"Filed on March 17, 2025\" etc. But maybe docket entries like \"03/17/25 1 1\" etc. We should search for \"Filed\" within docket. Let's search for \"Filed\". That may show matches. But docket may have \"Filed\" phrase. Let's search. We'll use search_document_regex on Docket with pattern \"Filed\\s+(?:on\\s+)?(?:[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4})\".

So we need to append the two values: 04/04/25 and 03/21/25. Use append_checklist.\n\nWe must ensure each entry has evidence: text, source_document, location. We can use the search results context for each. For 04/04/25: from Defendants’ Opposition. For 03/21/25: from Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Provide evidence.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.\n\nLet's craft JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"04/04/25\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:25-cv-00783-JEB Document 7 Filed 04/04/25 Page 1 of 29\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 of 29\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"03/21/25\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:25-cv-00783-JEB Document 5 Filed 03/21/25 Page 1 of 20\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 of 20\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "04/04/25", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:25-cv-00783-JEB Document 7 Filed 04/04/25 Page 1 of 29", "source_document": "Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "location": "Page 1 of 29"}]}, {"value": "03/21/25", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:25-cv-00783-JEB Document 5 Filed 03/21/25 Page 1 of 20", "source_document": "Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Preliminary Injunction", "location": "Page 1 of 20"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7215, "completion_tokens": 561, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to check if any other documents have filing dates. The Docket document may contain filing date. Also maybe other documents like any attachments? But only 5 docs. Docket unvisited. Let's search docket for \"Filed\". Use search_document_regex on Docket. Then see if there are filing dates. Probably docket includes docket entries with dates. The filing date of the lawsuit likely appears in docket entries. We should search docket for dates. So next action: search_document_regex on Docket for pattern. Use pattern: \"Filed\\s+(?:on\\s+)?(?:[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}|\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4})\". That will find date.

We have already extracted 4 filing dates: from Complaint (03/17/25), Notice of Voluntary Dismissal (04/14/25), Defendants’ Opposition (04/04/25), and Motion (03/21/25). Wait Step 4 earlier indicated two values: Complaint (03/17/25) and Notice (04/14/25). Step 9 added 04/04/25 and 03/21/25. So all four values extracted.\n\nChecklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have 4 distinct filing dates. Are there any more? We have already searched all documents using regex on \"Filed\" pattern. Step 7 searched all documents and found 18 matches. Those include multiple from each document. We captured 4 distinct dates. We should confirm no more unique dates. Let's scan the match list: In Complaint, all matches show 03/17/25. In Defendants’ Opposition, we saw 04/04/25. In Motion, 03/21/25. In Notice, 04/14/25. Also there might be other dates like \"Filed\" in docket? Docket unvisited but search didn't find matches. In the docket, maybe no \"Filed\" lines. But maybe docket has \"Filed\" lines with different format? The search didn't find matches. So likely no more.\n\nThus all distinct filing dates are collected. We should ensure that each entry has evidence. We have evidence for each from the matches. The earlier append_checklist step 4 appended 2 values. Step 9 appended 2 more. So now the checklist should contain 4 values. The system's current status says \"Keys with Extracted Values: 4\". That matches.\n\nNow we must decide next action. All keys are filled, no empty keys, no Not Applicable. So we can stop. But we should confirm that the checklist is fully complete: 1 key (Filing_Date) is filled with 4 values. No empty keys. So we can stop.\n\nThus next action: stop.
