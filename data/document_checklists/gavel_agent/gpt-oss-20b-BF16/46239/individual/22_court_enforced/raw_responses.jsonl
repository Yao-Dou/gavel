The documents are: Complaint, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Docket, Defendants’ Opposition, Motion for Preliminary Injunction. We need to see if any settlement is court-enforced. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal says dismissal without prejudice. That's not a settlement. The complaint may have settlement? Likely not. But we must check other documents.

But to be thorough, we could read the Docket entirely to see if any mention of settlement. But if we find no settlement, Not Applicable stands.\n\nBut the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if there are no settlements, Not Applicable is the only value.
