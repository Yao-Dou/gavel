But the format required: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]'. We need parties: respondents (maybe list). The parties could be \"Respondents\" but we should include the names? The specification: \"Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\"\n\nThus we need at least one entry: \"Appeal: Respondents appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\" But maybe also the petitioners appealed? In the Notice of Appeal, the respondents are appealing. That is the only appeal we have found. But there might be other appeals in other documents: e.g., Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal may include references to appeals. But the search earlier didn't find \"appealed to\" but found \"appeal to\" in docket entries. Those entries refer to the same appeal. But maybe other documents have other appeals. We need to search for \"appeal\" patterns in other documents.\n\nWe should search for \"appeal\" in all documents to find other appeals. The earlier search for \"appeal to\" found 3 matches: two docket entries and one Notice of Appeal.

But we need to extract unique values. So we have one appeal.\n\nBut we should confirm if other appeals in other documents. Use search_document_regex on all documents for \"appeal to\" or \"appealed to\". Already did. But maybe \"appeal\" used differently.

We could specify parties as \"Respondents\" or list names. The requirement: \"Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court.\" So we should provide parties names. In Notice of Appeal, the respondents are listed: \"DONALD J. TRUMP, ... PAMELA BONDI, ... KRISTI NOEM, ... U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, ... TODD LYONS, ... U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT, ... MARCO RUBIO, ... U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT, ... ROBERT GUADIAN, ... DAWN CEJA\". Should we list all? That is many. But we could simply say \"Respondents\" as party group. But maybe better to list the group as \"Respondents\". The format example: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'

There might be multiple documents with appeals to same court but with different parties. Should we list each distinct appeal. We should parse each unique combination of parties and appellate court.

Trump\". That's many. But we need to capture all parties. So we need to update the extracted value for this appeal to include parties. Also check if there are other appeals with different parties. But maybe just the same parties.\n\nWe should confirm the parties list from Notice of Appeal: The snippet shows \"Respondents identified above\". But earlier in Notice of Appeal, the parties were listed: \"US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump\". Let's verify. The Notice of Appeal snippet shows part above. So we may need to include all parties.\n\nThus we need to update the existing entry. Use `update_checklist` to replace the extracted list for Appeal with new value.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist for Appeal with one entry.\n\nWe need to include evidence: snippet from Notice of Appeal (page 2). Provide text snippet: \"Respondents identified above appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit from the District Court’s Order at ECF No. 52, and its related Order at ECF No. 51.\" Also include parties snippet: \"US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump\". Provide evidence entries for both.\n\nThus patch with one extracted entry: \"Appeal: US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\"\n\nNow we need to provide evidence list: two evidence entries: one for parties, one for court. Provide text, source_document \"Notice of Appeal\", location \"Page 2\" (or token range). We can use token range 224-424. Provide location \"Page 2 of 3\" maybe.\n\nThus call update_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Appeal\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Appeal: US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J.

The checklist item: Appeal. We have one value extracted: \"Appeal: US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\"\n\nBut we need to extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. The current extraction includes all parties and court. But maybe there are other appeals mentioned elsewhere that involve different parties or courts. For example, there are other documents referencing appeals: maybe the Order (004) etc. The search results show many references to \"United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\" but not necessarily new parties. The docket entries show \"to the U.S. Court of Appeals\", but we might need to capture the parties. Let's examine other documents.\n\nWe have not yet read many unvisited documents: Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (10,050 tokens). Order (002) 12,375 tokens. Order (003) 11,528 tokens. Petitioners-Plaintiff's Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order 13,761 tokens. Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification 8,581 tokens. Also unvisited: maybe more appeals.\n\nBut the key may just be the one appeal. But we must confirm if there are other appeals. The docket shows multiple \"appeal\" entries: There may be multiple appeals filed by Respondents to the Tenth Circuit. But the parties list might be same. Let's read some of the unvisited documents for appeal references.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on unvisited docs for \"appealed to\" or \"appeal to\". Let's search in all documents for \"appeal to\" again maybe we missed matches. But step 5 already did search for pattern \"appeal to\" across all documents and found 3 matches: 2 in Docket, 1 in Notice of Appeal. But we didn't read the docket matches fully; we saw matches but maybe they contain relevant info.\n\nThe docket matches: match 1 tokens 976-1176: text includes \"Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacates this Order.\" But no parties. match 2 tokens 4547-4747: includes \"to the U.S. Court of Appeals\" but part of a docket entry: \"filed by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement... to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\" That may include parties. We need to capture parties and court. The docket entry shows parties: \"US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump\". That matches the parties in the appeal we already extracted. But maybe there are other appeals with different parties or courts. Let's search for \"United States Court of Appeals\" again to find any other appeals. Step 9's search found 16 matches across many documents. Many are just header lines of appellate documents. For example, the Appellants-Respondents' Reply has header with parties and court. That may be a distinct appeal: Parties: D.B.U., et al., Appellees - Petitioners, v. Donald J. Trump, etc. That is a different appeal. The parties differ: D.B.U. etc vs our earlier parties. So we should extract that appeal as well.\n\nWe need to extract each distinct appeal. So we have at least two appeals:\n\n1. Appealed by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement etc. to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n\n2. Appealed by D.B.U., et al. (Petitioners) vs Donald J. Trump (Respondents) to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Wait, check the header: In the Appellants-Respondents' Reply, header shows: \"Appellate Case: 25-1164 Document: 25 Date Filed: 04/27/2025 Page: 1 No. 25-1164\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\nD.B.U., et al., Appellees - Petitioners, v. DONALD J. TRUMP, ... Appellants – Respondents.\"\n\nSo the parties: Petitioner(s) = D.B.U. et al. Respondents = Donald J. Trump. But the appeal is from the district court, presumably the same court. So we need to capture that.\n\nAlso, there might be other appeals in other documents: maybe the Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal is filed by D.B.U. etc. But that might be the same appeal. So we need to ensure we capture all distinct appeals. There might be other appeals in the docket entries: For example, the docket entry at 6017-6217 includes \"USCA Case Number 25-1265 for 55 Notice of Appeal, filed by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, et al\" and \"USCA Case Number 25-1265 for 55 Notice of Appeal\". That's the same parties.\n\nAlso, the docket entries might include \"Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal\" but that's not an appeal.\n\nThus we have at least two distinct appeals.\n\nAlso, maybe there's an appeal in the Order (002) etc. Let's search those unvisited docs.\n\nWe can search for \"appeal\" pattern. Let's run search_document_regex on all documents for \"appeal\" or \"appealed\". But step 4 already did \"appealed to\" and \"appeal to\" and found matches. But maybe we need to search for \"appealed\" without \"to\". But likely the appeals are only those.\n\nBut to be safe, we should read the docket entries fully to confirm any other parties. The docket entries we saw contain the parties list. But we already captured the parties list from Notice of Appeal. But the docket match 2 tokens 4547-4747 shows the same list. So no new parties.\n\nThus we only need to add the second appeal: parties D.B.U., et al. vs Donald J. Trump. Let's confirm the parties list: \"D.B.U., et al., Appellees - Petitioners, v. DONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity as President of the United States, et al., Appellants – Respondents.\" Actually, \"Appellants – Respondents\" means Donald J. Trump is the appellant/respondent? Wait, the header says \"Appellees - Petitioners, v. Donald J. Trump, ... Appellants – Respondents.\" This indicates the petitioners are the appellees, and Donald J. Trump is the appellant/respondent. So the parties are D.B.U., et al. (petitioners/appellees) and Donald J. Trump (appellant/respondent). The appeal is to the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. So we need to format: \"Appeal: D.B.U., et al. petitioners appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\" Wait, the parties should be \"D.B.U., et al. petitioners\" or \"D.B.U., et al.\"? The format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So we can say \"Appeal: D.B.U., et al. appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\" But might also include \"Donald J. Trump\" as the appellant. But the parties in the appeal are the appellant. The parties to the appeal are the respondents? The wording: \"appealed to\" refers to the parties who are appealing. In this case, Donald J. Trump is the appellant. So \"Appeal: Donald J. Trump appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\" But the document header shows \"Appellants – Respondents.\" So Donald J. Trump is the appellant/respondent. So yes, the appeal is by Donald J. Trump. So we should capture that.\n\nBut the earlier appeal is by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, etc. So the parties list includes many. That we have.\n\nThus we need to append the second appeal. But we need to provide evidence: from the header in the Appellants-Respondents' Reply to Response to Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal. The text we saw: tokens 0-131 include the header. We should provide the evidence snippet: \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT ... D.B.U., et al., Appellees - Petitioners, v. DONALD J. TRUMP, ... Appellants – Respondents.\" So we can use that as evidence.\n\nWe also might need to verify that the earlier appeal is indeed the same parties. The earlier evidence from Notice of Appeal includes \"US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump\" and the phrase \"appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\" So we have evidence.\n\nThus we should append new entry for Appeal with parties \"D.B.U., et al.\" and court \"United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\" Provide evidence from Appellants-Respondents' Reply header.\n\nLet's formulate the append_checklist call.\n\nWe need to include evidence: text snippet from the document; source_document: the document name; location: maybe \"Page 1\" or \"tokens 0-131\" or \"document 25 page 1\". Provide the snippet.\n\nWe should ensure we are consistent with the format: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nOur new value: \"Appeal: D.B.U., et al. appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\"\n\nBut we might also want to include the parties list as \"D.B.U., et al.\" or \"D.B.U., et al. petitioners\". The requirement says \"appealing party/parties\". So we can say \"D.B.U., et al.\".\n\nThus we will append. Let's construct the payload.\n\nWe must ensure we don't duplicate existing value. The existing value is \"Appeal: US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\"\n\nWe will append the second one.\n\nWe'll use append_checklist.\n\nWe need evidence: text snippet: \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\\n\\nD.B.U., et al., Appellees - Petitioners, v. DONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity as President of the United States, et al., Appellants – Respondents.\" That includes parties and court.\n\nBut we might want to shorten snippet to include \"D.B.U., et al.,\" etc. Also include \"appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\" But the snippet may not include that phrase. But the header includes the court name. We can include that. Let's read the snippet again: tokens 0-131 of that document: text includes \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\" and then the parties. So the snippet includes court. Good.\n\nThus evidence snippet: \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\\n\\nD.B.U., et al., Appellees - Petitioners, v. DONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity as President of the United States, et al., Appellants – Respondents.\"\n\nWe can include maybe also the phrase \"Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Colorado\" but not needed.\n\nThus we will append.\n\nWe need to ensure we include the source_document name: \"Appellants-Respondents' Reply to Response to Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal\".\n\nLocation: \"Page 1\" or \"tokens 0-131\" or \"document 25 page 1\". We'll say \"Page 1\".\n\nNow produce the function call.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Appeal\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Appeal: D.B.U., et al. appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\\n\\nD.B.U., et al., Appellees - Petitioners, v.

Also token 6017-6217: \"to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\" Probably same. Also from Notice of Appeal we have one. From Appellants-Respondents' Reply we have one. Also from Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal we have an appeal (the case is in the Court of Appeals). The first match shows \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\". That likely represents an appeal; the parties are D.B.U. et al. vs Donald J. Trump etc. Already captured as D.B.U. appeals. But maybe there are other appeals: e.g., from other documents like \"Order (001)\" etc. But those are orders, not appeals. However, the Court of Appeals case numbers appear in Docket entries. We need to extract all distinct appeals: each should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]'.\n\nThus we need to find all distinct parties and courts.\n\nWe have identified:\n\n1. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, etc. appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. (From Notice of Appeal)\n\n2. D.B.U., et al. appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. (From Appellants-Respondents' Reply)\n\nAre there other appeals?

Maybe the parties are same as above: \"US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump\". That appears as parties above. The docket entry might be referencing that same notice.\n\nAlso the Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal is the motion pending appeal, but the appeal is in the same case. Might be same parties.\n\nBut there could be other appeals: \"Order (001)\" etc. Might not.\n\nWe should search remaining unvisited documents (Class Petition, Order 002, 003, Petitioners-Plaintiff's Motion, Petitioners-Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification). They might contain appeals.\n\nBut we should be systematic: use search_document_regex for pattern \"appeal to the\" across all documents. That may capture more. Also pattern \"appeal to\" maybe.\n\nWe already did search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\" earlier. It found only one match in Notice of Appeal. But we saw \"appealed to the United States Court of Appeals\" earlier? In the search, step 7 had match for \"appealed to the United States Court of Appeals\". That yielded the Notice of Appeal. So that pattern only found that one.\n\nBut there might be appeals referencing other courts: e.g., \"United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\" etc. Let's search for \"United States Court of Appeals for the\" across all documents. That may capture other appeals.\n\nAlso \"appealed to\" pattern may find others.\n\nLet's perform search_document_regex with pattern \"appealed to\" across all docs. That might find the same? But we used earlier \"appeal to\" and found 3 matches. \"appealed to\" maybe similar.\n\nAlso \"appeal from\" may appear.\n\nWe'll just do search for \"appeal\" maybe.\n\nBut to avoid reading entire doc, we can use search_document_regex.\n\nWe need to find all distinct appeals. Let's search for pattern \"appeal to\" across all docs. That will give context tokens. We already did earlier but found only 3 matches: 2 in Docket, 1 in Notice of Appeal.\n\nThe Docket matches had \"to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\" They might not contain parties. But maybe the parties are in the docket entry earlier lines: The match tokens 4547-4747 include \"US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, ... Donald J. Trump to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\" That is the parties. So we need to capture that appeal as well; but we already captured the same parties in Notice of Appeal. But the docket entry also says \"to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\" So it's same appeal. But we should ensure we have extracted each distinct value. We already have that value. So no new.\n\nBut we should consider that the docket entry may refer to a different appeal? But seems same.\n\nNow check for other appeals: maybe from \"Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal\" there is an appeal in the case. It was filed in the Court of Appeals. The parties are D.B.U. et al. vs Donald J. Trump. Already captured.\n\nThus we might have all appeals.\n\nBut we must confirm if there are appeals to other courts, like \"United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\" etc. Let's search for \"United States Court of Appeals for the\".\n\nWe can call search_document_regex.\n\nAlso search for \"appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the\" pattern.\n\nLet's proceed.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"United States Court of Appeals for the\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "United States Court of Appeals for the", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7800, "completion_tokens": 1197, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Need to check if any others. Possibly more appeals? The search for \"appeal to\" found 3 matches: 2 in Docket, 1 in Notice of Appeal. Also Docket has entries referencing \"appeal\" maybe \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\" in Docket. We need to capture all distinct appeals. So we need to extract from Docket too.\n\nCheck Docket match 1 (tokens 976-1176) shows mention of \"Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\". But does it mention the appealing parties? The snippet shows: \"Defendants SHALL NOT REMOVE Petitioners from the District of Colorado or the United States unless or until this Court or the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacates this Order.\" That is about appeal but doesn't list parties. The note earlier: \"Pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), and in order to preserve the Court's jurisdiction, Defendants SHALL NOT REMOVE Petitioners from the District of Colorado or the United States unless or until this Court or the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacates this Order.\" That could be an appeal? But parties? The parties are Petitioners and Defendants? But not explicit \"appeal to\". Might not count.\n\nBut Docket match 2 (tokens 4547-4747) includes names of parties: \"filed by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\" That is an appeal. So we need to include that as a distinct value. Also Docket match 3 (tokens 6017-6217) also includes the same parties. Might be duplicate but maybe separate docket entries. But need distinct values. So we should capture both entries separately? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So each distinct appeal entry. Could be duplicate names but might be separate docket entries. We should include separate if distinct token ranges? Might be same content but appears twice. But they are separate docket entries; still distinct values. But we might consider same appellant parties and same court. But still counted twice? Might be redundant. But safer to include both as separate items.\n\nAlso there might be other appeals like in \"Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal\" maybe the motion itself indicates appeal. But that is a motion to stay pending appeal, not necessarily an appeal. But it may mention \"appeal from the District Court\". That could be a mention of appeal. But not exactly \"appeal to\". But maybe still count as appeal? The checklist definition: \"Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\"\n\nThus we should capture from:\n\n- Notice of Appeal: parties list and court.\n- Appellants-Respondents' Reply: parties list D.B.U., et al. and court.\n- Docket entries 2 and 3: parties list and court (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement etc).\n\nAlso maybe there are other appeals in other documents not yet visited: e.g., Order (001), (002), (003), (004), (005), Petitioners-Plaintiff's etc. But likely no additional appeals.\n\nWe should read the Docket entries 2 and 3 to capture evidence. Those are partially visited: we saw snippet but not full context. We need to capture the full parties and court. We have a snippet that includes the parties and \"to the U.S. Court of Appeals\". That may suffice. We need evidence text snippet: \"filed by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\" That is good.\n\nBut need to ensure we capture the exact phrase. Might need to read the document to confirm token positions. But we already have snippet from search with context_tokens 200, but we need to provide evidence evidence with location. We can use the snippet we saw. The location token range 4547-4747 is for match 2. For match 3 token range 6017-6217.\n\nSo we should append two new values:\n\n- \"Appeal: US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump appealed to United States Court of Appeals.\"\n\n- Also maybe same parties but different docket entry; but we can combine as same entry? They are same parties and same court. But distinct entries? The instruction says distinct values. They are identical. So we might not need to duplicate. Probably we should not duplicate. So we should have one entry for that parties and court.\n\nBut we already have that extracted? We didn't yet. So we need to add one new entry.\n\nAlso we might want to include the Docket match 1? But that mentions \"Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\" but not parties. So maybe not count.\n\nThus we need to append new value for Docket match 2.\n\nAdditionally, maybe \"Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal\" includes \"Appeal from the District Court for the District of Colorado\" but not \"appealed to\". But maybe we can capture as \"Appeal: ... appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\" But the parties? It's a motion by Respondents etc. But the snippet shows \"Respondents\" etc. Might not be necessary.\n\nThus we will append one new value.\n\nWe should do append_checklist with patch containing key Appeal, extracted list with one value.\n\nEnsure evidence: text snippet, source_document: \"Docket\", location: tokens 4547-4747. Provide context snippet.\n\nLet's craft evidence:\n\n- text: \"filed by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\"\n\nsource_document: \"Docket\"\n\nlocation: \"tokens 4547-4747\"\n\nAlso maybe include token range 6017-6217? But that snippet is same parties. But it's duplicate. We can include both? But maybe not. If we want to provide evidence from both token ranges, we can combine into one entry with multiple evidence lines. That could be good. So we can include two evidence objects: one for 4547-4747 snippet, one for 6017-6217 snippet. That would support the claim.\n\nAlso we might include the earlier Notice of Appeal value: already extracted. So we just add new.\n\nThus call append_checklist.\n\nWe must ensure we do not duplicate existing value from Notice of Appeal. That one is \"Appeal: US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ... appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\" That's same parties? It lists same parties? Notice of Appeal text shows parties list: \"US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Robert Gaudian, US Department of Homeland Security, Dawn Ceja, Todd Lyons, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, US State Department, Donald J. Trump\". It matches exactly. So the Docket entry is same parties. So it's duplicate. So we might not need to add. But the Notice of Appeal already captured that. So maybe we should not add duplicate. But the Docket entry may be separate but same parties, same court. Since distinct value must be distinct. So not duplicate.\n\nThus we need to include only the unique ones: Notice of Appeal parties, D.B.U. parties, maybe the parties from Docket duplicates but same as Notice of Appeal: no need.\n\nBut maybe we should check if there's any other appeal with different parties. Maybe \"Appellants-Respondents' Reply\" includes D.B.U. parties. That is included.\n\nThus we have 2 distinct values: Notice of Appeal parties and D.B.U. parties. Already extracted. So no further action needed? But the Docket entries duplicate the Notice of Appeal parties but are duplicates; not distinct. So we don't need to add.\n\nThus all distinct values are already extracted: 2 values. So we should stop.\n\nCheck if there are any other appeals with different parties: maybe \"Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal\" mentions \"Respondents\" includes list of parties, but might not include the appeal. But it's a motion to stay pending appeal; but the appeal is from the District Court to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. The parties are the same as the Respondents: US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, etc. So it's same parties. So duplicate.\n\nThus we have all distinct values.\n\nThus we can stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct appeals have been extracted: one from Notice of Appeal (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, etc.) and one from Appellants-Respondents' Reply (D.B.U., et al.)\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct appeals have been extracted: one from Notice of Appeal (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, etc.) and one from Appellants-Respondents' Reply (D.B.U., et al.)", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8080, "completion_tokens": 1964, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
{"step": 15, "run_id": "6c199524-e337-4b4d-a62a-16be7a4711a6", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T05:58:58.610024-05:00", "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have 1 key: Appeal. Already 2 values extracted. The status shows filled 1/1, empty 0/1? Wait \"Empty Keys: 0/1\"? It says 1/1 filled, 0/1 empty. That means all keys covered. So we should stop. No missing appeals? We should verify if any other appeals might exist. There are many documents: Docket, orders, other motions, etc. Possibly there may be appeals in other documents not yet read. But we previously searched \"appealed to\" and \"appeal to\" and found matches. But maybe there are appeals to other courts, e.g., \"United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\" etc. Let's review if any other documents contain \"appealed\" but not captured. Step 12 search for \"United States Court of Appeals for the\" found matches in two documents but maybe not captured all appeals. The search results included a match in Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal but the excerpt didn't show an appeal. The excerpt maybe cut off. But likely that document does not contain an appeal. Also Docket had 16 matches of \"Court of Appeals\" but maybe includes \"appealed to\" but might be other contexts.\n\nWe might need to ensure all appeals captured. The checklist item requires all distinct appeals in any document. So we need to scan all remaining documents for any phrase indicating an appeal. We have not fully read most documents. We need to search for \"appealed to\" maybe or \"appeal to\" across all. Step 12 didn't find new matches beyond those already captured. But maybe some document contains \"appeal\" without \"to\" as part of other contexts (e.g., \"appeal of the order\"). That would still be an appeal but not necessarily to a court. But the requirement: \"Information about any appeals taken, including appealing party/parties and the appellate court. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\"\n\nSo we need to find any appeals. We might need to search pattern \"appeal to\" and \"appealed to\" again but maybe we missed due to not scanning all tokens. But step 5 found 3 matches; step 12 found 2 matches; but maybe some appeals are in documents not yet visited but still contain \"appealed to\". The search function searches across all docs. It returned matches only in those two docs. So likely there are no other appeals.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that some appeal might be to a different court e.g., \"United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\" etc. The search pattern \"appealed to\" would catch that. The pattern \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\" captured a match. The pattern \"United States Court of Appeals for the\" captured matches. Combined, probably captured all. But maybe there is an appeal to a different court like \"Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\" etc. That still includes \"United States Court of Appeals\" phrase.\n\nThus likely all appeals captured. So we should stop.\n\nAlso note that the checklist has 1 key only: Appeal. It is fully extracted. So stop.\n\nWe should return stop JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct appeals have been identified and extracted with supporting evidence.\"\n}\n```", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct appeals have been identified and extracted with supporting evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4596, "completion_tokens": 706, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
