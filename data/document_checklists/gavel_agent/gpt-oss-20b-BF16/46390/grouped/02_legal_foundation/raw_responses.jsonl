We should read the PRAYER FOR RELIEF section fully. It is from token 10050? Actually the read_document we did was 7835-10050. That included PRAYER FOR RELIEF. So we have remedy sought. We need to identify all remedy items. We also need statutory basis: the complaint lists numerous statutory violations: 8 U.S.C. § 1101, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. § 1231, 50 U.S.C. § 22, Fifth Amendment, 28 U.S.C. § 2241, etc. Also constitutional provisions: Fifth Amendment, Suspension Clause, etc.\n\nCause of action: \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.\" etc. Each claim is cause.

Let's extract the items: a) Assume jurisdiction over this matter; b) Certify this action as a class action on behalf of the proposed Petitioner Class, appoint the Petitioners as class representatives, and appoint the undersigned counsel as class counsel; c) Grant a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo pending further proceedings; d) Enjoin Respondents from transferring Petitioners out of this district during the pendency of this litigation; e) Grant a writ of habeas corpus to Petitioners that enjoins Respondents from removing them pursuant to the Proclamation; f) Declare unlawful the Proclamation; g) Enjoin Respondents from applying the Proclamation to Petitioners without providing 30-day notice and an opportunity to respond to the designation prior to the removal date; h) Award Petitioners’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, and any other applicable statute or regulation; i) Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate.\n\nAlso maybe earlier relief: \"Temporary restraining order\" and \"writ of habeas corpus\" etc.\n\nThus we need to append these. But first need to confirm that we have all cause of action and statutes. Likely the earlier part of the complaint contains the same claims. We read tokens 7835-10050 which includes claims. But we might need to read earlier tokens 7635-7835 to capture the first claim? But we saw earlier the match at 7635-7835 included the first part of the complaint: the first part listed \"SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF\" etc. But maybe the first claim is \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\" but not in snippet.

The read so far includes \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\", \"SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF\", etc. We need to capture each claim. We have tokens 7406-7606 (first claim) and 7635-10050 (rest). We likely need to read earlier tokens before 7406 to capture cause of action introduction. Let's search for \"FIRST CLAIM\" or \"Cause of Action\" earlier. Search in all docs for \"Cause of Action\" might yield earlier parts. But we already searched in complaint and got a match at tokens 7635-7835. That snippet is part of claims. There might also be \"FIRST CLAIM\" earlier maybe at token 7406-7606. We have that snippet. We may need to capture all claim headings and the statutes.\n\nWe also need Remedy_Sought: the prayer for relief includes numerous relief items. We must capture each. Those are in the snippet near the end of complaint. We should read from where prayer for relief starts to capture all relief items. That appears starting around token 9700?

The complaint likely contains sections labeled \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\" etc. The \"Cause of Action\" might be in the preamble or earlier. We should search for \"CAUSE OF ACTION\" pattern in the complaint. Also maybe other documents contain cause of action: e.g., order, docket, etc. But complaint likely contains cause of action.\n\nAlso need statutory basis: likely appear within the complaint with references to statutes like 8 U.S.C. § 1101, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, etc. We can search for \"8 U.S.C.\" pattern or \"U.S.C.\".\n\nAnd remedy sought: likely in \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" section we saw earlier. That includes remedy requests. We have snippet lines a-i etc. We have evidence for remedy.\n\nThus we should search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" pattern to capture remedy. Already found snippet but we might want full text of that section for all remedies. We have part of it. Might need to read entire section. We could use search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" to get context. We saw earlier around tokens 9303-9503. But maybe remedy list continues beyond token 9503. We should read further to capture all items a-i. So we can read from 9303 to maybe 10050? But 10050 is end of complaint. We already have read up to 10050 earlier. That includes the prayer for relief section from a to i. We have that text in the earlier read. Let's confirm if we captured all items: we saw a through i but i is \"Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate.\" Good.\n\nThus remedy sought extracted.\n\nNow need cause of action: In complaint, claims are enumerated as \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\", \"SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF\", etc. Those are likely the causes of action. We need to extract each cause of action: e.g., \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. (All Respondents)\", \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158, Asylum (All Respondents)\", etc. Also \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), Withholding of Removal (All Respondents)\", \"Violation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note (All Respondents)\", \"Ultra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 22 (All Respondents)\", \"Violation of Due Process Under the Fifth Amendment (All Respondents)\", \"Violation of Habeas Corpus (All Respondents)\". Also earlier \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\" not shown in snippet. We saw FIRST CLAIM for relief not included because earlier. We need to read the earlier part of the complaint from start until the first claim. Let's search for \"FIRST CLAIM\" pattern. Already searched for \"FIRST CLAIM\" earlier but matched tokens 7406-7606 which was near the end? Wait earlier search for \"FIRST CLAIM\" matched tokens 7406-7606, but that snippet looked like \"3 Insofar as cause of action seeks to enjoin Respondents, Petitioners do not\" - that's not the claim.

We need to read earlier part of complaint to capture claim 1. The document is 10,050 tokens; we have partially visited 7406-7606, 7635-10050. We need to read earlier tokens before 7406 to capture claim 1. Let's search for \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\" pattern again to find earlier tokens. We saw earlier match at tokens 7406-7606.

The complaint might have 8 claims. We need to capture each. We have captured 1st, 5th-8th. The 1st claim text is partially in match 1; we only saw the header and maybe part of the claim. We need more context. Let's read more tokens around 7400-7608 to capture the claim body. The read_document already fetched 7400-7600. The match 1 shows 7408-7608, but we didn't read 7600-7608. Let's read 7600-8000 to capture rest of first claim. Also might need to read further to capture claim body. The 1st claim may be longer.\n\nAlso we need statutory basis. That may be indicated within each claim, e.g., \"violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)\", etc. We can capture statutes from each claim text. Also constitutional provisions: \"U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2 (Suspension Clause).\" etc.\n\nRemedy sought: we saw in PRAYER FOR RELIEF, listing various relief. We should capture all items: a. Assume jurisdiction... b. Certify class, c. Grant temporary restraining order, d. Enjoin Respondents from transferring, e. Grant a writ of habeas corpus, f. Declare unlawful the Proclamation, g. Enjoin Respondents from applying the Proclamation, etc. There might be more items after g. We saw truncated. We need to read rest of PRAYER FOR RELIEF to capture all items. The match 5 captured up to g. but truncated. We need to read further tokens, maybe 9500-10050 to capture rest. Also earlier we read 9303-9503; that covers a-g partially. We need to read from 9503-10050. Also there may be other prayers such as \"relief sought\" beyond that.\n\nThus next action: read_document from 7600-8000 to capture rest of first claim. Also maybe read from 9503-10050 to capture rest of prayer.\n\nWe can batch two reads? No, we choose one action per turn. Let's choose read_document for a range that will capture first claim body and maybe also prayer items. We can read 7600-10050? But max 10,000 tokens per call. 7600-10050 is 2450 tokens, fine. But we might want separate for clarity. The best is read 7600-10050 to capture both. But we need to ensure we capture first claim fully; it may extend beyond 7608. Also prayer items may extend beyond 9503; we will capture up to 10050. That covers both.\n\nSo next action: read_document doc_name=Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, start_token=7600, end_token=10050.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":7600,\"end_token\":10050}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 7600, "end_token": 10050}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6420, "completion_tokens": 946, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have partially visited the main complaint. We have seen \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" section. But also need Cause_of_Action and Statutory or Constitutional Basis for the Case. We need to find claims in complaint: \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\" etc. That section indicates cause of action; but we need distinct claims: \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.\", etc. Also \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158\", etc. These are cause of action. Also \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)\", etc. Also \"Violation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act...\" etc. Also \"Ultra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 22\". Also \"Violation of Due Process Under the Fifth Amendment\". Also \"Violation of Habeas Corpus\". Also \"Enforcement of Suspension Clause\" maybe? Also \"U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, clause 2\" appears in PRAYER and in claims? The statutory basis items: 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.; 8 U.S.C. § 1158; 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); 8 U.S.C. § 22; 28 U.S.C. § 2241; 50 U.S.C. § 21; etc. Also Constitutional: U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2 (Suspension Clause); Fifth Amendment due process; etc.\n\nRemedy sought: includes list from PRAYER: jurisdiction, certification, temporary restraining order, injunction on transfer, writ of habeas corpus, declare unlawful, injunction on application of Proclamation, attorneys' fees, further relief.\n\nWe need to capture all distinct remedy items.\n\nNeed to read more of the complaint to capture all cause of action and statutory basis. We have read tokens 7400-10050 covering large portion. We saw all claims in that range. However, we might need to capture earlier part: tokens 7835-10050 already read. But we might need earlier sections for initial cause of action statement. The \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\" section we partially saw starting around token 7406-7606. That included some text but didn't show full claim title. We saw \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\" but the claim title might be above that. We need to ensure we capture each claim title: \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.\", \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158, Asylum\", etc. The matches we saw include \"VIOLATION OF 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.\" as part of claim 2; \"VIOLATION OF 8 U.S.C. § 1158, Asylum\" as part of claim 3; etc. So we need to capture each of those claim headings.\n\nAlso \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\" might have a different claim: maybe \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.\"? Wait we need to check first claim: In match 1 we saw \"first claim for relief\" but the text snippet didn't show title. But earlier maybe claim 1 is \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.\"? Actually from match 2 seems to be \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.\" could be claim 2. But claim 1 might be something else, maybe \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 21\"? Let's search again for \"FIRST CLAIM\" maybe there is earlier snippet not in the read range. Let's search the document for \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\" again but maybe earlier token ranges. But we already saw match 1 tokens 7406-7606 (the snippet). That snippet shows \"the AEA Process is not authorized by that law.\" That probably is the conclusion of claim 1. But we need the heading \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\" likely earlier. We might need to read earlier tokens 7000-7400. Let's read tokens 7000-7400 to capture claim headings. Also \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\" heading might be near 7400. Let's read 7000-8000. We have read 7400-7600. But to capture headings we need earlier. Let's read 7000-7600.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":7000,\"end_token\":7600}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 7000, "end_token": 7600}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8906, "completion_tokens": 1008, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have read many parts of the principal complaint (the Petition). The complaint includes CAUSES OF ACTION section with eight claims for relief, each with statutory basis. Also PRAYER FOR RELIEF section lists remedies sought. So we need to extract all distinct values for each key.\n\nWe have already read tokens 7000-10050, includes CAUSES OF ACTION and PRAYER FOR RELIEF. But we may need to read earlier portions of the complaint for the first claim text. But the section includes \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" heading and then each claim with its title and description. There's also earlier \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" heading maybe at token 6500? But we read 7000-10050 which covers all claims and PRAYER. We need to ensure we capture all claim titles and their statutory basis. The claims are:\n\n1. Ultra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 21, et seq. (All Respondents)\n2. Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. (All Respondents)\n3. Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158, Asylum (All Respondents)\n4. Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), Withholding of Removal (All Respondents)\n5. Violation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note (All Respondents)\n6. Ultra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 22 (All Respondents)\n7. Violation of Due Process Under the Fifth Amendment (All Respondents)\n8. Violation of Habeas Corpus (All Respondents)\n\nThese are the cause of action names. The statutory basis for each: need to list the statutory or constitutional citations. For each cause of action, we need to capture the legal basis. For example:\n\n- 50 U.S.C. § 21\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1101\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1158\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note (FARRA) (actually 8 U.S.C. § 1231, note maybe FARRA)\n- 50 U.S.C. § 22\n- Fifth Amendment (U.S. Const. amend. V)\n- 28 U.S.C. § 2241; U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2 (Suspension Clause)\n\nAlso maybe the claim for Violation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note. So statutory basis includes 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note.\n\nAdditionally, the cause of action \"Ultra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 21, et seq.\" may also include 50 U.S.C. § 21, et seq. So include that citation.\n\nThe cause of action \"Ultra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 22\" includes 50 U.S.C. § 22.\n\nThe cause of action \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.\" includes that.\n\n\"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158, Asylum\" includes that.\n\n\"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), Withholding of Removal\" includes that.\n\n\"Violation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note\" includes that.\n\n\"Violation of Due Process Under the Fifth Amendment\" includes Fifth Amendment.\n\n\"Violation of Habeas Corpus\" includes 28 U.S.C. § 2241; U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2.\n\nSo for each cause of action we will list the statutory or constitutional basis. But we might need to extract each basis as separate values? The checklist key is \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\" – likely expecting a list of all statutory or constitutional citations. So we need to include each distinct citation. We also have multiple citations in a single cause (e.g., \"28 U.S.C. § 2241; U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2\"). So we should list them all separately.\n\nNow Remedy_Sought: The PRAYER FOR RELIEF section lists items a through i. Each item includes specific remedies: a. Assume jurisdiction; b. Certify class action; c. Grant a temporary restraining order; d. Enjoin Respondents from transferring Petitioners out of district; e. Grant a writ of habeas corpus; f. Declare unlawful the Proclamation; g. Enjoin Respondents from applying the Proclamation to Petitioners without 30-day notice; h. Award attorneys' fees under Equal Access to Justice Act, etc.; i. Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, appropriate.\n\nAlso possibly other relief earlier in the complaint? But PRAYER lists all. Also earlier the complaint says \"among other things, an order declaring the Proclamation unlawful and an injunction preventing enforcement of the Proclamation.\" But that's covered.\n\nSo we need to extract each remedy as separate values. Should we include the text of each remedy? Yes.\n\nNow we need to produce append_checklist with key-value entries and evidence. The evidence must include text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe have evidence from tokens 7000-10050. We need to capture the relevant tokens for each. For each cause of action, we need evidence snippet that contains the cause title and statutory basis. We have the snippet lines. For each remedy, we need snippet of the PRAYER text.\n\nWe need to gather the tokens for each. We saw tokens 7000-10050 include the PRAYER text. The snippet includes:\n\n```\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully pray this Court to: \na.  Assume jurisdiction over this matter; \nb.  Certify this action as a class action on behalf of the proposed Petitioner Class, appoint the \nPetitioners as class representatives, and appoint the undersigned counsel as class counsel; \nc.  Grant a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo pending further \nproceedings; \nd.  Enjoin Respondents from transferring Petitioners out of this district during the pendency \nof this litigation; \ne.  Grant a writ of habeas corpus to Petitioners that enjoins Respondents from removing \nthem pursuant to the Proclamation; \nf.  Declare unlawful the Proclamation; \ng.  Enjoin Respondents from applying the Proclamation to Petitioners without providing 30- \nday notice and an opportunity to respond to the designation prior to the removal date; \nh.  Award Petitioners’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice \nAct, and any other applicable statute or regulation; and \ni.  Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate. \n```\n\nWe can capture each line. The source_document is \"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". The location can be \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF section\". Or page 22? The snippet shows page 22. But we can just include location: \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" or \"page 22\".\n\nFor each cause of action, snippet:\n\nWe have lines:\n\n```\nCAUSES OF ACTION\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUltra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 21, et seq. \n(All Respondents)\n...\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. \n(All Respondents)\n...\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158, Asylum \n(All Respondents)\n...\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), Withholding of Removal \n(All Respondents)\n...\nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), \ncodified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note \n(All Respondents)\n...\nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUltra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 22  \n(All Respondents)\n...\nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of Due Process Under the Fifth Amendment \n(All Respondents)\n...\nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of Habeas Corpus \n(All Respondents)\n```\n\nWe need to capture each title and its statutory basis. Some titles include the statutory basis in the title itself. Eg \"Ultra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 21, et seq.\" includes citation. The \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.\" includes. \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158, Asylum\" includes. \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), Withholding of Removal\" includes. \"Violation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note\" includes. \"Ultra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 22\" includes. \"Violation of Due Process Under the Fifth Amendment\" includes Fifth Amendment. \"Violation of Habeas Corpus\" includes 28 U.S.C. § 2241; U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2.\n\nThus we need to extract each citation separately. For each cause, we might add multiple entries for statutory basis. The key \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\" will list each citation. So we need to list all unique citations: 50 U.S.C. § 21, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note (FARRA), 50 U.S.C. § 22, Fifth Amendment (U.S. Const. amend. V), 28 U.S.C. § 2241, U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2.\n\nAlso maybe \"et seq.\" is part of citation. Should we include \"et seq.\"? Probably yes.\n\nNow the Cause_of_Action list of eight distinct cause titles. We'll extract each as separate values.\n\nNow the Remedy_Sought list of 9 items (a-i). We'll extract each.\n\nNow we need to produce append_checklist with patches for each key. Provide evidence for each.\n\nWe need to ensure that for each extracted entry, we provide evidence snippet. The snippet should be verbatim text from the document. We have the snippet from PRAYER. For cause of action, we have snippet lines above. We need to include the snippet exactly. We can quote the text. For each cause, we can include \"Ultra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 21, et seq.\" etc.\n\nWe also need to include location. For PRAYER items, location: \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\", page 22. For causes, location: \"CAUSES OF ACTION\" section or page 18-22. The snippet shows page numbers in the text. For example, \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 1 filed 04/12/25 USDC Colorado pg 22 of 24\" appears before PRAYER. So location can be \"page 22\".\n\nFor cause of action, we have page numbers earlier: for example, \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 1 filed 04/12/25 USDC Colorado pg 18 of 24\" appears before cause section. For each cause, location can be \"page 18-22\" but we can specify page 18 for first claims, page 19 for second, etc. But we don't have precise mapping. But we can provide location as \"CASES OF ACTION section\" but we need to include location. Maybe we can use the page number preceding each claim. In the snippet, before \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\" appears \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 1 filed 04/12/25 USDC Colorado pg 18 of 24\". So location: \"page 18\". For second claim, the snippet shows \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 1 filed 04/12/25 USDC Colorado pg 19 of 24\". So location: \"page 19\". For third claim, page 20. Fourth claim, page 20. Fifth claim, page 20. Sixth claim, page 21. Seventh claim, page 21. Eighth claim, page 22. So we can assign accordingly.\n\nBut the snippet in the read didn't show page numbers for each claim, but we saw them in the fragments. We can extract each from the snippet.\n\nNow we need to perform the action: append_checklist. So next action: append_checklist with patches for three keys and the extracted values.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't miss any. Let's list all cause titles:\n\n1. Ultra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 21, et seq.\n2. Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.\n3. Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158, Asylum\n4. Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), Withholding of Removal\n5. Violation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note\n6. Ultra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 22\n7. Violation of Due Process Under the Fifth Amendment\n8. Violation of Habeas Corpus\n\nNow statutory basis citations:\n\n- 50 U.S.C. § 21, et seq.\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1158\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)\n- 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note (FARRA)\n- 50 U.S.C. § 22\n- Fifth Amendment (U.S. Const. amend. V)\n- 28 U.S.C. § 2241\n- U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2\n\nRemedy items:\n\na. Assume jurisdiction over this matter;\nb. Certify this action as a class action on behalf of the proposed Petitioner Class, appoint the Petitioners as class representatives, and appoint the undersigned counsel as class counsel;\nc. Grant a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo pending further proceedings;\nd. Enjoin Respondents from transferring Petitioners out of this district during the pendency of this litigation;\ne. Grant a writ of habeas corpus to Petitioners that enjoins Respondents from removing them pursuant to the Proclamation;\nf. Declare unlawful the Proclamation;\ng. Enjoin Respondents from applying the Proclamation to Petitioners without providing 30-day notice and an opportunity to respond to the designation prior to the removal date;\nh. Award Petitioners’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, and any other applicable statute or regulation; and\ni. Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate.\n\nEach remedy is a separate entry. Provide evidence snippet for each.\n\nThe evidence snippet for each remedy can be the line from PRAYER text. For example, \"a.  Assume jurisdiction over this matter;\" We'll include that line.\n\nNow we need to produce the JSON patch. The structure:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Cause_of_Action\",\n      \"extracted\": [ ... entries ... ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\",\n      \"extracted\": [ ... entries ... ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Remedy_Sought\",\n      \"extracted\": [ ... entries ... ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nEach entry:\n\n{\n  \"value\": \"...\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"...\",\n      \"source_document\": \"...\",\n      \"location\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each extracted value. For cause of action, the evidence snippet includes the title. For statutory basis, we can use the same snippet as evidence.\n\nBut for statutory basis, the evidence snippet should contain the citation. For example, for 50 U.S.C. § 21, we can include the snippet \"Ultra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 21, et seq.\" For 8 U.S.C. § 1101, snippet \"Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.\"\n\nBetter to include each snippet within the same evidence. For each statutory basis, we can use the snippet that contains that citation. So for each, we can include the same snippet text.\n\nNow for remedy items, we can include the snippet lines.\n\nNow we need to determine the source_document: \"Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\".\n\nNow location: For cause of action, we can use the page number as extracted. For simplicity, we can use \"page 18\" etc. But we need to provide location string.\n\nWe can include location like \"page 18\" for first claim, \"page 19\" for second, etc. But we need to confirm page numbers. The snippet includes:\n\n```\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 1 filed 04/12/25 USDC Colorado pg 18 of 24\n...\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 1 filed 04/12/25 USDC Colorado pg 19 of 24\n...\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 1 filed 04/12/25 USDC Colorado pg 20 of 24\n...\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 1 filed 04/12/25 USDC Colorado pg 21 of 24\n...\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01163-CNS Document 1 filed 04/12/25 USDC Colorado pg 22 of 24\n```\n\nWe can use those.\n\nFor remedy items, location: \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF, page 22\".\n\nNow we need to produce the function call. Let's draft the payload.\n\nWe need to ensure each value is unique. For statutory basis, duplicate citations like 50 U.S.C. § 21 and 50 U.S.C. § 22, etc. Also \"Fifth Amendment\" appears twice? We only list once. But we might also need to include \"et seq.\" as part of citation. We'll include exactly as appears.\n\nThus, the list:\n\nStatutory/Constitutional basis:\n\n1. 50 U.S.C. § 21, et seq.\n2. 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.\n3. 8 U.S.C. § 1158\n4. 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)\n5. 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note (FARRA)\n6. 50 U.S.C. § 22\n7.

But we need to verify completeness: Are there any other documents that might contain additional causes of action, statutory bases, or remedies? The other documents are orders, motions, etc. It's likely that the petition contains all claims; orders might not add new causes. But maybe the emergency motion for stay or other pleadings might list additional claims or remedies. But the checklist is for the case; we need all distinct values that are present in the corpus.\n\nWe should check if other documents contain any additional claims or remedies not in the petition. For safety, we could search for \"Cause of Action\" or \"CLAIM\" or \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" or \"Remedy\" in all documents.\n\nWe have 11 other documents. We could search for \"CAUSE OF ACTION\" pattern across all docs, but we already saw many claims in petition. Orders may not contain cause of action. But other pleadings like emergency motion or motion for class certification might list claims. But the checklist items require the legal claim(s) asserted; these are typically in the complaint. So likely no new cause.\n\nBut the statutory bases might be repeated in other documents but same list.\n\nRemedy sought: The petition lists all. Other pleadings may also request certain remedies but may not add new ones. But could add additional remedies, e.g., \"request for preliminary injunction\" etc. The petition has many remedy items.\n\nWe should search other documents for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" or \"Remedy\". But the orders likely not. But maybe the emergency motion for stay may request stay of proceedings, but that's not a remedy sought from the court in the case? Wait the petition is the initial complaint. The other documents are subsequent motions, replies, etc. They may request new remedies e.g., stay of removal order. But those are not part of the initial claim, but could be considered remedy sought. The checklist might require all remedy sought in the case, not just initial. But likely the petition covers all remedy sought.\n\nGiven we have extracted 9 remedy items. The petition lists 9 items from a to i. That seems complete.\n\nWe should check if there are any other remedy items like \"decline to remove\" etc. But likely not.\n\nThus we might be done. But we need to confirm no other documents contain new causes of action or remedies.\n\nWe can do a quick search across all docs for \"CAUSE OF ACTION\" to ensure no other claims.

Could there be more cause of action in other documents? The complaint likely contains all claims. But maybe other documents contain additional claims? The complaint is main pleading. Usually cause of action are stated in complaint. It's likely complete. But we must verify if any other documents contain additional claims that weren't captured.
