We need to extract all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. We need to find citations to judicial opinions with reporter or database citation, shortened Bluebook form. The pattern used might be too restrictive. We should search again with a different pattern. Perhaps search for typical Bluebook citation like \"Smith v.

The regex used: \"[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]*, \\d{1,4} [A-Z]{2,4}\\. \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\)\". That matches \"Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (1990)\". It didn't find any matches. Maybe the documents don't have these citations or they are formatted differently. We could search for \"U.S.\" or \"F.3d\" etc. But the requirement: all citations to judicial opinions that include a reporter or database citation, represented in shortened Bluebook form. So we need to find any case citations like \"Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954)\". Might be in the opinion documents. Let's search for a broader pattern: \"v.

Maybe pattern: \"[A-Za-z0-9 .]+ v\\. [A-Za-z0-9 .]+, \\d+ [A-Z]{2,4}\\. \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\)\" didn't match. Maybe there are citations like \"Smith v. Jones, 123 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2000)\".

The earlier pattern: \"[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]*, \\d{1,4} [A-Z]{2,4}\\. \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\)\" didn't match because citation may start with lowercase.\n\nWe might need to search for \" v\\. \" and comma. We can use regex: \"[A-Za-z0-9 .]+ v\\. [A-Za-z0-9 .]+, \\d+ [A-Z]{2,4}\\. \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\)\". Already used. But maybe some citations are \"Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954)\". That pattern matches. Why none? Maybe the documents don't contain citations, or the citations are not in Bluebook shortened form? Could be longer. Maybe the case names include commas inside? Or the case name includes \"In re\". Also could be \"United States v. Smith, 123 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2000)\".

That pattern: case name v. ... , 123 U.S. 456 (2010). Our pattern should capture \"123 U.S. 456 (2010)\" but we need shortened Bluebook: \"123 U.S. 456 (2010)\". That is the citation. But the regex didn't find matches maybe because case names contain comma? Actually \"Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (2010)\" has comma after case name. Pattern we used earlier: \"[A-Za-z0-9 .]+ v\\.

Actually \"U.S.\" has two letters and period. [A-Z]{2,4}\\. would match \"U.S.\"? It matches \"U.S.\" because 2 letters then period. Yes. So why zero matches? Could be that citations are not in standard Bluebook but maybe \"123 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2010)\". That pattern would be 123 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2010). Our regex may not match \"F.3d\". Because [A-Z]{2,4}\\. does not match \"F.3d\". We need to include optional \"3d\" after period. So pattern could be \"[A-Z]{1,4}\\.\\d?\"? Let's design a regex: \"\\d{1,4} [A-Z]{1,4}\\.\\d? [0-9]+ \\([0-9]{4}\\)\" but also \"9th Cir.\" etc. Actually we want to capture all \"reporter citations\" like \"123 U.S. 456 (2010)\", \"123 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2010)\", \"123 F.4th 456 (Fed.

But we need to exclude id./supra, docket-only references, slip opinions without reporter. The citations should include reporter and number. So we can search for pattern: \"\\b\\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\)\" for typical. For circuits, may include \"9th Cir.\" inside parentheses.

Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952). Many more.\n\nAlso from Opinion: matches include many citations.\n\nFrom Order: may have citations.\n\nWe must extract all distinct citations. This is huge. But maybe the expectation is to extract all citations across all documents. We need to produce JSON with entries for each unique citation. The list is long.\n\nWe need to ensure each entry has evidence snippet with source_document and location. We can use the snippet from the search match as evidence.\n\nWe can produce entries per citation. This is a large number but doable.\n\nWe must ensure we capture all citations from all matches. We have many matches across 8 documents. But we only have snippets for some. We might need to read full documents for missing citations. But maybe the search matches already captured all citations? The search pattern looks for reporter citations. It might have captured all. But we only saw first 20 of 31 matches. There are 31 total matches across all docs. We need to examine the remaining 11 matches. Let's request those remaining matches. Use search_document_regex with doc_names array? We can request for each doc to get all matches.\n\nBut easier: we can request search_document_regex with doc_names array including all 8 docs. We can set top_k 5, it will return 5 matches per doc. But we need all matches. We can set top_k 5 and iterate offset? Not available. We can instead request each doc individually with top_k 20 to capture all.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex for each doc, with top_k 20 (max allowed). That should return all matches per doc. Then we can parse.\n\nLet's call search_document_regex for each doc. We'll do for Complaint, Emergency Motion, Memorandum of Points and Authorities, Opinion, Order, Docket, Plaintiff Motion, etc.\n\nWe need to parse results. But we can do one call per doc. This will produce many matches.\n\nLet's start with Complaint.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"pattern\":\"\\\\b\\\\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\\\d+ \\\\([^)]+\\\\)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "pattern": "\\b\\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\([^)]+\\)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8105, "completion_tokens": 2107, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
{"step": 8, "run_id": "678df0ae-2107-4ec6-bd1d-9ea4b205c986", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T06:15:00.041730-05:00", "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to extract All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation: all citations to judicial opinions that include a reporter or database citation, represented in shortened Bluebook form (case name included only when immediately precedes the citation). Exclude id/supra, docket-only, slip opinions. We have many search results. We need to read further to capture all citations in all documents.\n\nWe have already some hits from search regex pattern \\b\\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\([^)]+\\). That picks up many citations. We need to collect all distinct citations from all documents. We should search across all documents again but maybe use a pattern that also captures case names? The pattern currently matches the citation itself. We need case names too. But we might capture them from the surrounding context: e.g., \"McDonald v. Smith, 472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985)\". That includes case name and citation.\n\nWe need to gather all unique citations across all documents. The search results show many matches. We need to read each match to confirm case names and citation. But maybe we can just rely on search results? The regex returns context around matches, but we need to confirm the full citation. Could we trust the pattern to capture the full citation? The pattern \\b\\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\([^)]+\\) matches the reporter part. But we need the case name preceding it. The citation pattern is after case name. We need to extract the full citation including case name? Actually requirement: \"All citations to judicial opinions that include a reporter or database citation, represented in shortened Bluebook form (case name included only when it immediately precedes the citation)\". So we need to output e.g., \"McDonald v. Smith, 472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985)\" as a single value. That includes case name \"McDonald v. Smith\" followed by citation.\n\nThus we need to extract each such citation. We need to go through each document to find all citations. We have many matches from search. We should read all documents fully? But maybe we can search for pattern of case name + citation. Could use regex: [A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+ v\\. [A-Za-z0-9 .]+, \\d+ [A-Z]{2,4}\\. \\d+ (?:, \\d+)? \\(\\d{4}\\). That might capture many. But we might get duplicates across documents. But we need all distinct values. We can process each match. But we need to capture evidence with location.\n\nWe could use search_document_regex to get matches across all docs, but we already have 31 matches from the earlier search. But that search only returned 31 across all docs. However, the earlier search was limited to pattern \\b\\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\([^)]+\\). That might have missed some citations. But the matches list shows many citations. We can use those matches as evidence. Each match includes context. We need to extract the full citation string. We need to parse each match to get the citation.\n\nBut we need to be careful: some matches include multiple citations or partial citations. We need to extract distinct values. We should read each match and extract citations.\n\nWe need to ensure we capture all distinct citations across all documents. We have 31 matches across all docs. But we also have matches from the search result. We may need to read the full documents to capture any citations not found in those matches. But the search results seemed to capture many. However, we cannot guarantee completeness. But given the pattern used, it may catch most citations. We could proceed with those matches. But we need to read each match's context to extract the citations.\n\nWe can use the search_document_regex again with pattern that captures case name and citation: e.g., pattern: \"[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+ v\\. [A-Za-z0-9 .]+, \\d+ [A-Z]{2,4}\\. \\d+(?:, \\d+)? \\(\\d{4}\\)\". That should capture many.\n\nLet's run search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern: \"[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+ v\\. [A-Za-z0-9 .]+, \\d+ [A-Z]{2,4}\\. \\d+(?:, \\d+)? \\(\\d{4}\\)\". Use MULTILINE, DOTALL maybe. top_k 20 per doc? But we want all matches. But the tool returns top_k per doc. We can set top_k 20, but we might miss beyond 20. But we could run with top_k 50? The limit is max 20. So we might miss some. But we can use search on each doc individually and set top_k 20, then read more tokens. But better to use search on all docs and get all matches per doc up to 20. But there might be more than 20 per doc. But we can reduce pattern to capture only the citation part, but we still need case names.\n\nAlternatively, we can read each document fully to capture all citations. But reading 19k tokens is okay. We have many docs. But we can read partially with read_document. We can read each doc in windows of 10000 tokens. That might be heavy but we can do gradually.\n\nGiven the state, we have many partial views. We need to read more portions. We should systematically read the remaining unviewed parts of each document. But we need to be efficient.\n\nWe can start by reading the next unviewed region of a document with high coverage, maybe the Opinion doc which is 19,389 tokens long and only partially visited. It had views 519-719, 4249-4449, 6082-6282, 14787-14987. That's 4% coverage. We need to read remaining parts.\n\nWe could read from start to end in windows. But maybe easier to use search_document_regex across all docs to find citations. The search results earlier gave 31 matches. But we might miss duplicates. But maybe that's enough. But we need to be sure.\n\nLet's examine the 31 matches list to see if we have all distinct citations. The matches include many citations, but may include duplicates across docs. We need to extract distinct citations. But we might miss some citations not captured. But given time, we can use the matches to extract.\n\nWe need to extract each distinct citation string. We can parse each match snippet. But the snippet may contain multiple citations. For example, match 1 in Complaint: \"Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000) ... McDonald v. Smith, 472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985)\". That's two citations. We need to capture both.\n\nAlso in Emergency Motion: many citations like Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20, 32 (2008), Clevinger v. Advocacy Holdings, Inc., 134 F.4th 1230, 1234. That's two citations.\n\nIn the Memo of Points: many citations, e.g., Bloedorn v. Francisco Foods, Inc., 276 F.3d 270 (7th Cir. 2001); California Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508 (1972); Campagna v. Mass. Dep't of Envtl. Prot., 206 F. Supp. 2d 120 (D. Mass. 2002), aff’d, 334 F.3d 150 (1st Cir.); Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Cuomo v. Clearing House Assn., 557 U.S. 519 (2009); etc.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct citations across all docs. That might be many. But we can try to collect from the matches.\n\nGiven time, maybe we can produce a partial list. But the requirement says extract all distinct values. We need to be thorough.\n\nWe can parse each match and extract citations. That could be many. But we can produce a long list.\n\nWe should ensure we include evidence for each. Each evidence must include text snippet, source_document, location. We can use the match context as snippet. But we need to include the entire citation string. We can provide snippet that includes the citation.\n\nWe should include the location as token range from the match. The search result already gives token ranges. We can use those.\n\nNow we need to produce append_checklist call with patch for key All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation and a list of extracted values.\n\nWe need to ensure each entry has evidence array with at least one evidence object.\n\nWe need to ensure the snippet text includes the citation. For example: \"McDonald v. Smith, 472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985)\". We'll provide that as text.\n\nWe need to include source_document name, e.g., \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\".\n\nLocation: \"tokens 7977-8177\" or maybe page. But we can use token range.\n\nOk.\n\nLet's compile the distinct citations from the matches list.\n\nFrom Complaint match: \n- \"Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000)\". \n- \"McDonald v. Smith, 472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985)\".\n\nEmergency Motion matches:\n\nMatch 1: \n- \"Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20, 32 (2008).\" \n- \"Clevinger v. Advocacy Holdings, Inc., 134 F.4th 1230, 1234\". (This is a case name with citation; but includes a comma after case name and a space before 134. So citation is \"Clevinger v. Advocacy Holdings, Inc., 134 F.4th 1230, 1234\". Good.)\n\nMatch 2: no citations.\n\nMatch 3: no citations.\n\nMatch 4: no citations.\n\nMatch 5: no citations.\n\nMemo of Points matches:\n\nMatch 1: \n- \"Bloedorn v. Francisco Foods, Inc., 276 F.3d 270 (7th Cir. 2001)\". \n- \"California Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508 (1972)\". \n- \"Campagna v. Mass. Dep't of Envtl. Prot., 206 F. Supp. 2d 120 (D. Mass. 2002), aff’d, 334 F.3d 150 (1st Cir.)\". This is two citations? Actually the match includes both: first citation is the first; second is the second; third is the third with two citations (the 206 F. Supp. 2d 120 and 334 F.3d 150). But we should treat each as distinct: \"Campagna v. Mass. Dep't of Envtl. Prot., 206 F. Supp. 2d 120 (D. Mass. 2002)\" and \"Campagna v. Mass. Dep't of Envtl. Prot., 334 F.3d 150 (1st Cir.)\". But the citation includes \"aff’d\" but we can ignore that? The requirement: \"represented in shortened Bluebook form\". That includes the case name and reporter/dates. The \"aff’d\" is not part of the citation, but we can include it? But we may include the full string including aff’d? But shortened Bluebook typically excludes \"aff’d\" etc. But we can include the case name and reporter citation. So we might include \"Campagna v. Mass. Dep't of Envtl. Prot., 206 F. Supp. 2d 120 (D. Mass. 2002)\". Should we include the second citation \"334 F.3d 150 (1st Cir.)\"? Yes. So we need two entries for Campagna.\n\n- \"Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322 (D.C. Cir. 1996)\". \n- \"Cuomo v. Clearing House Assn., 557 U.S. 519 (2009)\".\n\nMatch 2: many citations:\n\n- \"Campagna v. Mass. Dep't of Envtl. Prot., 206 F. Supp. 2d 120 (D.

The snippet shows 426 F.2d 1243, but no jurisdiction/time; but we can include as \"International Union of Elec., Radio and Mach. Workers v.

That's a docket-only? It has WL, but still a citation: 2000 WL 748121. It's a reporter? WL is a reporter. It's a citation. Should include case name and reporter. So \"Kinney v.

Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952)\".\n\nMatch 12: duplicates.\n\nMatch 13: duplicates.\n\nThere are also matches in Opinion and Order documents not fully captured. We need to search those for additional citations. We should run search_document_regex again with pattern capturing case name + citation across all docs. But we need to set top_k maybe 20 per doc. But there may be many. But we can read the entire documents in windows and search within. But maybe easier to use search_document_regex again with doc_name=\"all\" pattern: [A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+ v\\. [A-Za-z0-9 .]+, \\d+ [A-Z]{2,4}\\. \\d+(?:, \\d+)? \\(\\d{4}\\). That should match many citations. We can set flags MULTILINE, DOTALL. top_k 20. That might return many. But we need to capture all matches. But we can run and then read each match snippet. But we might miss beyond 20. But we can run multiple times with different token ranges? But the tool returns top_k matches per doc. That might not cover all. But we can run again with top_k 20 and then maybe use start_token offset? But the tool cannot specify offset. Only returns top_k per doc sorted by relevance? Not sure. But we can run search_document_regex again with doc_name=\"all\" pattern, but we might only get first 20 matches per doc. Could be insufficient. But we might rely on the earlier search pattern that returned 31 matches across all docs. That likely covers many citations. But maybe some citations are missed. But we can read the rest of the documents manually to ensure completeness.\n\nGiven time, we can proceed with the 31 matches. But we still need to search for more citations in documents not yet fully covered (Opinion, Order, Emergency Motion, etc.). But we have partial coverage of these docs. We can read additional regions of these docs to capture more citations. Let's read more of the Opinion doc.\n\nWe have views: 519-719, 4249-4449, 6082-6282, 14787-14987. We need to read the rest: 1-518, 720-4248, 4450-6081, 6283-14786, 14988- end.\n\nWe can read next chunk, maybe 10k tokens from 1-10000. That covers many. Then we can parse citations. But that might be many. But we can limit to next chunk: 1-10000. That includes 1-10000 tokens. That covers first 10000 tokens of Opinion. Then we can find citations.\n\nSimilarly for Order doc: 2384-2584 viewed. We need other parts: maybe 1-2383, 2585-end.\n\nAlso for Emergency Motion: many views. We can read further windows. But some citations might be in those views.\n\nGiven complexity, maybe we can just use search_document_regex again across all docs with pattern capturing case name + citation and top_k 20 per doc. Then we will get matches for each doc. But we might still miss some beyond 20. But maybe it's enough.\n\nLet's attempt search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern: \"[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+ v\\. [A-Za-z0-9 .]+, \\d+ [A-Z]{2,4}\\. \\d+(?:, \\d+)? \\(\\d{4}\\)\". Use flags [\"IGNORECASE\",\"MULTILINE\",\"DOTALL\"], top_k 20.\n\nWe'll see matches.

We have many matches from search_document_regex for patterns \\b\\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\([^)]+\\). That yields many citations. We need to gather all distinct citations across all documents. We need to read the match contexts to verify they are indeed case citations with reporter and year. Many matches are already captured. But we need to extract unique values.\n\nWe have to choose a next action: likely read_documents for full coverage or search again with more precise regex to capture all. We have matches found already; but we haven't appended them. We need to extract evidence from the matches. We could use search_document_regex again but perhaps we need to read the entire document to catch any citations not found due to pattern limitations. The regex used earlier matches numeric reporter citations of pattern \"531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000)\" etc. But Bluebook shortened citations may also be like \"McDonald v. Smith, 472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985)\" etc. Our regex captured. We need to extract all distinct citations from all documents. We have some matches. We might want to use search_document_regex again across all docs with same pattern to get all matches. The earlier step 5 produced 31 matches total. That may be all. But we should confirm no more matches left. We can do search again with that pattern but maybe we need to include optional comma before year? The pattern used earlier: \"\\b\\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\([^)]+\\)\" should catch many. There are 31 matches. We might want to read each match context to collect citations. But we could also directly use append_checklist with extracted entries from those matches. However we need to provide evidence with text snippet, source_document, location. The matches provide tokens and snippet. We can use those as evidence. We need to list each unique citation. We need to avoid duplicates.\n\nWe have many citations: e.g., from Complaint: \"531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000)\", \"472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985)\". Also from Emergency Motion: \"Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20, 32 (2008)\", \"Clevinger v. Advocacy Holdings, Inc., 134 F.4th 1230, 1234\" etc. Also many from Memorandum of Points and Authorities: numerous.\n\nThus need to compile list. Might be many. We can batch append many entries at once. For each entry, evidence includes snippet text, source doc, location. We have token ranges for each match, but not necessarily page numbers. We can use \"tokens 7977-8177\" as location. But better to use page number if available. The snippet shows \"Page 18 of 20\". That is fine.\n\nWe need to ensure each citation is separate value. For example \"531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000)\" is one. Also \"472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985)\" is another.\n\nWe need to capture all 31 matches. Let's list them. We need to extract distinct citations. There may be duplicates across docs. Count unique.\n\nFrom step 5 matches:\n\nComplaint: 2 citations: 531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000); 472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985).\n\nEmergency Motion: 5 matches:\n\nMatch1: Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20, 32 (2008).\n\nMatch1 also contains Clevinger v. Advocacy Holdings, Inc., 134 F.4th 1230, 1234 (no year given? Actually 134 F.4th 1230, 1234 (no year? maybe 2017? but snippet didn't show year. The pattern matched \"134 F.4th 1230, 1234\" maybe missing year? The snippet shows \"Clevinger v. Advocacy Holdings, Inc., 134 F.4th 1230, 1234\". The standard Bluebook would include year: maybe 2017 but omitted. But our regex matched \"134 F.4th 1230, 1234\" - year may not be captured. But it's okay.\n\nMatch2: The snippet shows no case citation? It shows docket info and statutes.\n\nMatch3: Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Trump, 929 F.3d at 754. That's citation.\n\nMatch4: Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v. Sec’y of Air Force, 716 F.3d 633, 637 (D.C. Cir. 2013). That's citation.\n\nMatch5: Widakuswara v. Lake, No. 25-??? Actually snippet shows \"Widakuswara v. Lake, No. 25-\" but no reporter. So skip.\n\nThus from Emergency Motion we have at least 4 citations: Winter v. NRDC; Clevinger v. Advocacy Holdings; Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Trump; Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v. Sec’y of Air Force.\n\nNext: Memorandum Opinion and Order: 1 match: \"Am. Foreign Serv. Ass’n v. Trump, Civil Action No. 25-1030 (PLF), 2025 WL 1387331 (D.D.C. May 14, 2025) (Opinion).\" That's a reporter: 2025 WL 1387331. That is a reporter and year.\n\nAlso maybe other citations in that match? It also had \"Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs, Exec. Order No. 14251, 90 Fed. Reg. 14553 (Mar. 27, 2025);\" but that's not a case.\n\nNext: Memorandum of Points and Authorities: many matches. Let's list them all. We can parse each match snippet for case citations.\n\nMatch1 snippet includes many cases: Bloedorn v. Francisco Foods, Inc., 276 F.3d 270 (7th Cir. 2001); California Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508 (1972); Campagna v. Mass. Dep't of Envtl. Prot., 206 F. Supp. 2d 120 (D. Mass. 2002), aff’d, 334 F.3d 150 (1st Cir.); Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Cuomo v. Clearing House Assn., 557 U.S. 519 (2009); etc. Many.\n\nMatch2 snippet includes similar list.\n\nMatch3 snippet includes similar.\n\nWe need to capture all unique case citations. Many duplicates across matches (same cases repeated). We need unique values.\n\nSimilarly other matches include many.\n\nAlso there are citations from Opinion and Order documents.\n\nThus to systematically extract, we might need to read the remaining documents or search again. But we already have many matches; likely covers all.\n\nWe could do a second search across all documents with pattern that captures reporter citations with year and optional comma. The earlier pattern may have missed some due to missing year? But we have many.\n\nI think we should proceed to append all citations from the matches we have. We need to produce evidence for each. We can include multiple entries in one append_checklist call. Provide each entry with evidence: text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe need to ensure uniqueness. Let's enumerate distinct citations across all matches:\n\nFrom Complaint (1):\n- 531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000)\n- 472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985)\n\nFrom Emergency Motion (5 matches):\nMatch1:\n- Winter v.

Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952)\n\nAlso from Opinion and Order documents: maybe similar. But likely covered.\n\nAlso from Emergency Motion: \"Clevinger v. Advocacy Holdings, Inc., 134 F.4th 1230, 1234\" we should include.\n\nAlso from Emergency Motion: \"Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Trump, 929 F.3d at 754\" include.\n\nAlso from Emergency Motion: \"Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v. Sec’y of Air Force, 716 F.3d 633, 637 (D.C. Cir. 2013)\" include.\n\nAlso from Emergency Motion maybe \"Widakuswara v. Lake, No. 25-\" not case.\n\nAlso from Opinion: maybe \"Karem v. Trump\" etc.\n\nThus many.\n\nWe need to produce append_checklist call with multiple entries. We need to provide evidence for each. We can use the snippet text from the match. For each citation, evidence can be the snippet containing the citation. Provide source_document and location tokens.\n\nWe have different source documents: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Emergency Motion, Memorandum Opinion and Order, Memorandum of Points and Authorities.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each. We can refer to tokens ranges given: e.g., Complaint match tokens 7977-8177. For each citation in that snippet, location could be \"tokens 7977-8177\". But we might want page number: snippet shows \"Page 18 of 20\". So location \"Page 18 of 20\".\n\nFor Emergency Motion, each match has tokens ranges. For each citation, location could be \"tokens 8732-8932\" etc. Provide snippet.\n\nFor Memorandum of Points and Authorities, each match has tokens ranges. Provide snippet.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't duplicate entries. Let's list unique citations and evidence:\n\nI'll create a list.\n\n1. 531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000) – Complaint, tokens 7977-8177, page 18.\n2. 472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985) – Complaint, same.\n3.

Trump, 929 F.3d at 754\" - we have that.\n\nAlso \"Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v. Sec’y of Air Force, 716 F.3d 633, 637 (D.C. Cir. 2013)\".\n\nAlso \"Am. Foreign Serv. Ass’n v.

Cook County School Bus\".\n\nAlso \"League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby\".\n\nAlso \"Levine v. C & W Mining Co.\".\n\nAlso \"National Fed. of Fed. Emps. v. McDonald\".\n\nAlso \"NLRB v. Electro-Voice, Inc.\".\n\nAlso \"NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin\".\n\nAlso \"Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v FERC\".\n\nAlso \"SEIU Health Care Michigan v. Snyder\".\n\nAlso \"Sinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. LLC v.

NLRB\".\n\nAlso \"Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Doerr v. Executive Office of the President\".\n\nAlso \"Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer\".\n\nI think this covers.\n\nNow we need to produce append_checklist with patch key \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\" and extracted list of these entries.\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each: text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe have token ranges for each match but not for each citation. We can use the match token range as location.\n\nFor Complaint, token 7977-8177, page 18.\n\nFor Emergency Motion: match 1 tokens 8732-8932 etc for citations 3-4. For match 3 tokens 14634-14834 for citation 5. For match 4 tokens 16437-16637 for citation 6.\n\nFor Memorandum Opinion and Order: tokens 161-361 for citation 7.\n\nFor Memorandum of Points and Authorities: matches 1 tokens 1453-1653 for citations 8-13. match 2 tokens 1521-1721 includes same. match 3 tokens 1565-1765 includes additional 14-16. match 4 tokens 1653-1853 includes 17-26. match 5 tokens 1789-1989 includes 27-35? Actually match 5 covers many. match 6 tokens 1997-2197 includes 36? match 7 tokens 2084-2284 includes 36? Actually we need to map each. But we can simply use the match token ranges for each citation. Provide snippet with the citation.\n\nThus we need to compile evidence: For each citation, we can use snippet from the match that contains it. For example, for Bloedorn citation, snippet: \"Bloedorn v. Francisco Foods, Inc., 276 F.3d 270 (7th Cir. 2001)\". Provide source_document: \"Memorandum of Points and Authorities Supporting Plaintiff American Foreign Service Association's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" and location: \"tokens 1453-1653\".\n\nWe should maybe include page number if provided. Many snippets include \"Case 1:25-cv-01030-PLF Document 10-1 ... Page 5 of 57\" etc. We can use that.\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each. Let's pick snippet from match containing each citation.\n\nWe may need to include multiple evidence pieces if multiple citations in same snippet.\n\nBut each extracted entry can have multiple evidence entries. For each citation, evidence could be snippet text and location.\n\nWe will create one evidence per citation.\n\nNow we prepare the JSON function call.\n\nGiven the large number of entries, we need to ensure JSON is not too huge but okay.\n\nWe will create patch:\n\n{\n \"patch\": [\n   {\n     \"key\": \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\",\n     \"extracted\": [\n        { \"value\": \"531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000)\", \"evidence\": [ { \"text\": \"... 531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000) ...\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 18 of 20\" } ] },\n        ...\n     ]\n   }\n ]\n}\n\nWe need to fill all citations.\n\nLet's list all entries with evidence snippet and location.\n\nI'll craft snippets:\n\n1. 531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000) – snippet: \"531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000)\". Source: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, location: \"Page 18 of 20\".\n\n2. 472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985) – snippet: \"472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985)\". Same.\n\n3. Winter v.

Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Trump, Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v. Sec’y of Air Force. That's 4.\n\nBut there might be more citations in the rest of the Motion.\n\nAlso, Memorandum Opinion and Order: 3,223 tokens; we saw 1 citation? Actually we saw Am. Foreign Serv. Ass’n v. Trump, 2025 WL 1387331? Wait, that's from Emergency Motion. The append list had 1 value from Memorandum Opinion: \"Am. Foreign Serv. Ass’n v. Trump, 2025 WL 1387331 (D.D.C. May 14, 2025)\". That is from the Emergency Motion? Wait, the value 7: \"Am. Foreign Serv. Ass’n v. Trump, 2025 WL 1387331 (D.D.C. May 14, 2025)\" was from Memorandum Opinion and Order (tokens 161-361). That's indeed a citation.\n\nWe also have many citations from Memorandum of Points and Authorities Supporting Plaintiff American Foreign Service Association's Motion for Preliminary Injunction: 26 values. But there may be more.\n\nWe also have other documents: Order, Plaintiff Motion, Docket. Those may contain citations. The system hasn't visited them. We need to ensure all citations across all documents are captured.\n\nThus we need to search across all documents for pattern like \"U.S. ... (\" etc. We already did search with regex pattern capturing citations. That found 78 matches: 1 in Complaint, 20 in Emergency Motion, 12 in Memorandum Opinion and Order, 20 in Memorandum of Points and Authorities, 20 in Opinion, 5 in Order. Those are presumably all matches. But we didn't extract all of them because we only appended 43 values. We need to extract the rest.\n\nThus we should run search_document_regex again or read the documents to capture missing citations.\n\nWe need to extract all 78 matches. But we need to confirm that each match is a distinct value. Some might be duplicates across documents? Probably not.\n\nThus we need to get the 78 matches list. The last search results gave 78 matches across 8 docs. It listed 1 in Complaint, 20 in Emergency Motion, 12 in Memorandum Opinion and Order, 20 in Memorandum of Points and Authorities, 20 in Opinion, 5 in Order. The current extracted list includes 43 values: 2 from Complaint, 4 from Emergency Motion, 1 from Memorandum Opinion, 26 from Memorandum of Points and Authorities, and 10 from Opinion (but the summary mentioned 10 from Opinion). Actually the summary says: 10 from Memorandum of Points and Authorities? Wait, the summary at top of extraction progress says: 43 values (2 from Complaint, 4 from Emergency Motion, 1 from Memorandum Opinion, 26 from Memorandum of Points and Authorities, 10 from ???). Let's see:\n\n\"Keys with Extracted Values (1):\n- All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation: 43 values (2 from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, 4 from Emergency Motion for an Immediate Administrative Stay and Stay Pending Appeal, 1 from Memorandum Opinion and Order, 26 from Memorandum of Points and Authorities Supporting Plaintiff American Foreign Service Association's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, 10 from Memorandum of Points and Authorities...)\"\n\nWait likely mis-copied. Actually the 26 from Memorandum of Points and Authorities. 10 from ??? Maybe from Opinion? But we have 20 from Opinion. So we have missing 10 maybe.\n\nAlso we have 5 from Order that we haven't extracted.\n\nThus we need to search again and read missing sections.\n\nWe can call search_document_regex again for all documents with pattern that captured citations. But we need to provide context. The tool returns matches with context tokens. We can then parse manually? But we can't parse manually because we can't read the entire context. We could call read_document on specific token ranges to capture the exact citation text.\n\nBetter: Use search_document_regex with pattern capturing citations and top_k large enough to get all matches. Then read the matches. But we might get many matches; we can read token ranges for each match to extract the citation.\n\nAlternatively, we can use read_document to read entire documents and parse manually in code? But we can't parse automatically; we must manually identify citations.\n\nSimpler: Use search_document_regex again with pattern for citations across all docs, get the matches list. Then for each match, we read the text surrounding the match to extract citation. But we need to do this for all matches. That might be many calls. But we can batch.\n\nWe could attempt to read the entire documents in one go for each document, but each read call limited to 10k tokens. The documents are large: Complaint 9k, Emergency Motion 29k, Opinion 19k, etc. We could read the entire documents in multiple calls. But that's many calls.\n\nAlternative: Use search_document_regex with pattern that captures citations. This returns matches with context. We can parse the returned matches to extract the citation text. But the tool returns only match context; we can read each match. But we can use the search result to extract evidence; but we need to provide evidence snippet. The match snippet includes the citation text. So we can use that as evidence. That might be easier: For each match, we get a snippet containing the citation. So we could use the search result to create entries.\n\nThus we should call search_document_regex again for all documents with the pattern used earlier: \"\\b\\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\([^\\)]+\\)\" plus maybe WL pattern. But earlier we used pattern:\n\n\"\\b\\d{1,4}\\s+[A-Z.]+\\s+\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)|\\b\\d{4}\\s+WL\\s+\\d+\"\n\nWe can use that again. Let's call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern. That will return top_k matches per document. We need to set top_k maybe 100 to capture all. Let's do that.\n\nBut we need to specify top_k 100 and context_tokens maybe 200. We'll get many matches. Then we can process them manually? We need to extract the citation text as evidence. But we have to provide the snippet exactly. The snippet will be included.\n\nWe need to create append_checklist entries for each new citation not already extracted. We have 43 entries extracted. The search will return 78 matches. We need to extract remaining 35.\n\nWe need to avoid duplicates. We must track extracted values.\n\nList of extracted values we have: Let's enumerate.\n\nFrom the append (values 1-43):\n\n1 531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000)\n2 472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985)\n3 Winter v.

They are presumably 20 from Opinion, 5 from Order, 12 from Memorandum Opinion and Order? Wait we have 1 from Memorandum Opinion. The 12 from Memorandum Opinion and Order maybe include ones not captured earlier like other citations.\n\nAlso 20 from Opinion we haven't captured. And 5 from Order.\n\nThus we need to extract those remaining.\n\nWe need to get the match list. Let's call search_document_regex again with doc_name=\"all\" pattern. Use top_k maybe 100. That will return all matches across docs. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n  \"pattern\": \"\\\\b\\\\d{1,4}\\\\s+[A-Z.]+\\\\s+\\\\d+(?:\\\\.\\\\d+)?\\\\s*\\\\([^\\\\)]+\\\\)|\\\\b\\\\d{4}\\\\s+WL\\\\s+\\\\d+\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\", \"MULTILINE\", \"DOTALL\"],\n  \"top_k\": 100,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "\\b\\d{1,4}\\s+[A-Z.]+\\s+\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)|\\b\\d{4}\\s+WL\\s+\\d+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE", "MULTILINE", "DOTALL"], "top_k": 100, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12652, "completion_tokens": 3289, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to confirm if all relevant citations are captured. The steps indicate that we had 78 matches found earlier, but we only appended 43. There may be missing ones. The checklist: All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation. We need to ensure all citations present. The earlier search returned 78 matches across documents. We appended 43. Likely 35 missing.\n\nWe should search again for remaining matches. Use search_document_regex with pattern capturing citations. We need to get all matches. We might need to search all documents with the pattern but top_k default 5 may miss. We can increase top_k to 20? The tool's max top_k=20. We need to get all matches. We can search per document with top_k 20, but there are many matches. We might need to iterate through documents. But the instruction: choose one action. We could search all documents with pattern and top_k 20, but that might undershoot. But we can set top_k 20 per doc. For 8 docs, 20 each gives 160 matches capturing many. We can then parse results to find missing citations. But easier: search all documents, top_k 100? Not allowed. But we can set top_k 20 per doc, but we might need more. But maybe 20 per doc is enough to capture all. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents pattern: \"\\b\\d{1,4}\\s+[A-Z.]+\\s+\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)|\\b\\d{4}\\s+WL\\s+\\d+\" with top_k 20. That returns 20 per doc. We can then parse to see missing. The earlier error due to top_k 100. So set 20.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"\\\\b\\\\d{1,4}\\\\s+[A-Z.]+\\\\s+\\\\d+(?:\\\\.\\\\d+)?\\\\s*\\\\([^\\\\)]+\\\\)|\\\\b\\\\d{4}\\\\s+WL\\\\s+\\\\d+\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "\\b\\d{1,4}\\s+[A-Z.]+\\s+\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)|\\b\\d{4}\\s+WL\\s+\\d+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12677, "completion_tokens": 491, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
{"step": 15, "run_id": "678df0ae-2107-4ec6-bd1d-9ea4b205c986", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T06:18:51.319330-05:00", "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have a detailed snapshot. The system says that all checklist items have been filled? The status: Keys with Values 1/1, Empty 0/1. Wait it says 1/1 filled means all keys? Only one key: All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation. So it's complete. But the step 9 appended 43 values. But maybe there might be more? We need to ensure all distinct values found in any document have been extracted. The current extraction may be incomplete, because they have partial coverage of many docs. There are still many unmatched citations. So we need to continue scanning. The last step 10/11 indicated more matches. The last \"Current Status\" shows 43 values extracted. But likely incomplete.\n\nHence we need to find remaining citations. We need to search for citations patterns in remaining documents not fully searched. The search pattern used earlier captured many citations. But still incomplete. We need to locate all citations across all documents. We can run search_document_regex with a pattern that captures citations like \"531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000)\" etc. The pattern used earlier: \"\\b\\d{1,4}\\s+[A-Z.]+\\s+\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)\". That captured all? That pattern matches reporter citations. But it might miss some with \"U.S.\" \"F. Supp.\" \"F. L.R.A.\" etc. But pattern covers.\n\nBut we need to ensure all citations in all documents are extracted. We should run search_document_regex on all documents again with same pattern and top_k maybe 20 per doc? It returned 78 matches earlier, but they only displayed first 20. There are remaining matches not shown. We need to retrieve all matches. We can set top_k high? The tool has limit 20 per doc. That might be too low. We need to get all matches. Maybe we can run search_document_regex on each document individually and set top_k to 100? But limit is 20. So we need multiple searches per document, adjusting context or token offsets? Or we might use read_document to read entire document in chunks and search manually. But easier: we can run search_document_regex on each document with pattern and top_k 20, but that may miss some beyond 20. We can then incrementally search from after last token? But the tool doesn't support specifying start token. But we can read the rest and search manually. However, the search may find only first 20 matches per doc; we need all.\n\nAlternative: Use read_document to read entire document (or large window) and manually find citations. But manual extraction is heavy.\n\nBetter: We can run search_document_regex on each doc separately with top_k 20, but then after read first 20 matches, we can read subsequent portion to find more. Or we can use read_document to read entire doc and then do local regex within? But we can't run regex manually; we have to use tool. But we can read all tokens of a doc and parse for citations ourselves? We can read entire doc into memory (≤ 10,000 tokens). Many docs exceed 10,000 tokens. But we can read in chunks of 10k tokens.\n\nBut we need to guarantee all citations extracted. Might be many. Might be easier to use search_document_regex with top_k 20 for each doc, then read the remaining tokens after the last match to find additional.\n\nBut we don't know where last match ends. We can read the entire doc and search again? But tool cannot search within a previously read segment? We can read entire doc and then search again? The search function doesn't allow specifying range. It searches entire doc.\n\nBut we can get all matches but only 20 per doc. So we need to adjust pattern to match fewer results? But we need all.\n\nMaybe we can run search_document_regex with pattern that matches citations but also include \"WL\" Westlaw citations. The pattern used earlier includes that. But still only 20 per doc.\n\nWe could do incremental search: After getting first 20, we can read the doc and manually find the next 20 using regex ourselves? But we can't run regex manually. We could read entire doc and then manually search using regex in analysis channel? But we cannot run code. But as ChatGPT, we could \"simulate\" search? But the tool is required to provide evidence. So we must use tool to find evidence.\n\nWe can circumvent by using read_document to read the remaining tokens after last known match, then search manually by scanning text in analysis, though we can't guarantee accuracy. But we can produce evidence by quoting text. But we need evidence from the document. We can read entire doc in chunks and manually examine for citations. But that is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the earlier 43 values were indeed all citations. But the notes show many more matches: 78 total matches in step 10. They only displayed first 20 of 78. The rest matches include many citations. So 43 values likely incomplete. So we need to extract all.\n\nThus we need to perform search_document_regex again to get all matches, but the tool limit 20 per doc. We could circumvent by narrowing pattern to match fewer results per doc, e.g., include distinct reporter names? But still many.\n\nWe could use search_document_regex on each doc with pattern that matches citations but with context maybe filter? But still limit 20.\n\nWe can use read_document to read entire doc and then manually find and extract citations. That ensures we capture all.\n\nThus best approach: For each doc, read entire doc in chunks, manually extract citations by scanning the text for patterns like \"531 U.S. 533\". But we need to produce evidence for each citation. That is heavy but doable.\n\nBut maybe we can rely on the earlier search results that returned 78 matches. That includes all citations? But step 10 said 78 total matches across all docs. That may be the total number of citations. But we only extracted 43. So we need to find remaining 35 citations.\n\nWe can run search_document_regex again but only for docs that still have unviewed tokens and may contain more citations. But tool still returns 20 per doc. But we can use read_document to read all tokens of a doc and then manually find remaining citations.\n\nOk, choose next action: read_document for a doc that hasn't been fully covered, maybe \"Opinion\" which has 19k tokens but only 18% coverage. We need to read the rest.\n\nBut we need to identify which citations remain. Could be many. Maybe easier to read entire doc in chunks of 10k tokens and manually extract.\n\nWe'll choose read_document for \"Opinion\" starting from token 0 to 10000, then next 10000, etc. But we need to keep track of which we have read.\n\nLet's check coverage: Opinion has viewed tokens: 488-719, 1616-1816, 2029-2368, 4249-4627, 4985-5185, 5531-5731, 5905-6282, 6408-6696, 7155-7355, 7577-7777, 7861-8061, 8506-8960, 14787-14987. That's 13 ranges. So many gaps.\n\nWe need to read the rest. Let's read from start 0-10000 to capture many gaps. But we already have 488-719, so 0-488 also. But we can read 0-488. Then 720-1615, etc. But we can read large segments.\n\nBut we only need to extract citations. We could read entire doc in 10k chunks: 0-10000, 10000-20000, 20000-30000. But doc size 19k, so 0-10000 covers first half; 10000-20000 covers rest.\n\nLet's do that: read_document \"Opinion\" 0-10000. Then read 10000-20000.\n\nBut we also need to read other docs: Memorandum of Points and Authorities, Emergency Motion, etc.\n\nWe might need to read many docs. But maybe we can rely on the search results to identify all matches and just need to collect evidence for each citation we haven't extracted. But we don't know which ones remain.\n\nWe can run search_document_regex again but with top_k 20 per doc for each doc individually, then manually read each match. But we already saw many matches. However, we need to process all.\n\nTime constraints: Possibly the best is to use search_document_regex on each doc with pattern and top_k 20, then for each match, we can extract evidence. But we need all matches, but only 20 per doc. But if each doc has less than 20 matches, fine. But some docs might have >20. But we can run again with top_k 20 but maybe get next matches? The tool always returns top_k per doc. But we cannot specify offset.\n\nThus we need to read docs fully.\n\nGiven the complexity, we might decide to stop because the system says all values extracted. But that might be wrong.\n\nHowever, the instruction says \"Stop when every key is complete or set to Not Applicable.\" We need to ensure completeness. We have 43 values, but there might be more. It says \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\". There might be many more citations. The earlier search found 78 matches across all docs. 43 extracted. So 35 missing.\n\nThus we need to extract them.\n\nGiven time, we can proceed to read each doc partially and extract.\n\nWe'll proceed step-by-step.\n\nFirst, read \"Opinion\" doc 0-10000 tokens.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Opinion\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":10000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13513, "completion_tokens": 2075, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Already 43 values extracted. But we need to check if any missing citations? The snapshot shows they appended 43 values earlier. But we need to see if more exist beyond those 43? We should search for more citations maybe in other documents not fully visited. Many remaining matches: 1 in Emergency Motion, 12 in Memorandum Opinion and Order, 20 in Opinion, 5 in Order. Those were not yet appended? Wait earlier they appended 43 values total. Might have been from all docs? But the \"Remaining matches\" list from step 14 indicates more matches still unviewed. So likely not all extracted. We need to find all distinct citations across all documents. So need to search for patterns again and capture matches.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex with pattern for Bluebook citations: typical pattern: \"CaseName v. CaseName, \\d+ [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\)\". Already earlier search attempts had none. They used pattern for \"CaseName v. CaseName, 531 U.S. 533, 542-49 (2000)\" etc. That pattern didn't match? Maybe due to variable formatting.\n\nWe can use a more generic pattern: \"\\b[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+ v\\. [A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+, \\d{1,4} [A-Z]{2,4}\\. \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\)\" might catch. They did similar but got zero. Maybe citations sometimes have \"U.S.\", \"F.3d\", \"F.4th\", etc. We can use pattern: \"\\b[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+ v\\. [A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+, \\d{1,4} [A-Z]{1,4}\\. \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\)\"? That's similar.\n\nAlternatively we can search for \"(\\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\))\" which they did earlier and got many matches but maybe includes other numbers like \"2025 WL 1387331\" etc. But they also had matches 78. Those include Westlaw citations, but we need Bluebook citations: reporter or database citation. Westlaw is not Bluebook? Bluebook includes reporter (U.S., F.3d, etc). Westlaw might be included? The requirement: \"All citations to judicial opinions that include a reporter or database citation, represented in shortened Bluebook form (case name included only when it immediately precedes the citation); excludes id./supra/infra, docket-only references, slip opinions without reporter/database cites, and non-case sources.\"\n\nSo we need citations like \"United States v. Smith, 123 U.S. 456, 789-90 (1999)\" etc. Westlaw citations \"2025 WL 1387331\" are database citations, but could be considered Bluebook? The instruction says database citation is allowed. So Westlaw counts. But pattern earlier with \\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\) captured Westlaw? Actually Westlaw pattern: 2025 WL 1387331, 2025 WL 1218044. That's 4 digits, space, WL, space, number, no parentheses. The pattern earlier didn't capture that. They had separate pattern including WL.\n\nWe have 78 matches total. Many are Westlaw, some are reporter citations. We need to extract all distinct values across all docs. We have 43 values appended earlier. But we need to confirm if that covers all 78 matches? Likely not. So need to search again and list all matches. Might be easier to use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern that matches both reporter and Westlaw citations.\n\nLet's define regex: \"\\b([A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+ v\\. [A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+, \\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\))|(\\b\\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\))|(\\b\\d{4} WL \\d+)\" Something like that.\n\nBut we might get many matches. We need to return top_k matches per doc. The tool returns top_k matches. We might need to set top_k large enough to capture all. But we can just search for Bluebook citations across all docs and then read each match region to extract.\n\nHowever, we could rely on the earlier 78 matches, but we need to ensure all citations extracted. Let's check the 78 matches list: 1 in Complaint, 20 in Emergency Motion, 12 in Memorandum Opinion, 20 in Memorandum of Points and Authorities, 20 in Opinion, 5 in Order. Total 78. So we need to extract all 78 citations. The 43 appended earlier likely include many but maybe not all. We need to identify missing ones.\n\nWe can search for each doc individually and extract matches. But maybe easier: use search_document_regex on all docs with pattern capturing reporter and Westlaw citations, top_k maybe 100. That gives us all matches. Then we can read each match context tokens to extract.\n\nBut we need to produce only one action per turn. We can send search_document_regex to get matches. Then next turn we will read one match and append. But we need to ensure we eventually extract all. But the snapshot indicates many matches not yet processed. So we should use search_document_regex to get list.\n\nWe must choose an action. Next action: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern that covers both reporter and Westlaw citations. Provide top_k maybe 20? But we need all 78. We can set top_k 100 to capture all. The tool's top_k default is 5, but we can set 100. Let's do that.\n\nPattern: \"\\b[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+ v\\. [A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+, \\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\)|\\b\\d{1,4} [A-Z.]+ \\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\)|\\b\\d{4} WL \\d+\" That should match all.\n\nWe also need context tokens - default 200. That might be fine.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n  \"pattern\": \"\\\\b[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9 .]+ v\\\\.

But we have extracted 43 values; but is that complete? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" They already extracted 43 values from earlier steps. But we must check if any missing. Maybe some documents still partially visited and may contain more citations. The system says 1/1 keys filled, 0 empty. But we need to verify that all citations across all documents have been captured. We may need to search for more. The earlier steps: They did search regex pattern for citations, found 78 matches across all docs. They appended 43 values? Wait earlier step 9 appended 43 values. Then step 10 search pattern found 78 matches and presumably appended more? But the status shows 43 values. That indicates they didn't append all 78 yet. So we need to continue extracting. We must identify remaining citations. We need to parse the search results again? Step 10 found 78 matches: 1 in Complaint, 20 in Emergency Motion, 12 in Memorandum Opinion and Order, plus others. But the appended values only 43. So likely there are more citations not yet appended. We need to search for remaining matches and append them. We should search for full set of matches again, but maybe we need to refine. We can use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern for citations. The pattern used earlier: \"\\b\\d{1,4}\\s+[A-Z.]+\\s+\\d+ \\(\\d{4}\\)|\\b\\d{4}\\s+WL\\s+\\d+\" returned 78 matches. We can use that again to get matches. But we must ensure top_k <=20. We can set top_k to 20; but we need all matches. We can call search_document_regex with top_k 20 per doc, but we need all 78. But we can set top_k 20 and then iterate. But we are limited to one action per turn. We can use search_document_regex with top_k 20 and context tokens 200. That will return first 20 matches per doc, but we need all. But we can call again with top_k 20 plus offset? Not possible. Maybe we can use read_document to read entire documents to manually extract. But this is large. But we can call search_document_regex with top_k 20 and then later search for remaining patterns? We could call search_document_regex on each doc individually with higher top_k? The constraint says top_k <=20. So we cannot retrieve all 78 in one call. But we can call search_document_regex on all docs with top_k 20, then parse results. That may capture many but not all. But we can call again with top_k 20 for each doc until we capture all. However we need to iterate. But we have only one action per turn. So we should plan to call search_document_regex on all documents again to get the first 20 matches per doc. But do we need all matches? The checklist requires all citations. So we need to capture all 78. We might need to iterate multiple turns.\n\nBut maybe the earlier step 9 appended 43 values already, which covers all 78? The status says 43 values. So maybe 43 matches are the total across all docs? But step 10 search found 78 matches. So discrepancy. Let's check step 10 description: \"Found 78 matches: 1 in Complaint, 20 in Emergency Motion, 12 in Memorandum Opinion and Order (+3 more docs)\". So 1+20+12=33, plus maybe 3 more docs with some matches? That could add up to 78? Wait 33 +? The phrase \"+3 more docs\" implies there were additional matches in three other documents. So total 78. So there are 78 matches across all documents.\n\nBut the appended 43 values might be incomplete. So we need to continue extraction.\n\nWe should schedule next action: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern again, but we need to gather all matches. We should set top_k 20, but we might miss matches beyond 20. But we can read the entire doc to extract manually. However that's large.\n\nAlternate: we can use read_document on each document to read the entire text (maybe 30k tokens). That's large, but we can read up to 10k tokens per call. We can read segments and identify citations. But it's time-consuming.\n\nPerhaps we can just call search_document_regex again but with top_k 20 for each doc; we will get first 20 matches per doc. Then we can read the rest manually.\n\nBut we need to add new extracted entries for the remaining matches. We don't yet know what they are. We could approximate by reading matches from the search results provided earlier. For example, step 14 shows first 20 of 78 matches with match details. Those match snippets include citations: e.g., \"531 U.S. 533\" etc. We can add those to checklist. But we need to confirm all unique citations. Step 14 shown 20 matches across documents. We can parse them for citations. We can extract each citation from each match. But maybe there are more than 20. But we can extract from the 20 matches. That might fill many of the remaining values. But we still need to ensure all citations are captured.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe we can use search_document_regex again but with top_k 20. But we need to specify top_k 20 for each doc. Maybe we can search all docs and aim to capture all matches. But we might still miss after 20. But we can get a batch.\n\nAlternatively, we can use search_document_regex on each document individually, then read each snippet to capture all citations.\n\nGiven time, maybe we can finish by stopping? But risk missing citations.\n\nBetter to proceed to next step: call search_document_regex again with pattern and top_k 20. Then we will parse results and append.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n  \"pattern\": \"\\\\b\\\\d{1,4}\\\\s+[A-Z.]+\\\\s+\\\\d+\\\\s*\\\\(\\\\d{4}\\\\)|\\\\b\\\\d{4}\\\\s+WL\\\\s+\\\\d+\",\n  \"flags\": [],\n  \"top_k\": 20,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "\\b\\d{1,4}\\s+[A-Z.]+\\s+\\d+\\s*\\(\\d{4}\\)|\\b\\d{4}\\s+WL\\s+\\d+", "flags": [], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 19430, "completion_tokens": 1344, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
