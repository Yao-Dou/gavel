We have partial views of documents. Likely parties are in Complaint, Emergency Motion, etc. We saw some matches: In Complaint, lines show \"Plaintiff, ... American Foreign Service Association\" and \"v. Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President...\". Also in Emergency Motion: \"AMERICAN FOREIGN SERVICE ASSOCIATION, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. DONALD J. TRUMP, et al., Defendants-Appellants.\" Also in Memorandum Opinion and Order: \"AMERICAN FOREIGN SERVICE ASSOCIATION, Plaintiff; v. DONALD J. TRUMP et al., Defendants.\" So we need to capture each party entry.\n\nWe need to gather distinct values: Plaintiff and Defendant. For each, description including role. We should probably capture separate entries: \"Plaintiff: American Foreign Service Association, a professional association.\" and \"Defendant: Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States.\" Also possibly \"Defendant: Donald J. Trump, et al.\" but we should capture the description. And maybe \"Defendant: Office of Personnel Management\" etc? The Emergency Motion lists multiple defendants: Donald J. Trump; Office of Personnel Management; U.S. Department of State; U.S. Agency for International Development; Marco Rubio, in his official capacity as Secretary of State and Acting Administrator, U.S. Agency for International Development; and Charles Ezell, in his official capacity as Acting Director, Office of Personnel Management. So we need to capture all those as separate entries? The requirement: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\"\n\nThus we need separate entries for each party. That means many entries: Plaintiff: American Foreign Service Association; Defendant: Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States; Defendant: Office of Personnel Management; Defendant: U.S. Department of State; Defendant: U.S. Agency for International Development; Defendant: Marco Rubio, in his official capacity as Secretary of State and Acting Administrator, U.S. Agency for International Development; Defendant: Charles Ezell, in his official capacity as Acting Director, Office of Personnel Management. Also maybe Defendant: Donald J. Trump et al. but we already captured one. But \"Donald J. Trump, et al.\" indicates others; but we list each individually.\n\nAlso in the Complaint, \"v. Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States\". So same.\n\nWe should search for parties across documents. We have partial coverage of Complaint. We should read more of Complaint at beginning to capture Plaintiff and Defendant. The first view shows Plaintiff line: \"American Foreign Service Association:\" and \"v. Donald J. Trump\". That is enough. But we might also read more to confirm description. Let's read tokens 0-200 of Complaint. We have already tokens 0-159 partially. We may read 0-200 to capture context. Let's request read_document for Complaint from 0-200. Also maybe read more for the defendant description \"in his official capacity as President...\" which may be beyond 159. Let's read 0-300. We can read 0-400? But limit 10k tokens. Let's read 0-400 for Complaint. Also maybe we need to capture \"American Foreign Service Association\" role: \"American Foreign Service Association\" is a professional association. That may be described in other parts. But we can capture the description as \"American Foreign Service Association, a professional association.\" The snippet may not include \"professional association\" but we can infer. But for extraction we need evidence. We can use the snippet that shows it's a professional association? Let's search for \"professional association\" in Complaint. It might be in the text. We can search. But we can use the snippet \"American Foreign Service Association:\" maybe not enough description. But requirement says \"identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" The description can include role. For American Foreign Service Association, the role is \"association\". Might be enough. So we can provide \"American Foreign Service Association\" as description. Possibly we want \"American Foreign Service Association, a professional association\" but that might not have evidence. We could just include \"American Foreign Service Association\" as description. That seems safe.\n\nNow for defendants, we need to capture \"Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States\" from Complaint. That snippet exists in first view but truncated. Let's read 0-500 to capture that. Also confirm \"in his official capacity as President of the United States\" is present. We saw in snippet: \"DONALD J. TRUMP,  in his official capacity as  President of the United States\". So yes.\n\nAlso in Emergency Motion, we have a list of defendants: \"Donald J. Trump; Office of Personnel Management; U.S. Department of State; U.S. Agency for International Development; Marco Rubio, in his official capacity as Secretary of State and Acting Administrator, U.S. Agency for International Development; and Charles Ezell, in his official capacity as Acting Director, Office of Personnel Management.\" We should capture each as separate entries. We need evidence for each. We can search the Emergency Motion for \"Defendants-appellants\" pattern. But we can read the snippet we have already. But we have only tokens 0-144 and 209-409. The snippet 209-409 includes list. Let's read 200-500 to capture entire list. We can read tokens 200-500 of Emergency Motion. That should include the list. Let's do that.\n\nAlso we should read the Memorandum Opinion and Order maybe to capture the parties again, but not necessary if already captured. We can stop after capturing all parties. Let's read from Emergency Motion 200-500. Also maybe read from Complaint 0-400. That will give evidence for parties.\n\nLet's proceed with two read_document calls. But we must only select one action each turn. So we need to choose one. We could perform search_document_regex across Emergency Motion for pattern \"Defendants-appellants\" to capture the list. That might return matches with context. That would give us evidence. But the snippet we have already includes list. But we might want to read the full list. Search with pattern \"Defendants-appellants\" might show context. Let's do that. We'll search Emergency Motion for pattern \"Defendants-appellants\". That should return a match with context. Then we can parse the list. Also we may want to search for \"Plaintiff-Appellee\" to capture plaintiff description. But we can use the snippet already.\n\nWe also need to capture defendant description for Donald J. Trump. That appears in both Complaint and Emergency Motion. But we may capture from Complaint.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex on \"Emergency Motion for an Immediate Administrative Stay and Stay Pending Appeal\" for pattern \"Defendants-appellants\". Also maybe pattern \"Plaintiff-Appellee\". Let's search two patterns? We can only give one pattern per call. We could call search_document_regex with doc_names [\"Emergency Motion for an Immediate Administrative Stay and Stay Pending Appeal\"] and pattern \"Defendants-appellants\". That will return match. We might also need \"Plaintiff-Appellee\". But we can capture plaintiff from same doc. Maybe we can parse from the same match context for \"Plaintiff-Appellee\". The snippet likely contains both. Let's search with pattern \"Plaintiff-Appellee\" also. But we can choose to search for \"Plaintiff-Appellee\" to get evidence. But for parties we need both. We could do two separate searches. But we can only do one action per turn. But we can do a search with pattern that captures both? Maybe pattern \"(Plaintiff-Appellee|Defendants-appellants)\". That will return matches for either. That might give context for both. Let's do that.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Emergency Motion with pattern \"(Plaintiff-Appellee|Defendants-appellants)\". That should return matches with context. We'll get a match containing the list. Then we can parse. Also we might want to search Complaint for pattern \"American Foreign Service Association\" but we can capture from snippet previously. But we might need to confirm the defendant description. But we can read Complaint again. But we can also search for pattern \"Donald J. Trump\" with context. Let's search for that. But we can't do two actions. But we can first search for \"American Foreign Service Association\" in Complaint to get both plaintiff and defendant? But the snippet shows \"American Foreign Service Association: \" and \"v. Donald J. Trump\". Let's search for pattern \"American Foreign Service Association|Donald J. Trump\". That will capture both. That might be easier to get evidence for both. Let's do that. We'll search in Complaint for pattern \"American Foreign Service Association|Donald J. Trump\". That will give context covering both. Then we parse.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Complaint with pattern \"American Foreign Service Association|Donald J. Trump\". That returns matches. We'll parse evidence.\n\nWe need to read entire match to capture description.

But likely not.\n\nAlso the Complaint lists \"Donald J.

But we need to extract all parties found across the corpus.\n\nTherefore we should gather evidence for each party.

That provides evidence for those parties.\n\nWe need evidence for other parties: Office of Personnel Management, Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, Marco Rubio, Charles Ezell. We saw these in Emergency Motion snippet. We should capture that.\n\nAlso there might be \"United States\" as a party? In the \"Docket\" maybe not. But maybe \"United States\" is a defendant? But not necessary.\n\nAlso maybe \"United States\" is a party in the Complaint? The Complaint is 'American Foreign Service Association v. Donald J. Trump'. So parties: AFSA plaintiff, Donald J. Trump defendant.\n\nBut there may be other documents containing parties: The Emergency Motion lists multiple defendants and the plaintiff.\n\nWe should also search for \"Defendant\" across all documents to capture any other parties. But we may not need to read entire documents; we can use search_document_regex to find matches and capture context.\n\nWe need to gather evidence for each party.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex across all documents for pattern matching party names.

But we have 300-600 includes many. Let's read again tokens 0-600 to capture all parties. But already have 0-600 partially. Let's read tokens 0-600 again.

We have read some parts. We have seen plaintiffs: American Foreign Service Association (AFSA). Defendants: Donald J. Trump, Office of Personnel Management, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, Marco Rubio, Charles Ezell. Also maybe others? In motion, list includes those.\n\nWe need to extract each distinct party as separate entries with evidence. Format: 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\n\nWe should search for \"Defendant\" etc. But we already have matches. We need to ensure all parties. Let's search entire corpus for \"Defendants\" or \"Plaintiff:\" etc. But we can use search_document_regex across all documents with pattern like r\"(?i)(Plaintiff:|Defendant:|Defendants|Plaintiff|Defendant)\" but we want to capture the names. Probably easier to read more of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief beyond tokens 0-600. But we have tokens 0-600 which included the list of parties. But we might need to confirm all parties and maybe the description of each party (role). The complaint lists: Plaintiff: American Foreign Service Association. Defendant: Donald J. Trump in his official capacity as President. Defendant: Office of Personnel Management, etc. That is enough.\n\nWe might also need to capture that the parties include \"Office of Personnel Management\" etc. Provide description like \"Defendant: Office of Personnel Management\" etc.\n\nAlso from Docket we have attachments: Summons to Donald J. Trump, Office of Personnel Management, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, Marco Rubio, Charles Ezell. That matches.\n\nAlso from Emergency Motion for an Immediate Administrative Stay and Stay Pending Appeal we have defendants-appellants: Donald J. Trump; Office of Personnel Management; U.S. Department of State; U.S. Agency for International Development; Marco Rubio; Charles Ezell. Plaintiff-appellee: American Foreign Service Association.\n\nThus all parties are these 7? Count: Plaintiff: American Foreign Service Association. Defendants: Donald J. Trump, Office of Personnel Management, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, Marco Rubio, Charles Ezell. That's 6 defendants + 1 plaintiff = 7.\n\nWe need to extract each as separate entries with evidence.\n\nWe need to use append_checklist or update_checklist. We have not added any yet. So we can append entries. Use evidence from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 0-600 which includes all parties.\n\nWe should provide evidence for each party. For each, we include snippet text containing the party name and role. Eg for Trump: \"DONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity as President of the United States\". For Office of Personnel Management: \"OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, 1900 E Street, NW Washington, D.C. 20415\". For U.S. Department of State: \"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, 2201 C Street, NW Washington, D.C. 20520\". For U.S. Agency for International Development: \"U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, 2201 C Street, NW Washington, D.C. 20520\". For Marco Rubio: \"MARCO RUBIO, in his official capacity as Secretary of State and Acting Administrator, United States Agency for International Development\". For Charles Ezell: \"CHARLES EZELL, in his official capacity as Acting Director, Office of Personnel Management\". For Plaintiff: \"AMERICAN FOREIGN SERVICE ASSOCIATION\".\n\nWe need location: maybe page 1. Provide location \"Page 1 of 20\" or token range. Use token range 0-200? We have that snippet in read_document. Provide location \"Page 1 of 20\".\n\nLet's construct append_checklist patch with key \"Who_are_the_Parties\" entries.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't add duplicates. None yet.

That suggests no other parties labelled \"Defendant:\" outside the complaint.
