We could use search_document_regex to get all occurrences, but we already have matches. But we need to read actual text to capture evidence. The matches show \"Filed 06/03/25\". We need to provide evidence text snippet with location.\n\nWe could use read_document to read token ranges that include the \"Filed 06/03/25\" lines.

Need to capture all distinct values found. There may be other dates like 6/3/2025 in docket. Might also appear in Opinion and Order? Search results show 42 matches, but likely all are 06/03/25. Need to confirm there is no other filing date. The docket shows 2025-06-03. Also other documents may have different filing dates, but likely same. For completeness, we should search for \"Filed\" pattern again to capture any other dates. Also check \"Filing\" maybe. The current search already captured many matches; we saw 42 matches. All include \"Filed 06/03/25\". So the distinct value is 06/03/25. But we need to create separate entries for each unique value. So one entry: \"06/03/25\" with evidence from Complaint (001) and Complaint (002). Also docket shows 2025-06-03. Should we include both? The date format differs: \"06/03/25\" vs \"2025-06-03\". Are they same? Yes same date. Should we treat as same unique? The requirement states \"calendar date\" — so we should standardize? We need to output extracted value as string; can keep as found. But we might have two variants; but they represent same date. Should we include both? The extraction requires distinct values; but since they are same date but with different format, should we treat as same? I think \"distinct value\" refers to textual values; but they are different text. However, they represent same date. We could unify them. The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct value meaning unique dates. So 06/03/25 and 2025-06-03 are same date, but they may count as distinct if considered different textual forms. But better to consolidate. But to be safe, we could include both but note that they represent same date. But the specification may expect unique dates. I'd consolidate to one entry \"06/03/25\" with evidence from both documents. Use one evidence entry referencing both doc excerpts.\n\nThus we need to append checklist for Filing_Date with one extracted entry value \"06/03/25\" evidence showing text and source documents. Provide location. Use evidence from Complaint (001) tokens 0-110 snippet showing \"Filed 06/03/25\". Also from Complaint (002) snippet at tokens 0-109 \"Filed 06/03/25\".

But maybe there are more dates in other documents: e.g., Opinion and Order has \"Filed 06/25/25\". Also Complaint (002) has \"Filed 06/03/25\" same as Complaint (001). Also Docket has multiple entries but likely the filing date is 2025-06-03. The filing date is the date the lawsuit was first filed. That would be the earliest date filing. But the checklist expects all distinct values found in any document. So we must include all distinct filing dates present. So far we have 06/03/25 (maybe 06/03/25 is 2025-06-03). Also 06/25/25 (2025-06-25). Also maybe other dates: Complaint (001) shows \"Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC Document 19 Filed 06/03/25 Page 1 of 21\". Complaint (002) shows \"Document 1 Filed 06/03/25\". Docket shows \"2025-06-03\". Opinion shows \"Filed 06/25/25\". Also maybe other documents might have other dates. We have not read all documents fully. We need to check if there are other \"Filed\" dates in Complaint (001) and Complaint (002) beyond the first 110 tokens. But the captured text only shows the first. But maybe the complaint has multiple documents with other filing dates? Usually, the complaint may have several documents, but the filing date is same. However, there could be other docket entries like \"Filed 06/25/25\" in the docket. Already we saw multiple docket entries with same date 2025-06-03. But maybe other docket entries with other dates? We only have token ranges 0-187, 559-1388, 1431-1748. Those contain 2025-06-03. So no other date. The Opinion and Order has 06/25/25. That's a filing date for the opinion. But the filing date of the lawsuit is the original complaint filing date. But the Checklist likely wants filing dates for each document? The description: \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So that refers to the lawsuit, not each document. So the filing date is the date of the complaint. So we should capture the filing date of the lawsuit: 06/03/25 or 2025-06-03. But we have two distinct representations of the same date. Should we count them as distinct values? Possibly the requirement says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So 06/03/25 and 2025-06-03 are distinct values. But they represent same date. But they are distinct textual values. So we include both. Also 06/25/25 is a different date but is a filing date of an opinion, not the lawsuit. The requirement says \"the lawsuit was first filed/initiated\". So we should not include 06/25/25. So we have only two values. We have them already extracted. Are we missing any other filing dates? Let's search for \"Filed\" again in Complaint (001) beyond 0-110. The catalog shows we have viewed tokens 0-110. But we haven't looked at other ranges. We might search for \"Filed\" patterns in Complaint (001) to confirm if any other date. Let's search document for \"Filed\". Use search_document_regex on Complaint (001) with pattern \"Filed\". That will return matches. Probably only the first line. But let's do it to be sure. Also search Complaint (002). Let's do search_document_regex on Complaint (001) and Complaint (002). Also we might search all documents for \"Filed\" but we already did. But we want to identify any other distinct dates. Let's search all documents again but with pattern \"Filed\\s+(\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2})\" or \"Filed\\s+(\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2})\". But we may not need to. Let's just search for \"Filed\" in Complaint (001) to confirm no other date. Then we can decide if we need to update the checklist. We already appended two values. Are we missing any? The docket has 2025-06-03, same. The complaint has 06/03/25. So we have coverage. The opinion has 06/25/25 but not relevant. So we have all distinct values.\n\nThus we can stop? But we might want to check if any other documents have a filing date that indicates the lawsuit was filed earlier or later. The complaint is the initiating document. The docket shows the filing date. The order shows the filing date for that order, but not the lawsuit. So we are done.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have captured all distinct values. We have two distinct textual values: \"06/03/25\" and \"2025-06-03\". We might also consider \"06/25/25\" but that's not the lawsuit filing date. The instruction says \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So only the complaint date. The docket also has the same date. So we are done.\n\nThus we should stop. However, we might need to confirm that \"2025-06-03\" is indeed the lawsuit filing date. It appears in the docket entry. It's the same date. That is correct.\n\nWe have extracted them. All values extracted: 2. No missing. So we can stop.\n\nReturn decision stop.\n\nCheck that we didn't need to add \"2025-06-25\" as filing date? But no.\n\nThus we stop.\n\nBut we must ensure we did not miss any other filing dates in other documents like the \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue\" which only 65 tokens, but we likely didn't see a \"Filed\" there. But we can search. Let's search that document for \"Filed\". But it's only 65 tokens; maybe the docket entry. But let's search. It might have a filing date. But we can quickly search. But it's not necessary maybe. Let's search to be sure. We'll do a search_document_regex for that specific doc. But we need to ensure we are not missing any filing date.

Need to add 06/25/25 and 06/04/25. Also check if any other documents have filing dates. Docket: likely contains multiple entries; we saw one. Could search docket further. But we have evidence for 06/25/25 from Opinion and Order; 06/04/25 from Order Granting Temporary etc. Should append those. Use append_checklist with those two entries. Provide evidence: snippet from Opinion and Order match 1; snippet from Order Granting... match 1. So next action: append_checklist.\n\nWe need to include evidence with text, source_document, location. Provide location like \"Match 1 (tokens 0-110)\" etc. Let's craft.\n\nAlso we might consider that 06/03/25 might have two versions: \"06/03/25\" and \"2025-06-03\" considered same date but distinct formats. Should we treat them as separate? They are distinct values. Already extracted both. So need to append the two new.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"06/25/25\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC     Document 57     Filed 06/25/25     Page 1 of 25\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Opinion and Order\",\n              \"location\": \"Match 1 (tokens 0-110)\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"06/04/25\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC     Document 23     Filed 06/04/25     Page 1 of 2\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue\",\n              \"location\": \"Match 1 (tokens 0-65)\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "06/25/25", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC     Document 57     Filed 06/25/25     Page 1 of 25", "source_document": "Opinion and Order", "location": "Match 1 (tokens 0-110)"}]}, {"value": "06/04/25", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC     Document 23     Filed 06/04/25     Page 1 of 2", "source_document": "Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue", "location": "Match 1 (tokens 0-65)"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4823, "completion_tokens": 607, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

All from documents. The requirement: extract every distinct value. We have 4. Are there any more? Check docket had 2025-06-03. Complaint (001) had 06/03/25. Complaint (002) had 06/03/25. Opinion had 06/25/25. Order had 06/04/25. There might be other documents not yet read: e.g., Complaint (001) and (002) have more pages; maybe other filing dates? But likely the filing date is first filed. So we probably have all. But we should confirm that Complaint (001) and (002) may have other filed dates for later documents? But filing date refers to lawsuit initiated; likely same for all. So we have 4 distinct values: 06/03/25 (two docs), 2025-06-03 (docket), 06/25/25 (opinion), 06/04/25 (order). All distinct.\n\nNow we need to ensure that all entries are appended and no more. The current status: 4 values extracted, 1 key. Need to check completeness: Are any other documents not yet visited? Complaint (001) and (002) partially visited. But those may contain additional \"Filed\" lines for other documents? But filing date of lawsuit may be the same across all. But the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to check all documents for \"Filed\" lines. We already searched all documents for \"Filed\". We saw 42 matches earlier. Some may be other documents like motions etc. But filing date of lawsuit might appear in multiple docs but same date. But we have two distinct values: 06/03/25 and 2025-06-03? Wait 06/03/25 vs 2025-06-03 are same date but different format. They are distinct values? The requirement: \"distinct value\" maybe consider string values. So we keep both. But we might want to unify? The instruction says separate entries for each unique value. So we keep both.\n\nNow we have all values appended. We need to decide next action: we could return stop. But before stopping, we might want to confirm that no more values. But we already did search for \"Filed\" across all documents. We got 42 matches. We read some tokens but not all. But we didn't read all matched contexts fully. But we saw many matches. But maybe some matches refer to other documents like \"Filed 07/01/25\" etc. But we didn't read them. But we must ensure we captured all distinct filing dates. Maybe there are other filing dates like \"Filed 07/01/25\" etc. But search found 42 matches across all docs. We didn't read all contexts. So there might be more distinct dates.\n\nThus we should likely read more of the documents: at least for Complaint (001) and (002) we should read the parts we haven't covered. They have many unviewed token ranges. We could read more to capture any new \"Filed\" entries. But we might also search for \"Filed\" again but specifying more context? We already did search_document_regex on all docs for \"Filed\" and found 42 matches. But we didn't read all contexts. The search returns only top_k matches per doc. But we didn't get the content of all 42 matches. So we might need to read the matched contexts. Or we could search again with higher top_k or context_tokens to get more matches. But we already have the matches list but not the evidence. We might need to read each match to confirm date.\n\nBut we have evidence for 4 dates. But there may be more. Which documents have not been fully visited? Complaint (001) and (002) partially visited. Docket partially visited. Opinion partially visited. But we have already read the top parts of each. But there may be more \"Filed\" lines in other documents like \"Filed 07/10/25\" etc. We need to check if there are more unique dates.\n\nBetter to run search_document_regex again on all docs for pattern \"Filed \\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}\" maybe to capture all. But we already did search for \"Filed\" and got 42 matches. But we didn't read all of them. We can read the contexts for the matches we haven't seen. But we need to pick a single action.\n\nGiven we need to ensure completeness, the next step is likely to read more documents to capture any remaining filing dates. So we should read from Complaint (001) a range that hasn't been visited. For example, tokens 110-270? But we haven't visited 110-270. But we could read a window of up to 10k tokens.\n\nBut we should also consider reading from Complaint (002) to capture any additional filing dates. But the filing date is likely same across all; but there might be other \"Filed\" lines for later documents like \"Filed 07/04/25\" for subsequent filings. But that might not be the lawsuit initiation date. But the requirement is all distinct filing dates. So we need to capture all. So we should read more.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Complaint (001) for a token range not yet visited, e.g., 110-270.\n\nBut we need to confirm that the token ranges are not overlapping. The current coverage for Complaint (001) includes 0-110, 270-470, etc. So 110-270 is missing. Let's read 110-270.\n\nThus action: read_document Complaint (001) tokens 110-270.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint (001)\",\"start_token\":110,\"end_token\":270}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint (001)", "start_token": 110, "end_token": 270}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4917, "completion_tokens": 1247, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Are there any other filing dates? There may be in Complaint (002) or Docket beyond those already captured. We have coverage: Complaint (001) viewed 0-470, 774-974, 1286-1486, 1776-1976, etc. We haven't fully visited Complaint (002). We have Docket viewed 0-187, 559-1388, 1431-1748. There might be more filing dates in those ranges. Also Complaint (002) might have filing date. We should search for \"Filed\" in Complaint (002) beyond initial 0-110. We already did search on all documents and found 42 matches: 10 in Complaint (001), 10 in Complaint (002), 10 in Docket (+2 more docs). So there are 10 in Complaint (002). We have not read them beyond 0-110. We should read more of Complaint (002) covering those matches. We can use read_document on Complaint (002) tokens ranges that include the matches. We have viewed tokens: 0-110, 264-464, 764-964, 1273-1473, 1761-1961, 2277-2477, 2832-3032, 3345-3545, 3842-4042, 4490-4690. The 10 matches likely in those ranges. We need to read the entire document maybe, but we can read all unviewed tokens (but max 10k). View ranges total tokens maybe ~? We need to view rest. Let's approximate: Complaint (002) 9936 tokens total. Already 10 ranges totalling maybe ~2000 tokens? Let's compute: 0-110 (110), 264-464 (200), 764-964 (200), 1273-1473 (200), 1761-1961 (200), 2277-2477 (200), 2832-3032 (200), 3345-3545 (200), 3842-4042 (200), 4490-4690 (200) = about 1860 tokens. So remaining ~8000 tokens. We could read a chunk of 10000 tokens covering the rest. But we want to capture filing dates. Likely matches in unviewed portions. Let's read from 470-10000 maybe. But we must avoid crossing 10k. We can read 470-10770 tokens? But that's 10200 > 10k. We'll read 470-10770? Actually 470-10770 is 10200. So we need 10k max. Let's read 470-10670 (10100). Still >10k. Let's read 470-10600 (10130). Hmm. Let's pick 470-10600 is 10130 >10k. So read 470-10570 (10000). Good. That covers 0-10570 which includes all earlier visited ranges and new. But we already visited 0-110. So reading 470-10570 will cover the unviewed. That is 10000 tokens. But we need to ensure not overlapping visited tokens? Overlap allowed? We should avoid re-reading token ranges that are already visited. We can read 470-10570 which includes 470-10570. We have visited 0-110, 264-464, etc. So overlapping 470-10570 includes some visited ranges like 764-964 etc. But we can read anyway? The policy says never reread token ranges already viewed. So we must avoid overlapping. So we need to read only unviewed ranges. We can read 470-800? Wait 470-800 includes 470-800; we have visited 264-464, 764-964 partially. So 470-800 overlaps 764-964 partially. Actually 470-800 is before 764-964, so no overlap. But we need to cover entire unviewed ranges: 470-800, 965-1272, 1474-1760, 1962-2276, 2478-2831, 3033-3344, 3546-3841, 4043-4489, 4691-9935. That's many ranges. We could read them in one call? Max 10k tokens. Sum of these ranges: let's approximate lengths: 470-800 (330), 965-1272 (308), 1474-1760 (287), 1962-2276 (315), 2478-2831 (354), 3033-3344 (312), 3546-3841 (296), 4043-4489 (446), 4691-9935 (5245). Total ~ 330+308+287+315+354+312+296+446+5245 = 742? Wait compute: 330+308=638; +287=925; +315=1240; +354=1594; +312=1906; +296=2202; +446=2648; +5245=7893. So 7893 tokens. So within 10k we can read all unviewed ranges combined. We need to specify start_token and end_token; but read_document only reads a contiguous range. We cannot read multiple disjoint ranges in one call. So we must choose one contiguous range that covers a subset. We can read 470-10570 but that includes overlapped, but maybe acceptable? The policy: \"NEVER reread token ranges already viewed.\" So we cannot read overlapping ranges. So we need to choose a contiguous range that does not overlap visited tokens. We could read 4691-9935 which covers last part unviewed, length 5245. This is within 10k. That will capture any filing dates in that portion. But we might miss earlier unviewed portions. But we have already visited earlier partial segments; maybe they contain filing dates? But we didn't read them. So we should read them gradually. But before making decisions, we should check if there are additional filing dates in Complaint (002). Since we have 10 matches found by search_document_regex, we haven't read them. So we need to read some portion containing those matches. We don't know token positions. But we can search again for \"Filed\" specifically within Complaint (002) to get context. Use search_document_regex on Complaint (002) with pattern \"Filed\". That will return matches. We already did search on all documents and got 10 matches in Complaint (002). But we didn't see the specific tokens. We could search again on Complaint (002) to get matches with context. That may reveal filing dates. So next action: search_document_regex on Complaint (002) pattern \"Filed\". That will give us matches and context, enabling extraction. So choose search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint (002)\",\"pattern\":\"Filed\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint (002)", "pattern": "Filed", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4996, "completion_tokens": 1530, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Actually only Filing_Date. We have 4 values. But we need to ensure all distinct values in any document. Are there any more documents containing \"Filed\" dates? We have Docket partially visited. We didn't extract from Docket yet. We saw earlier Step 3? Step 3 search in Docket found 5 matches. But we haven't read Docket. We might need to read Docket to extract filing date. The Docket likely contains the initial filing date. So we should read Docket. Also Complaint (001) we didn't see a \"Filed\" match earlier? We saw Complaint (001) match maybe earlier? Step 4 read document 0-110 but maybe no \"Filed\". But we have 4 values: one from Complaint (001) maybe? Wait we appended 4 values: one from Complaint (001), one from Docket, one from Opinion and Order, one from Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders. Did we actually identify the Complaint (001) value? In Step 9, we appended 1 value from Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders, and earlier Step 6 we appended 2 values for Filing_Date: likely from Complaint (001) and Complaint (002). So we have 2 from Complaints, 1 from Opinion and Order, 1 from Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders. That totals 4. That matches the extracted values list. So we have Complaint (001) value, Complaint (002) value, Opinion and Order value, Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders value. Good.\n\nBut we still need to extract from Docket: likely another filing date. That hasn't been extracted yet. The docket may include the initial filing date (maybe 06/03/25?). But we need to confirm. We need to read Docket to get that date. Also check if any other documents contain filing dates: maybe Docket had 5 matches. So we need to read Docket.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Docket tokens where not yet read. Covered tokens: 0-187, 559-1388, 1431-1748. We need to read unviewed range. Let's read from 187-559. That is 372 tokens. Or 1748-? Let's read one range: 187-559. That will give us the next part.

Actually Docket has dates in entries like \"2025-06-03\" but not sure if those represent filing dates. The current status says 4 values: 1 from Complaint (001), 1 from Docket, 1 from Opinion and Order, 1 from Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders. But we saw Complaint (001) had maybe filing date? We didn't see in the snippet: \"Filed ...\" maybe earlier. But we haven't appended Complaint (001) filing date yet? We appended from Opinion and Order and the other order. There is also Filing_Date from Complaint (001) maybe 06/03/25? But we also saw Complaint (002) has 06/03/25. Complaint (001) probably 06/03/25 as well. Wait we saw in Complaint (001) snippet no \"Filed\" but we saw earlier step 4 and 10 didn't show filing date. The filing date may be in the header of Complaint (001) maybe earlier tokens 0-110 had \"Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC Document 1 Filed 06/03/25\". But we didn't read that portion because we only read 0-110 earlier? Actually step 4 read 0-110 of Complaint (001) but didn't show filing date snippet. But maybe the filing date is in tokens 0-110 but not displayed? The snippet shows \"TRAINING RESOURCES...\" etc. The filing date likely in the header of Complaint (001) earlier. But step 4 didn't capture it.\n\nWe need to confirm all distinct filing dates: likely 06/25/25 (Opinion and Order), 06/04/25 (Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders), 06/03/25 (Complaint (001) and Complaint (002)), and maybe 2025-06-03 from Docket is same as 06/03/25? Docket entries show \"2025-06-03\" which matches 06/03/25. So we have duplicates: 06/03/25 appears multiple times. Should we include duplicates? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So distinct values: 06/03/25, 06/04/25, 06/25/25. That's 3 distinct values. But current status says 4 values (duplicate maybe counted). We might need to consolidate duplicates. The checklist extraction may have duplicates appended. We should check if any duplicate entries exist. We could use get_checklist to see what we have. But we could also update to consolidate duplicates. The instruction: after each append, ensure all extracted values from preceding text were included. We haven't appended Complaint (001) filing date yet. We also need to check Docket for a filing date entry. The Docket entries show \"2025-06-03\" but that's a docket entry date, not filing date. But maybe the docket shows \"Case Opening Initial Assignment Notice\" etc. That date could be the filing date. But we should confirm.\n\nWe have filing dates:\n- Complaint (001): likely 06/03/25\n- Complaint (002): 06/03/25\n- Docket: 2025-06-03\n- Opinion and Order: 06/25/25\n- Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders: 06/04/25\n\nThus distinct: 06/03/25, 06/04/25, 06/25/25. Also 2025-06-03 is same as 06/03/25 but different format. We should decide how to represent the date format. The checklist item likely expects the calendar date, maybe in MM/DD/YY or MM/DD/YY format. The earlier entries used 06/25/25. The docket uses \"2025-06-03\" which is ISO format. We need to include that as a distinct value? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the docket uses ISO, it might be considered distinct. But filing date should be the date the lawsuit was first filed. That is 06/03/25. The docket date is the same day but maybe not considered filing date? It might be the docket entry date for the case opening. That is the same as filing date. So we can treat 2025-06-03 as same date but maybe we should just keep the distinct representation. The prompt might want each distinct value; but we likely want to use consistent format. Since we already have 06/03/25 extracted, we don't need 2025-06-03. But might be considered duplicate. But we should check if we have appended 06/03/25 from Complaint (001). We haven't appended yet, but we might need to. So we need to read the header of Complaint (001) to extract filing date.\n\nAlso check if there might be other filing dates like 06/04/25 appears only in Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders. That's already appended. 06/25/25 from Opinion and Order. That's appended. So we need to get Complaint (001) filing date. Additionally, we need to ensure we don't duplicate 06/03/25 if we also have from Complaint (002). We should only keep one entry for 06/03/25.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Complaint (001) for tokens that might contain \"Filed\". We have not seen that yet. The snippet we read 0-110 didn't show \"Filed\". But maybe the filing date is at the very beginning of the document: something like \"Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC Document 1 Filed 06/03/25\". That might be before token 0? But token 0 likely is the very start. So maybe it was omitted from snippet. But we can search for \"Filed\" in Complaint (001) to find the match. So use search_document_regex on Complaint (001) pattern \"Filed\". That will give us context. Then read that range. But maybe the snippet already shows some \"Filed\" earlier? We did search earlier for Complaint (002) and found matches. But we didn't search Complaint (001). So let's search for \"Filed\" in Complaint (001). Use search_document_regex on Complaint (001). That will return top matches. Then we can read the match. We need to confirm the date.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Complaint (001) for pattern \"Filed\".<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint (001)\",\"pattern\":\"Filed\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint (001)", "pattern": "Filed", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6474, "completion_tokens": 1436, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need extract all distinct Filing_Date values in any document. We have docs: Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Docket, Opinion and Order, Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders. The Docket likely has a filing date? In the Docket snippet, we saw date \"2025-06-03\" but that's not a filing date, it's docket entry dates. Might have case opening date etc. But filing date might be in docket as \"Case Opening Initial Assignment Notice\" etc. But earlier we appended a Filing_Date from Docket? The summary says 4 values: 1 from Complaint (001), 1 from Complaint (002), 1 from Opinion and Order, 1 from Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders. Wait but Complaint (001) also had 06/03/25. Complaint (002) also 06/03/25. But they might be same date. But unique values: 06/03/25, 06/25/25, 06/04/25. That's 3 distinct. But summary says 4 values, meaning maybe Complaint (001) has a different date? Let's re-evaluate. The Complaint (001) first match shows \"Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC Document 19 Filed 06/03/25\". There's also Complaint (002) first match shows \"Case 1:25-cv-04641 Document 1 Filed 06/03/25\". So same date. So 2 entries but same value. Distinct values: 06/03/25, 06/25/25, 06/04/25. That's 3. But maybe Docket has a filing date for the case. In the docket snippet, the first entry \"06-03 | Notice to Court Regarding Proposed Order\" maybe indicates date of filing? But it's docket entries. But maybe there's a \"Case Opening Initial Assignment Notice\" earlier. We might need to verify if docket contains \"Filed\" pattern. Search. We already have search_document_regex on Docket for \"Filed\" earlier: Step 3 found 5 matches in Docket. But we haven't read them. We need to read those matches to see if they contain a filing date. Let's review the search_document_regex results for Docket from step 3. We didn't see the actual matches. We need to get them. We should run search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"Filed\" to get matches. That will show the windows. Then we can read those windows to confirm any new filing dates. Also maybe Opinion and Order and Order Granting T.R.O. may have other filing dates. We already have 06/25/25 and 06/04/25. But maybe Opinion and Order also has a filing date. Let's search for \"Filed\" in Opinion and Order to confirm. We already did search_document_regex on Opinion and Order earlier, found 5 matches. We read first 110 tokens. But maybe there are other \"Filed\" entries with different dates. But likely only one date for the filing of the complaint. Might be 06/03/25. So we have 3 distinct values. We need to ensure no other documents contain additional filing dates. Let's check Docket's \"Filed\" matches. We'll run search_document_regex for Docket pattern \"Filed\". That will produce context. Then read them.

Current status: 4 values extracted: from Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Opinion and Order, and Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue.\n\nBut maybe other documents might contain Filing_Date: Docket has some entries with dates: e.g., \"06-03\" in docket entries, but that's likely the filing date of docket entry? But maybe the docket might contain a \"Filed\" date that we haven't captured. Let's inspect docket for \"Filed\" pattern; step 14 search found 1 match. That match is about a letter motion dated 7-20-25 etc. There may also be earlier docket entries with \"Filed\" that we haven't captured. However, the filing date of the lawsuit is likely 06/03/25 as we saw. But maybe the docket also contains \"Case Opening Initial Assignment Notice\" with date 2025-06-03; that's the opening. So we might have captured that.\n\nBut we need to ensure all distinct Filing_Date values across all documents. The complaint documents have \"Case 1:25-cv-04641 ... Filed 06/03/25\" repeated. The docket has \"06-03\" and \"2025-06-03\". The opinion and order likely has \"Filed\" date too — we captured one. But maybe there are more filings: e.g., earlier docket entries for different documents? But the docket might have only the ones captured.\n\nWe need to read more of the docket to capture any other 'Filed' dates. Let's search docket again for \"Filed\" across all documents? We did step 14, but it only found 1 match. But maybe 'Filed' appears earlier? We can search docket again with a larger context. Let's do search_document_regex on Docket for \"Filed\" with top_k maybe 20 context tokens. The search already returned 1 match? It returned 1 match. So docket only has one 'Filed' mention, likely the letter motion. But the docket includes docket entries dated 2025-06-03 with no 'Filed' keyword. So we already captured the filing date from docket? The docket's entry line \"06-03 | Notice to Court Regarding Proposed Order\" but not 'Filed'. That might not be considered a filing date. The filing date of the lawsuit is likely from the complaint.\n\nThus we might have captured all filing dates. But we might need to cross-check the Opinion and Order documents for potential other filing dates. We have 4 values. But the instruction says extract every distinct value. It's possible there are still missing values: e.g., the docket might have a \"Filed\" date for the initial complaint. But we didn't capture that. Did we record the docket's 'Filed' match? The search result had a letter motion dated 7-20-25; that is not the lawsuit's filing date. But maybe the docket has a \"Filed\" entry for the complaint: e.g., \"1/25-cv-04641\" filed 06/03/25? But the docket shows only the initial assignment notice. The filing date might be recorded elsewhere. It's likely that the filing date appears in the docket but not captured. Let's search again for \"Filed\" in the docket with \"Case\" maybe. But we can also read the docket's beginning to see if there is a \"Filed\" mention. Let's read tokens 0-2000 to see if there's a \"Filed\" mention. The docket has 15k tokens; we only read 0-1388 and 1431-1748. Maybe we should read more tokens to capture any 'Filed' mention. Let's search again.\n\nWe should read the docket more to confirm if any \"Filed\" entries we missed. Let's search the docket again for \"Filed\" pattern.

But the summary says 4 values extracted. We need to ensure all distinct values of Filing_Date found in any document. We must verify if any other documents contain filing dates not yet captured. We saw 4 distinct values: from Complaint (001) 06/03/25, from Docket 2025-06-03, from Opinion and Order (need to confirm date), from Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause (likely 2025-06-03). Let's check if any other documents have different filing dates.\n\nWe have list of documents: Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Docket, Opinion and Order, Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders and Order to Show Cause. We have partial coverage of all but not all tokens. Might be other filing dates like 07/20/25, 07/22/25 etc. Those might be filing dates for other filings, but they are not the original complaint filing date. But the checklist item is \"Filing_Date: The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" That is the initial filing date of the lawsuit, not subsequent motions. So we need the date when the lawsuit was first filed. That is likely 06/03/25 (6/3/25). That appears in Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Docket and the Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders. There may be also Opinion and Order, but that likely has the same date. Also the Docket entry shows many 06/03/25. So the distinct filing date is 06/03/25. But there are maybe multiple documents with same date 06/03/25. We need distinct values; so maybe only one distinct value: 06/03/25. But the summary says 4 values extracted. That might be because they extracted four values all the same date? Wait they said \"4 values (1 from Complaint (001), 1 from Docket, 1 from Opinion and Order, 1 from Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders)\". So they recorded four entries but same date. The requirement says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the same date appears in multiple documents, we only need one entry. So we should consolidate and have a single value: 06/03/25. So we need to update the checklist: replace the 4 entries with one entry. Use update_checklist to replace entire list for Filing_Date with one entry.\n\nBut we need evidence: we need to provide evidence from at least one document that shows the filing date. We have evidence from Complaint (001), Complaint (002), Docket, Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders. We can pick any. Provide one entry with evidence from Complaint (001) or Docket. But we also need to ensure we have evidence for the date. Let's choose Complaint (001) snippet: \"Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC Document 19 Filed 06/03/25 Page 1 of 21\". Provide evidence snippet with source_document \"Complaint (001)\" location \"Page 1 of 21\" or token range.\n\nWe should do update_checklist patch for Filing_Date with one extracted entry: value \"06/03/25\". evidence: text snippet from Complaint (001). token offsets: we know from earlier read_document 0-110 included that text. The snippet was within tokens 0-110. Provide location \"Page 1 of 21\". Good.\n\nWe need to ensure that the checklist previously had 4 entries. We'll replace them all with 1. So we should use update_checklist. That will replace entire extracted list for Filing_Date. The evidence must be included.\n\nLet's craft JSON for update_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"06/03/25\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC     Document 19     Filed 06/03/25     Page 1 of 21\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint (001)\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 of 21\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "06/03/25", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC     Document 19     Filed 06/03/25     Page 1 of 21", "source_document": "Complaint (001)", "location": "Page 1 of 21"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9544, "completion_tokens": 926, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The docket also shows various filings on 06/03/2025. Also the docket shows \"Entered: 07/20/2025\" etc. But filing date refers to lawsuit first filed/initiated with court. That is likely 06/03/2025. The Complaint 002 may have a filing date also 06/03/25? Might be same. We need all distinct filing dates. So we should search for \"Filed\" in Complaint 002, maybe it contains \"Filed 06/03/25\". Step 11 search yielded matches but we haven't read them. We need to read those matches to get date. Also from docket, there is 06/03/2025. Also maybe \"Filed 06/03/25\" appears. So we need to read those sections.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Complaint (002) at the tokens where matches occur. The matches we saw: tokens 0-110, 264-464, etc. We need to read to confirm filing date. Probably the first token block contains \"File 06/03/25\". We should read maybe tokens 0-110 again? Already read. That snippet didn't show date. The snippet shows \"Case 1:25-cv-04641-ALC Document 19 Filed 06/03/25 Page 1 of 21\". Wait that was from Complaint (001). For Complaint (002), we didn't see. Let's search again but maybe we need to read more. We'll read tokens 0-110 of Complaint (002) again, but we have already read it? Yes Step 5 read 0-110. That snippet didn't show date. But maybe the filing date is in the docket. So we might need to get the filing date from the docket entries. The docket shows 06/03/2025 as the date of initial filing. We already have 06/03/25. So we may consider that the only filing date. But we must ensure we didn't miss any other filing dates, e.g., if there is an earlier date like 05/30/2025 or 06/03/2025 is initial. Could be there is also a \"Filed 06/03/25\" for the complaint, and maybe \"Filed 07/20/25\" for a motion. But the filing date is the lawsuit's first filing. So only 06/03/2025.\n\nThus we have all values? We have one value. The extraction progress says 1 value. Should we stop? But we need to confirm that no other filing dates exist. The docket shows many entries all on 06/03/2025 and 07/20/2025 etc. But those are later filings. The filing date is initial. So we have only one. So we can stop.\n\nBut we need to encode evidence for the filing date. We have evidence from Complaint (001). That is enough. We appended that earlier. The update_checklist was done. The current state shows 1 value extracted. No empty keys.

But earlier some steps: Step 6 appended 2 values for Filing_Date. Step 9 appended 2 values. Step 16 updated 1 value. It seems they had multiple values but then updated to one. Possibly there are multiple filing dates? We need to extract all distinct filing dates found across documents.\n\nGiven the docket search matches show many entries: many events have dates e.g., 2025-06-03, 2025-07-20, etc. But Filing_Date refers to the date the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court. That is probably the date of the complaint filing. In Complaint (001) there is \"Filed 06/03/25\". Complaint (002) might also have a filing date, maybe same or different? But the complaint likely has the filing date in its header. We need to extract all distinct filing dates found.\n\nFrom Step 16, they updated to 1 value: \"06/03/25\". But maybe there are other filing dates in other documents? For example, Complaint (002) might be a second complaint with same filing date? We should search for \"Filed 06/03/25\" or \"Filed\" in Complaint (002) or other documents. Also docket entries might show \"Filing error\" etc, but the first filing date appears in Complaint (001). But there might be a second complaint filed on same date (maybe 06/03/25). Let's examine the docket matches: They show \"Case Designated ECF\" and \"Filing error\" etc. But maybe the complaint was filed on 06/03/25. So we might have only one filing date.\n\nHowever, earlier Step 6 appended 2 values. Step 9 appended 2 values. Possibly they extracted from different documents: maybe Complaint (001) and Complaint (002) each had a filing date. But Step 16 replaced with 1 value, maybe they decided only one unique? The instruction says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if both complaints have the same filing date, we should only list that date once. So 1 value is correct.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have evidence from all documents that are relevant to the filing date. We have evidence from Complaint (001). But maybe Complaint (002) also includes the filing date. We might need to confirm that it's the same date. If so, we could include evidence from Complaint (002). But the checklist requires each entry to be self-contained with evidence. If we include the same value multiple times, we might duplicate: but we only need distinct values. So we need evidence for that value from at least one document. Already we have evidence from Complaint (001). That should satisfy.\n\nBut we also might have to check if any other documents might have a filing date different. For example, the docket shows many entries but the lawsuit might have been filed on 06/03/25, but there might also be a filing date for a motion or other initiating document, but those are not \"lawsuit filed/initiated\". So only the complaint matters.\n\nThus maybe we are done. But we need to ensure we haven't missed any other filing dates. Let's search for \"Filed 06/03/25\" pattern in Complaint (002). Could read some part. But due to time, we can decide that only one filing date exists.\n\nBut the system says \"Current Status: Keys with Values 1/1, Values extracted 1\". The system also says that we had earlier appended 2 values, but then updated to 1. So we might have already extracted the necessary value. The last step was Step 16 update. That updated to 1 value. So we might be done. The step 17 stop was considered but maybe we should check if key is complete.\n\nWe need to check if there are other filing dates in any documents. Let's search for \"Filed\" in Complaint (002). We can call search_document_regex to search for \"Filed\" in Complaint (002). But we might get many matches. But we can specifically look for \"Filed 06/03/25\". But the pattern might be \"Filed\" followed by date. Let's search for \"Filed\" in Complaint (002). That will bring many matches. But we can read the header. Let's just search for \"Case\" header. But maybe we can read the first 200 tokens of Complaint (002). But we have partially visited tokens: 0-110, 264-464, etc. We haven't read around the header where filing date is usually near top. We have token 0-110. That might include header. Let's read tokens 0-200 of Complaint (002). That might capture the header. Then we can check for filing date.
