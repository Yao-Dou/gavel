Those are the two. But maybe there are other judge names in the Docket beyond 457 tokens? We only see 195-457. There might be more later. But we saw only those two. But could be other judge names in later parts. We need to ensure all judge names are extracted. So we should read the remaining part of the Docket beyond token 457 to the end, to find any more judge names. Also maybe the Opinion and Order beyond 2000 tokens, maybe there are more judge names. We saw partial coverage 0-2000 and 12169-12277. That leaves 2000-12169 unviewed. That could contain more judge names. So we need to read that segment.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Docket for tokens 458-15327 (the rest). But we must limit to <=10k tokens. The Docket is 15,327 tokens; 458-15327 is about 15k-458= about 14869 tokens, which is >10k. So we need to break into segments. We can read 458-10458 (10k tokens). That would cover first 10k after 458. Then we may need to read more if more judge names appear later. But likely if there were more judge names, they'd be near earlier portion. But not sure.\n\nAlso read Opinion and Order from 2000-12169. That's 10k tokens, fits. So we should do that.\n\nWe should choose one action per turn. We can choose to read Docket 458-10458. Let's do that.\n\nWe need to read_document with doc_name: \"Docket\", start_token 458, end_token 10458.\n\nProceed.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":458,\"end_token\":10458}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 458, "end_token": 10458}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4483, "completion_tokens": 891, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But we need to extract all distinct judge names in the documents. We have seen Andrew L. Carter Jr. and Katharine H. Parker. Are there others? In the docket, we saw \"Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr.\" and \"Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker\". In the opinion, we saw \"Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr.\" maybe also \"Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr.\" maybe also \"Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr.\" Only those two. But maybe other documents (Complaints) could have judge names? Usually complaints have no judge names. But maybe the Opinion also has mention \"United States District Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr.\" We should search for \"Judge Andrew\" or \"Judge\" across remaining docs: Complaint (001) and (002). But likely no judge names in complaints. But let's search to confirm. Let's search all documents for \"United States District Judge\" or \"Judge\" pattern. But we already did earlier search for \"United States District Judge\" which found 2 matches in Opinion and Order. Also earlier search for \"Judge\" found 5 matches in Docket. There might be other judge names in other documents like \"Magistrate Judge\" etc. We saw \"Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker\". Is there any other \"Magistrate Judge\" names? Maybe in other documents. Let's search for \"Magistrate Judge\" across all. But we saw only one. Maybe in \"Order Granting Temporary Restraining Orders\" there might be a judge signature line: \"Signed by Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr on 6/4/2025\". That is same.\n\nThus the unique judge names: \"Andrew L. Carter, Jr.\" and \"Katharine H. Parker\". However the requirement: Provide first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion. Should we include middle initial? The example says provide first and last name if available; otherwise state whatever portion. We can include full name \"Andrew L. Carter, Jr.\" but that's first, middle initial, last, suffix. It's okay. For Parker, \"Katharine H. Parker\". We have two distinct values.\n\nBut we need to confirm if there are any other judge names in other documents (Complaints, etc). Let's search for \"Judge\" pattern again but maybe there are other matches. Let's run search_document_regex on all docs pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" maybe we already did earlier but no matches. But maybe \"Judge [A-Z]\" might capture \"Judge Andrew\". But earlier search had pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+\". That would capture \"Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr.\" yes. But no matches in complaints. So likely only those two.\n\nThus we need to append the second value? But we already appended Value 1: \"Katharine H. Parker\". Stage 6 appended 1 value? Actually step 6 appended 1 value? Wait step 6: `append_checklist` added 1 value for 1 key: First_and_Last_name_of_Judge. The extracted value 1: \"Katharine H. Parker\". So we have only Parker. Step 4 maybe earlier extracted Andrew? Let's check step 4 read Opinion and Order tokens 0-2000. That likely contained Andrew. But step 4 didn't append. Step 5 search found 2 matches in Opinion and Order. Step 6 appended 1 value for Parker. Maybe they appended only Parker, missing Andrew. So we need to append Andrew. Also need to ensure no duplicate. We currently have one value: \"Katharine H. Parker\". Need to add \"Andrew L. Carter, Jr.\".\n\nThus next action: append_checklist for First_and_Last_name_of_Judge adding Andrew L. Carter, Jr. with evidence. We need evidence snippet from Opinion and Order. We saw earlier search results for \"United States District Judge\" but not the snippet. We need to retrieve the snippet. Let's search again for \"United States District Judge Andrew\" pattern. Use search_document_regex on Opinion and Order? We can search all documents for \"United States District Judge Andrew L. Carter\".

Step 9 appended second value. So we have 2.\n\nBut the current status says Total Values Extracted: 2. So we have exactly them.\n\nNow we need to ensure we didn't miss any other judge names. Let's scan the docket snippet: earlier in docket we saw \"Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr\" and \"Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker\". Also maybe \"Judge Andrew L.

Complaint documents might not include judge names. But maybe other orders: Order Granting TRO etc. It also had \"Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr\". So we have one judge. Are there any other judge names? Search in all documents for \"Judge\" pattern found earlier: Step 12 search found 0 matches for \"United States District Judge Andrew L. Carter\". But maybe other judges like \"Judge Carter\" only. But we already have. The docket shows only that one judge. The system said 1/1 filled, meaning only one key. That key has 2 values. But we need distinct values: there is only one distinct judge name. The two extracted values presumably are same. But we need ensure we don't duplicate. The step 6 appended 1 value, step 9 appended another value. The value probably same \"Andrew L. Carter Jr.\" So we have duplicate entries. The requirement: extract every distinct value. So we should have only one entry. So we need to update the checklist replacing the extracted list with a single value. That is an update_checklist action.\n\nThus we should call update_checklist to replace the list with one unique value, ensuring evidence from both sources. Provide evidence from Opinion and Order and Docket. Let's gather evidence: In Opinion and Order snippet: It shows \"(Signed by Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr on 6/25/25)\". In Docket snippet: \"Court hearing ... Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr.\" The text in the docket lines show \"Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr.\" We should provide evidence.\n\nThus we need to fetch evidence text. We might need to read document to confirm. But we have snippet from Docket lines. We can use that. For Opinion and Order, we saw snippet in step 57. We can extract text: \"(Signed by Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr on 6/25/25)\". For Docket, we saw \"Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr.\" in line at 23. We'll use that.\n\nThus call update_checklist with key First_and_Last_name_of_Judge, extracted array with single entry: value \"Andrew L. Carter Jr.\" evidence array of two items.\n\nWe should provide location: For Opinion and Order: maybe page? The document is 12,277 tokens. We didn't read full. But we can approximate location: \"Opinion and Order\" doc, maybe near token 12169-12277? That snippet was earlier. But we can give location: \"Opinion and Order\" doc, tokens around 12000-12300. For Docket, we can say token range 23? But better to refer to line 23. Provide location: \"Docket\" doc, line 23. We'll use \"Docket\" doc, location \"Line 23\".\n\nThus output JSON with update_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Andrew L.
