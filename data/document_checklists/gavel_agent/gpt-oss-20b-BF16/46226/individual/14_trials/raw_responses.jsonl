We have some matches with \"Trial\" in the complaint, consent decree, docket, etc. We need to extract all distinct trial info: scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, rulings.\n\nWe have partially visited documents. We need to find trial information. Likely the docket and other documents have trial dates or hearings. We should search again for \"Trial\" or maybe \"trial\" pattern to find more. We already saw matches in complaint, consent decree, docket, joint motion, dismissal. But maybe there are other trial-related entries like \"trial\" synonyms: \"trial hearing\", \"trial date\". But we need to extract any trial info.\n\nWe should read portions of docket to capture trial dates and hearings. Also maybe the complaint mentions trial? The complaint text snippet didn't show trial. But maybe earlier in complaint there is \"Trial\" references. We need to get all distinct trial info. So we should search for \"trial\" again but maybe include \"Trial\" capitalized, \"trial\" lower-case. The search already used \"(?i)Trial\" which is case-insensitive. But we didn't get full matches for all documents? It found 6 matches. Might be more.\n\nWe can search again in all documents for \"(?i)Trial\" but maybe we want to capture additional context like \"Trial\" with more words: maybe \"Trial\" or \"trial\" is enough.\n\nBut we already have matches: Complaint: 1 match, Consent Decree: 2 matches, Docket: 1 match, Joint Motion: 1 match, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal: 1 match. That's 6 matches. But maybe more matches exist but not displayed due to token limits. We can request more context. But we need to read more token ranges to capture trial info.\n\nThe Docket match shows a hearing for a motion, not a trial. But maybe there are trial dates elsewhere.\n\nAlso maybe the consent decree or the joint motion has trial info. But the snippet didn't show trial.\n\nWe should search for \"Trial\" again but maybe use a broader pattern: \"(?i)(trial|trialing|trialing|trialing?)\"? Not necessary.\n\nBetter to search for \"trial\" with word boundary: r\"(?i)\\btrial\\b\". But the earlier search used \"(?i)Trial\" which would match. But maybe some matches were omitted because of context token limit? The search returns top_k matches per document, default 5. So if there are more than 5 matches, it may only return 5. Our documents are not huge, but maybe each document has many \"trial\". But the search returned only 6 matches, maybe because each doc had at most 1 or 2. But maybe the docket has many trial entries, but only the first 5 were returned. But get context_tokens 200. So we might need to search again with top_k maybe 20 to capture all.\n\nBut we also might need to read more of the docket to see all trial hearing entries. The docket snippet shows a hearing for a motion. But maybe there are trial dates elsewhere. Let's search docket for \"Trial\" again with larger top_k.\n\nAlso maybe the complaint has trial info? But snippet didn't show.\n\nWe should read the docket more fully. Let's use read_document to read entire docket maybe in chunks. The docket is 2,962 tokens. We can read token ranges 0-2962. But we need to avoid re-reading already visited tokens 649-849. So read 0-649 and 850-2962.\n\nThus we can read two ranges: 0-649 and 850-2962. That would cover entire docket. That is two read_document calls. But we can only call one function per turn. We can combine? We can only call one. We can call read_document for 0-649 first. Then we will get evidence for trial info in docket. Then we can append.\n\nBut maybe easier: search_document_regex again for \"Trial\" with top_k large to capture all matches. That might give us multiple context snippets. That would be one function call. Let's do that. We'll search all documents for \"trial\" with top_k 20 and context_tokens 200. That should provide up to 20 matches per doc. That might give us all trial-related contexts. Then we can parse.\n\nOk, let's call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern \"(?i)\\\\btrial\\\\b\". flags default. top_k 20. context_tokens 200.\n\nWe need to confirm that the search returns the matches. We'll parse them. Then we can identify trial info like dates, hearing times, etc. Then we can append to checklist.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)\\\\btrial\\\\b\",\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)\\btrial\\b", "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4280, "completion_tokens": 1023, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Let's search for \"Trial\" but we already did; but maybe the snippet didn't capture actual trial info. We need to read more of Complaint for trial info. Also read Docket for more entries.

The requirement: \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" So hearing might count? Possibly. But we should look for trial events: maybe trial dates, outcomes. There's no trial in docket except motion hearing. The consent decree partially read, but likely no trial references. But maybe the Consent Decree has a clause about \"trial\" not relevant. The Order mentions \"Fairness Hearing\" but not trial. The Joint Motion maybe not. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal no trial. So only two trial entries? Maybe also \"Fairness Hearing\" considered trial? Not sure. The requirement says \"trials\". That implies actual trial proceedings. This case may not have had a trial; only hearings and motions. So maybe only the two entries.\n\nHowever we need to double-check if any other trial info appears in the Consent Decree or other documents. Let's search for \"trial\" again but perhaps earlier parts of Consent Decree not read. We only looked at two matches; they were about \"Senior Trial Attorneys\" contact info, not trial events.

But we need the actual scheduling. Likely near that section. We need to read tokens around 700-800 maybe where hearing schedule is.

Consent Decree partially visited; we have some trial references? The search on all documents for \"trial\" earlier found matches in Consent Decree and maybe others. We saw in Step 16 search_document_regex on [Consent Decree, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Joint Motion...] found matches in Consent Decree (2 matches: tokens 7048-7248, 19398-19598). Those appear to be not about trial proceedings but about attorneys; maybe not trial info. But maybe there are trial references in Consent Decree beyond those matched tokens. Let's search again in Consent Decree for \"trial\" to capture any other matches. Also search in Notice of Voluntary Dismissal and Joint Motion maybe for \"trial\" to confirm no other references.\n\nWe also might have trial references in Complaint (but maybe not; we had initial search found 1 match). But we already visited Complaint fully; we can review to ensure no more trial references beyond the one we captured. But we only appended 2 values from Docket; maybe there were also trial references in Complaint but we didn't capture. Step 8 appended 2 values for Trials from Docket. Did we miss any from Complaint? Let's check the Complaint text - we have not read it fully? We read 0-3166 tokens, which is the entire Complaint? It says 3,166 tokens fully visited. So we have the entire Complaint. But we didn't capture any trial info from Complaint. But maybe there were none; maybe only 1 match earlier. But we need to verify.\n\nAlso maybe there are trial references in Notice of Voluntary Dismissal or Joint Motion. That search didn't find \"trial\" in those docs except that the attorneys lists had \"Senior Trial Attorneys\" but not actual trial proceedings. That might not be considered trial info. The checklist item \"Trials\" likely refers to actual trial proceedings, dates, outcomes, etc. So maybe only Docket had trial references. But we need to double-check Consent Decree for any trial info beyond the matches we saw. Let's search again \"trial\" in Consent Decree. Use search_document_regex on Consent Decree only, pattern \"(?i)trial\". That will return top matches. We saw earlier matches at tokens 7048-7248 and 19398-19598; these are attorney listings, but maybe still mention trial info? Let's inspect the matched contexts: the first match shows \"trial\" in \"Senior Trial Attorneys\". Probably not a trial. The second match is also attorney listing.\n\nMaybe there are other trial references in Consent Decree but not captured due to pattern? Could be \"Trial\" as part of \"Trial Court\", \"Trial\" as part of \"Trial date\" etc. We should search for \"Trial\" case-sensitive? But we used case-insensitive; maybe the word \"trial\" appears in \"Trial\" but not as \"trial\". There could be \"Trial\" in uppercase. Our regex with IGNORECASE covers that.\n\nOk, maybe only Docket has trial info. But we only appended 2 values from Docket. We need to verify Docket content: does Docket contain trial info? We read 0-2962 tokens fully. But we didn't look at extracted values. The \"Trials\" key has 2 values. Those likely come from Docket. But we need to ensure no other trial info in other docs.\n\nLet's search again in all documents for \"trial\" to confirm. But we already did earlier step 9 \"search_document_regex\" on all docs and found 6 matches: 1 in Complaint, 2 in Consent Decree, 1 in Docket, +2 more docs. That earlier search might have captured all \"trial\" occurrences. But we need to verify if there are any more that we haven't captured. The search result earlier says 6 matches across 4 docs: Complaint, Consent Decree (2), Docket, and 2 more docs (which are likely Notice of Voluntary Dismissal and Joint Motion). So all matches have been found. We captured the Docket one already. The Complaint match might be a trial reference we missed. We didn't append any from Complaint. Let's check the Complaint's match tokens. We need to search again for \"trial\" in Complaint to see context. That will help decide if it contains a trial reference. Also check Notice of Voluntary Dismissal and Joint Motion for \"trial\" but likely just attorney listings. But we should check to confirm if those references are just attorney listing or maybe mention trial. But they are just listings of attorneys; likely not considered trial info. The checklist likely expects actual trial info.\n\nThus we need to read Complaint for the match. Let's search again \"trial\" in Complaint. Use search_document_regex on Complaint. Then inspect the match. If it contains trial info, we need to append it.\n\nAlso we should read Notice of Voluntary Dismissal for context of match. But maybe not needed.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for \"trial\" in Complaint to get match context. Then after reading, we can parse. So choose search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Complaint\" pattern \"(?i)trial\" top_k maybe 5. That will return context around the match.\n\nNow we need to ensure we don't duplicate earlier.

The search for trial gave matches in Consent Decree; but those matches were about trial attorneys, not trial dates. Could be trial proceedings info.\n\nWe need to ensure all trial info. The Docket likely lists trial dates. The Consent Decree may not have trial info. The other documents likely don't contain trial info. The Complaint had trial attorneys but maybe not trial dates.\n\nWe should check Docket for actual trial dates. But we already read entire Docket. But we haven't extracted the trial dates from Docket. The two values appended likely were something like \"Trial on XXX\" maybe dates. But we need to verify if there are more trial references in Docket beyond two. The Docket is 2962 tokens; we read entire. But we didn't parse the content. The earlier search found 1 match in Docket for trial. But that could be a reference to trial dates. We might need to confirm if there are more. Could be multiple trial dates scheduled. The \"search_document_regex\" on Docket earlier returned 1 match. That suggests only one mention of \"trial\" in Docket. But the earlier step 4 read entire Complaint, step 6 read entire Docket.\n\nBut the earlier \"search_document_regex\" on all documents gave 6 matches: 1 in Complaint, 2 in Consent Decree, 1 in Docket (+2 more docs). So 1 match in Docket. That indicates only one trial reference in Docket. So only two trial values? Wait: Step 8 appended 2 values for Trials. That seems odd: one match in Docket but 2 values appended. Perhaps Docket had two trial dates. But search found one match; but maybe the match included both dates. The search matched \"trial\" word, but the match could include multiple dates. So we may have captured two trial dates.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have all trial info. Let's search Docket again for \"trial\" to confirm. But we can't re-read tokens already viewed; but we can do search_document_regex on \"Docket\" for \"trial\". That will give matches with context. Then we can parse the dates.\n\nAlso maybe the Consent Decree contains trial info? It might contain \"Trial\" in the context of trial attorneys section. But that is not about trial dates. Likely not.\n\nThus, we should search Docket for \"trial\" again. Then parse the match to confirm two trial dates. Also check if other documents have trial info: maybe \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" might mention trial? But likely not.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on Docket for \"Trial\" with context 200. Then we'll parse. Use regex that captures \"Trial\" with surrounding. That will get the match. Then we can extract the trial dates. We need evidence snippet.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"(?i)trial\".\n\nBut we must ensure we don't re-read already visited tokens? Search_document_regex does not read; it just searches. It's fine.\n\nSo we call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Docket\". Pattern \"(?i)trial\". Top_k maybe 5, context_tokens 200. Then parse the snippet to get trial dates.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"Docket\",\n  \"pattern\": \"(?i)trial\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 5,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "(?i)trial", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6341, "completion_tokens": 811, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But maybe other trial info exists elsewhere, maybe in Consent Decree? The earlier steps appended 2 values for Trials. But we need to check all documents for trial references. We saw search matches in Consent Decree, but those matches didn't contain trial info about scheduling etc. They were about attorneys. Also the Complaint had no trial mention. The Order had no trial mentions. Docket had the hearing info. Also maybe other documents have trial info: Notice of Voluntary Dismissal and Joint Motion? They had attorney lists, not trial info. So maybe only the Docket has trial info. But also the Consent Decree may contain trial portion? No.\n\nCheck if Consent Decree might have a hearing or trial. But we saw only attorney lists. We might need to search for \"Hearing\" earlier, but that may not be trial. Trials might have \"trial\" in content. The search on Consent Decree found 2 matches. Both were attorney lists. No other trial info.\n\nThus likely only 2 trial entries: one hearing set 12/16/2024; and the minute entry for proceedings held 12/16/2024. Those are two distinct trial events? They might be same trial? The Docket shows a hearing and a motion hearing. The two entries could be separate. Might need to extract both.\n\nBut we need to ensure completeness. Are there any other trial mentions in other docs? Search all docs again? But we did earlier. We saw 6 matches: 1 in Complaint, 2 in Consent Decree, 1 in Docket (+2 more docs). That means maybe two more docs had matches: Notice of Voluntary Dismissal and Joint Motion. But those matches were attorney lists. So no trial content.\n\nThus maybe the only trial info are the two docket entries. And we already appended 2 values. But we need to double-check that the extracted values are correct. The append_checklist has 2 values for Trials. We should verify if any more trial info exists in the Consent Decree? Let's re-scan Consent Decree for \"Trial\" around tokens we haven't visited. We have tokens 7048-7248, 19398-19598. Those are attorney lists. But maybe earlier part of Consent Decree contains trial info? We haven't visited tokens 0-100 or 400-650 etc. But those are earlier. Let's search again with regex? But we already did search_document_regex on all documents for pattern (?i)trial. That gave us matches in Complaint, Consent Decree, Docket. So no other matches. So no more trial info.\n\nThus we have all trial entries. So we should stop. But we need to confirm that the two entries we appended are correct and have evidence. The append_checklist step earlier presumably had evidence. But we need to ensure we didn't miss any trial info in the documents.\n\nCheck the \"search_document_regex\" results again: It says 6 matches: 1 in Complaint, 2 in Consent Decree, 1 in Docket (+2 more docs). The +2 more docs had matches but they were attorney lists. So no trial content.\n\nThus we should stop.\n\nBut we need to ensure that the checklist \"Trials\" is fully extracted. The earlier append_checklist had 2 values. So we have 2 values. Are we sure no other trial info is missing? Could there be trial info in the Consent Decree that refers to hearing in the order? But we didn't see. But maybe the Consent Decree includes a \"Trial\" in the context of \"trial\" as a noun referring to a hearing. But the search likely captured that. And we saw only attorney lists. So no.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut before stopping, we should double-check that the checklist has only one key \"Trials\". The status shows Keys with Extracted Values: 1. So no other keys.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nReturn decision: stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All trial information has been extracted from the corpus; no additional trial references remain.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All trial information has been extracted from the corpus; no additional trial references remain.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5434, "completion_tokens": 860, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
