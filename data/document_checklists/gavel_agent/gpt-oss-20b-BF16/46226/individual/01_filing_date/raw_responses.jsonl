We also saw \"10/07/24\" in many. The search matches gave 20 total matches; we saw many of them are the same date. We should extract distinct dates: 10/07/24 and 02/25/25. Are there any other dates? Search in Docket found 0 matches, maybe docket entries have dates. But we need filing date of lawsuit, i.e., the first filing. Likely the Complaint's filing date: 10/07/24. Also maybe the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal is later, not the filing. The Consent Decree is also 10/07/24. So filing date likely 10/07/24. We need to extract distinct values found in any document. So 10/07/24 appears multiple times; we should record once with evidence. Also 02/25/25 appears in Notice of Voluntary Dismissal; but this is not the filing date of the lawsuit, but it's a later filing date of a voluntary dismissal. But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we should include all dates found as filing dates in documents. So list both 10/07/24 and 02/25/25. Provide evidence snippets. We have evidence from search results: for Complaint and Consent Decree: snippet shows \"Filed 10/07/24\". For Notice of Voluntary Dismissal: snippet shows \"Filed 02/25/25\". Also order may have \"Filed 10/07/24\". We need evidence from distinct documents. Provide location page numbers.

Source_document: \"Complaint\". Location: \"Page 1\".\n\nEntry 2: \"10/07/24\" from Consent Decree: snippet: \"Filed 10/07/24     Page 1 of 57\". Source_document: \"Consent Decree\". Location: \"Page 1\".\n\nWe could combine both as separate evidence but same value. We might include both evidence entries for same value. The patch can include one extracted entry with multiple evidence. So value: \"10/07/24\". evidence: two objects.\n\nEntry 3: \"02/25/25\" from Notice of Voluntary Dismissal: snippet: \"Filed 02/25/25     Page 1 of 4\".

But maybe docket uses different format like \"Filed 10/07/24\" but search didn't find because of token difference. But likely correct.\n\nAlso, we might want to confirm if any documents have different filing dates like 10/07/24 and 02/25/25. Could be that the Consent Decree, Order, Joint Motion, Complaint all filed on 10/07/24. Notice of Voluntary Dismissal filed 02/25/25. So we have two distinct dates. That matches the extracted values.\n\nBut we must ensure we didn't miss any other filing date, e.g., in \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" there is also a \"Filed 02/25/25\" yes. Is there any earlier \"Filed\" like \"Filed 10/07/24\" repeated. But no new dates.\n\nThus the checklist of Filing_Date is complete with two values.\n\nWe have appended them. We should confirm that we didn't miss any other distinct date. If there might be a docket entry like \"Filed 10/07/24\" but we didn't see. But we can search docket for \"10/07/24\" or \"02/25/25\". But we can also read docket to be safe. But the search seemed to include docket but found 0 matches. But maybe docket contains \"10/07/24\" but not preceded by \"Filed\". But still could be a filing date. But we need to capture distinct filing dates. The pattern \"10/07/24\" might appear in docket entries. But we may not be sure. But we can check docket for \"10/07/24\" anyway. But the contract says we should extract all filing dates. The docket might record the filing as \"Filed 10/07/24\" but maybe not. But we can search docket for the pattern \"10/07/24\" or \"02/25/25\". But maybe docket has \"Case 1:24-cv-00838   Document 1   Filed 10/07/24   Page 1 of 10\". But that's in Complaint. But docket may have \"Document 1\" etc. But maybe docket contains \"10/07/24\". But search didn't find. But we can be safe and read docket tokens 0-2000 to see if any \"10/07/24\" appears. But docket token count is 2,962. We can read 0-2000. But we didn't read docket yet. So we can read docket.\n\nHowever, the checklist only needs distinct filing dates. We already have two. But we should verify docket doesn't introduce an additional date. Let's check docket. We'll read docket 0-2000.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":2000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 2000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9847, "completion_tokens": 1109, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have 2 values found: 10/07/24 and 02/25/25. Are there any other dates? Possibly Docket entries show filed dates 10/07/2024, 10/08/2024 etc. The Filing_Date is the date the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court. That would be the complaint filed date: 10/07/24. Also Notice of Voluntary Dismissal filed date 02/25/25 is also a filing, but is that a separate lawsuit? It's same case, but voluntary dismissal is a later filing. But the rule: \"distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we should include all distinct filing dates. That includes 10/07/24, 02/25/25. Are there any other filing dates in other documents? The docket dates show entries on 10/07/2024 and 10/08/2024 etc. But those are docket entries, not separate filings. The docket entries show \"Entered: 10/07/2024\" but not \"Filed\". The complaint says \"Case 1:24-cv-00838 Document 1 Filed 10/07/24\". The consent decree \"File 10/07/24\". The order \"Filed 10/07/24\". The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal \"Filed 02/25/25\". Also the docket shows a \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" maybe but the docket shows \"Notice of Attorney Appearance\" etc. The docket includes \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" maybe not. But we have the Notice's own file. Also the Joint Motion has a filing date 10/07/24. So the distinct filing dates are 10/07/24 and 02/25/25. Are there any other filing dates like \"Filed 10/08/2024\"? The docket shows \"Entered: 10/08/2024\" but not \"Filed\". That may not count. So we have 2 values. Already appended. But we need to check if any further filing dates exist in other documents not yet fully scanned, e.g., Consent Decree maybe has a date of 10/07/24. Already included. But maybe Consent Decree has a date of 10/07/24. Already. There might be a \"Filed 10/07/24\" at the top. All good.\n\nBut we must ensure that we didn't miss any other filing dates e.g., \"Filed 10/08/24\" somewhere. Search \"Filed 10/08\" maybe. But we didn't search. The docket entries show \"Entered: 10/08/2024\" but not \"Filed\". The \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" shows \"Filed 02/25/25\". The \"Joint Motion\" has \"Filed 10/07/24\" — already included. The \"Docket\" shows \"2024-10-07\" entries but not \"Filed\". So likely we have all distinct filing dates.\n\nBut the current extraction has 2 values. Should we include \"10/07/24\" only once? It appears in multiple documents but we need distinct values; duplicates not needed. But we already have one entry for 10/07/24. Did we include multiple entries? In the appended checklist we have two values: \"10/07/24\" and \"02/25/25\". That seems fine. But we need to verify that the evidence for 10/07/24 includes at least one document that is a filing. We have evidence from Complaint, Consent Decree, Order. That is fine. For 02/25/25 we have evidence from Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. That is fine.\n\nBut we need to double-check if there is any other filing date that might be included like \"10/08/24\". The docket entries \"Entered: 10/08/2024\" are not \"Filed\". The \"NOTICE of Voluntary Dismissal\" perhaps is a filing. The docket entry for the voluntary dismissal might have \"Entered: 02/25/2025\". But we have the Notice document that says \"Filed 02/25/25\". So good.\n\nThus we likely have all distinct filing dates. We should confirm no other documents have \"Filed\" with different date. The only documents with \"Filed\" lines in search results: Complaint, Consent Decree, Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. Also Joint Motion has \"Filed 10/07/24\" but that matches the same date. So we have all.\n\nThus extraction is complete. But we should verify that the checklist currently has 1 key with 2 values. The status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" indicates we have extracted all values. But we need to confirm that the key is complete. Since we have 2 distinct values, and no evidence of other values, we can stop.\n\nBut we must be careful: The \"Filing_Date\" definition might expect multiple values if multiple filings exist. We have 2. Good.\n\nBut we need to ensure that we didn't miss a \"Filed 10/08/2024\" somewhere. Let's search for \"Filed 10/08/2024\" in documents. But we didn't search. We could search all documents for \"Filed\\s+\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4}\". The search earlier on all documents found 20 matches. That included \"Case 1:24-cv-00838   Document 1   Filed 10/07/24\" etc. It didn't find \"10/08\". So no other \"Filed\" dates.\n\nThus all good.\n\nWe should ensure that the \"Filing_Date\" key is complete. We should also verify that we didn't miss any \"Filed\" with year 2025 besides 02/25/25. The search \"Filed\\s+\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\" would catch 02/25/25. So done.\n\nThus next action should be stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct filing dates extracted: 10/07/24 and 02/25/25, with evidence from relevant documents.

{"step": 11, "run_id": "e9eac771-bf69-4ec5-a425-b76290a2c876", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T15:16:03.970217-05:00", "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We are at step 11. The user wants to extract filing date. We already extracted two dates: 10/07/24 and 02/25/25. But we must verify if there are any other filing dates in other documents not yet fully covered. We have partial coverage of documents. We need to check if any other filing dates appear. The docket shows entries all with dates like 2024-10-07 etc. Those are docket dates, not filing dates? The filing date is the date the lawsuit was first filed. Typically appears in complaint. The docket shows the complaint filed 2024-10-07, which matches the filing date 10/07/24. Also, the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal shows filed 02/25/25. Those are likely the filing dates.\n\nBut maybe there are other documents with filing dates? For example, the Joint Motion etc. might have a filing date, but those are not initial filing. The task: \"Extract the filing date from the legal documents.\" The filing date of the lawsuit is the earliest. The docket shows \"2024-10-07\" for the complaint. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal shows \"02/25/25\". That is presumably the filing date of that notice. The filing date of the lawsuit is 10/07/24. But the user wants \"the filing date\" singular? But instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Create separate entries for each unique value\". So we should record both distinct values. Probably all distinct dates found. We have two distinct dates.\n\nWe need to confirm if any other documents contain a filing date? The docket entries for other documents have dates like 2024-10-08, 2025-01-10, etc. But those are docket entries, not filing dates. They might be filing dates of those docket entries. But the filing date of the lawsuit is likely the complaint. However, the docket might list the filing date of each docket entry. But the requirement is \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" That is only the complaint's filing date. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal is a separate document filed later. But is it a filing date of the lawsuit? It's a later filing. But the requirement may interpret any filing to include any document that is filed. The earlier steps extracted two dates: the complaint and the notice of dismissal. So we might be done.\n\nHowever, we should double-check the other documents for any other 'Filed' patterns that we might have missed. The search results earlier found 20 matches across documents. We appended two values. But maybe there are more dates like 10/07/24 repeated. But we want distinct. We have 10/07/24 and 02/25/25. Are there any other dates like 10/08/24? That appears in docket entries but not necessarily a filing of the lawsuit. But maybe the Complaint was also filed on 10/08/24? The docket shows \"Modified on 10/8/2024 to correct party names.\" But that's a modification. That might not be a filing date.\n\nGiven the instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if a document contains a \"Filed\" entry with a date, we should extract. That includes the docket entries for other motions. The docket shows entries like \"2024-10-08\" for a notice of attorney appearance, etc. Those have (Entered: 10/08/2024). But that's a docket entry, not a filing date. But the docket might not be considered a filing date. The requirement is ambiguous. However, the earlier steps considered only complaint and notice of dismissal. So likely the correct answer is those two dates.\n\nBut we must verify if any other documents contain \"Filed\" date not captured. The search on all documents found 20 matches: 5 in Complaint, 5 in Consent Decree, 4 in Joint Motion, +2 more docs. We appended 4 dates: 10/07/24 and 02/25/25. Wait, that search produced 20 matches, but we only appended two distinct dates. But maybe there were duplicates. The complaint had 5 matches of \"Filed 10/07/24\"? Probably repeated in many docket entries. Similarly, the other documents may have duplicates.\n\nThus we have all distinct dates: 10/07/24 and 02/25/25. So we can stop.\n\nBut we must ensure that we have appended all extracted values. The prior step appended two dates. But we need to check if any other distinct date like 10/08/24 appears. The docket shows 10/08/24 entries. But they are docket entries, not filing dates. So we ignore.\n\nThus we should call stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct filing dates (10/07/24 and 02/25/25) have been extracted from the documents, and no additional filing dates are present.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct filing dates (10/07/24 and 02/25/25) have been extracted from the documents, and no additional filing dates are present.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5674, "completion_tokens": 1068, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
