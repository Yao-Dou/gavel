We could search for \"appeal\" in all documents but we already did; no matches. However maybe the appeal is referenced in the docket or other documents. Perhaps we need to read the docket fully, as it may contain appellate actions. The docket likely includes docket entries, maybe an appeal entry. We have partially visited docket (0-2000 tokens). We need to read rest of docket for more entries. Also, the \"Order\" doc, \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\", \"Joint Motion\" might mention appeal. But we searched all documents for \"appeal\" and found none. It's possible the word \"appeal\" is not present but maybe \"appeals\" or \"Appeal to\" etc. But we searched for \"appeal\" pattern which matches word boundary. That should match \"appeals\" too.

Need to set Not Applicable with evidence.\n\nWe need evidence that there is no appeal. We can use the docket: it lists all docket entries; if there is no \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"Appeal\" or \"Appellate\" entries, we can consider no appeal. But we need explicit evidence that indicates no appeal. We could use absence of \"appeal\" entries across all documents. But we need explicit text? The instructions say Not Applicable only if evidence or logical dispositive. A dismissal with prejudice indicates no appeal? There's a Voluntary Dismissal. Might be no appeal.\n\nWe can set Not Applicable by referencing the docket entries showing no appeal. We can state evidence: e.g., docket entry 28: \"NOTICE of Voluntary Dismissal\" and no \"Notice of Appeal\" entries. But is that dispositive? Dismissal could preclude appeal. For a voluntary dismissal, typically not appealable? Actually a voluntary dismissal is a dismissal by plaintiff; the case is dismissed, often with prejudice? But we don't know prejudice. But we might consider No Appeal.\n\nWe could also search for \"dismissal\" with prejudice. But we might need evidence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is an appeal in the Consent Decree? But we only read first 2000 tokens. We might need to search further. Maybe the consent decree contains an appeal clause to a federal appellate court. Might be at the end. We need to read further. Since we haven't fully read Consent Decree, we should search for \"appeal\" again in that doc, but we did search all docs and got 0 matches. That search included Consent Decree.

{"step": 16, "run_id": "50a390dd-d5f4-45c7-846e-d5e96aa6107d", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T15:24:03.084797-05:00", "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have a checklist item: Appeal. It has been set to Not Applicable based on Docket. But we need to confirm that there are no appeals elsewhere. We have partially visited documents: Complaint (60% coverage), Consent Decree (10% coverage). We should search for appeals in those documents. We must confirm that no appeals exist. But we cannot rely solely on the absence of \"appeal\" keyword; there might be appeals using different phrasing: \"appealed\", \"appellate\", \"appeal to\", \"appeal in\", \"appeal to the Court\", \"appellate court\". We already searched for \"appeal\" and \"appealed\" and \"Appellate\" and \"appealed to\" and \"notice of appeal\" – no matches. But maybe the phrase \"appeal\" may not be used; maybe the document includes \"appeal\" in a different case, but we have no matches. But we still have partially visited documents; we must read them fully to be sure. But the rule: \"If the document catalog is unknown → list_documents.\" Already known. The next step: we should read the remaining parts of the partially visited documents: Complaint tokens 2000-3166; Consent Decree tokens 2000-? (19,742 tokens). We need to search for appeals. We can use search_document_regex across all documents for \"appeal\" or \"appealed\" etc. But we already did that and found none. But maybe the search didn't cover all tokens? It says search_document_regex on all documents, pattern: \"appeal\" found 0. That should search across all documents entire content. But maybe something like \"appeal to\" or \"appeal in\" or \"appeal to the court\". But pattern \"appeal\" should catch any substring \"appeal\". It found none. So maybe there truly is no appeal. But we already set Not Applicable. But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. ... If no appeals found, mark Not Applicable.\" So we have done that.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that the \"Not Applicable\" is correct; we need to provide evidence. We already have evidence from Docket. It says \"Docket entries list various motions, notices, and orders but do not include any references to an appeal or appellate action.\" That is evidence.\n\nBut the system says we should \"ensure that all extractable values from the preceding text were included.\" We have only one value: Not Applicable. We must make sure we didn't miss any appeals. We already searched, but we might double-check with search_document_regex again, maybe using regex \"appeal to\" or \"appealed to\". But search already found none. But we might do a broader pattern: \"appeal[^\\n]*\" or something. But the search tool might not allow that? It supports regex pattern. We can use pattern \"appeal\" or \"appealed\" etc. Already did. But maybe the text includes \"Appealed\" with capital A? We did pattern \"\\bappeal\\b\" with IGNORECASE? We didn't set IGNORECASE. But maybe the search is case-sensitive. We can set flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"]. That will catch. But we already did \"Appeal\" pattern earlier. That should catch capitalized. But we didn't set ignore case. But pattern \"Appeal\" should catch capitalized. But maybe the text uses \"Appellate\" or \"Appellate\" with capital A. We searched \"Appellate\" and found none.\n\nBut maybe there's an appeal but not spelled \"appeal\" but \"appealed\" etc. We searched \"appealed\" and found none. So likely none exist.\n\nBut we need to double-check partially visited documents. But the search across all documents presumably covers entire content. But we should confirm that the search function returns matches across all documents. It did for Docket and others, but maybe the search didn't search the entire content of Consent Decree or Complaint? It says search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \"appeal\") -> no matches. That should cover all documents. So we can conclude no appeals.\n\nThus the \"Not Applicable\" entry is correct. But we must still check that we didn't miss any appeals in other documents. But we can double-check with a different pattern: \"appeal.*court\" or \"appeal to\" maybe. But we can search for \"appeal\" again with IGNORECASE to be safe. But that may find nothing. But we can just confirm.\n\nBut the question: The goal is to extract appeals. We have set Not Applicable and evidence. We have 1 value. So the extraction is complete.\n\nThus we should stop. But we must ensure that the Not Applicable entry is indeed present and evidence is provided. In step 15, we updated \"Appeal\" with Not Applicable and evidence from Docket. That seems enough.\n\nWe should verify that the current status shows Keys with Values: 1/1. That means the key is complete. So we can stop.\n\nThus we should output JSON with decision stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are complete.

The prior step 15 updated Appeal to Not Applicable based on Docket evidence. But we didn't fully exhaust all documents. Notably, we haven't fully read Consent Decree (only 2000 tokens, 10% coverage). There might be appeals in that. Also \"Order\" (365 tokens) unvisited; \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" unvisited; \"Joint Motion\" unvisited. Need to confirm if any appeals exist. The user wants all distinct appeal values. We must not prematurely stop. So we should search for appeal-related patterns in remaining documents. We did earlier search for \"appeal\" etc. But maybe the phrase \"appealed\" etc. The earlier searches returned no matches. But maybe there is \"appeal\" in different capitalization? Already searched various patterns. \"Appellate\" too. So likely no appeals in any doc. But we must be sure. We have not searched for \"appeal\" inside the Consent Decree beyond first 2000 tokens. Could be later. We could search entire Consent Decree for \"appeal\" pattern. Use search_document_regex on Consent Decree with pattern \"appeal\". That will return matches with context. If none, we can confirm Not Applicable. Also check \"Order\" doc. But we can also search all docs again for \"appeal\". But that was done earlier with no matches. But maybe after reading more tokens, new matches may appear? No, search_document_regex uses entire corpus. Already did earlier and got no matches. So we can be confident there are no appeals. But maybe there is a phrase like \"appealed to\" but earlier searches didn't find. But maybe it's \"appeals\" plural? Could search for \"appeals\". But earlier search didn't find. But maybe \"appeal\" appears in a different case or with whitespace? earlier regex had IGNORECASE? Not. Some patterns may have not matched due to word boundary? We used \"\\bappeal\\b\" which matches word \"appeal\". That should catch any. So likely none. Also \"Appellate\" search found none.\n\nThus the Not Applicable remains correct.\n\nBut we must still verify that all documents are fully visited (Consent Decree partially visited, others unvisited). But we don't need to read them if no appeals. But we need to be sure. The system's automatic review may allow a second stop. But we must ensure no appeals. Could search all documents again for \"appeal\" to be sure. But we already did. However, the search might have been limited by top_k? It returns top_k matches per doc; default 5. If there are more matches, but top_k might miss. But we can set top_k large. But we rely on earlier search that returned 0 matches. That means no matches at all. So safe.\n\nBut we still have partially visited Consent Decree; we haven't included its evidence for Not Applicable. But we only need evidence from Docket? The evidence for Not Applicable must be explicit. We had evidence from Docket showing no appeals. That is enough. But we might also want to add evidence from other documents that also show no appeals. But Not Applicable only needs one evidence. So fine.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we must issue stop action. The user is at step 18, wants to extract appeals. We have extracted Not Applicable. We can stop. So final action: stop.\n\nBut we must ensure that we didn't miss any appeal. Let's double-check: The docket entries list many motions, notices, orders. Could there be an appeal? But docket entries mention \"NOTICE of Voluntary Dismissal\" but no appeal. No \"appeal\" found.\n\nThus stop.\n\nReturn JSON with decision \"stop\".<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All checklist items have been evaluated; no appeals were found in the full document set, and the 'Appeal' key has been appropriately marked Not Applicable.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items have been evaluated; no appeals were found in the full document set, and the 'Appeal' key has been appropriately marked Not Applicable.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4429, "completion_tokens": 821, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
