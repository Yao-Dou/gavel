We have 6 documents. Likely Complaint contains cause of action. Also Docket, Consent Decree, Order, etc. The best is to search for pattern \"cause of action\" or \"counting\" or \"statutory basis\" etc. But we should use regex search to find patterns like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. But we need all distinct values of cause of action: statutes or judge-made vehicles. So we should search for typical causes: e.g., \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"Title II of the ADA\", \"FTC Act\", \"Bivens\", \"FTC\", \"Tennessee v. City\" etc. We need to read Complaint to capture. So first action: search_document_regex for patterns like \"§\" or \"U.S.C.\" or \"Title\" or \"ADA\" or \"Bivens\". Or we could directly read the Complaint. But searching may be faster. Let's search for \"§\" and \"U.S.C.\" across all documents. We'll use pattern \"§\\s*\\d+\"? But we want to capture cause of action. Maybe we can just search for \"§\" within the Complaint. But we might get many. Maybe search for \"42 U.S.C. §\" or \"Title II of the ADA\" etc. Let's just search for \"§\" pattern. But that might capture many. Maybe better to search for \"42 U.S.C.\" pattern. Use pattern \"42 U.S.C.\\s*§\\s*\\d+\".\n\nAlso for \"Title II of the ADA\" pattern. Use \"Title II of the ADA\". Also \"Bivens\". Use \"Bivens\".\n\nLet's combine multiple patterns? We can only pass one pattern. But we can search multiple docs with same pattern. But we might need separate calls. Perhaps simplest: search for \"42 U.S.C.\".\n\nAlso search for \"Title II of the ADA\". Could be in Complaint. Also \"FTCA\" maybe. But let's do multiple search calls sequentially.\n\nPlan: first search for \"42 U.S.C.\" across all documents. Then parse results. Then append entries. Then search for \"Title II of the ADA\". Then append. Then search for \"Bivens\". Then append. Then search for \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" or \"FTCA\" pattern. Then append. Then maybe \"Tennessee v. City\" etc. But we can stop when we think we found all. But to be systematic, we should search for standard causes. But we might miss others. But we can search for \"§\" pattern to capture all statutes.\n\nLet's do search for \"§\" with context. That will give many matches but we can parse. We'll get context around each. Then we can extract all distinct cause of action patterns.\n\nThus first action: search_document_regex for pattern \"§\".\n\nBut the regex may match many. But we can set flags MULTILINE. context_tokens 200. top_k maybe 20 per doc. That might be okay.\n\nOk. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"§\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "§", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 2789, "completion_tokens": 684, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have some matches from search_document_regex for § patterns. We need to identify cause of action: the legal vehicles used to bring the claims (statutes creating private right of action). From Complaint, we see Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), 1345, 28 U.S.C. § 1391. Also Title VII Section 703(k) is part of Title VII. We also see \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" as part of Title VII. So the cause of action is Title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6, § 2000e-2(k), § 2000e etc.). Also 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question), § 1343(a)(3) (civil rights), § 1345 (relief). Title VII is the main cause of action.\n\nAlso the complaint says \"enforced Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.\" So we should extract \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" as a cause of action. Possibly also \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" (statutory right). But we should dedupe: cause of action includes the statutory vehicle. So we list each distinct cause of action: Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.), 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question), 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) (civil rights), 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (relief). Also 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (venue). But maybe 28 U.S.C. § 1391 is venue, not cause of action. The requirement: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action.\" So we should include statutes that create a private right: Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e), 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) is also a civil rights statute providing private right. 28 U.S.C. § 1345 is a statute providing relief, but not necessarily a private right? But it's part of Federal Civil Rights law. Maybe include.\n\nAlso 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is a specific subsection of Title VII. But we may treat Title VII as the cause. But the requirement: \"statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action\". So Title VII qualifies. 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) is also a civil rights law that provides a private right. 28 U.S.C. § 1345 is about relief and also private right.\n\nWe should also maybe include \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" which details discriminatory practices. That is part of Title VII. But it's a substatute providing a private right. The cause of action may be Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.) and possibly \"28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3)\". But maybe we should not list each subsection separately, but list the statutory vehicle: Title VII and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345.\n\nAlso 28 U.S.C. § 1391 is venue. Not cause. So we ignore.\n\nAlso 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is a specific section within Title VII that provides a private right. But it's part of Title VII. The cause of action is Title VII. So we list Title VII.\n\nAlso 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) is also part of Title VII. So Title VII.\n\nThus, we can extract just \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" as the cause of action. But the complaint also states \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\", \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\", \"28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3)\", \"28 U.S.C. § 1345\". Are these considered cause of action? 28 U.S.C. 1331: federal question jurisdiction. That is not a cause of action but a basis for jurisdiction. But it is also a statutory vehicle that provides a private right? It's about jurisdiction, not a cause of action. But the requirement: \"statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action\". 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is not a private right; it's jurisdiction. So we exclude.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) is a civil rights statute. It provides for a private right of action. So include.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1345 is the civil rights statute that allows relief. It also provides a private right.\n\nThus we have 3 distinct causes of action: Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.), 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), 28 U.S.C. § 1345.\n\nAlso 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) is a substatute that provides a private right. But it's part of Title VII. But we might list it separately. But the instruction says deduplicate repeats; each cause appears only once. So we could list Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.) as the cause. But we may want to list each distinct statutory vehicle. So Title VII and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345. Possibly also \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\"? But maybe not.\n\nLet's look at the complaint snippet: \"This action is brought ... to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.\" That is the cause. Also it says \"This Court has jurisdiction ... 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\". That is jurisdiction. Also \"28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1345.\" That includes 1343(a)(3) and 1345. So cause of action includes Title VII, 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), 28 U.S.C. § 1345. So we should extract those.\n\nWe need to read to confirm that 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) and 1345 are indeed causes. The complaint: \"This Court has jurisdiction of this action under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1345.\" So the complaint includes them. So we can extract those.\n\nThus we need to read the part of the complaint that shows these statutes. The search results show matches containing those lines. We can read the snippet around tokens 247-447, etc. We need to read the relevant portion. We already have the text from tokens 247-447 in match 2. That shows \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1345.\" We need evidence for each cause. Also need evidence for Title VII. We have match 1 tokens 0-195, which shows \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.\" That is evidence.\n\nThus we can append three entries: Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.), 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), 28 U.S.C. § 1345. We need to provide evidence for each: text snippet, source document \"Complaint\", location \"page 1\" or token range. We can refer to match 1 for Title VII and match 2 for the others.\n\nWe should create an append_checklist call with patch for key \"Cause_of_Action\" and extracted values.\n\nLet's craft evidence:\n\n- For Title VII: text: \"enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.\" Source document: Complaint; location: Page 1 (tokens 0-195). Provide snippet exactly.\n\n- For 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3): text: \"28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1345.\" Provide snippet. Source: Complaint; location: Page 1 (tokens 247-447). Provide snippet.\n\n- For 28 U.S.C. § 1345: same snippet.\n\nAlternatively, we could separate the snippet for each but can use same snippet. Provide separate evidence entries.\n\nThus we will call append_checklist with patch: key \"Cause_of_Action\", extracted: list with three entries.\n\nLet's craft JSON.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Cause_of_Action\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 (tokens 0-195)\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1345.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 (tokens 247-447)\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"28 U.S.C. § 1345\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1345.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 (tokens 247-447)\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Cause_of_Action", "extracted": [{"value": "Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964", "evidence": [{"text": "enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 1 (tokens 0-195)"}]}, {"value": "28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3)", "evidence": [{"text": "28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1345.", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 1 (tokens 247-447)"}]}, {"value": "28 U.S.C. § 1345", "evidence": [{"text": "28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1345.", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 1 (tokens 247-447)"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7318, "completion_tokens": 2356, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have extracted some: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), 28 U.S.C. § 1345. But likely more: 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) etc. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) (disparate impact). Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is a cause of action. Also 28 U.S.C. § 1391, 28 U.S.C. § 1331 etc. But some are jurisdiction, not cause of action. Need to parse definitions: \"legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens). Do not include underlying rights, remedies, procedural doctrines.\" So we need to list statutes that create a private right of action. For Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., that creates private right of action. Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) provides cause of action for disparate impact. Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) is also a cause of action? Actually 2000e-2(k) is the statutory basis for disparate impact claim. So it is a cause. Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is a cause. Also 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) is a cause of action for federal civil procedure? Actually 1343(a)(3) is about action for civil rights. That is a cause of action. 28 U.S.C. § 1345 is a cause? 1345 is a civil procedure statute for review of administrative orders. It may be a cause? Actually 1345 is the \"Uniform Administrative Procedure Act\" and provides cause of action? It is not a private right of action, but a cause of action for enforcement of administrative orders. Might be considered a cause of action. But we need to check if it's a cause. The complaint uses it as jurisdiction. But the cause of action could be 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, etc. Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is a \"disparate impact\" claim. Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) is also a cause. Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) and 2000e-2(k) appear in complaint. Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. Possibly 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is separate. Also 28 U.S.C. § 1391 is jurisdiction, not cause. 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is jurisdiction. So we should extract only cause of action statutes.\n\nAlso maybe other documents (Consent Decree, etc.) mention other causes e.g., Title VII again. But we need to capture all distinct values. We have 3 already. We need to find more. Likely 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). Also 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345 maybe. But 1345 is for review of administrative orders; maybe not a cause of action for discrimination. But the complaint references it. But is it a cause? It's a private right of action for enforcement of a federal administrative order? Possibly used to enforce civil service regulations. But we can include it.\n\nAlso we might find 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) as separate cause. Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is a cause. Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is part of Title VII.\n\nAlso we might have 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) in the complaint.\n\nAlso maybe from Consent Decree or other documents: maybe 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) again. Also might mention Title VII. Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1983? Not in this. So we need to read more of the complaint to capture these.\n\nWe should read the part around tokens 1920-2100 maybe earlier part of complaint to capture cause of action. We saw earlier matches 3-12. We need to read the segments that mention 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) and § 2000e-2(k). Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) appears earlier. Let's search for \"2000e-6\" or \"2000e-2(k)\". We can use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"2000e\" or \"2000e-\". That will give matches. Also we might search for \"§ 2000e-6\" or \"§ 2000e-2(k)\". We should search for pattern \"§ 2000e-6\" or \"§ 2000e-2\". We'll likely get matches. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"§ 2000e-6\". Also for \"§ 2000e-2\". Also maybe \"§ 2000e-\" covers. Let's search for \"2000e-\". We'll do one search. But we should be careful not to exceed token limit. We'll request top_k maybe 10 per doc.\n\nWe need to read the complaint and maybe consent decree to capture all cause of action. So we should search the complaint for \"2000e-6\" and \"2000e-2\". We'll do search_document_regex on document \"Complaint\" for pattern \"2000e-6\" and \"2000e-2(k)\". Actually we can do two separate calls but maybe combine pattern with OR? But we can do two searches.\n\nWe also need to confirm that 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) is a cause of action. It's a cause. We'll keep it.\n\nAlso maybe 28 U.S.C. § 1345 is not a cause of action but a procedural basis. But we can include it as cause? The earlier extraction included it. But we can consider that maybe it's not a private right of action; but it's a cause in the sense of \"private right of action for enforcement of administrative orders\" maybe. But we can keep it as extracted.\n\nBut maybe we should also include 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e\" alone is a cause of action (Title VII). But we might want to capture that too. But we already have \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" as a value. That might be enough. But we might want to include the statutory citation \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.\" but we already have that. But we can keep as \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" as the cause. That covers the statute.\n\nThus we need to append new values: \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\". Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\". Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\". Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" appears multiple times. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" appears. So we need to add these two.\n\nAlso check if there are any other cause of action statutes like \"28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3)\" we already have. Also maybe \"28 U.S.C. § 1345\" we have. Also 28 U.S.C. § 1391 is jurisdiction not cause. 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is jurisdiction. So we have all.\n\nThus we need to read the complaint for those matches. Let's search for \"2000e-6\" in complaint.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint\",\"pattern\":\"2000e-6\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "pattern": "2000e-6", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7553, "completion_tokens": 1957, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But likely more: 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), 28 U.S.C. § 1391, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k), etc. Also maybe \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" is the statute; but the cause of action is specific statutes: Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), § 2000e-2(k), etc). Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e\" etc. Also 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction). 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (venue). 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) (equal protection). 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (equal protection?). Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" etc. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" is cited. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" could be cause of action? That is a specific subsection. Might include that. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\". Also \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\". Also \"28 U.S.C. § 1391\" (venue). But cause of action refers to legal vehicle used to bring the claims. That includes statutes creating a private or enforcement right. So Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) etc) is cause. Also 28 U.S.C. § 1331, § 1343(a)(3), § 1345, § 1391. Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b). Also maybe 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). Also 28 U.S.C. § 1391. Also 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Also 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). Also 28 U.S.C. § 1345. Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e (overall). The complaint says \"enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.\" That includes the entire Title VII. So maybe that counts as a cause of action. Also \"Title VII\" is a cause of action. Also \"28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3)\" is equal protection. But is that a cause? The complaint uses that for jurisdiction? The cause of action could be Title VII and Equal Protection. But the cause of action must be the legal vehicle used to bring the claims. The complaint alleges violation of Title VII. That is the cause. Also equal protection claims may be separate cause. The complaint references 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) but also says \"28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3)\" is part of jurisdiction. But that statute provides a cause of action: equal protection. But the complaint might be bringing equal protection claims. It might not be the cause of action but the basis for equal protection. The complaint may be bringing equal protection claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). Usually equal protection claims are under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). So that is cause of action. Also 28 U.S.C. § 1345 is equal protection? Actually 1345 is equal protection. So that is also cause. So we have multiple.\n\nWe need to read more to capture others: 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is a specific subsection of Title VII. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) is also a subsection. Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is part of Title VII. So we might need to list these.\n\nAlso maybe 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (venue). Probably not cause of action but venue. But the requirement is to extract every distinct value of this checklist item. The checklist item is Cause_of_Action: The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims. So we want all statutes that create right of action. Venue is not a right of action. So likely exclude § 1391. So we should not include § 1391.\n\nThus we need to extract Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k), 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), 28 U.S.C. § 1345. Also 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is federal question jurisdiction, not a cause of action. But maybe considered? It's a cause of action for federal question. But typically it's a jurisdictional statute. But the requirement says legal vehicle used to bring the claims. 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is a federal question jurisdiction statute, not a cause of action. So maybe exclude. But the complaint uses it for jurisdiction. So maybe not.\n\nAlso 42 U.S.C. § 2000e (the entire Title VII). So we might include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That is the cause.\n\nAlso in consent decree, maybe other causes: maybe \"Title VII\" again. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" etc.\n\nThus we need to read more of the complaint to capture all. We have partial coverage. We need to read more unvisited tokens: 607-1932, 2132-2220, 2574-2614, 2814-? etc. We need to read rest of complaint.\n\nAlso read consent decree for other causes: maybe equal protection claims. Let's search for \"equal protection\" or \"28 U.S.C. § 1343\" or \"§ 1345\" in all documents.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on all documents for patterns like \"§ 1343\" or \"§ 1345\" or \"§ 2000e-6\" etc. But maybe easier to read full complaint. We can read remaining tokens of complaint. Let's read from 607 to maybe end of complaint (3,166 tokens). We have up to 2814. So we need to read 2814-3166. Let's call read_document.\n\nAlso read consent decree for other causes: we have partial coverage. We need to search for \"Title VII\" etc.\n\nWe also need to ensure dedup.\n\nThus next action: read_document for Complaint from 2814 to 3166.\n\nAlso might need to read consent decree for all tokens? Maybe search. But we can search for patterns in all docs. Let's search for \"§ 2000e-2(k)\" across all docs. Also \"§ 2000e-6\" etc.\n\nBut maybe the complaint contains all. Let's read.\n\nWe'll do read_document Complaint start 2814, end 3166.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint\",\"start_token\":2814,\"end_token\":3166}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 2814, "end_token": 3166}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7827, "completion_tokens": 1608, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But we might have missed other causes of action. The Complaint also states \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" and \"28 U.S.C. § 1391\" etc. But the cause of action is the legal vehicle used to bring the claims. In the Complaint, the cause of action is Title VII (the civil rights statute). Also they cite 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) as a jurisdictional provision, not cause of action. But the cause of action is Title VII. They might also include \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" (the same). They might also mention \"28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3)\" and \"28 U.S.C. § 1345\" as statutory basis for Federal civil rights claims? Actually 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) is the federal court jurisdiction for civil rights lawsuits. It is not the cause of action. The cause of action is Title VII. So we should maybe not include 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) and § 1345. The instruction says: \"extract the cause of action ... the legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action.\" So 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) is a jurisdictional provision, not a cause of action. 28 U.S.C. § 1345 is also a jurisdictional provision. So we should maybe exclude them. The only cause of action is Title VII.\n\nBut maybe also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is a statutory provision that creates the right to sue in federal court for Title VII disputes. But it's a jurisdictional provision. The \"cause of action\" is Title VII. So we should list \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" only. But the text says \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\". That is a sub-section of Title VII, but again cause is Title VII. So we might need to include \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" as part of Title VII. The instruction: \"such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA)\". So Title VII is a cause of action. The sub-section 2000e-6(b) is a specific statute that creates a right of action. So maybe we should include both Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) as separate? But the same law? But maybe we include each distinct value of the cause of action. So we could list \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\". But the complaint specifically states \"in violation of Title VII\" and \"under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\". So we could include both. Also \"28 U.S.C. § 1391\" is jurisdiction, not cause of action.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" appears in the complaint as a specific subsection of Title VII. But again that is a part of Title VII. But the cause of action is Title VII. We might also include \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" as a distinct cause of action? It's an actionable subsection. Could be considered a cause of action. But it's a part of Title VII. But still a statute that creates a right of action. So we might list \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\".\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" is a statute that creates a right of action for Title VII claims. So we might list that.\n\nThus we currently have 3 values: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), 28 U.S.C. § 1345. But we need to correct: we should not include § 1343(a)(3) and § 1345. So we need to update the checklist: remove those values and add missing ones.\n\nThus we should update the checklist to set Cause_of_Action to only the correct values. We have evidence for Title VII. We need evidence for 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b). We have evidence from the complaint: \"under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\". We also need evidence for 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). Evidence: multiple lines in complaint: \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" appears. We must check if we have evidence from earlier reads. We saw in Match 3 etc: \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\". Yes. So we should include that.\n\nThus we need to update checklist to include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). Possibly also \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" is a cause of action. Yes.\n\nWe might also include \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\", \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\", \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\".\n\nThus we need to update the checklist accordingly. We must use update_checklist.\n\nWe also need to ensure no duplicates. So we should provide an update with exactly those three values.\n\nWe must provide evidence for each:\n\n- Title VII: from Complaint Page 1 tokens 0-195: \"enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.\"\n\n- 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b): from Complaint: \"under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\". That's tokens 248-448. Provide evidence snippet.\n\n- 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k): from Complaint: \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" appears in tokens 1932-2132 and 2220-2420. We'll reference one snippet.\n\nThus we will call update_checklist with patch for key Cause_of_Action with extracted array of three entries.\n\nWe must ensure no previous values remain. The previous values included Title VII, § 1343(a)(3), § 1345. We will replace entire list. So update_checklist.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Cause_of_Action\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"\\\"enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.\\\"\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 (tokens 0-195)\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"\\\"under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\\\"\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 (tokens 248-448)\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"\\\"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\\\"\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 7 (tokens 1932-2132)\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Cause_of_Action", "extracted": [{"value": "Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964", "evidence": [{"text": "\"enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.\"", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 1 (tokens 0-195)"}]}, {"value": "42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)", "evidence": [{"text": "\"under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\"", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 1 (tokens 248-448)"}]}, {"value": "42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)", "evidence": [{"text": "\"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\"", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 7 (tokens 1932-2132)"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8250, "completion_tokens": 1817, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But we need all distinct values of Cause_of_Action across all documents. Likely more: 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), 28 U.S.C. § 1345, 28 U.S.C. § 1391, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, maybe Title II ADA? But maybe other documents contain other causes: Consent Decree might mention Title VII again but already captured. Also \"Title II of the ADA\" or \"FTCA\" etc. Let's search for \"Title II\" or \"ADA\" etc. Also search for \"42 U.S.C. §\" patterns. Use search_document_regex on all documents for \"42 U.S.C. §\" to gather all citations. But careful: we don't want to include underlying rights like 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) is a cause? It's a statute that creates right of action under Title VII. Yes. Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is a cause. 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) and § 1345 and § 1391, § 1331 are jurisdictional statutes, not causes of action, but they are causes of action? The instructions: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens). Do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments or statutory rights), remedies (injunction, damages, declaratory relief), or procedural doctrines/rules (e.g., Rule 23, Ex parte Young, standing, immunity).\"\n\nThus, jurisdiction statutes are not causes of action—they assert jurisdiction, not a cause of action. So we should not include 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) or § 1345 or § 1391 or § 1331 or 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) maybe? Wait 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is part of Title VII, but is it a cause of action? The cause of action is Title VII itself, not the specific section. However, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is a subsection that provides jurisdiction for civil rights claims. But is it a cause of action? Not exactly; it's a jurisdictional provision. The cause is Title VII. The specific sub-section may be considered part of the cause? The instructions: \"statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA)\". That refers to statutes that provide cause of action. Title VII provides cause of action. But 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is a subsection of Title VII that deals with jurisdiction. It's not a cause of action. So we should exclude it. Similarly, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) is a subsection of Title VII that provides a cause of action for disparate impact. It is a cause. So include 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). Also Title VII is the cause. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" not present. Also \"FTCA\" not present. Also maybe \"Title II of the ADA\" not present. So the only causes: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is not in documents, but might appear in other docs. But we should search all documents for 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Also search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"1983\". Also search for \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" might not be cause. So we might need to ensure we don't include jurisdiction statutes incorrectly. Let's search for \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6\" across all docs to confirm. But we already saw it. We should not include that as cause. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" is cause. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-1\" etc. But likely only these. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" might appear in other docs. Let's search. We'll add search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" across all docs. Also search for \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-1\" maybe. Let's use search_document_regex pattern: \"42 U.S.C. § 20[0-9]e-\\\\d+\\\\(?[a-z]*\\\\)?\" but maybe simpler: \"42 U.S.C. § 20\\\\d+e-\\\\d+\".\n\nAlso search for \"Title VII\" or \"Civil Rights Act of 1964\". But we already captured Title VII. Maybe \"Title II of the ADA\" might appear. Search for \"Title II of the ADA\". Also \"FTCA\" search for \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" or \"FTCA\". Let's search for \"FTCA\". Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". Let's run search_document_regex on \"all\" for pattern \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". Then maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1932\" etc. But let's focus.\n\nAlso need to check Consent Decree, Docket, Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree for any cause of action. Likely no new ones. But maybe Consent Decree may refer to Title VII again. Already captured.\n\nThus we likely need to update the checklist to include Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). But Title VII is included. Also we must remove the jurisdiction statutes that were incorrectly appended earlier. We need to correct the list. So we should perform an update_checklist to replace Cause_of_Action with the correct set: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). But also we might need to add 42 U.S.C. § 1983 if found. Let's search for it. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in other documents like Docket? Possibly yes. Let's search.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"42 U.S.C. § 1983\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "42 U.S.C. § 1983", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8488, "completion_tokens": 1501, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have 3 already: Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). We need to check other documents for additional causes. The Complaint covered many. But maybe Consent Decree contains other causes. We should search for patterns like \"§\" or specific statutes: 28 U.S.C. § maybe. But earlier search found 19 matches of \"§\" in Complaint and Consent Decree. But we didn't extract all. We need to find all distinct causes. The Complaint also included 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), 1345. But earlier update replaced those with Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). Wait: we replaced 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) with 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b). That suggests the Complaint also had 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1345. But we replaced with other causes only. Maybe the 28 U.S.C. § 1345 is not a cause of action? But it's a federal statute: Civil Rights Act? Actually 28 U.S.C. § 1345 is \"Federal courts' jurisdiction over civil actions for the enforcement of civil rights.\" That is a cause of action? Not necessarily. But maybe they consider it a cause. But earlier update replaced with Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). So we might need to also extract 28 U.S.C. § 1345? But earlier step 3 had extracted it. Then step 6 updated to remove it. So maybe the correct ones are just Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). But we need to check other documents: Consent Decree might mention \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. Search step 7 found 0. But step 7 searched for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and found none. But there might be other statutes: maybe \"28 U.S.C. § 1340\" etc. Let's search for \"§ [0-9]\" patterns. But we might need to do search_document_regex on all documents for \"§\" with context. But we already did earlier, found 19 matches. But maybe not all. Let's search for \"§ 1\" etc. Better to search for \"§ 2000e-2\" etc. But we already captured those. Let's search for \"§ 2000e-6\" we did. For Consent Decree, maybe there are other causes. Let's search for \"§\" in Consent Decree. Also search for \"28 U.S.C.\" or \"42 U.S.C.\" or \"Title\" etc. But maybe the Consent Decree includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. But step 7 searched for 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and found none. Maybe the Consent Decree mentions other causes like \"Title VII\" again. But we already have Title VII. But maybe the Consent Decree mentions \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6\" again. But that's already extracted. But we need distinct values; duplicates okay. But we need to check if any other cause not captured: maybe \"28 U.S.C. § 1345\" is still a cause. But step 6 removed it. Did we mistakenly remove it? The update replaced with Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). That means we consider only those three. But maybe we should add 28 U.S.C. § 1345 if it qualifies. Let's check the definition: 28 U.S.C. § 1345 is the federal courts' jurisdiction over civil actions for the enforcement of civil rights. That is a cause of action? It's a statute that authorizes civil rights causes. But the cause of action is the underlying claim: Title VII. 28 U.S.C. § 1345 is a jurisdiction statute, not a cause. So likely not included. But maybe the system expects to include it? The earlier extraction had it but then removed. So final list is those three.\n\nBut we need to verify if Consent Decree has any other cause like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. Let's search Consent Decree for \"§\". We'll use search_document_regex on Consent Decree for pattern \"§\". But that's broad. But we can limit to \"§ 2000e\" maybe. But maybe there is \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". Let's search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" again but maybe the Consent Decree has it. Step 7 searched all docs and found none. So none.\n\nSearch for \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\" etc. That might be a cause. But earlier we removed. But maybe Consent Decree includes \"28 U.S.C. § 1331\" again. But maybe we should include 28 U.S.C. § 1331 as a cause? But 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is diversity jurisdiction. Not a cause. So exclude.\n\nThus likely final list is the three.\n\nBut we must confirm that we have extracted all distinct values. We need to check if Consent Decree contains any other cause of action like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2\" etc. Let's search Consent Decree for \"42 U.S.C. §\". We'll do a search regex for \"42 U.S.C. § [0-9-]+\" maybe. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Consent Decree\",\"pattern\":\"42 U.S.C. § [0-9-]+\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Consent Decree", "pattern": "42 U.S.C. § [0-9-]+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4109, "completion_tokens": 1349, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But we must ensure all distinct causes of action in any document. We have partially visited Consent Decree. Likely there may be additional causes: Title VII again? In Consent Decree, there is mention of Title VII (the City denies it violated Title VII). But that is a claim, not a cause. Also maybe Title II of the ADA, or 42 U.S.C. § 1983? The search earlier didn't find 42 U.S.C. § 1983. But we might need to search further for other statutes like 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Also maybe there's an \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" again. We have that. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" which is a discriminatory intent claim.\n\nMaybe other documents: Docket, Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Joint Motion. The Docket may list claims. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal probably indicates dismissal of claims, but may contain cause of action list. The Joint Motion may refer to claims. The Order may have causes.\n\nWe need to ensure complete list. So next action should be search_document_regex on all documents for patterns that could indicate causes of action: 42 U.S.C. § [0-9-]+, Title [IV] of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, maybe Title II ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. But we might need to read the docket for claims.\n\nBetter to search for \"§\" in all documents again? Already did earlier but found 19 matches, all in Complaint and Consent Decree. But we might not have seen 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because none.\n\nMaybe search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" again? Already did, 0 matches. So likely no 1983.\n\nSearch for \"Title VII\" again? Already found in Complaint.\n\nSearch for \"Title II\" maybe. We can search for \"Title [^ ]+\" but might be too broad.\n\nGiven the legal context, likely only causes: Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). But we need to confirm if Consent Decree includes any new cause: maybe \"Title VII\" again but that's same. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\"? Not found.\n\nCheck Docket: maybe has line \"Claims: 1. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; 2. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b); 3. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\". Could be.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Docket to get claims.

But there might be additional causes in Consent Decree or other documents like Joint Motion or Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. Could also be \"§ 2000e-6(b)\" is one; maybe also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is another if present. Search for \"1983\" returned 0. Maybe other statutes: \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6\" is present. \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" present. Also Title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964. Maybe also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" not present but could be in other docs not yet searched. Also possibly \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in consent decree? Not found.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" may be in other docs like Joint Motion. We haven't searched that. We should search in all remaining unvisited documents for patterns like \"U.S.C. §\" or \"§\". We did earlier search for \"§\" in all docs found 19 matches: 12 in Complaint, 7 in Consent Decree. That likely captured other statutes. But maybe other docs have also. We didn't search other docs for §.\n\nThus next step: search_document_regex for pattern \"42 U.S.C. § [0-9-]+\" across all documents. That would capture any statutory causes in other docs. But we already did search on Consent Decree and found 4 matches, but those were not statutory? Actually those matches contain \"Title VII\" but not statutory code. The regex would find \"42 U.S.C. § [0-9-]+\" which might pull out \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6\" etc. But we already have from Complaint. But maybe other docs like Joint Motion may contain other statutes e.g., \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"42 U.S.C. § 1981\" etc. So let's search all docs for pattern \"42 U.S.C. § [0-9-]+\".\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"42 U.S.C. § [0-9-]+\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "42 U.S.C. § [0-9-]+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6754, "completion_tokens": 608, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Need to check if any other causes of action exist in other documents. For example, Consent Decree might have same causes, but the pattern shows \"Title VII\" again maybe. But we need all distinct values across any document. We have only found those three. Search for \"42 U.S.C. §\" pattern again? We already did step 10 search across all documents. It found 11 total matches: 7 in Complaint, 4 in Consent Decree. The Consent Decree matches didn't show specific § numbers; they just have \"Title VII\" references. But we should check if Consent Decree might also mention \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" or \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\". The snippet didn't show. But maybe later in Consent Decree there are other sections. We should search again in Consent Decree for \"§\" maybe with pattern \"§ 2000e\" or \"§ 2000e-\"? Could also contain other causes like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" but step 7 found none. Also maybe other causes like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" in other docs. But we didn't search other documents like Order, Notice, Motion. Could be \"Title IX\" or \"Title VI\" etc. But likely no.\n\nWe need to ensure we have covered all documents. We have partially visited Consent Decree with only 4% coverage. We should search for \"42 U.S.C. §\" in Consent Decree again to confirm any other causes. Also search for \"Title\" maybe \"Title VII\" repeated. But that is same.\n\nWe also might need to capture \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\". Already captured. Are there any other citations like \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6\" without (b) or \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2\"? Might be. We should search for \"2000e-\" pattern. Step 4 earlier looked for \"2000e-6\" and found one match. But maybe other patterns like \"2000e-2\" etc. But we have captured 2000e-2(k). Could there be 2000e-2? The pattern may be \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" only. Might be other cause like \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" we have. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6\" synonyms. But we captured that.\n\nAlso maybe cause of action under \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" we searched and found none. So we likely have all.\n\nBut we should search for \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e\" pattern across all documents to confirm no extra. But Step 10 already found all matches across all docs. 11 matches: 7 in Complaint, 4 in Consent Decree. None show other citations. Consent Decree matches didn't show numbers. Possibly the Consent Decree contains other sections but the search didn't capture because maybe there are no § signs. Could be \"Title VII\" but not §. But the cause of action includes the statute, not section. So we only need the statute. Title VII is a statute; we captured that. So likely we have all.\n\nBut we should confirm if any other documents contain cause of action. The other documents might be \"Order\", \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\", \"Joint Motion\". Those might not contain causes. But we can search quickly for \"Title VII\" in those documents to be sure. But we can also search for \"Title\" maybe. But the requirement is to extract every distinct value of Cause_of_Action found in any document. So if other documents mention \"Title VII\" again, we should not duplicate. But duplication is fine? The requirement: \"Deduplicate repeats so that each cause of action appears only once.\" So if \"Title VII\" appears again, we shouldn't add duplicate. So it's fine.\n\nThus we likely already have all distinct values: 3. However we need to check if any other cause not in Complaint but maybe in Consent Decree like \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" again. But if duplicates, ignore.\n\nThus we can stop? But we need to ensure there are no more. Let's search all documents for \"§\" to see if any other citations. But we can't read entire documents. We can use search_document_regex across all docs for pattern \"§\". That may produce many matches. But we can restrict maybe to \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6\" etc. But we already did. But maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e\" pattern could catch others. Let's search for \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e\" across all docs. That might find same matches. But we can search for \"42 U.S.C. § \" pattern. That is what step 10 did. So no further matches.\n\nThus we have all.\n\nBut we should confirm that we didn't miss any cause like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" maybe in other docs. We searched across all docs and found none. So likely all.\n\nThus we can stop. But we need to ensure that the checklist's \"Cause_of_Action\" key is fully extracted. We have 3 values. Are they correct? We need to confirm evidence for each: we have evidence from complaint. We have extracted evidence for each value.\n\nBut we need to ensure that we have appended those values to the checklist. According to step 6 we did update_checklist with 3 values. So the checklist already contains those 3. So we have all. The \"Current Status\" says: keys with values: 1/1 (Cause_of_Action), empty keys 0/1, not applicable 0/1, total values extracted 3. So it indicates we already have the values. So we may have already finished extraction. But we still need to confirm that no other values exist. But we may need to perform a get_checklist to confirm. But maybe the system expects us to call get_checklist to verify. But we can stop if we are sure. But safer to do a get_checklist to confirm we have all values. But the instruction: choose exactly one action. We could call get_checklist to ensure completeness. But the system's logic: we must stop when all keys are complete. But we might not know completeness. We can verify via get_checklist. But we can also stop if we are confident. But it's safer to call get_checklist to see if any other values exist. But we don't have key list; we only have one key. So get_checklist might return the key's values. But if we call get_checklist, we will get the same 3. But we might not realize if there are others. But we might rely on search results that had no matches.\n\nGiven we have 11 matches across all docs for § pattern, we saw only those 3. So we can stop.\n\nThus we should issue \"stop\" with reason.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct causes of action identified: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k).

The last status: 3 values: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). Those are the causes of action found. But we need to verify if any other causes are present in other documents: maybe the Complaint also contains \"Title VII\" etc. Already captured. Consent Decree apparently does not add new causes; it mentions Title VII but same. There might be also \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e\" but that's Title VII. Are there any other statutes? The Complaint also references \"28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1345\" for jurisdiction, but those are not causes of action—they are just jurisdiction. The complaint uses \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" as cause.\n\nAlso maybe the Complaint contains \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\". Also Title VII. The recall step 11 said \"no additional citations found in remaining documents.\" That seems thorough.\n\nBut we need to double-check if there might be any other cause of action in the \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\" or others. The Joint Motion likely references the same cause of action. But maybe it includes \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" again. But not new.\n\nThus likely all causes of action extracted.\n\nHowever, we must confirm that the checklist currently has 3 values, but are they correctly deduplicated? Titles: \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" are separate. Wait, Title VII is the same as 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6? Actually Title VII is codified as 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6. But they might be considered separate vehicles: Title VII is the statutory vehicle, but it is the same as the section. But the instruction: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims — such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA)\". So Title VII is a statutory vehicle; 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is a sub-section of Title VII, but the cause of action is Title VII. So we might not need to list both Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b). But the complaint includes both. The cause of action is Title VII. Maybe we should only list Title VII. But the complaint also lists 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) which is a specific cause of action under Title VII. So we should list Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). But the 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is jurisdiction. The complaint says \"This Court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\". That's not a cause. So maybe we incorrectly included that. Wait, the system earlier had 3 values: Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). But that might be wrong. We need to double-check. The complaint lines:\n\nMatch 1: \"enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.\" That's Title VII.\n\nMatch 2: \"This Court has jurisdiction of this action under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1345.\" That's jurisdiction.\n\nSo the cause is Title VII. The complaint also states \"violation of Title VII\" in the allegations. But no other cause.\n\nAlso 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) is part of Title VII, but is a specific subsection. The cause of action is Title VII. The complaint's allegations mention \"Section 703(k) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k).\" That is a specific cause of action under Title VII. So the list should include Title VII, and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). The 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) is not a cause of action; it's a jurisdictional basis. So we need to correct the extracted list: we should remove 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b). We need to update the checklist.\n\nThus we need to use `update_checklist` to set the list to the correct values: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k).\n\nWe need evidence for each.\n\nWe have evidence from complaint: Title VII lines, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) lines. Let's locate the evidence.\n\nSearch for \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" in complaint. We saw in match 5 and 6. Provide context. That evidence snippet includes \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\". Provide snippet.\n\nAlso Title VII evidence: from match 1.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't double count.\n\nSo we need to replace the existing list with two entries.\n\nAction: update_checklist for Cause_of_Action with two entries.\n\nWe must include evidence for each entry.\n\nWe need to provide evidence text, source_document, location. For location, we can give page number or token range. We have token ranges from search results. For Title VII: match 1 tokens 0-192, location \"Complaint page 1\" maybe. For 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k): match 5 tokens 2218-2418. Provide location \"Complaint page 7\" maybe. But token offsets are given. Use token ranges.\n\nThus:\n\n- Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: evidence from tokens 0-192.

The goal: extract Cause_of_Action from documents. Currently 3 values extracted: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). According to prior steps, they think all distinct causes identified. But we need to verify if any other documents contain other causes. We saw earlier search for \"42 U.S.C. § [0-9-]+\" found matches in Complaint and Consent Decree. Also earlier search for \"§\" found many matches. We might need to check other documents like Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Joint Motion. Also could be others like \"Title IX\", \"Title II\" etc. Let's search across all documents for common cause-of-action citations: \"Title II\", \"Title III\", \"Title IX\", \"42 U.S.C. §\", \"15 U.S.C. §\", \"42 U.S.C. §\", \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"42 U.S.C. § 1985\" etc. Also \"RICO\", \"FTCA\", \"ADA\", \"Fair Labor Standards Act\".\n\nBetter to search for \"§\" but that's too broad. Maybe search for \"§\" plus digits: pattern \"§\\\\s?[0-9]\". But we need to capture statutes. Let's search all documents for \"§\" pattern that includes digits. The earlier search included pattern \"42 U.S.C. § [0-9-]+\" which found 11 matches. But maybe other statutes not starting with 42 U.S.C. For example \"15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)\". So we need to search for \"U.S.C.\" maybe pattern \"U.S.C. §\". Let's search all documents for \"U.S.C. §\".<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. §\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "U\\.S\\.C\\. §", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7997, "completion_tokens": 443, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Current state: Cause_of_Action has 3 values extracted from Complaint. We have not yet searched other documents for additional causes. Need to confirm if there are additional causes in Consent Decree, Order, etc. The prior steps indicated Step 11 said all distinct causes identified: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). But that was based on search results. However we haven't appended those? Wait Step 6 updated checklist with 3 values. But we saw from search results: Title VII of Civil Rights Act (maybe 42 U.S.C. § 2000e). Also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b) and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). So 3 values. But are there more? Could there be Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-7?) Not likely. The consent decree likely references Title VII too. But maybe we should double-check for other causes like \"Disparate Impact\" under Title VII. But that is still Title VII. So likely 3 distinct causes.\n\nBut we need to ensure that all distinct causes in all documents have been identified. The system indicates we have partial coverage of Consent Decree, but maybe some cause of action references in Consent Decree, e.g., \"Title VII\" again. But that's same cause. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" appears in Complaint. The consent decree may not mention it. But we need to search for any other statutory provisions like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" etc. We might search across documents for \"§\" pattern again but we already did, but it found only those matches. But we might need to search for \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e\" etc. But maybe the consent decree has a broader \"Title VII\" mention. But that is same cause.\n\nWe also need to check if there is any reference to \"Title VIII\" or \"§ 1983\" etc. The search results didn't show. But maybe there is a \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" in the docket. But we didn't search for that. But we can search all documents for \"1983\" or \"1988\" etc. But that's risk. But we need to confirm completeness.\n\nThe instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if there are only 3 distinct values, we are done. But we should verify that no other cause of action appears elsewhere.\n\nWe might still need evidence for each of the 3 values. We have evidence from Complaint for each: Title VII of Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 2000e), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). We have tokens for each. But we haven't appended those yet; we did update step earlier but maybe not with evidence. Step 6 updated with 3 values, but likely we need to provide evidence. The prior update didn't show evidence; maybe it did but truncated. But we need to ensure that the checklist has the extracted values with evidence. The system says \"Keys with Extracted Values (1): Cause_of_Action: 3 values (3 from Complaint)\". That implies the update has been done. But we don't see evidence details. But likely the system already updated with evidence. We need to confirm if we need to append further evidence? The system may have evidence. But we need to check if any other documents contain new causes.\n\nWe can run search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"42 U.S.C. §\" again but maybe we already did. Step 14 had many matches including all those same. We saw only those 3 distinct. So no new. But maybe there's \"Title VII\" text in Consent Decree but it's same. But we might need to append evidence for Title VII from Consent Decree. But we already have evidence from Complaint; that is enough. But we might need to extract from Consent Decree too? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" It doesn't require evidence from each document, just evidence. So a single evidence snippet per value is enough. So we are done.\n\nBut we should double-check if there are any other cause of action references like \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" in the docket maybe. Let's search for \"1988\" or \"1983\" quickly.\n\nBut we must be careful: we can only call search_document_regex once per turn. We can search for pattern \"1983\" maybe. But we risk missing others. But we can search for \"§\" again but we saw all. But maybe some are in other documents that we haven't searched fully: Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Joint Motion. But those documents likely don't contain cause of action. But we can search them.\n\nWe could search for \"§\" across all documents again; but we already did and saw matches only in Complaint and Consent Decree. But maybe Order contains \"§ 2000e-2(k)\" but not captured due to limited coverage? Search_document_regex returns top matches across all docs; it should capture all. But maybe it didn't because pattern \"§\" is generic; but we saw 15 matches across all docs in Step 14. That likely covers all. So no new.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we need to ensure that the checklist is fully populated and no key remains empty. The status says \"Keys with Extracted Values (1): Cause_of_Action: 3 values\". So that's all. So we can stop.\n\nBut we need to produce stop JSON. According to instructions: \"When stopping, return only this JSON (no extra text): { 'decision': 'stop', 'reason': '<brief justification>' }\"\n\nSo answer: stop.\n\nBut before final, confirm that we haven't missed any cause. Let's think of possible cause: The complaint also refers to \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e\". That's one. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b)\" is a specific jurisdiction. And \"42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)\" is the cause of action. So 3 distinct. Consent Decree references Title VII but not other statutes. So done.\n\nThus final output: stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct causes of action (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)) have been extracted with evidence from the Complaint, and no additional causes were found in the remaining documents.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct causes of action (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(b), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)) have been extracted with evidence from the Complaint, and no additional causes were found in the remaining documents.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9462, "completion_tokens": 1481, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
