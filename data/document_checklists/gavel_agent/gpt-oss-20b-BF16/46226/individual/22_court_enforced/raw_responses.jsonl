We have partial reading of Consent Decree. The search results show some mentions of retention of jurisdiction. We need to confirm if the settlement is court-enforced. In a consent decree, generally the settlement is court-enforced, as it's a court order. But we need explicit evidence: statement that court retains jurisdiction to enforce settlement, or that settlement is a court order. Let's search within the Consent Decree for \"court-enforced\" or \"court order\" or \"court retains jurisdiction\". There's already search for retain jurisdiction. The snippet shows: \"entering any orders that may be appropriate to implement the Decree until the obligations set forth in Paragraph 136 have been met.\" But maybe earlier there's a clause about \"This Decree constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties\" which implies enforceability by court.\n\nWe should search for \"court order\" or \"court-enforced\" or \"enforcement\" within Consent Decree. The search earlier for \"enforce|enforcement|retain jurisdiction\" gave two matches: one earlier around paragraph 5, the other at 18795-18995. But maybe the snippet didn't capture the clause. We need to read more context around those matches. Let's read around tokens 18795-18995. That's presumably the part about \"entering any orders that may be appropriate to implement the Decree until the obligations set forth in Paragraph 136...\" So likely we need to read that range fully to see if it says \"court retains jurisdiction\" or \"court will enforce\". But the snippet didn't show that. We might need to read more context, maybe earlier in the decree. Perhaps the decree has a clause: \"This Decree is a court order and the court retains jurisdiction to enforce it.\" This is common.\n\nLet's search again for \"court retains jurisdiction\" pattern again but maybe broader. Or search for \"court retains\" or \"retain jurisdiction\" globally. Already did. Only match found. Maybe the clause is in a different section.

But we need to capture the clause.\n\nWe also may need to confirm that settlement is court-enforced: \"This Decree constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties, and supersedes all prior agreements, representations, negotiations, and undertakings not set forth or incorporated herein.\" That indicates court enforcement.

Let's consider other documents: Complaint, Docket, Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Joint Motion. The settlement is the Consent Decree. The other documents likely are pre-decree.
