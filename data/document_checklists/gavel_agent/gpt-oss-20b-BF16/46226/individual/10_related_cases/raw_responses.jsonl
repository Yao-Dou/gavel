We have already search results showing case numbers in 3 documents: the Joint Motion, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Order. All show same case number: 24-cv-838 or 1:24-cv-838? The patterns show \"Case No.  24-cv-838\" and \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\". Also maybe other documents contain other case numbers. We have Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree unvisited. These might contain other case numbers. We need to search for case numbers across all documents. The search regex pattern used earlier might have missed other patterns. We need to search for \"Case No\" patterns across all documents. But we already have matches in 3 docs. But there might be other pattern like \"Case No. 24-CV-838\" etc. Let's search all documents for \"Case No\" pattern again. Use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\". But we already did. It found 3 matches. But maybe other documents have different patterns, e.g., \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" is same. But maybe other documents have \"Case No. 2:24-cv-119\" etc. We should re-search all documents for \"Case No\" pattern. But we only need to extract all distinct values of the checklist item found in any document. We have 3 matches but they all same case number 24-cv-838. But maybe the Complaint or Consent Decree may have other case numbers like \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" (the same). But if they are same, we only need one entry? But we need all distinct values. The same case number repeated is not distinct. So we only need one entry: \"24-cv-838\". But we must check if there are any other case numbers in other documents. The Consent Decree might reference the same case number. The Complaint might reference same case number. Docket may reference. But likely no other case numbers. But we should confirm by searching. Let's search all documents again for \"Case No.\" pattern. But the previous search only gave 3 matches. It might have missed due to pattern differences. But we can search broader pattern: something like \"Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?\\s*([\\w\\-:]+)\". That was used. It returned 3 matches across 3 docs. So likely no other case numbers. But to be thorough, we could search for \"Case\\s+No\" across all. But the earlier search already did. We can trust that. So the only case number is \"24-cv-838\". But there is also \"1:24-cv-838\" in Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. That is the same case but with a docket number prefix \"1:\"? Actually \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" indicates docket number 1. But the case code is the same \"24-cv-838\". So we likely treat as same case. But the checklist expects the case code number. So we should extract \"24-cv-838\" only. But we might need to include evidence showing the case number. We have evidence from the matches: we have the snippet with \"Case No.  24-cv-838\". We can extract that as evidence. We should also include the snippet from Notice of Voluntary Dismissal: \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\". That shows the same underlying case code \"24-cv-838\". But we need to decide whether to include both as separate values? The checklist says \"Any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes.\" So if the same case number appears multiple times, we only need one unique value. So we will produce one entry with value \"24-cv-838\" and evidence from one or both documents. Provide evidence for the value: include text snippet and location. We can provide evidence from the Joint Motion match snippet, or Notice. We'll include both maybe. But we can include multiple evidence entries. The evidence array can have multiple evidence items. So we can include both.\n\nThus we need to append to checklist key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" with one entry value \"24-cv-838\" and evidence array with two items. Provide location: token range or page? For the snippet from Joint Motion: tokens 0-130. For Notice: tokens 0-135. Provide location: maybe \"tokens 0-130\" etc. Provide source_document names.\n\nSo next action: append_checklist.\n\nWe should call append_checklist with patch: key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", extracted array: one object with value \"24-cv-838\" and evidence array containing two evidence objects.\n\nLet's prepare JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"24-cv-838\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case No.  24-cv-838\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-130\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-135\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number", "extracted": [{"value": "24-cv-838", "evidence": [{"text": "Case No.  24-cv-838", "source_document": "Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree", "location": "tokens 0-130"}, {"text": "Case No. 1:24-cv-838", "source_document": "Notice of Voluntary Dismissal", "location": "tokens 0-135"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3303, "completion_tokens": 1195, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Should we include both? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct values: 24-cv-838 and 1:24-cv-838 are distinct strings. But it's same case? The spec says distinct values. So we should include both. But we already have 24-cv-838 from earlier. But we didn't include 1:24-cv-838. So we need to append that.\n\nBut check if there are other related cases in other documents. We should review Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree.\n\nWe should search for case numbers in those documents. Likely the Complaint will have \"Case No. 24-cv-838\". Docket may have docket entries with case numbers. Consent Decree may mention \"Case No. 24-cv-838\". But the requirement is related cases listed by case code number. If the same case appears multiple times, maybe we only need distinct values. But we must ensure if there are other case numbers referencing other cases?

But we already did Step 2 and found 3 matches only in the 3 documents. But in other documents maybe more matches. The search might have been limited to first 3 documents. But we should search again in all documents. Let's use search_document_regex on all documents for that pattern. That will likely find matches in Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern same.\n\nWe might have to specify flags: [\"IGNORECASE\", \"MULTILINE\"] maybe. The pattern we used earlier: \"(?i)(Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?)\\s*(\\S+)\". That includes IGNORECASE already. So we can use same pattern.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n  \"pattern\": \"(?i)(Case\\\\s+No\\\\.?\\\\s*[:\\\\-]?)\\\\s*(\\\\S+)\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\", \"MULTILINE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 20,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)(Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?)\\s*(\\S+)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE", "MULTILINE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3481, "completion_tokens": 581, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have 6 documents. We have already extracted 24-cv-838 from Joint Motion, Notice, Order. But we need \"every distinct value\" of this checklist item found in any document. So we should scan all documents for related case numbers. We have not yet examined Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree. Likely there might be other case numbers in those documents. Also maybe the Docket might list related cases. Also Complaint might have case numbers like same or different. Need to search all documents for pattern again. Already did search across all documents and found 3 matches, all same pattern. But maybe this search pattern missed some because of formatting variations. For example \"Case No.: 24-cv-838\" with colon, or \"Case No 24-cv-838\". The regex used (?i)(Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?)\\s*(\\S+) matches \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" and \"Case No.:24-cv-838\". It likely captured all. But maybe the Complaint or Docket may have other case numbers like \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" etc. The Notice already had \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" which includes the \"1:\" prefix. That might be a variant of docket numbering (e.g., 1:24-cv-838). Our extraction might need to include that as a distinct value? The requirement: \"Any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes.\" So if there is \"1:24-cv-838\", we should extract that too. But we already extracted 24-cv-838 from Joint Motion etc. In Notice we extracted \"1:24-cv-838\". That is distinct. But the extraction currently shows only \"24-cv-838\" as the value. Wait: step 3 appended 1 key: Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number with value 1: \"24-cv-838\". They didn't include \"1:24-cv-838\". They maybe considered that the same? The Evidence shows \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" but they extracted \"24-cv-838\". So they omitted the leading \"1:\". That might be inaccurate. Need to correct.\n\nWe should update the checklist to include both values: \"24-cv-838\" and \"1:24-cv-838\". Actually the values should be distinct. \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" indicates docket number 1:24-cv-838 (the 1: indicates docket entry). The case number is 24-cv-838. So maybe we only need the case number; but the requirement says \"All distinct values of this checklist item found in any document.\" So maybe we should capture the case number part. For Notice, \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" might still indicate the same case number 24-cv-838. So no new value. But the evidence extracted earlier has \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" but they extracted value \"24-cv-838\". So consistent.\n\nBut maybe there are other case numbers such as \"Case No. 1:23-cv-123\" etc. Let's search again. But the earlier search found only 3 matches. But maybe the Complaint might have \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" as well. Search again. But the earlier search used \"Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?\\s*(\\S+)\" which would match. So maybe the Complaint didn't contain that phrase. But could have \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" still. But if not found, maybe no other. The Docket might contain docket entries with other related case numbers. But the search might miss if the phrase is \"Case No 24-cv-838\" without dot. Pattern includes optional dot. So likely captured.\n\nBut the requirement states \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to confirm that we captured all. We have only \"24-cv-838\" as distinct value. But maybe the Consent Decree is longer and contains other content referencing \"Case No. 24-cv-838\". Let's check. But we haven't read Consent Decree (19,742 tokens). We can search there. The earlier search across all documents likely scanned all documents for the regex and found 3 matches. So Consent Decree probably didn't contain that phrase. But maybe contains \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" but the search didn't find maybe due to token limitations? The search_document_regex returns top_k matches per document with context. It scanned all documents. It found 3 matches. Consent Decree not listed. So no match. So likely no case number in Consent Decree.\n\nThus we might have only one distinct value: \"24-cv-838\". But we need to confirm if any other case numbers appear in documents like \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" but that's same case number. So we are done.\n\nBut we might need to update checklist to reflect that we extracted \"24-cv-838\". But step 3 appended one key with value 1: \"24-cv-838\". So the extracted list has 1 value. But we need to ensure that we include \"1:24-cv-838\" as evidence? The evidence shows the text \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\". But we extracted only \"24-cv-838\". That's okay; we extracted the case number. But the evidence still shows the full phrase. It's fine.\n\nBut we might need to confirm that no other case numbers exist. Let's search for \"Case No\" again specifically in Complaint and Docket. But we can use search_document_regex again for pattern \"Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?\\s*(\\S+)\" across \"Complaint\" and \"Docket\". But earlier search gave 3 matches total. But maybe the search didn't return all due to top_k? It returns top_k matches per document, default 5. So if there were more, they'd be returned. But we could search again but only for Complaint and Docket to confirm.\n\nWe should call search_document_regex for Complaint and Docket separately? Could use doc_names array. Let's do that.\n\nWe also need to check for other formats like \"Case No 24-cv-838\" with no dot; pattern includes optional dot. Good.\n\nOk next action: search_document_regex for Complaint and Docket.\n\nBut note: we must choose exactly one action. We should do search_document_regex. But we might only need to search Complaint and Docket. We can pass doc_names [\"Complaint\", \"Docket\"]. That will return matches for those documents. Then we can parse results.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex with doc_names [\"Complaint\", \"Docket\"], pattern: same regex, flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k: 20, context_tokens: 200. Then after receiving results we will analyze. But we need to proceed step by step. So we issue search_document_regex.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Complaint\",\"Docket\"],\"pattern\":\"(?i)(Case\\\\s+No\\\\.?\\\\s*[:\\\\-]?)\\\\s*(\\\\S+)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Complaint", "Docket"], "pattern": "(?i)(Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?)\\s*(\\S+)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4041, "completion_tokens": 1582, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But there might be other case numbers elsewhere, maybe with different format. But requirement is \"Any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes.\" The documents: Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree might have other case numbers. Should search. Since we have partially visited parts of 3 documents but not entire. We might need to search for \"Case No.\" patterns across all documents.

But we can search.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Docket and Complaint.\n\nBut we can search across all documents again but we already did and found 3 matches.

But likely not.\n\nGiven the tasks, we should confirm if any other matches exist.\n\nLet's search Docket: use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Docket\". Also Complaint.\n\nWe need to provide evidence and then update checklist accordingly.\n\nBut we already have 1 value extracted: 24-cv-838. But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct values: maybe there is \"1:24-cv-838\" or \"24-cv-838\" but they are same? The code \"1:24-cv-838\" includes a prefix 1: maybe docket number? But likely the case code is 24-cv-838. But maybe they want both? The earlier extraction had both \"24-cv-838\" and \"1:24-cv-838\". The appended entries had value 24-cv-838 only. Did we include the second? In Step 3 they appended 1 value: 24-cv-838. But evidence had Case No. 1:24-cv-838. But they used value \"24-cv-838\" ignoring the leading \"1:\". So maybe we need to extract \"24-cv-838\" only.

The pattern used earlier may have captured all. But we should double-check. Let's search for \"Case No\" across all documents again. But we need to provide evidence for each. We have evidence for 24-cv-838 from Joint Motion and from Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. But we might need to include evidence from all sources that contain the same value. The requirement: \"Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So each unique value: 24-cv-838. We have two sources. But we should have evidence for each. We already appended evidence from two docs. But we might need to include evidence from all docs that mention it. We have evidence from Joint Motion and Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. That's okay.\n\nBut we also need to check if there are other case numbers. Maybe the Consent Decree has a case number. Let's search the Consent Decree for \"Case No.\" pattern. Use search_document_regex on Consent Decree. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Consent Decree\",\"doc_names\":null,\"pattern\":\"(?i)(Case\\\\s+No\\\\.?\\\\s*[:\\\\-]?)\\\\s*(\\\\S+)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Consent Decree", "doc_names": null, "pattern": "(?i)(Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?)\\s*(\\S+)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4156, "completion_tokens": 976, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Currently we have only 24-cv-838. But maybe other documents contain other case numbers. We need to search all documents for case numbers. We already searched all for pattern \"Case No.\" and found 3 matches: all with 24-cv-838. But maybe other documents have different case numbers not captured by that regex? For example, docket might have \"Case No. 1:23-cv-123\". But we didn't find matches. But other documents may have \"Case No.\" with different case numbers. We can search again with a more general pattern or search for \"Case Number\" etc? But likely the only case number is 24-cv-838. But the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we must confirm there are no other distinct values. The search found 3 matches all same. But we need to be sure: maybe the docket contains case numbers like \"Case No. 1:23-cv-123\" but our pattern didn't catch because of colon after 1? Actually pattern: \"(?i)(Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?)\\s*(\\S+)\" will match \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\". The captured group would be \"1:24-cv-838\". But we extracted \"24-cv-838\". In step 3 we appended 24-cv-838 from both. So maybe there are other case numbers in docket or complaint. We should search on Complaint and Docket again.\n\nWe did step 5 search on [Complaint, Docket] but found 0 matches. But maybe other pattern like \"Case No.\" preceded by \"Case No. 1:\" etc. But we used pattern with optional colon after case no. It should catch. But maybe the docket uses \"Case No. 1: 24-cv-838\" with space after colon. Our pattern allows optional colon after \"No.\" and whitespace then capture \\S+. That would match \"1:24-cv-838\" maybe. But we didn't find matches. So likely only 24-cv-838.\n\nHowever, maybe other documents have \"Case No. 1: 24-cv-838\" with space after colon. Pattern would match \"24-cv-838\"? Actually pattern: (Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?)\\s*(\\S+). Suppose the text: \"Case No. 1: 24-cv-838\". The regex would match \"Case No.\" then optional colon: there is none after No. because \"No.\" then space then \"1:\"? Wait \"Case No. 1: 24-cv-838\". After \"Case No.\" there is a space, then \"1:\" then space, then \"24-cv-838\". pattern: \"Case No.\" matches; \\s* matches space; optional [: -]? may match colon? There is \"1:\" so colon after 1. But optional colon is directly after \"No.\" not after \"1\". So pattern fails? Actually pattern: \"Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?\" means after \"No.\" there may be whitespace and then optional colon or hyphen. But there's \"1:\" so pattern would match \"Case No.\" then space then optional colon? It would not match because there's \"1:\" not just colon. So pattern fails. So our search didn't match that style. So we may have missed case numbers with \"Case No. 1: 24-cv-838\". But step 3 extracted \"24-cv-838\" from Notice of Voluntary Dismissal: \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\". That had no space between colon and number. So pattern matched capturing \"1:24-cv-838\"? But they extracted \"24-cv-838\". So they may have trimmed. But maybe there are other case numbers with \"Case No. 1: 14-cv-123\" etc. So we need to search again with a pattern that captures numbers after \"Case No.\" optionally preceded by \"1:\".\n\nWe can search again on all documents using pattern: \"(?i)(Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?\\s*(?:\\d+:)?\\s*(\\S+))\". But we need to capture the code. Alternatively we can search for \"Case No.\" and then extract manually. But we need to provide evidence for each case.\n\nWe can analyze the documents quickly by reading them partially. We have 6 documents. Already partially visited 3. The others unvisited: Complaint (3166 tokens), Docket (2962 tokens), Consent Decree (19742 tokens). We might need to read them to see if other case numbers appear. But maybe only 24-cv-838 appears. But we need to confirm.\n\nWe could search again on all documents with pattern that picks up \"Case No.\" followed by optional \"1:\" before code. Eg pattern: \"(?i)(Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*(?:\\d+:)?\\s*(\\S+))\". That would match \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" capturing 24-cv-838. Let's do that.\n\nWe'll use search_document_regex on all docs. That may produce matches. Provide context tokens.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)(Case\\\\s+No\\\\.?\\\\s*(?:\\\\d+:)?\\\\s*(\\\\S+))\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\",\"MULTILINE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)(Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*(?:\\d+:)?\\s*(\\S+))", "flags": ["IGNORECASE", "MULTILINE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3725, "completion_tokens": 1198, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We already found 24-cv-838 and 1:24-cv-838. But maybe other documents have different case numbers. We need to search remaining unvisited documents: Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree. The regex pattern used previously may have missed some. We should search all documents again with pattern capturing \"Case No.\" maybe with colon and number. But we should search for case numbers in the remaining unvisited docs. Use search_document_regex on all documents? But the catalog shows partially visited some. We want to find other case numbers. Use search_document_regex on all documents, maybe pattern: \"(?i)Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?\\s*([0-9]+:[0-9]+-[a-z]+-[0-9]+|[0-9]+-[a-z]+-[0-9]+)\" But simpler: use pattern \"(?i)Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?\\s*(\\S+)\" again. We already did that and only found 3 matches across 6 docs. Those 3 matches correspond to the ones we already captured. But maybe the other documents have different case numbers but not following that pattern? Let's think: In Complaint, there might be \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" again. But it's maybe repeated. But the search didn't find matches in Complaint. That suggests maybe the Complaint doesn't have \"Case No.\" phrase. But could have \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" but we didn't search. Wait we did search all docs. It didn't find any matches in Complaint and Docket and Consent Decree. Means there may be no \"Case No.\" string in those. But still possible that there are other related case numbers like \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" captured. But maybe other related cases like \"Case No. 14-cv-1234\"? But not present.\n\nWe might need to search for \"Case No.\" pattern again to confirm. But we already did. Could there be multiple case numbers in a single document? For example, the Complaint might list other related cases. But not captured. Let's search again with pattern capturing \"Case No.  \" with double space maybe. But we used pattern with \\S+ which includes digits and hyphens. So should match.\n\nMaybe some documents have \"Case No.\" with a space after colon? But pattern covers that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the related cases are referenced elsewhere, like \"See also Case No. 12-cv-3456\" etc. But the regex pattern may not capture because it's not \"Case No.\" but \"Case No:\"? We used optional colon. Should capture.\n\nMaybe the other documents have \"Case No.  24-cv-838\" with double spaces. That still matches.\n\nBut maybe the documents have \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" but we didn't search on all docs? We did search #8 on all docs and found 3 matches. So no other.\n\nThus we have extracted both case numbers: 24-cv-838 and 1:24-cv-838. Are they considered distinct? Yes, they are distinct values. But are they duplicates? They represent same case but with different formatting. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we should include both unique values. We already appended 1 value earlier (the system said appended 1 value for 1 key: Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number). Which one was appended? It likely appended \"24-cv-838\" or \"1:24-cv-838\". We need to check: step 3 appended 1 value. Which value? Not specified. But we saw in step 4 matches: they found 3 matches: one with 24-cv-838, one with 1:24-cv-838, and another 24-cv-838. So there are two distinct values: 24-cv-838, 1:24-cv-838. The appended one likely was \"24-cv-838\". So we need to append the missing \"1:24-cv-838\" as well.\n\nWe need to provide evidence for it. We have evidence from the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal match: \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\". That is in the snippet. So we need to append that value.\n\nThus action: append_checklist with patch to key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" with a new extracted entry for value \"1:24-cv-838\" with evidence snippet, source document \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\", location tokens 0-135 or maybe page. Use location \"tokens 0-135\" or \"page 1\" but tokens fine.\n\nThus we do append_checklist.\n\nReturn that function call.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"1:24-cv-838\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-135\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number", "extracted": [{"value": "1:24-cv-838", "evidence": [{"text": "Case No. 1:24-cv-838", "source_document": "Notice of Voluntary Dismissal", "location": "tokens 0-135"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4184, "completion_tokens": 1157, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Already found 1:24-cv-838. There could be other case numbers like 24-cv-838, 1:24-cv-838, maybe 24-cv-1234 etc. Let's search for \"Case No.\" pattern again but maybe we missed. Already did search on all documents and found 3 matches: those three. But maybe other documents have different format: \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" appears in Joint Motion; but we already have that. In Notice, we have \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\". In Order, \"Case No. 24-cv-838\". So we have two distinct values: \"24-cv-838\" and \"1:24-cv-838\". Wait we appended earlier two values: one from Joint Motion (24-cv-838) and one from Notice (1:24-cv-838). But maybe there are more like \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" appears both in Joint Motion and Order. But we only need distinct values; we already extracted two. But we might have missed \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" in Order but that's duplicate. So we have two distinct case codes: \"24-cv-838\" and \"1:24-cv-838\". But check if any other document contains case numbers like \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" or maybe \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" is same as 24-cv-838. Already captured. Could there be \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" and \"Case No. 24-cv-838\". We have both. Are there any other case numbers in Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree? We need to search.\n\nWe might need to search for pattern \"Case No\" again but maybe it didn't find in Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree. But maybe there is \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" in those documents but not captured due to earlier search maybe not scanning entire doc because we limited to 200 tokens context? But search_document_regex returns matches limited to top_k per doc. We didn't specify top_k in earlier calls except default 5. But if there are multiple matches, it would return up to 5. In Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree, maybe there are no \"Case No.\" strings. But we should double-check. Let's search again in all documents but maybe with a broader pattern that also catches \"Case No.\" without colon? We already used pattern \"(?i)(Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*(?:\\d+:)?\\s*(\\S+))\" which should capture both. But we can refine to include \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" exactly. But we want to confirm no other case numbers appear.\n\nWe can search for \"Case No.\" in all documents again with default. Or we can read each unvisited document - Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree. But reading all may be large (Consent Decree 19,742 tokens). But we can search for pattern in all documents. Let's call search_document_regex again with pattern \"Case No\" maybe we capture all.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"(?i)(Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*(?:\\d+:)?\\s*[\\d-]+)\" to catch numeric only. I'd like to see if any other matches appear. But we already did with pattern that captured digits and hyphens. That found only 3 matches. So likely no more. But we should confirm that search didn't miss because of token range? It returns matches from each document. It might have missed if the match is beyond token limit? It should search entire doc. But we didn't specify context_tokens. But default 200. So it should find matches anywhere. So likely no other case numbers.\n\nThus we have all. We need to ensure we have appended both values. We appended earlier two values? Step 5 appended 1 value for 1 key: Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number. Wait step 5 is after step 4: step 5 search on Complaint, Docket found 0. Step 6 search on Docket found 0. Step 7 search on Consent Decree found 0. Step 8 search on all found 3 matches: one each in Joint Motion, Notice, Order. Step 9 append checklist: \"Successfully appended 1 key: Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" with extracted Value 1: \"1:24-cv-838\". But earlier step 3 appended 1 value from Joint Motion? Wait step 3 appended 1 value for 1 key: Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number. That likely was from Joint Motion. So we have two values: \"24-cv-838\" (from Joint Motion) and \"1:24-cv-838\" (from Notice). But we might have not appended the value from Order because it's duplicate. So we have all distinct values: \"24-cv-838\" and \"1:24-cv-838\". So extraction complete.\n\nBut still we need to confirm if we extracted \"24-cv-838\" from Joint Motion. Step 3 says appended 1 value for 1 key. It didn't specify the value. But earlier step 3 likely appended \"24-cv-838\". So we have two values.\n\nThus all checklist keys filled. So we should stop. But we need to ensure that the checklist state shows that the key has 2 values. The current status says: \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number: 2 values (1 from Joint Motion..., 2 from Notice...)\". So yes.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut the instructions: \"Stop when every key is either complete or Not Applicable.\" There's only one key. It has 2 values extracted with evidence.

But maybe there are more case numbers in other documents: Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree. We should search for other case numbers. The pattern used earlier: \"Case No.  24-cv-838\" etc. The prior search found matches only in those three documents. However, maybe the Complaint or Docket might have a different case number or multiple. The Checklist item: Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number: any related matters identified by case numbers/codes. So we need to extract all distinct values across all documents.\n\nWe have already extracted two, but we might not have seen all documents fully. In the \"Available Documents\" list, we have 6 documents: Order, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Joint Motion, Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree. We have partially visited Order, Notice, Joint Motion. The other three are unvisited. The earlier search didn't find matches in Complaint and Docket due to pattern. Maybe there could be case numbers in those, but maybe not.\n\nBut maybe the Consent Decree contains a reference to other case numbers, e.g., \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" etc.\n\nTo be thorough, we should search all documents again for case numbers. The prior search was pattern \"(?i)(Case\\\\s+No\\\\.?:?\\\\s*(\\\\S+))\" but it found only 3 matches. Could there be case numbers in other docs but not captured by this pattern? Let's inspect the Complaint for any \"Case No.\" pattern. But we haven't read Complaint. So we should search for case numbers across all documents again. But we already did search on all docs that found 3 matches. But maybe the other documents have other case numbers but not matched due to formatting differences. For example \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" vs \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" matches. But maybe \"Case No 24-cv-838\" without period. Our regex uses optional period. Should catch both.\n\nHowever, the Consent Decree is huge (19k tokens). It might reference the same case number, but we already have it. But maybe there are other related case numbers like \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" we already captured.\n\nBut the checklist expects all distinct values of this item found in any document. We have found 2 distinct values: \"24-cv-838\" (maybe from Joint Motion) and \"1:24-cv-838\" (from Notice). But maybe there is also \"24-cv-838\" with a \"Case No.  24-cv-838\" repeated. Already captured. But we might need to confirm that there are no others.\n\nTo be safe, we could search for \"Case No.\" across all documents again and read the context. But the earlier search didn't find any in Complaint or Docket. But maybe the pattern didn't catch \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" because the regex captured the number but we may have missed the colon in the number. The pattern used earlier: \"(?i)(Case\\\\s+No\\\\.?:?\\\\s*(\\\\S+))\". That should capture \"1:24-cv-838\". Yes.\n\nMaybe the Complaint has a different case number like \"Case No. 1:24-cv-839\" or something. So we should search again.\n\nWe can perform search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(?i)(Case\\\\s+No\\\\.?:?\\\\s*(\\\\S+))\". But we already did that (Step 8). It found 3 matches. So it's likely no others.\n\nBut maybe the Consent Decree references the case number but not with \"Case No.\" but some other format like \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" or \"Case No.: 24-cv-838\". But we used optional colon after \"No.\" and before the number; we might miss \"Case No.: 24-cv-838\". But that's rare.\n\nBetter to search for \"Case No\" without period: \"Case No\" pattern. Let's search for \"Case No\" pattern. The regex pattern could be \"(?i)Case\\\\s+No\\\\s*[:\\\\-]?\\\\s*(\\\\S+)\". But we don't need to capture group, just match.\n\nLet's call search_document_regex on all docs with pattern \"(?i)Case\\\\s+No\\\\s*[:\\\\-]?\\\\s*(\\\\S+)\". That may catch \"Case No 24-cv-838\" etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can just read the Complaint and Docket fully to confirm. But reading 3k tokens each might be okay if we read in chunks: we only need to find case numbers. Could be easier to search.\n\nGiven we want to be thorough, let's do search_document_regex across all documents with pattern \"Case\\\\s+No\\\\s*[:\\\\-]?\\\\s*\\\\S+\". That will find all occurrences. Then we can extract from the context. Let's do that.\n\nWe must choose one action. Let's choose search_document_regex on all docs with pattern \"(?i)Case\\\\s+No\\\\s*[:\\\\-]?\\\\s*\\\\S+\".\n\nWe'll set top_k maybe 20. context_tokens 200. That gives us matches. Let's do that.\n\nAfter that, we can parse the matches to see if any new case numbers appear. If yes, we will append new entries.\n\nThus, next action: search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)Case\\\\s+No\\\\s*[:\\\\-]?\\\\s*\\\\S+\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)Case\\s+No\\s*[:\\-]?\\s*\\S+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3991, "completion_tokens": 1264, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Let's search for \"Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[\\:\\-]?\\s*\\S+\" on all docs again. Already found. But maybe the Complaint contains \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" but with different punctuation. But likely we captured all. But maybe the Complaint contains \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" but with a different spacing like \"Case No 1:24-cv-838\". Already pattern covers optional colon. But maybe the docket has \"Case No. 1:24-cv-838\" somewhere else. But we have found 3 matches total. That includes all documents? It searched all documents and found 3 matches. So likely only those 3. But we still have two distinct values. But Step 9 indicates 2 values extracted: \"1:24-cv-838\" and also earlier Step 3 appended 1 value for 1 key: maybe \"24-cv-838\"? Actually Step 3 appended 1 value for 1 key (maybe \"24-cv-838\") from Joint Motion. Step 9 appended \"1:24-cv-838\" from Notice. So we have 2 values. So the checklist has 2 values. Are there any other case codes? Might be \"24-cv-838\" and \"1:24-cv-838\". That seems complete. But we should verify if there is any case number like \"2:24-cv-838\" etc. Search for pattern \"Case No. 2:\"? But no. But maybe the Complaint includes \"Case No. 2:24-cv-838\" but not found. But the search results included only 3 matches. So likely only those. The Consent Decree might include \"Case No. 24-cv-838\" again. But we already have that. So we likely have all distinct values. The checklist currently shows 2 values. Are there duplicates? We have \"24-cv-838\" appears twice but we only have one entry. But the checklist has 2 values: \"24-cv-838\" and \"1:24-cv-838\". So we have 2 distinct. Are there any others? Might be \"24-cv-839\"? But not found. To be safe, we should search the Complaint and Docket for case numbers. Use search_document_regex on \"Complaint\" and \"Docket\" with pattern \"(?i)Case\\s+No\\.?\\s*[:\\-]?\\s*\\S+\" again maybe missing due to token limit? But we can search all docs again. Already did, and got only 3 matches. So I think it's complete.\n\nThus we should stop. But the current status shows \"Keys with Extracted Values (1): Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number: 2 values (1 from Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree, 2 from Notice of Voluntary Dismissal)\". That indicates they think 2 values. So we are done. We should stop.\n\nBut the instruction: \"Stop when every key is complete or Not Applicable, or no further progress is possible.\" We have 1 key complete (2 values). There are no empty keys. So we should stop.\n\nReturn JSON with decision: stop, reason: \"All distinct case code numbers extracted\".\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All distinct case code numbers extracted\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct case code numbers extracted", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4427, "completion_tokens": 1077, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
