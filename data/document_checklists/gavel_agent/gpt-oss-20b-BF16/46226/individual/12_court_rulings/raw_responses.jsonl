We have 6 documents. Likely the Consent Decree may have rulings, Order document, Docket, etc. We need to search for key phrases that indicate rulings: \"granted\", \"denied\", \"ordered\", \"issued\", \"declared\", \"certified\", etc. The most efficient: search_document_regex across all docs for patterns like \"(granted|denied|ordered|issued|declared|certified)\". But we need to capture context. Maybe search for \"granted\" or \"denied\" with preceding words. Might be many matches. We can use regex: \"(?i)(granted|denied|ordered|issued|declared|certified) (.*?)[.]\" but better to search for \"granted\" and \"denied\" in context. But we need to ensure we capture rulings; the order document likely has \"The court granted the motion\" etc.\n\nWe can search across all documents for \"granted\" or \"denied\" with preceding context. Use pattern: \"(granted|denied) (.*?)(?=\\\\.|$)\". But we must ensure we get context. Provide context tokens.\n\nWe can search for \"granted\" and \"denied\". Let's search for \"granted\" first. Use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern=\"granted\", flags=[\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k maybe 10, context_tokens 200. Then parse. And also search for \"denied\". But maybe multiple. Another approach: read the Order document (365 tokens) to see if it contains rulings. That might be the main decisions. Let's read Order. Use read_document on Order doc from 0 to 365 tokens. Likely contains rulings.

We have Order document fully read; it contains a ruling: \"ORDERED that the Motion is GRANTED, and the Consent Decree is PROVISIONALLY ENTERED\". That is a ruling. Also \"ORDERED that all case management deadlines are stayed pending the Court’s determination\". Also \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing on the Terms of the Consent Decree is scheduled to be held on ________\".\n\nBut the rule is about granting the motion. Also docket shows orders granting motion to stay, etc.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values of Court_Rulings. We need to read more documents to find other rulings. Search for \"ORDER\" etc but we already have many matches. But we need to read the other documents for more rulings.\n\nWe could search for patterns \"granted\" \"denied\" \"issued\" \"preliminary injunction\" etc. We already did search and got many matches but they are mostly text snippets unrelated to rulings; but the order doc may have more. We should read the rest of the Order document beyond tokens 0-365? It is fully visited but maybe there is more beyond 365? Wait Order doc has only 365 tokens; we saw the entire content? The snippet shows page 1 of 2, but we only read 0-365 tokens which might be entire Order; but maybe there are two pages? But token count 365 indicates entire doc. So we got all rulings from Order.\n\nNow need to read other documents: Docket, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Complaint, Consent Decree, Joint Motion.\n\nWe can search in Docket for rulings. Docket contains many orders: e.g., \"ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED\" etc. We saw matches at tokens 1055-1255 and 1199-1399. We need to read those token ranges to capture evidence.\n\nAlso Docket has many orders; maybe we need to read all orders for rulings. We can search again for \"ORDER\" pattern but we already have many matches. Let's search within Docket for \"ORDER\" maybe capture all orders. But we have tokens 1055-1399 which likely include orders. Let's read that range fully to capture multiple rulings.\n\nAlso Docket has match 1639-1839: order granting motion 14. So we should read that range.\n\nAlso maybe 1738-1938 etc. But those are duplicates of same. It's okay.\n\nAlso Docket has match 1782-1982 duplicates.\n\nSo I think we need to read Docket token ranges 1055-1399, 1639-1839, maybe 1782-1982 duplicates.\n\nAlso Docket has match 1055-1255 earlier maybe includes \"ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED\". That we should capture.\n\nAlso Docket has match 1199-1399 includes similar. So we need to read both to capture distinct rulings.\n\nAlso we need to read Consent Decree for rulings: maybe there are orders about provisional entry etc. But we saw only the Consent Decree has the order? Let's search in Consent Decree for \"ORDER\" pattern again but we already saw many matches but not all. The Consent Decree seems to be a decree itself; but maybe it contains orders for fairness hearing etc. But we need to read those. We can search for \"ORDER\" pattern in Consent Decree again but maybe we need to read those ranges.\n\nHowever, the pattern search already returned 27 matches across all documents, but it listed only 10 from Consent Decree. There might be more in Consent Decree not captured? But we have 10 matches for Consent Decree. We can read each token range individually, but that's many. But maybe we don't need all, because the rulings are in the Order documents and Docket.\n\nBut also the Consent Decree may have the ruling that the consent decree was provisionally entered. That might be part of the Order. But \"Consent Decree\" doc might not contain the order; it's the decree itself. But maybe it contains the \"Notice of Entry\" etc. But not necessary.\n\nAlso we have Joint Motion doc which may have some orders? But likely no. But maybe the motion doc includes the filing but not orders.\n\nAlso Notice of Voluntary Dismissal may have orders? Probably not.\n\nSo main rulings likely in Order and Docket.\n\nThus we need to read Docket token ranges to capture all orders.\n\nWe also need to read the Order doc for the ruling. We already have that.\n\nNow we need to extract distinct rulings. Let's list them:\n\nFrom Order: \n- \"The court granted the Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree, and provisionally entered the Consent Decree.\" This is one ruling. Also \"The court ordered the Fairness Hearing to be scheduled on ________\" but that is a scheduling order. Also \"The court ordered all case management deadlines to be stayed pending the Court’s determination.\" That's a ruling. So we have at least 3 rulings from Order.\n\nFrom Docket:\n- \"ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED and that all case management deadlines, including the United States' deadline to serve the Summons and Complaint on the City of Durham, are stayed pending the courts resolution of the Parties' Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree.\" That's a ruling.\n- \"ORDER signed by JUDGE THOMAS D. SCHROEDER on 01/15/2025, that the motion (Doc. 13) is GRANTED.\" That's a ruling. It's about word limit for briefing.\n- \"ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED in that American Alliance for Equal Rights is granted leave to file its brief as amicus curiae as a separate document forthwith.\" That's a ruling.\n\nAlso there might be other orders in Docket earlier: maybe \"ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED\" appears twice? But we only captured two distinct orders. Also maybe \"ORDER that the motion (Doc. 13) is GRANTED\" could be the same as above.\n\nAlso there might be other orders like \"ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED\" etc.\n\nWe should read token ranges 1055-1399 and 1639-1839 fully.\n\nAlso maybe other orders earlier in Docket not captured: tokens 318-518, 546-928, 1055-1255, 1199-1399, 1639-1839, 1782-1982. The ranges 1055-1255 and 1199-1399 likely overlap? They may contain same order. But let's read them to capture all.\n\nAlso maybe token 1055-1255 includes order granting 10 Motion to Stay. Token 1199-1399 also includes same order but maybe additional details.\n\nSo we should read both.\n\nAlso Docket has match 1055-1255 and 1199-1399; we might read both.\n\nThus plan: read_document for Docket 1055-1399 (maybe 1055-1399 includes both orders). But 1055-1255 plus 1199-1399 overlap partially? They maybe separate. We can read 1055-1399 to cover both. But we need to ensure we don't exceed 10k tokens; 1055-1399 is 344 tokens, fine.\n\nAlso read Docket 1639-1839, which is 200 tokens.\n\nNow also read Consent Decree maybe for other rulings but maybe not needed. But could contain order about provisional entry? But we might skip if not needed. But to be safe, we might search for \"ORDER\" in Consent Decree again but we already saw matches but they may not contain rulings. But we can search for \"ORDER\" pattern in Consent Decree to capture any orders. But we can read the entire Consent Decree maybe but that's 20k tokens, too large. But we can search for \"ORDER\" pattern again specifying doc_names=[\"Consent Decree\"] to get matches. But we already had 10 matches from Consent Decree. We can read those token ranges for context but they may not contain new rulings beyond those already captured. But we could skip.\n\nBut the question: \"Extract the court rulings from the legal documents.\" So we need to extract all distinct rulings.\n\nWe may need to include rulings from the Consent Decree? The Consent Decree is likely the document that states the terms; but maybe it includes the court order that the consent decree was provisionally entered. But that was in Order doc.\n\nThus we likely only need to extract from Order and Docket.\n\nAlso maybe Notice of Voluntary Dismissal includes an order of dismissal? The notice might contain the dismissal. That might be a ruling: \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" indicates the parties voluntarily dismissed. That could be a ruling that the case was dismissed. That is a ruling. So we should read Notice of Voluntary Dismissal token ranges 448-648, 957-1136. That is 200+ tokens. Let's read those to capture the dismissal.\n\nThe Notice of Voluntary Dismissal likely says \"The Court hereby dismisses the action\" etc.\n\nThus we need to read that doc.\n\nAlso maybe Complaint may contain ruling? Probably not.\n\nAlso Joint Motion doc may contain the motion but not orders.\n\nThus we will read:\n\n1. Docket 1055-1399\n2. Docket 1639-1839\n3. Notice of Voluntary Dismissal 448-648\n4. Notice of Voluntary Dismissal 957-1136\n\nAlso we already have Order doc fully visited but we don't have evidence for rulings extracted. We need to append those from Order.\n\nThus next action: read_document for Docket 1055-1399.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":1055,\"end_token\":1399}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 1055, "end_token": 1399}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8094, "completion_tokens": 2099, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have some evidence from Order: The Court ordered the motion granted, and consent decree provisionally entered. Also Docket has orders granting motions to stay. We need distinct values of Court_Rulings: each distinct ruling on a motion or issue. We should read more documents to capture all rulings. We have read Order and Docket partly. But the Consent Decree document likely contains many rulings. We need to search for \"ORDER\" \"granted\" \"denied\" etc. We have search results showing many matches in Consent Decree. We need to read those matches to extract rulings. We saw from Docket: \"ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED\" and \"ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED\" etc. Also \"ORDER that the motion 10 is GRANTED\"? Let's search in Consent Decree for specific motions. Maybe we need to read specific ranges around matches. We already have seen some matches but maybe need to read more tokens around matches to capture full order statements.\n\nGoal: list all distinct rulings. Let's inspect the Docket matches we have. We saw match 4 (tokens 1055-1255) includes \"ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED\". That is a ruling. Additional match 6 (tokens 1639-1839) includes \"ORDER signed by JUDGE THOMAS D. SCHROEDER on 01/15/2025, that the motion (Doc. 13 ) is GRANTED.\" So that's a ruling. And \"ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED\" within same. So two rulings there. Also match 5 had \"ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED\" again? Wait match 5 maybe duplicate. Let's review match 5 snippet: it repeated same sentence. So we have at least one ruling for motion to stay. Also a ruling for motion 13? That is motion to exceed word limit? Actually the text: \"Consent MOTION to Exceed Word Limitation by UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\" But the order says \"granted\" for motion 13? The snippet: \"ORDER signed by JUDGE THOMAS D. SCHROEDER on 01/15/2025, that the motion (Doc. 13 ) is GRANTED.\" So that's a ruling. Also \"ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED\" is another. So we have at least two distinct rulings: motion to stay, motion 13, motion 14. But we might have also ruling for provisional approval of consent decree (the Order we read). That's a ruling: \"ORDERED that the Motion is GRANTED\" (joint motion). Also maybe other rulings like \"Order granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED\" we already counted. Also in Consent Decree we might have other orders like \"ORDER that the motion to stay case management deadlines is GRANTED\" etc.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct rulings. To be safe, we should search Consent Decree for \"ORDER\" or \"granted\" etc. We already did search, found many matches. Let's read some of those match ranges to capture the rulings. We saw match 1-10 earlier. Those were from Consent Decree but many are about procedural details, not necessarily rulings. The search pattern might capture many context, but we need to see if any of those contain \"ORDER\". Many might not. But we can read the match ranges to confirm.\n\nWe also need to read the Order we already did: it contains one ruling. Also Docket we have read some orders. Let's read further Docket tokens 1639-1839 already. That had rulings. We might need to read more Docket tokens beyond 1839 to capture other orders. But we have covered 1055-1399 earlier. But maybe there are other orders in Docket after 1399. The Docket's total tokens 2962. We have partially visited up to 1982. We might need to read beyond 1982 to capture subsequent orders. Let's search Docket for \"ORDER\" again. But we can just read remaining tokens to capture. Let's read tokens 1982-2962. That is ~980 tokens. Let's do read_document for that range.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":1982,\"end_token\":2962}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 1982, "end_token": 2962}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8485, "completion_tokens": 928, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have read the Order, Docket, and some Consent Decree parts. We need to find all distinct rulings: e.g., from Order: \"ORDERED that the Motion is GRANTED, and the Consent Decree is PROVISIONALLY ENTERED\". Also \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing ... scheduled\" etc. Also Docket entries about orders: e.g., \"ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED\" (actually says \"granted\" but the text: \"ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED\" — that may be a typo but indicates a ruling). Also other orders: maybe \"ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED\". Also \"ORDER signed by MAG/JUDGE ... granting 26 Motion for L.R. 5.5 Report-Joint as approved\".\n\nAlso there may be more rulings in other documents we haven't read: Consent Decree has many matches but not all. But the search regex found 10 matches in Consent Decree but those are not rulings. The Docket has many orders. We should search for \"ORDER\" in Docket to capture all orders. Also search for \"GRANTED\" maybe not enough. But we can search for \"ORDER\" pattern. Let's do a search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"(?i)(ORDER|GRANTED|DENIED|CERTIFIED|ISSUED|PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION|TRO|CLASS CERTIFICATION)\". But we already did that search across all documents. It returned 27 matches across documents; we saw the Docket matches. We need to parse each match to capture rulings. The Docket matches included \"ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED\" and \"ORDER signed by JUDGE THOMAS D. SCHROEDER on 01/15/2025, that the motion (Doc. 13 ) is GRANTED.\" etc. Also \"ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED\". Also \"ORDER signed by MAG/JUDGE ... granting 26 Motion for L.R. 5.5 Report-Joint as approved as submitted.\"\n\nAlso there might be orders in Notice of Voluntary Dismissal? That likely is a dismissal, but not a ruling. The Complaint is unvisited but likely contains pleadings, not orders.\n\nWe should read the Docket again to capture all orders. The Docket read covered tokens 1055-1399 and 1639-2962. That covers all Docket entries except earlier tokens 318-518, 546-928 which we have. We have read all Docket entries. We need to extract all rulings from Docket. Let's parse each order:\n\nFrom 12 | 2024-12-20 | ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED and that all case management deadlines... So ruling: Motion to Stay (Motion 10) was granted. Who brought? The motion likely by United States? Text not specify. But we can note \"Motion to Stay was granted\".\n\nNext: 17 | 2025-01-15 | ORDER signed by JUDGE THOMAS D. SCHROEDER on 01/15/2025, that the motion (Doc. 13 ) is GRANTED. The motion 13 is the Motion to Exceed Word Limitation by United States. So ruling: Motion to Exceed Word Limitation was granted.\n\nThen: 18 | 2025-01-15 | ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED in that American Alliance for Equal Rights ... So ruling: Motion 14 was granted. Who? The motion likely by American Alliance? Not sure. We'll just state that Motion 14 was granted.\n\nAlso: 27 | 2025-01-30 | ORDER signed by MAG/JUDGE JOI ELIZABETH PEAKE on 01/30/2025, granting 26 Motion for L.R. 5.5 Report-Joint as approved as submitted. So ruling: Motion 26 was granted.\n\nAlso there may be an order about \"granted 10 Motion to Stay\" etc.\n\nAlso, from Order document, we have the provisional approval order: \"ORDERED that the Motion is GRANTED, and the Consent Decree is PROVISIONALLY ENTERED\". That's a ruling: Motion (Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree) was granted.\n\nAlso in Order we might have \"ORDERED that all case management deadlines are stayed pending the Court’s determination\". That is also an order: case management deadlines stayed. That's a ruling: case management deadlines stayed.\n\nAlso \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing on the Terms of the Consent Decree is scheduled to be held on ______, 2025\". That is a ruling: Fairness Hearing scheduled.\n\nAlso \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing ... is scheduled to be held on ______, 2025\". Also \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing ... is scheduled to be held on ______, 2025\". So those are rulings.\n\nAlso maybe \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing ... is scheduled to be held on ______, 2025\". The date is blank but we can capture that statement.\n\nAlso possible other orders: \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing ... is scheduled to be held on ______, 2025\". That's one.\n\nAlso the earlier docket entries: 12 | 2024-12-20 \"ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED\" is a ruling. Also \"ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED\". Also \"ORDER signed by MAG/JUDGE ... granting 26 Motion for L.R. 5.5 Report-Joint\".\n\nAlso \"ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED in that American Alliance for Equal Rights...\" but we might also have \"ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED\" but the preceding text might mention the motion 14 was granted. So we have four rulings from Docket.\n\nAlso there might be a ruling about \"Motion to Seal\" etc. But we saw \"21 | 2025-01-15 | MOTION to Seal\" but that's not an order.\n\nAlso \"27 | 2025-01-30 | ORDER signed by MAG/JUDGE ... granting 26 Motion for L.R. 5.5 Report-Joint as approved as submitted.\" That's a ruling.\n\nAlso maybe \"12 | 2024-12-20 | ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED and that all case management deadlines ...\". That's a ruling.\n\nAlso \"17 | 2025-01-15 | ORDER signed by JUDGE THOMAS D. SCHROEDER on 01/15/2025, that the motion (Doc. 13 ) is GRANTED.\" That's a ruling.\n\nAlso \"18 | 2025-01-15 | ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED\". That's a ruling.\n\nThus we have at least 5 rulings: 1 from Order, 4 from Docket. Also maybe \"ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED\" we counted. Also \"ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED\" might be the same as the previous.\n\nAlso the Order includes \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing on the Terms of the Consent Decree is scheduled to be held on ______, 2025\". That's a ruling.\n\nAlso the Order includes \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing ... is scheduled to be held on ______, 2025; and it is further ORDERED that all case management deadlines are stayed pending the Court’s determination\".\n\nAlso \"ORDERED that the Motion is GRANTED, and the Consent Decree is PROVISIONALLY ENTERED\". That's a ruling.\n\nThus we need to create entries for each distinct ruling. Should we combine? Each entry should be a separate value. So we can produce 6 values: 1 from Order (Joint Motion granted), 1 fair hearing scheduled, 1 case management deadlines stayed, 1 from Docket (Motion to Stay granted), 1 from Docket (Motion 13 granted), 1 from Docket (Motion 14 granted), 1 from Docket (Motion 26 granted). Wait that's 7. Actually we have 1 (Joint Motion) + 1 (Fair hearing scheduled) + 1 (Case management deadlines stayed) + 1 (Motion 10 granted) + 1 (Motion 13 granted) + 1 (Motion 14 granted) + 1 (Motion 26 granted). That's 7.\n\nBut check if the Order includes separate rulings: \"ORDERED that the Motion is GRANTED\" is one. \"ORDERED that the Consent Decree is PROVISIONALLY ENTERED\" maybe separate? But it's part of same order. But we can include them in same entry: \"Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree was granted and the Consent Decree provisionally entered.\" That covers both.\n\nAlso \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing on the Terms of the Consent Decree is scheduled to be held on ______, 2025.\" That's separate.\n\nAlso \"ORDERED that all case management deadlines are stayed pending the Court’s determination.\" That's separate.\n\nThus 3 from Order.\n\nFrom Docket: \"ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED\" (maybe redundant \"granted\" repeated). That's one.\n\nAlso \"ORDER signed by JUDGE THOMAS D. SCHROEDER on 01/15/2025, that the motion (Doc. 13 ) is GRANTED.\" That's one.\n\nAlso \"ORDER that the motion 14 is GRANTED\". That's one.\n\nAlso \"ORDER signed by MAG/JUDGE ... granting 26 Motion for L.R. 5.5 Report-Joint as approved as submitted.\" That's one.\n\nSo 4 from Docket. Total 7.\n\nNow we need to produce evidence for each: from which doc, location.\n\nWe have evidence for Order: tokens 0-365 we read. The specific lines: \"ORDERED that the Motion is GRANTED, and the Consent Decree is PROVISIONALLY ENTERED\" and \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing on the Terms of the Consent Decree is scheduled to be held on ______, 2025\" and \"ORDERED that all case management deadlines are stayed pending the Court’s determination\".\n\nWe need to cite the text snippet. For the Order, we can use the snippet from read_document. We'll include the snippet that includes those lines. For example: \"ORDERED that the Motion is GRANTED, and the Consent Decree is PROVISIONALLY ENTERED; ... ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing on the Terms of the Consent Decree is scheduled to be held on ______, 2025; ... ORDERED that all case management deadlines are stayed pending the Court’s determination...\"\n\nBut we need separate entries. So we can do three separate entries each with snippet referencing the Order.\n\nFor Docket entries, we need to capture each. We have the text from Docket read: lines like \"12 | 2024-12-20 | ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED and that all case management deadlines...\" This snippet. We'll use the snippet. Similarly for other entries.\n\nWe need to include location: maybe \"Page 1 of 2\" or token range. But we don't have page numbers for Docket. We can use \"token range 1055-1399\" for that order. But we should also include \"line numbers\" but we can just mention \"token range 1055-1399\" or \"entry 12 | 2024-12-20\".\n\nBetter to use \"location\" as the docket entry text. We'll put location string like \"Entry 12 | 2024-12-20\" etc.\n\nThus we will create a JSON with patch containing key \"Court_Rulings\" and extracted array of entries.\n\nWe need to have each entry with evidence array containing text, source_document, location.\n\nWe'll produce 7 entries.\n\nNow we must call append_checklist with patch.\n\nLet's construct patch.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Court_Rulings\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree was granted and the Consent Decree provisionally entered.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"ORDERED that the Motion is GRANTED, and the Consent Decree is PROVISIONALLY ENTERED\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Order\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-365\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Fairness Hearing on the Terms of the Consent Decree scheduled to be held on ______, 2025.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing on the Terms of the Consent Decree is scheduled to be held on ______, 2025\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Order\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-365\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"All case management deadlines stayed pending the Court’s determination.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"ORDERED that all case management deadlines are stayed pending the Court’s determination, at or after the Fairness Hearing on the Terms of the Consent Decree\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Order\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-365\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Motion to Stay (Motion 10) was granted.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"ORDER granting 10 Motion to Stay is GRANTED and that all case management deadlines, including the United States' deadline to serve the Summons and Complaint on the City of Durham, are stayed pending the courts resolution of the Parties' Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"Entry 12 | 2024-12-20\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Motion to Exceed Word Limitation (Motion 13) was granted.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"ORDER signed by JUDGE THOMAS D.

We need all distinct values of Court_Rulings across all documents. We have not yet fully read Consent Decree, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Joint Motion, Complaint. Are there more rulings? Likely in Order/Opinion (the Order already read). Docket has entries for various motions. We captured many. But may be other rulings in other documents. For instance, Court may have issued orders in Consent Decree document (maybe the Consent Decree itself contains orders). But we haven't read. Also the Complaint may have a ruling? Unlikely. Notice of Voluntary Dismissal may have a dismissal order. That's a ruling. Also there might be orders in the Consent Decree document (like the Consent Decree itself might have orders). Also the Joint Motion file may have a ruling? Not likely - it's a motion.\n\nWe need to ensure we capture all distinct court rulings. Let's search for \"ORDER\" pattern in all documents to see if there are more orders not captured. But we already did search_document_regex with pattern covering \"ORDERED|Granted|denied|certified|issued|preliminary injunction|TRO|class certification\". That returned 27 matches across 6 documents. They found many matches in Consent Decree and Docket. But we didn't read all matches. We only read some parts of Consent Decree and Docket. We need to read the rest of matches to capture more rulings. Also might be in Notice of Voluntary Dismissal: it likely contains an order to dismiss. We haven't read that part. So we need to read that. Also maybe in Consent Decree we saw agreements but not the actual order? The Consent Decree may include the court's order. But we haven't read it fully.\n\nGoal: capture all distinct court rulings. We need to browse all matches from the search. The search gave 27 total matches: 10 in Consent Decree, 9 in Docket, plus presumably others? The search result lists \"Remaining matches: 2 in Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, 5 in Order\". Wait, \"Order\" had 5 matches too? But we already fully read Order and captured 4 rulings? The search results also mention \"Remaining matches: 2 in Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, 5 in Order\". So we need to read Order for remaining matches? But we already read Order (0-365). Did we miss some matches in Order? The search pattern may have matched multiple times within Order. We saw 5 matches? We only read one segment 0-365 but maybe Order has more sections after 365? It has only 365 tokens though. So maybe the 5 matches are all within that 0-365 range. We already captured the rulings from those 5 matches? We captured 3 from Order. Let's verify: The Order had:\n\n- \"ORDERED that the Motion is GRANTED, and the Consent Decree is PROVISIONALLY ENTERED\" => ruling 1.\n- \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing on the Terms of the Consent Decree is scheduled to be held on ______, 2025.\" => ruling 2.\n- \"ORDERED that all case management deadlines are stayed pending the Court’s determination, at or after the Fairness Hearing on the Terms of the Consent Decree.\" => ruling 3.\n- \"So ORDERED this ______ day of October, 2024.\" => not a ruling, just date.\n\nSo maybe the 5 matches include 4 rulings like above. We captured 3; maybe there's a 4th ruling: \"ORDERED that the Fairness Hearing on the Terms of the Consent Decree is scheduled to be held on ______, 2025.\" That's ruling 2. There's also \"ORDERED that all case management deadlines are stayed pending the Court’s determination, at or after the Fairness Hearing on the Terms of the Consent Decree.\" That's ruling 3. So we captured 3. There's also \"ORDERED that the Motion is GRANTED, and the Consent Decree is PROVISIONALLY ENTERED.\" That's ruling 1. So we've captured all 3. So Order's 5 matches correspond to 3 rulings plus maybe the date. So that's fine.\n\nNow Docket had many entries: we captured 4 rulings (10, 13, 14, 26). But there may be other rulings in Docket entries earlier or later? The search matched 9 in Docket. Let's inspect Docket matches: We saw matches 1-9 in Docket earlier. The search results show 9 matches. We captured 4 (10, 13, 14, 26). The other matches might be other orders: maybe \"Motions Referred\" but not orders. Let's examine Docket matches list from the search? The search_document_regex results didn't list Docket matches explicitly but mention 9 matches. We need to see what those 9 matches are. We can search Docket for ORDER pattern again but we already did a search across all docs. But we can explicitly request all matches from Docket to review. But to avoid reading entire Docket again, we can re-search for pattern \"ORDER\" in Docket only. That will give us matches. Let's do search_document_regex on Docket doc with pattern \"(?i)(ORDERED|Granted|denied|certified|issued|preliminary injunction|TRO|class certification)\" and top_k maybe 20. That should give us all matches in Docket. Then we can read each match if needed. However we might already have read many of those matches. But better to confirm.\n\nAlso we need to read Notice of Voluntary Dismissal for the dismissal order. That likely contains a ruling: \"The Court dismisses the case with prejudice\" etc. So we need that.\n\nAlso we need to read Consent Decree for any rulings. The search found 10 matches in Consent Decree. We have only read some of those tokens. Many of those probably include the court's order of consent decree. We should read those matches to capture any rulings.\n\nThus next action: search for \"ORDER\" etc in Consent Decree and Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. Then read relevant matches.\n\nWe should plan to read all remaining matches. We can search for pattern again but specifying doc_names: [\"Consent Decree\",\"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\"]. That will return matches.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on these two docs. Then read each match to extract rulings.\n\nWe need to check if the search results already returned the matches for Consent Decree earlier. But we read tokens 1056-1256, 3093-3293, 3472-3722, 4185-4385, 4738-4969, 5822-6022, 8764-8964, 9310-9510. That's 8 matches. There were 10 matches total. So we missed 2 matches. Also we didn't read the other 2 matches. They might be near beginning or end. We need to find them.\n\nSimilarly for Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, we only read 448-648, 957-1136. That covers 33% coverage. There were 2 matches - we need to read those.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for Consent Decree and Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. Then read each match.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Consent Decree\",\"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\"],\"pattern\":\"(?i)(ORDERED|Granted|denied|certified|issued|preliminary injunction|TRO|class certification)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Consent Decree", "Notice of Voluntary Dismissal"], "pattern": "(?i)(ORDERED|Granted|denied|certified|issued|preliminary injunction|TRO|class certification)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10127, "completion_tokens": 1634, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The search results limited to pattern maybe missed some. We should search for \"ORDERED\" etc in all documents again maybe including consent decree, notice of voluntary dismissal, joint motion? Also maybe there are rulings in the consent decree itself? The consent decree is a document but not necessarily a court order; but it may contain the court's decision. The consent decree may have a section \"ORDER\" or \"GOT\" etc. Let's search all documents again for pattern, maybe we missed some matches. We already did search on all documents pattern, got 27 matches, but many of them were not rulings but just words. But we need to extract only court rulings. We should search for \"ORDERED\" \"GRANTED\" \"DENIED\" etc in all documents. We did that, but we might have missed some that are not captured in those matches. Let's search again with pattern that also includes \"received\" etc? But the pattern we used is fine.\n\nWe need to ensure we captured all rulings. Let's examine the search results from Step 3: 27 matches. Many from Consent Decree didn't contain rulings. But maybe some matches in Consent Decree may be about \"ORDERED\" etc. Let's scroll through the matches for Consent Decree: tokens 1056-1256 etc. Those were the header lines, not rulings. Many matches are just words from the decree. So likely no rulings in Consent Decree.\n\nSearch for \"ORDERED\" etc in Notice of Voluntary Dismissal: check tokens 448-648, 957-1136. Let's see if there is a ruling about dismissal. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal likely contains the court's ruling to dismiss. Let's read that section. We'll read tokens 448-648 and 957-1136. Actually we already read only part of it. Maybe we need to read more. Let's read the entire document or relevant portion. We should read the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal fully to capture the court's ruling. We have partially visited tokens 448-648, 957-1136. Let's read the whole document.

Are there more court rulings? We haven't fully explored other documents: Consent Decree, Joint Motion, Complaint. Also maybe there are additional rulings in those. We need to extract all distinct court rulings. Our current list has 7 values. We need to check if more exist. According to search, many matches in Consent Decree, but these are not necessarily rulings. The Consent Decree is the decree itself, not court orders. We might need to find if any court rulings appear in that document. But \"Consent Decree\" likely contains the decree text, not rulings. The Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree may have an order granting it. But we already captured from Order. We should check the Joint Motion document for maybe the order is in the same doc? The Joint Motion might not contain court ruling. The Complaint likely contains no rulings.\n\nCheck the Docket: we read many entries. We captured motions 10, 13, 14, 26. There might be other orders like \"Motion to Stay\" etc. But we should check if there are other orders in Docket: like \"Motion to Stay\" (10) we captured. We might have missed \"Motion to Stay\" earlier? Let's see Docket entries: We saw 12 2024-12-20 order granting Motion 10. 17 2025-01-15 order for motion 13. 18 2025-01-15 order for motion 14. 27 2025-01-30 order for motion 26. Also earlier maybe entry 21? But entry 21 is a motion to seal; no order. 23, 24, 25, etc are notices. So likely no more orders in Docket.\n\nCheck other documents: Consent Decree might contain a clause like \"The court hereby approves\" but that's part of decree, not a separate order. But maybe it includes \"The court has entered the Consent Decree\" but that's in the Order. So no new rulings.\n\nJoint Motion: maybe includes an order for provisional approval; that is captured in Order. But maybe the Joint Motion file may contain the order text as well. But we shouldn't duplicate.\n\nBut maybe there is a \"Notice of Entry of Consent Decree\" which might mention \"The court hereby enters the consent decree\" but that is a separate action. The \"Notice of Entry of Consent Decree\" might be a procedural filing; not a ruling. So likely no new rulings.\n\nThus the 7 values might be complete. But we must confirm that no other rulings exist in the other documents. The search in Consent Decree didn't find any \"ORDERED\" or \"Granted\" text, because the decree text likely doesn't contain such. The search in Joint Motion maybe not needed. But to be safe, we could search for \"ORDERED\" or \"GRANTED\" in Joint Motion. But maybe the Joint Motion file is only the motion, not the order.\n\nThus we might be done. But we need to verify that we have all values: The first 3 from Order: Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree was granted; Fairness Hearing scheduled; all case management deadlines stayed. That's 3. Docket: Motion to Stay; Motion to Exceed Word Limitation; Motion 14; Motion 26. That's 4. So 7.\n\nBut check if the order also had a motion for provisional approval? The order might also have other rulings like \"the court granted the motion to stay\" etc. But we captured that. Perhaps the order had also \"the court granted the motion to stay\" etc. But maybe also \"the court granted the motion to stay and stayed deadlines\". That's the same as the 4th value? Wait: Value 4 is \"Motion to Stay (Motion 10) was granted.\" That's from Docket entry 12. The order also had that? The order might have also included that. But we didn't note it. But we already have that value.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThus we can stop. But need to check if the key has 7 values. Did we include all? Yes.\n\nThus we should issue stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All court rulings have been extracted and the Court_Rulings key contains the complete set of 7 distinct values with evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All court rulings have been extracted and the Court_Rulings key contains the complete set of 7 distinct values with evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11190, "completion_tokens": 939, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The prompt says: \"Extract the court rulings from the legal documents.\" We have already extracted 7 values. But are there any more rulings? We saw search results for Consent Decree matches, but many didn't contain rulings. However maybe there are rulings in the Consent Decree that we haven't captured. The earlier search captured many matches but many are not rulings. We need to ensure that all court rulings (decisions, orders) are extracted. The documents: Order, Docket, Consent Decree, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Joint Motion, Complaint. The Order gave 3 rulings. Docket gave 4. Possibly the Consent Decree includes some rulings? It's a decree, but may have orders issued by court? Actually Consent Decree is a court order. But we may need to extract any rulings within that decree? The Consent Decree might contain the actual order; but the earlier search found many matches but they seem content of decree. The decree may have the court's orders. But they might not be separate rulings; it's the decree itself. But the requirement: \"court's decisions or orders on key motions or issues, expressed as short, self-contained narrative values.\" The decree may itself be an order that gives rulings on motions. The decree might include the court's order on the motion. But the earlier search results didn't find \"ORDERED\" etc within decree. But maybe within decree there is a paragraph stating \"The Court ORDERS...\" We didn't see that. The search pattern included ORDERED, Granted, denied, etc. We saw 20 matches in Consent Decree, but they mostly were text about the decree content, not actual rulings. So maybe no extra rulings.\n\nBut there might be rulings in the Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree? That document is a pleading; likely no rulings. The Complaint likely no rulings. Notice of Voluntary Dismissal is a dismissal; it's a filing, not a court ruling. So the 7 values likely cover all. But we need to confirm that there are no other rulings hidden in the Consent Decree. Let's search the Consent Decree for \"ORDERED\" etc again but maybe we missed. The search already looked for pattern and returned 20 matches. They were not rulings. But maybe some matches had \"ORDERED\" but we didn't see? Let's quickly check one of the matches: match 1 tokens 1056-1256: seems to be appendix. Not a ruling. The other matches are content. So likely no.\n\nCould there be other rulings in the Order beyond those 3? The Order had 3. We captured them. The Docket had 4. We captured them.\n\nAlso, is there any court ruling in the \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\"? That document may be a motion; but the court may have ruled on it earlier? But that's the motion itself. The court's ruling on it is in the Order: \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree was granted.\" That is captured. So no more.\n\nThus we likely have all. But we need to confirm that there are no missing rulings in the Complaint or other. The Complaint is a pleading, no rulings. So complete.\n\nThus we should stop. However we need to ensure that the checklist is fully filled. The last get_checklist shows 1/1 filled.
