We have partial coverage of Complaint, Docket, Consent Decree, Order, Notice, Joint Motion. We need Filing_Date, Parties, Class/Individual, Type_of_Counsel.\n\nWe saw in Complaint matches that \"Case 1:24-cv-00838 Document 1 Filed 10/07/24 Page 1 of 10\". That gives filing date 10/07/24. But we need to verify date format. Also Docket shows filing date 2024-10-07. So we should extract Filing_Date.\n\nAlso parties: Plaintiff: United States of America, Defendant: City of Durham. That appears in Consent Decree header. Also in Complaint maybe. So we need to extract parties.\n\nClass or Individual: The Complaint likely is a class action? The Complaint header: \"United States of America, Plaintiff, Civil Action No.: 24-cv-838 v. City of Durham, Defendant.\" The case might not specify class action. But maybe the complaint indicates \"class action\" or \"individual plaintiffs\" somewhere. The Consent Decree might mention class action? We saw in Consent Decree: \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\" etc. I didn't see class. But maybe in other documents. Checking Docket entries: maybe \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree by United States\" indicates \"United States\" as plaintiff. Not necessarily class.\n\nType_of_Counsel: We need categories for each party: private counsel, public defender, public interest org, government counsel. In Joint Motion, we see names: \"KRISTEN CLARKE, Assistant Attorney General, United States Attorney, Civil Rights Division, Middle District of North Carolina\" etc. That indicates government counsel for United States. For City, we see \"Sarah Laws, Associate City Attorney\". That is government counsel. So Type_of_Counsel for United States: Government counsel. For City: Government counsel. Possibly no private counsel. There might be other counsel for other parties? But only United States and City.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values. So we need to gather evidence for each.\n\nWe need to read more of documents to capture party descriptions and maybe class action designation.\n\nSearch for \"class action\" in documents. Use search_document_regex. We can search across all documents for pattern \"class action\". That will give matches.

We have partially visited documents. We need to find Filing_Date, Parties, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, Type_of_Counsel.\n\nWe have some evidence: In Complaint snippet, we saw \"Case 1:24-cv-00838 Document 1 Filed 10/07/24 Page 1 of 10\". That indicates Filing_Date: 10/07/24. But we need evidence with source document and location. We have that in Complaint. We should read more to confirm. Also we need parties: Plaintiff United States of America, Defendant City of Durham, North Carolina. Also maybe other parties: maybe the Department of Justice? But parties likely just plaintiff and defendant. Also we need class action or individual: The complaint says \"class action\" maybe? The search didn't find class action. But maybe they filed as class action? The complaint may state \"class action\" or not. But the step 3 search for \"class action\" returned 0. So maybe it's not a class action, it's individual. The complaint may refer to \"class action\" or \"class action lawsuit\". Let's search for \"class\" maybe? But better to search for \"class\" or \"class action\" again. We already did. So likely it's not a class action. So we need to mark \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" as Individual with description. Maybe \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America\". But the description should include \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America\" or similar. The instruction: The extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'. So we need description: \"United States of America\". Or maybe include \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as the United States of America.\" We'll extract that.\n\nType_of_Counsel: For each party we need category of legal representation: For plaintiff United States of America, counsel is \"Private counsel\"? Actually the complaint was filed by United States of America, represented by United States Attorney and Assistant Attorney General. They are government counsel. That would be \"government counsel\" or \"public defender\"? The instructions: category can be private counsel, legal services/public defender, public interest org, government counsel. So for plaintiff: government counsel. For defendant City of Durham, counsel: City Attorney, likely \"public interest organization\"? Actually it's a city, so representation is \"public interest organization\" or \"government counsel\"? The City of Durham likely has city attorneys, which are also government counsel. But maybe the city is represented by City Attorney's office, which is also government counsel. So Type_of_Counsel for both parties: government counsel. So we need entries: \"Plaintiff: government counsel\" and \"Defendant: government counsel\". But we need to format as per guidelines? The instructions for Type_of_Counsel: \"The category of legal representation for each party (e.g., private counsel, legal services/public defender, public interest organization such as the ACLU, government counsel).\" So we need to list each party with category. So entries like \"Plaintiff: government counsel\", \"Defendant: government counsel\". Also maybe \"Plaintiff: United States of America - government counsel\". Might need description. We'll just use \"Plaintiff: government counsel\" and \"Defendant: government counsel\".\n\nWe need evidence. We have evidence from Complaint: \"Case 1:24-cv-00838 Document 1 Filed 10/07/24\". Also the docket shows \"COMPLAINT against CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA filed by UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\". That gives parties.\n\nAlso, the Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree includes the signers: for plaintiff United States - listed attorneys. For defendant City of Durham - City Attorney. That gives counsel.\n\nAlso, the Consent Decree has \"United States of America, Plaintiff\" and \"City of Durham, Defendant\". That also gives parties.\n\nSo we can use these documents.\n\nNow we need to read specific token ranges to capture evidence: For Filing_Date, we can use the Complaint snippet we already have. That snippet is tokens 174-374. That includes the date. Let's call location \"Page 1 of 10\". We'll use that.\n\nFor parties: The docket snippet tokens 0-120 contains \"COMPLAINT against CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA filed by UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\" That is evidence. Location: \"Page 1 of docket\". We'll use that.\n\nFor counsel: The Joint Motion snippet tokens 155-355 includes \"FOR PLAINTIFF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\" and lists attorneys. That shows government counsel. Also the defendant side shows City Attorney. The snippet tokens 611-861 includes City Attorney signature. That shows counsel. We'll use those.\n\nNow we need to append checklist entries. We'll do update_checklist for each key? But we can batch. But we need to ensure we include all values.\n\nWe have 4 keys: Filing_Date, Who_are_the_Parties, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, Type_of_Counsel.\n\nWe need to fill each with extracted entries. For Filing_Date, single value. For Who_are_the_Parties, two values: Plaintiff and Defendant. For Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, single value: 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America'. For Type_of_Counsel, two values: Plaintiff and Defendant with category.\n\nWe need to ensure we include evidence for each.\n\nLet's gather evidence text: For Filing_Date: snippet: \"Case 1:24-cv-00838 Document 1 Filed 10/07/24 Page 1 of 10\". We'll use that.\n\nFor Parties: snippet: \"COMPLAINT against CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA filed by UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\" We'll use that. Maybe also \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff\" from Consent Decree. But we can use one snippet.\n\nFor Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: we need evidence that indicates not class action. The complaint might say \"class action\" but we didn't see. Search for \"class action\" returned none. So we assume individual. We still need evidence that indicates \"individual\" plaintiffs. The complaint might say \"Plaintiff: United States of America\" not class. But we need explicit indicator that it's individual. The text \"United States of America, Plaintiff\" indicates individual. So we can use that. Maybe from Consent Decree snippet: \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff\". We'll use that.\n\nFor Type_of_Counsel: snippet from Joint Motion: \"FOR PLAINTIFF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\" then list of attorneys: \"KRISTEN CLARKE Assistant Attorney General United States Attorney\". That indicates government counsel. For defendant: \"Office of the City Attorney\" etc. We'll use snippet tokens 611-989.\n\nNow we need to craft update_checklist call with patch for each key. Since we need to replace entirely? We haven't added any entries yet. So we can just add. We could use append_checklist, but since we are adding first time, either works. But update_checklist may be safer to replace empty list. We'll use update_checklist with patch array of 4 items, each with key and extracted array.\n\nWe need to structure each extracted entry: evidence array with objects: text, source_document, location. And value string.\n\nWe need to ensure we provide the text exactly as verbatim snippet. We'll copy the snippet lines. For Filing_Date: text: \"Case 1:24-cv-00838 Document 1 Filed 10/07/24 Page 1 of 10\". Source_document: \"Complaint\". Location: \"Page 1 of 10\" or \"Page 1 of 10\" maybe combine. Use \"Page 1 of 10\".\n\nFor Parties: text: \"COMPLAINT against CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA filed by UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\" Source_document: \"Docket\". Location: \"Page 1\" or \"Line 0-120\" but we can say \"Page 1 of docket\". But maybe just \"Page 1\" or \"token range 0-120\". We'll use \"Page 1 of docket\".\n\nFor Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: text: \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff\" from Consent Decree snippet. Source_document: \"Consent Decree\". Location: \"Page 1 of 57\" or \"Page 1 of 57\". We'll use that.\n\nFor Type_of_Counsel: we need two entries. For Plaintiff: text: \"FOR PLAINTIFF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: KRISTEN CLARKE Assistant Attorney General United States Attorney\". Source_document: \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\". Location: \"Page 1 of 4\". For Defendant: text: \"Office of the City Attorney 101 City Hall Plaza, Suite 2200\" etc. Source_document: same. Location: \"Page 2 of 4\".\n\nWe need to include evidence arrays for each.\n\nNow let's craft JSON.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"10/07/24\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 1:24-cv-00838 Document 1 Filed 10/07/24 Page 1 of 10\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 of 10\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Who_are_the_Parties\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"COMPLAINT against CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA filed by UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 of docket\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"COMPLAINT against CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA filed by UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 of docket\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Consent Decree\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 of 57\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: government counsel\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"FOR PLAINTIFF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: KRISTEN CLARKE Assistant Attorney General United States Attorney\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 of 4\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: government counsel\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Office of the City Attorney 101 City Hall Plaza, Suite 2200\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 2 of 4\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "10/07/24", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:24-cv-00838 Document 1 Filed 10/07/24 Page 1 of 10", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 1 of 10"}]}]}, {"key": "Who_are_the_Parties", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiff: UNITED STATES OF AMERICA", "evidence": [{"text": "COMPLAINT against CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA filed by UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Page 1 of docket"}]}, {"value": "Defendant: CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA", "evidence": [{"text": "COMPLAINT against CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA filed by UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Page 1 of docket"}]}]}, {"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Individual, described as UNITED STATES OF AMERICA", "evidence": [{"text": "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff", "source_document": "Consent Decree", "location": "Page 1 of 57"}]}]}, {"key": "Type_of_Counsel", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiff: government counsel", "evidence": [{"text": "FOR PLAINTIFF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: KRISTEN CLARKE Assistant Attorney General United States Attorney", "source_document": "Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree", "location": "Page 1 of 4"}]}, {"value": "Defendant: government counsel", "evidence": [{"text": "Office of the City Attorney 101 City Hall Plaza, Suite 2200", "source_document": "Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree", "location": "Page 2 of 4"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7608, "completion_tokens": 2517, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But need to verify completeness. Let's review each key.\n\nChecklist items: Filing_Date, Who_are_the_Parties, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, Type_of_Counsel.\n\nWe have only one filing date, 10/07/24. But is there any other filing dates? Could be other documents filed later, e.g., Joint Motion, etc. The requirement: \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So only first filing date. That is 10/07/24 from Complaint. Good.\n\nWho_are_the_Parties: We captured Plaintiff and Defendant. Are there other parties? The Complaint indicates \"United States of America\" and \"City of Durham, North Carolina\". Might be also other parties like \"Durham Fire Department\" as a party? Probably not, but might be \"Durham Fire Department\" is part of City. Could be also \"United States\" as plaintiff, \"City of Durham\" defendant. There might also be \"United States of America\" as plaintiff, \"City of Durham, North Carolina\" defendant. There's not a third party. So two entries is fine.\n\nClass_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: We have \"Individual, described as UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\". But the definition: \"designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs (with a brief description of the individuals when applicable). The extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\"\n\nBut we might need to confirm whether the lawsuit is class action or individual. The case is a federal civil rights action by the US. Likely not a class action. The evidence from Consent Decree: \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff\". That suggests individual plaintiff. But we should confirm if it's a class action or not. Search for \"class action\" didn't find matches. So it's individual. So we have correct.\n\nType_of_Counsel: We have \"government counsel\" for plaintiff and defendant. But maybe there are other counsel types? For example, private counsel could represent the plaintiff or defendant? But likely both parties had government counsel. But there might also be counsel for the United States (government). The Joint Motion shows several attorneys: Kristen Clarke (Assistant Attorney General), Sandra J. Hairston, Karen D. Woodard, etc. These are all U.S. attorney's office. So government counsel. For defendant, the City Attorney's Office. So government counsel.\n\nBut also there might be other counsel like \"Private counsel\" for the city? In the motion, we see \"Office of the City Attorney\" only. So government counsel.\n\nThus all four keys appear complete.\n\nBut we need to ensure that for each key we have all distinct values. For Type_of_Counsel: we have two distinct values. That seems correct.\n\nNow check for completeness: Are there any missing values? For example, Filing_Date: maybe there are multiple filing dates due to amendments. But the filing date is first filed. So okay.\n\nFor Parties: The Complaint indicates \"United States of America\" as plaintiff, \"City of Durham, North Carolina\" as defendant. Could there be other parties like \"United States Department of Justice\"? It's not a party. So okay.\n\nFor Class_Action: We have \"Individual, described as UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\". But maybe they want \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" not \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\". But we used that format.\n\nCheck formatting: In the update we used \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\". That matches format.\n\nFor Type_of_Counsel: We used \"Plaintiff: government counsel\" and \"Defendant: government counsel\". That matches format.\n\nCheck evidence: The update had evidence referencing the Joint Motion for Provisional Approval and Entry of Consent Decree page 1 and 2. Good.\n\nBut we need to check that the evidence snippet is correct length and exact text. The snippet we used: For plaintiff: \"FOR PLAINTIFF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: KRISTEN CLARKE Assistant Attorney General United States Attorney\" (page 1). For defendant: \"Office of the City Attorney 101 City Hall Plaza, Suite 2200\" (page 2). Those are correct.\n\nNow, we need to confirm that we didn't miss any other values for Type_of_Counsel. There might be \"private counsel\" in the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal\" or other documents. But likely not.\n\nSearch for \"Counsel\" in documents. But maybe there's mention of \"private counsel\" in the docket or others. But we didn't search. But given the case is between US and City, both likely government counsel. So fine.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut need to double-check: The current state shows 4/4 keys filled. But the system may want us to confirm that we have indeed extracted all distinct values. The keys are not lists for each. But we might need to ensure that we didn't miss any party. For example, the Complaint might also include \"United States of America\" as plaintiff and \"City of Durham\" defendant. But there might be \"United States of America\" as plaintiff and \"Durham Fire Department\" as a party? The Complaint might include \"Durham Fire Department\" as a defendant's department. But it's not a separate party. So okay.\n\nNow check if any of the documents might have a class action designation or mention \"class action\" somewhere. The search didn't find any. So we are fine.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we might need to verify that the update we did earlier includes all evidence entries. The update didn't include evidence for \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" but we added that. The evidence snippet: \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff\". Good.\n\nBut we need to check if we need to provide evidence for the Filing_Date: we used snippet \"Case 1:24-cv-00838 Document 1 Filed 10/07/24 Page 1 of 10\". Good.\n\nFor Who_are_the_Parties: evidence snippet: \"COMPLAINT against CITY OF DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA filed by UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\" That includes both parties.
