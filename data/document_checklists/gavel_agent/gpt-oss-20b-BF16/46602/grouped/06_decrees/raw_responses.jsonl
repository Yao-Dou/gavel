The documents: \"Opinion and Order\" likely contains the decree text. The \"Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" might discuss a decree? Could be the decree is a court order. The \"Amended Complaint\" or \"Complaint\" might reference a decree? Possibly \"decreed\" as in \"court decreed\".\n\nAlso \"Brief of Amicus Curiae\" might mention decree.\n\nWe need to find all decrees: maybe there is a \"consent decree\" in the case.

Possibly there are no decrees, maybe only injunctions. But we must check. We need to search for \"decree\" in all documents again and read surrounding. But we already did search_document_regex on all documents for \"decree\" found 2 matches: one in Memorandum, one in Opinion and Order. Those matches didn't have content? Let's inspect the snippet of Opinion and Order match at tokens 20867-21067. That snippet didn't include decree. So maybe the decree is in a different part of the document. We should search again with pattern \"decree|decrees?|decreed|decree\" but we might need a broader pattern to capture. But earlier search returned only 2 matches, meaning only those two tokens. So maybe there are no decrees in the documents. But we have to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\". If no decrees, we might mark Not Applicable if the case has no decrees or no decree exists. But we need evidence that there are no decrees. How to determine? We must read all documents to confirm. The documents are 6. We have unvisited Complaint, Amended Complaint, Docket, Amicus Brief, etc. We need to search for \"decree\" again across all documents. We did but only found 2 matches. That suggests no other decrees. But we need to be sure. Could be that the decree is in the Amended Complaint or Complaint? Those are unvisited. We should search again in those. But we can use search_document_regex on specific documents. Let's run a search on all documents again for \"decree\" maybe with ignorecase. But we did earlier, still 2 matches. So likely no decree. But then we need to decide if we mark Not Applicable. According to rules, Not Applicable requires explicit text or dispositive posture supporting Not Applicable. If the document indicates no decree, or there is no decree. We might need to find explicit statement like \"no decree was entered\" or \"no decree\" or \"no injunction\" etc. Maybe the case involves injunction but not decree. So we can mark Not Applicable for all three items: Significant Terms, Dates, Duration.\n\nBut we must provide evidence. We need to find a statement that there is no decree. Search for \"decree\" might not capture \"decrees\". We found only 2 matches. But maybe there is a sentence like \"no decree was entered\" which contains \"decree\". But search would catch it. So if not found, maybe the case had no decree. But we should confirm by reading the entire document or at least the sections with potential. We could read the entire Opinion and Order to see if any decree is mentioned. But 43k tokens, too large. But we can read key sections: maybe the order includes a preliminary injunction, no decree. So we can find the section where the court orders. The order might say \"The Court orders that...\" but not a decree. We need to check if any \"decree\" appears. Let's search for \"decree\" again with ignorecase across all documents, but maybe the earlier search omitted due to token range? Search_document_regex returns matches on all documents. It returned only 2 matches. That suggests no other matches. So we can likely conclude no decree.\n\nWe must produce Not Applicable for each key if there is no decree. But we need evidence: maybe a statement like \"There is no decree entered in this case\" or \"This case involves only an injunction\" etc. We need to find such evidence. Search for \"injunction\" we saw many. But we need evidence that there is no decree. We could read the Opinion and Order for the language around the order, maybe \"The Court orders\" but not \"decree\". If we can't find explicit statement saying no decree, we might still mark Not Applicable, because the presence of no matches for \"decree\" may be enough? But rule says need explicit text or dispositive posture. The fact that the search returned no matches for \"decree\" could be considered evidence that there's no decree. But is that explicit? It's a negative finding. The rule says \"explicit text or a dispositive posture supporting Not Applicable\". The search itself is a tool action, but we need to provide evidence snippet. We could read a section where the court says \"There is no decree\" or \"This order does not constitute a decree\". If not found, we may still mark Not Applicable. But we need evidence. We could search for \"decree\" again but maybe with \"not\" preceding: \"no decree\".

But we must provide evidence.\n\nTo set Not Applicable, we use update_checklist with single extracted entry \"Not Applicable\" for each key, with evidence. We need evidence that there is no decree. We can cite the search results: search_document_regex returned zero matches for \"decree\" in other docs. But that indicates none. We can also cite that the documents mention \"injunction\" but not decree. Provide text snippet \"No decree\" or \"there is no decree\" though we don't have that. But we can use the evidence that search for \"decree\" returned only two matches and those references are not decrees but references to the word. That might support Not Applicable.\n\nHowever, the requirement: \"Not Applicable: Represent Not Applicable as a single extracted entry for that key, set via `update_checklist`.\" We must provide evidence. Evidence must be from the text; we can use the snippet from the search match: e.g., in the Opinion and Order, \"the Court's decree\" maybe not present. But we can use the snippet showing the word \"decree\" but not as a decree. That might be enough.\n\nBut maybe the decree is actually in the Opinion and Order but not captured. The decree text might be in the Court's order, but we haven't read beyond 41000. But we might need to read beyond 41000 to capture it. Let's examine the word \"decree\" occurs only in those two places. The first match at 20717-21217 likely includes a reference to \"decree\" but not the decree. The second match at 20867-21067 is same region. So likely no decree.\n\nThus set all keys Not Applicable.\n\nWe must issue update_checklist calls for each key with evidence.\n\nWe need to provide evidence: we can provide the search snippet for each key. But the search snippet is a match for \"decree\" but does not contain a decree. But we can use that as evidence that no decree is present. But we need to cite actual text: e.g., the snippet includes \"decree\" but no decree content. We can provide that snippet.\n\nAlternatively, we can use evidence that the documents are about injunctions, not decrees. But that is not a direct evidence of absence. The rule says we cannot mark Not Applicable solely because we failed to find a value; require explicit text or dispositive posture. But we can argue that the documents do not include any decree. The evidence of absence might be the search results showing no matches. But not sure if accepted.\n\nWe might need to actually read the documents to confirm no decree. But we have some text from the opinion and order maybe includes \"decree\" but not an actual decree. We need to look for the phrase \"decree\" again. The snippet in 20867-21067 is:\n\n```\n      complying with the ICA. Defendants dispute \n     whether the Court has jurisdiction under the APA to review this claim and argue that Plaintiffs \n     are unlikely to succeed on the merits. The Court addresses these arguments next in its analysis of \n     Plaintiff’s claims under the APA. \n     3.  APA Claims \n     Plaintiffs assert APA claims against all Defendants, alleging agency action contrary to \n     law and arbitrary and capricious agency action. As an initial matter, DOGE is likely not an \n     “agency” subject to the APA. Executive Order 14158, which created DOGE, expressly exempts \n     “the Executive Office of the President or any components thereof” from the meaning of \n     “agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551. See New Mexico v. Musk, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 \n     WL ... \n```\n\nNo decree. So evidence is that no decree present.\n\nWe need to produce update_checklist for each key. Provide evidence: maybe use the snippet from the search result that shows the search tokens. But we might need to provide actual portion of the document where \"decree\" appears. But the snippet we have includes some context. That is evidence that the word \"decree\" appears but no decree.\n\nBut the rule: \"Not Applicable: Represent Not Applicable as a single extracted entry for that key, set via `update_checklist`.\" Provide evidence required. We can provide the evidence as snippet showing no decree. Provide source_document \"Opinion and Order\" and location \"Tokens 20867-21067\" context snippet.\n\nWe must do this for all three keys. But we can batch update all three keys in one patch.\n\nThus we will call update_checklist patch for each key: Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, Dates_of_All_Decrees, How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. Each with extracted entry value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence from the snippet.\n\nWe need to provide evidence list with one element for each.\n\nWe must ensure that each evidence has text, source_document, location.\n\nWe can use the same snippet for each key.\n\nLet's provide evidence: text snippet: \"The Court has not entered a decree; the document discusses injunctions but does not contain any decree.\" But we need to provide verbatim snippet. But we don't have that exact phrase; we can use the snippet that shows the word \"decree\" and no decree. But we need to show that nothing else. But we can use the snippet from the search match: \"defendants dispute whether the court has jurisdiction under the APA...\". That snippet doesn't mention decree. But we can say that the evidence indicates absence of decree.\n\nBut maybe we should include the snippet that includes the word \"decree\" but not actual decree. But we might need to capture the snippet that shows that no decree content. But we have no snippet that says \"There is no decree\". But we can still use the evidence that the search found only references to the word but no decree. That might be acceptable.\n\nWe need to cite location: tokens 20867-21067. Provide that token range.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"injunction\" as evidence that decree absent. But the rule: \"Not Applicable: Represent Not Applicable as a single extracted entry for that key, set via update_checklist.\" Provide evidence. The evidence can be the search snippet where the word \"decree\" appears but no decree.\n\nThus we can use the snippet: \"the Court addresses these arguments next in its analysis of Plaintiff’s claims under the APA.\" That snippet is within the token range. Provide that.\n\nWe can provide the evidence for each key as the same snippet.\n\nBut maybe better to search for \"decree\" in the document again but provide entire context. But we already have snippet.\n\nOk, let's create the update_checklist call.\n\nWe will patch each key.\n\nWe need to provide extracted array with single extracted entry with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence array with one evidence.\n\nWe need to produce a JSON with patch array of objects.\n\nLet's produce patch:\n\n[\n  {\n    key: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\n    extracted: [\n      {\n        value: \"Not Applicable\",\n        evidence: [\n          {\n            text: \"The Court has not entered a decree; the document discusses injunctions but does not contain any decree.\",\n            source_document: \"Opinion and Order\",\n            location: \"Tokens 20867-21067\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    key: \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\",\n    extracted: [\n      {\n        value: \"Not Applicable\",\n        evidence: [\n          {\n            text: \"The Court has not entered a decree; the document discusses injunctions but does not contain any decree.\",\n            source_document: \"Opinion and Order\",\n            location: \"Tokens 20867-21067\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    key: \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\",\n    extracted: [\n      {\n        value: \"Not Applicable\",\n        evidence: [\n          {\n            text: \"The Court has not entered a decree; the document discusses injunctions but does not contain any decree.\",\n            source_document: \"Opinion and Order\",\n            location: \"Tokens 20867-21067\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nBut the evidence text must be verbatim snippet. We don't have that exact phrase. We can use snippet: \"The Court addresses these arguments next in its analysis of Plaintiff’s claims under the APA.\" But that doesn't mention decree. But we can still provide that as evidence of absence.\n\nBetter to provide the actual snippet that contains the word \"decree\" but not an actual decree. But the snippet we have from the search match at 20867-21067 does not contain \"decree\". It is part of earlier match at 20717-21217. That match might contain \"decree\" but we didn't capture. The snippet at 20867-21067 doesn't show \"decree\". But earlier match at 20717-21217 might contain \"decree\". We didn't see the snippet. It's likely that the snippet includes the word \"decree\". We can approximate.\n\nBut to be safe, we can provide the evidence that search for \"decree\" found only references to the word but not a decree. But we need text.\n\nMaybe we should use the snippet from the search match at 20867-21067, but that snippet doesn't show \"decree\". But we can provide evidence from the earlier match at 20717-21217, but we don't have exact snippet.\n\nWe could use the snippet from the search match at 20867-21067 as evidence of absence, but it doesn't mention \"decree\". That might still show that the document contains no decree. But it's not explicit.\n\nAlternatively, we could search again for \"decree\" in the Opinion and Order but focusing on the entire document. But we already did. But we could search for \"decree\" with context around it to get the snippet that includes the word. Provide that as evidence.\n\nLet's try a new search: search_document_regex on Opinion and Order for pattern \"decree\" with context 200 tokens. That will show the match snippet. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Opinion and Order\",\"pattern\":\"decree\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion and Order", "pattern": "decree", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6711, "completion_tokens": 2798, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Format \"[duration]: [decree].\"\n\nWe need to find decrees. The documents are an Opinion and Order, a Memorandum, etc. We have searched for \"decree\" and found only two matches in Opinion and Order and Memorandum. But maybe there are decrees in the Opinion and Order. We need to read more. The Opinion and Order is partially visited, but we haven't seen the decree text. We should search for \"decree\" again but with other patterns like \"consent decree\" \"injunction\" \"injunctive\" etc. The relevant decree might be a \"preliminary injunction\" (the order). The key is \"decree\" but might be in \"injunction\" phrase.\n\nHowever, the question: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" refers to substantive obligations imposed by any decree. In this case, the order is a preliminary injunction, which is a decree. But is it called \"decree\"? Maybe the order is a \"preliminary injunction\" but we need obligations. Could also be an \"injunction\" with terms.\n\nBut we might need to read the decree portion. The earlier reads covered tokens 18000-19000, 20867-21067, 35000-41000 etc. But not the entire decree. We need to locate the section where the Court issues the injunction and lists terms. This is likely near the end of the opinion.\n\nThus we should search for \"orders that\" or \"order that\" or maybe \"orders that\" was searched but no matches. But \"order that\" found one match. We need to locate the injunction terms. We might search for \" order\" but that's too common.\n\nBetter to search for \"orders that\" again maybe we missed. But we can search for \"injunction\" again. We did but only got 5 matches earlier. But maybe the terms are in a phrase like \"orders that the\" etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"preliminary injunction\" again but we did earlier. However, the terms might be in \"orders\" like \"orders that the defendants cease\" etc.\n\nWe need to find the decree text. The decree might be the \"preliminary injunction\" granted. We can search for \"issued\" maybe.\n\nBut perhaps the decree is not in the Opinion and Order but in the Memorandum. Let's search \"decree\" again in the Opinion and Order, we saw a match at tokens 20867-21067 but it's about \"decree\" only in context maybe not the decree text.\n\nWe can search for \"injunction\" again but maybe we need to capture the decree text. Maybe the decree text is near page 70? We can search for \"orders\" again but maybe not.\n\nWe can search for \"orders the\" or \"orders that the\" but that might be too general. We can search for \"the Court orders\" pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"preliminary injunction\" with pattern \"preliminary injunction\" we did earlier but only matched the heading. That might not include the decree text.\n\nWe might need to search for \"injunction\" but with context after. We can search for \"injunction\" again with context. Let's try search_document_regex for all documents pattern: \"injunction\" again but maybe we need to include a longer context. But the earlier search returned 5 matches. We might need to look at each match for terms.\n\nLet's see the matches: we saw one at tokens 291-491, but that's introduction. Another at 1385-1585, but that's background. Another at 2875-3075, etc. These are likely earlier sections. The decree text may be near the end. We might need to search for \"orders\" near the end. Let's search for pattern \"orders that\" again but maybe we need a more specific pattern like \"orders that the\" or \"orders that the defendants\" etc.\n\nBut maybe the decree text is under \"Orders\" heading. The Opinion and Order might have a section like \"Orders\" with bullet points. The search for \"order that\" found one match. Let's inspect that match. It might contain the decree text. We need to read that match. We should search for \"order that\" again but maybe we can read that region. The earlier search didn't show the match details. Let's do search_document_regex on Opinion and Order pattern: \"order that\" again. But we might need to set context tokens to maybe 500 to get more context.\n\nLet's call search_document_regex with doc_name \"Opinion and Order\", pattern \"order that\", flags [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k maybe 5, context_tokens 300.

Currently no values extracted. Need to find decrees in documents. We have seen earlier search for \"decree\" but found no matches in Opinion and Order? Wait earlier steps found matches in Opinion and Order and Memorandum. But the content we saw did not show decree. The search results show pattern \"decree\" but the match snippet didn't include a decree. In the Opinion and Order snippet we saw \"decree\" but not the decree text. We may need to read more of Opinion and Order to find any decree. Also maybe the Amended Complaint or Complaint includes a decree? But likely the decrees are in Opinion and Order. We need to read more of that doc. We have partially visited ranges, but we need to find the decree. Search for \"decree\" again but we saw only 1 match in Opinion and Order, but likely the match is around the decree text. But the snippet didn't show the decree. Might need to read more context around that token range. The match was tokens 20867-21067. We can read that range. We already read 200 tokens from 20867-21067 earlier (step 8). That snippet didn't include decree. Maybe the decree is outside that window. Let's search again for \"decree\" but maybe with different pattern: \"decree\" with preceding word \"consent\" or \"injunction\". But we did that. We saw only 1 match. Let's search for the phrase \"consent decree\" but earlier no matches. Maybe the decree is a \"preliminary injunction\" but not a decree. But the checklist asks for Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, Dates_of_All_Decrees, How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. So need to find any decree in the documents. Perhaps the decrees are in the Opinion and Order, but we need to read more of that doc, maybe later pages. Let's search for \"injunctive\" or \"decree\" again but maybe it's a \"decree\" in the Amended Complaint. Let's search in all documents for \"decree\" again but maybe we need to get context. But we already did search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"decree\" and got 2 matches: one in Memorandum, one in Opinion and Order. So only those two matches. That suggests there is only one decree in the entire corpus. But the snippet didn't show the decree. Maybe the decree is a \"preliminary injunction\" but not a decree. Wait the checklist might refer to decrees in the court order, like \"the court enters a decree\" or \"the court orders\". Let's search for \"decree\" again but we did. Maybe the decree is in the Opinion and Order but not captured because the snippet didn't include it. But our search only shows the snippet around the match. There might be only one \"decree\" word. So we need to read that snippet fully to capture the decree. The snippet earlier: we saw \"decree\" but not the surrounding. Let's re-read that snippet fully. The match tokens 20867-21067 were displayed earlier. It didn't show the decree. So maybe the decree is earlier or later. Let's search for \"decree\" again but maybe get context of 200 tokens. We can call search_document_regex again with context_tokens maybe larger. But we already have a match. But we need to read the full match. Maybe the match was truncated. Let's call read_document for tokens 20867-21067 again to confirm. But we already did that. It returned 200 tokens. But the snippet might have been truncated due to display. Let's request read_document for the entire range maybe 20800-21000. But we already did. The snippet didn't show decree. So maybe the decree is not there. Let's search for \"injunction\" maybe the decree is a \"preliminary injunction\" in the Opinion and Order. But the checklist is about decrees, not injunctions. But maybe the decree is a \"decree\" like \"decree entered on date\" etc.\n\nWe need to find all decrees. Let's search for \"decree\" again, but maybe the doc names: \"Opinion and Order\" has many tokens; we might need to see if there are other matches beyond the 1 we saw. Maybe the search only returned 1 match but we might need more context. Let's run search_document_regex on Opinion and Order for pattern \"decree\" again but with context 500 maybe. But we need to call the tool. So next action: search_document_regex on Opinion and Order with pattern \"decree\" again to get context. But we already did steps 20-21 and got same. But maybe we need to increase context tokens to capture full decree. But the match snippet didn't show decree. Let's inspect the match tokens: 20867-21067. That snippet is 200 tokens. It didn't show decree. So maybe the decree is not there. Let's search for \"decree\" with pattern \"decree\" but maybe the text \"decree\" appears in a different context e.g., \"decree\" as part of word \"decreed\". But the search regex pattern will match. The snippet didn't show decree. Let's search for \"decree\" again but maybe the snippet is truncated due to display. But we can read the entire match by reading the entire token range. But we did. So maybe there is no decree in Opinion and Order. Then maybe the decree is in the Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Let's read that doc around the match tokens 16848-17048. But that snippet didn't show decree. But maybe the decree is earlier or later in that doc. Let's search again for \"decree\" with context 200 in that doc. But we did. Only one match.\n\nThus maybe there is no decree in the documents. But we need to determine if any decrees exist. But the checklist expects 3 items. If there are no decrees, we set Not Applicable for each? But we need evidence. Could be that there is no decree, but we need evidence that none exist. That would require scanning all documents. But we have partially visited many. But we haven't visited Amended Complaint, Complaint, Docket, Amicus Brief. We need to search for \"decree\" in all documents to confirm. We did earlier search_document_regex on all documents and found only 2 matches. That should be exhaustive. So likely there are no decrees. Then we can mark each key as Not Applicable. But we need evidence that there is no decree. The search results show no matches. That is evidence. But we need to provide evidence: maybe we can use the search result outcome: \"No matches found\". But we need evidence with text snippet. The search_document_regex result itself includes the matches. We can use that as evidence: \"Search in 6 documents found 0 total matches\" for one search. But to be safe, we can search again for \"decree\" in all documents, but specifying context 200. The result will show no matches. Then we can set Not Applicable. But we need to include evidence: the search result that says 0 matches. However, the evidence format requires verbatim text from document. The search result indicates no matches, but does not provide text. We might need to provide evidence such as \"No decree found in any document\" but that is not verbatim. Maybe we need to set Not Applicable by using evidence that the search found no matches. But the guidelines say evidence must include text snippet. But maybe we can provide the search result as evidence? It says evidence must be with text snippet from document. But if no document contains the term, we cannot provide a snippet. In such case, we might need to set Not Applicable but evidence may be a statement that no matches were found. However guidelines require evidence. This might be an edge case. But we can provide evidence from the search result: \"Search in 6 documents found 0 total matches\". But it's not a snippet from a document. But maybe the system accepts. Alternatively we could search for \"decree\" again but with a broader pattern like \"decre\" to capture \"decrees\". But we did earlier. But still no matches.\n\nThus likely no decrees. So we need to set each key to Not Applicable. Use update_checklist for each key.\n\nBut we must provide evidence. We can provide the search result as evidence. But we need to include evidence as text, source_document, location. We could use source_document as \"Search\" or \"All Documents\" but that might not be accepted. But maybe we can provide evidence from the search_document_regex result: \"Search in 6 documents found 0 total matches\". Provide source_document: \"Search\" and location: \"search result\". But guidelines may not accept that. Another approach: we could use the search result for \"decree\" which shows 0 matches, but we can still provide that as evidence that no decree found. But not ideal.\n\nAlternatively, we could search for \"decree\" again but maybe there is a decree in the Amended Complaint or Complaint. Let's check quickly by reading a bit of those docs. But we haven't visited them. Let's search for \"decree\" in Amended Complaint. Use search_document_regex on that doc. That would confirm. Let's do that. Use search_document_regex on \"Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" with pattern \"decree\". If no match, we can be confident. Similarly for Complaint, etc. So we will do search_document_regex on each unvisited doc. That will give evidence. We can then update Not Applicable. So next action: search_document_regex on the remaining unvisited docs for \"decree\". But we can combine doc_names array to search all unvisited docs: Amended Complaint, Complaint, Docket, Amicus Brief. That will produce matches.

Let's read the Opinion and Order near the \"Order\" part. The read_document at 18000-19000 likely covered part of the order. But we didn't read the part where the decree is issued. There's a long document; maybe the decree is at the end. We should read near the end of the document where orders are. Let's search for \"ORDER\" or \"By the Court\". But maybe the decree is in the order, which is at the end of the opinion. Let's search for \"by the court\" or \"the court hereby\". Use regex. But better to search for \"by the Court\" across Opinion and Order.\n\nWe can search for \"by the Court\" pattern. Use search_document_regex on Opinion and Order.

So we need to capture obligations from decrees. We have: The Court ORDERS... but is that a decree? It's an order. The decree might be a \"preliminary injunction\" considered a decree? Usually a preliminary injunction is a decree.

We have seen many matches, but no decree text. We need to read sections that contain decrees. The documents have \"Opinion and Order\" and \"Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\". Likely decrees are in Opinion and Order: \"The Court ORDERS ...\". Also there may be \"decree\" in other docs. We need to locate the decree text: maybe in \"Opinion and Order\" there is a \"decree\" section. We saw matches but not content. Let's search for \"decree\" again but maybe look at context: For matches we saw earlier. But we need to read relevant tokens. The search_document_regex gave matches but we need to read the content. We need to find decree text: maybe \"decree\" appears in the \"Opinion and Order\" around token 20717-21217. But that snippet didn't show decree. Maybe further tokens after 21217 have decree. We can read tokens 21217-22217? Let's read a larger window.\n\nWe can use read_document on Opinion and Order tokens 21217-22217. That covers next 1000 tokens. But we must not exceed 10k. Let's do that.\n\nBut also check if there are decrees in \"Memorandum\" or others. Search for \"decree\" in those docs. We can search with regex across all documents, but we already did earlier. Only two matches per doc. But those were maybe not decree text. We might need to read more tokens around those matches. For \"Memorandum\" tokens 16000-20000 already read some. We may need to read other parts. Let's search again for \"decree\" in \"Memorandum\" with context. But maybe the decree is in \"Opinion and Order\".\n\nIn \"Opinion and Order\", search for \"decree\" again: we saw match at 20717-21217. Let's read tokens 20717-21217 again but we already saw snippet. It didn't show decree. Maybe the decree is earlier, around 18000-19000? But we saw earlier read of 18000-19000, but no decree snippet. We might need to search for \"decree\" again with context 200 tokens. But we had matches earlier.\n\nMaybe the decree is in \"Opinion and Order\" but not containing the word \"decree\" but \"orders\" or \"grant\" etc. The question: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: The substantive obligations imposed by any decree—what defendants are ordered to do or refrain from doing.\" So we need to find obligations. That may be in \"The Court ORDERS\" section. We saw snippet: \"Defendants National Endowment for the Humanities, National Council on the Humanities, and Michael McDonald are hereby STAYED from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs’ grants and from disbursing, encumbering, loaning, granting, or otherwise disposing of the funds committed to Plaintiffs, including the member Councils of the Federation, through grants approved as of April 2, 2025, except as to Plaintiffs.\" That is an obligation: stay from implementing terminations and from disbursing etc. So that is a significant term.\n\nWe also need dates of all decrees: dates entered, with identification. The decree might be the stay order, dated \"DATED this 6th day of August, 2025.\" That is the date.\n\nAlso \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\": length terms: maybe the stay is until the Court orders otherwise? The decree text may include \"until the Court orders\" or \"until the Court orders.\" In snippet at tokens 43422-43622, we saw \"The Court ORDERS ... that Defendants ... are hereby STAYED from implementing ... except as to Plaintiffs.\" It didn't include duration. But maybe earlier or later there is \"This stay is effective until ...\" Let's search for \"stay\" or \"effective\" patterns. Search for \"stay\" in Opinion and Order. But we already saw \"stay\" snippet. But to find duration, we may need to read more context after the stay order. We can read tokens 43622-44622 already read. That snippet included the order but not duration. It ended with \"PAGE 80 – OPINION\". So maybe the duration is earlier or later in the document. Let's read further tokens beyond 44622: maybe 44622-45622. But we haven't read that.\n\nLet's read tokens 44622-45622. Also maybe the decree is not a stay but a consent decree in other documents. Search for \"consent decree\" again but earlier step 5 found none. So only possible decree is the stay order in Opinion and Order.\n\nThus we need to extract:\n- Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: the stay order obligations (list of things defendants must not do, etc.).\n- Dates_of_All_Decrees: date of the stay order: \"6th day of August, 2025\". Also maybe other decree dates? Not sure. There might be other decrees earlier in the case, but let's search for \"decree\" again in Opinion and Order for \"decree\" pattern maybe in earlier tokens. We saw match 20717-21217 etc. But maybe there is a \"decree\" in earlier part near 0-2000 or 2872-3155 etc. But we haven't read those sections. We can search for \"decree\" again but we already did earlier, but it gave matches only in those two documents. But maybe the decree text is beyond 21217. Let's search again for \"decree\" in Opinion and Order but with more context. The search_document_regex gave match at 20717-21217. That snippet didn't show decree. But maybe the decree is in that snippet but truncated? Let's read 20717-21217 again but maybe we need to read more context around it. But we already did. Let's read 20717-21717. That's 1000 tokens. That will include the snippet and maybe more beyond. Let's do that.\n\nAlso to find duration: we need to read the \"stay\" order fully. We already read 43422-43747 which had the order but not duration. Maybe the stay order is earlier? Let's read 43422-44422. That contains the start of the order and maybe the end of the order with duration. Let's read 43422-44422.\n\nLet's plan: read 43422-44422 to capture the stay order. Also read 20717-21717 to capture any decree text. Also maybe read 43422-44422 again to capture if there's duration.

We need to find decrees. The plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction might have a stay of a decree? The search results show some \"decree\" matches but we saw that the Court ORDERS a stay of some terminations. That might be a decree: the Court orders to stay the terminations. That is a decree. Also \"The Court ORDERS\" sections are decrees. We need to capture significant terms of decrees: what's ordered to do or refrain.\n\nDates_of_All_Decrees: date when decrees entered.

The court also orders (in step 61) about staying terminations effective April 2, 2025. But that is a stay order dated August 6. So maybe only one decree.\n\nHow_Long_Decrees_will_Last: The decree's duration. The stay order likely lasts until the Court orders otherwise? In the text we saw: \"The Court ORDERS... that Defendants National Endowment for the Humanities, National Council on the Humanities, and Michael McDonald are hereby STAYED from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs’ grants and from disbursing...\" It doesn't specify a time limit but may be until the Court orders otherwise. But we need to capture any duration terms. Also the preliminary injunction is also a decree: the Court grants a preliminary injunction. That may also have a duration? The document might have earlier part with injunction conditions. We need to search for \"preliminary injunction\" to find the injunction terms. They might include a stay of actions until the court orders. Let's search for \"preliminary injunction\" in Opinion and Order. Already step 31 found 5 matches. But we haven't read those sections. Let's read the relevant tokens. The preliminary injunction might be earlier in the document. Let's read around 7000-9000 tokens maybe.

We need to find decrees in the documents. Probably the opinion contains a preliminary injunction, but maybe also a decree? The \"Opinion and Order\" is an order, but the term \"decree\" may appear. We need to find all decrees, and extract terms, dates, durations.\n\nWe have seen some matches for decree patterns but those were not necessarily decrees; maybe the opinion has \"decree\" in context. But we need to see if any decree is actually issued. Maybe the court orders an injunction but not a decree. However, there may be \"decree\" in the text describing the order. Let's search for \"decree\" in Opinion and Order but we haven't read all. The previous search found only one match at tokens 20867-21067? That snippet didn't contain decree. But maybe earlier matches: step 4 read 18000-19000, step 8 read 20867-21067. Step 10 read 35000-41000. Step 30 read 41000-42000. Step 33 read 33534-33734. Step 57 read 43622-44622. Step 61 read 43422-43747. Not all. We need to find any decree. Let's search again for \"decree\" but with context maybe. Use search_document_regex on Opinion and Order with pattern \"decree\" might give more context. But earlier we did search_document_regex on all docs and got only 2 matches. That indicates that there may be only 2 instances of the word \"decree\" in the entire corpus. Those were in the memorandum and in the opinion. The snippet in the opinion didn't show a decree. Let's inspect that snippet: tokens 20867-21067 snippet did not mention a decree. It's possible that the word \"decree\" appears elsewhere, but the search only found 1 match in opinion. But the earlier search at step 4 (search_document_regex on all docs) found 2 matches, one in memorandum and one in opinion. So there are only 2 occurrences of the word \"decree\".\n\nThus, there may be no decree in the opinion or memorandum. But the task is to extract items for all decrees. If there are no decrees, we might mark keys as Not Applicable? However, the definition says: Not Applicable only if explicit evidence indicates no decree. But maybe the case has no decree. The opinion is an order, not a decree. The memorandum is a motion, not a decree. So likely there are no decrees. But we need to confirm by searching specifically for \"decree\" matches to confirm they are not referencing a decree. The earlier snippet from the memorandum didn't mention decree. The snippet from the opinion didn't. So likely no decrees.\n\nBut maybe there are \"decree\" in other documents not yet visited: Amended Complaint, Complaint, Docket, Brief of Amicus. We should search across all documents for \"decree\" again but maybe with case-insensitive and possibly with word boundaries. Search pattern: \\bdecree\\b. That should catch.

We have partial coverage of Opinion and Order; but we need to find all decrees, dates, durations, and significant terms. The documents with potential decrees are likely the Opinion and Order and maybe the Memorandum. We have seen some text from Opinion and Order: it contains \"The Court ORDERS\", \"The Court ORDERS ... from implementing ...\". That looks like order, but is it a decree? The term \"decree\" appears rarely. There may be a \"decree\" in the Opinion and Order that we didn't see. The search results earlier found matches but didn't show any decree text. We need to find any decree statements.\n\nMaybe the Opinion and Order contains a final decree, like a \"decree\" or \"decree that\". The searches earlier indicated few matches. But we might need to read more of the Opinion and Order to find decree. The current coverage is 35%. We need to find all decrees. The phrase \"decree\" might not appear; but the key is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" - obligations imposed by any decree. Even if the word \"decree\" isn't used, but the decree might be a \"final order\" or \"decree\" in text. The search on \"decree\" didn't find many; but maybe there is a \"decree\" in the document but not captured. The search results at step 60 were on \"decree\" but the match didn't show a decree. The search at step 62 also didn't show a decree. The search at step 64 found a match but no decree. So likely no decree term appears? But the law case might have a \"decree\" in the memorandum. But we saw only one match earlier.\n\nLet's consider the \"Opinion and Order\" might have a \"decree\" but not found due to pattern. Maybe \"decrees\" spelled with s. Search on \"decrees?\" found matches. But what about \"decree\" usage? The searches earlier might have mis- captured. Let's search again for \"decree\" with broader.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex with pattern \"decree\" on Opinion and Order again, maybe get context. But we might need to confirm no decree. But if no decree exists, we might set Not Applicable? However, the document is an \"Opinion and Order\" which could include a \"decree\" that the court orders. But the key is \"decree\" maybe not in the text. But the obligations may still be in the \"orders\" part.\n\nHowever, the key \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" is about obligations imposed by any decree. If there is no decree, but there is a \"stay\" order, that might be a decree. But we need to see if the document states \"The Court ORDERS ...\". That is an order, but not necessarily a decree. The key is \"decree\". But we might interpret any \"order\" as a decree. But the key may be limited to \"decree\" language; but the instructions say \"substantive obligations imposed by any decree—what defendants are ordered to do or refrain from doing.\" So it might refer to any decree, but if the decree is not explicitly labeled, but is an order, maybe still considered a decree. But the key might be ambiguous.\n\nBetter to search for \"decree\" in the entire corpus again. The search results earlier didn't find many. But we can do a broader search: pattern \"decree\" or \"decrees?\" but maybe we missed. Could be \"decree\" in the Memorandum? The earlier search on Memorandum found a match but didn't show a decree. Let's read the Memorandum around that match to see if there's a decree.\n\nWe have read the memorandum from tokens 16000-20000. The match at 16848-17048 did not show decree. But maybe there's a decree earlier or later. Let's search again for \"decree\" in the memorandum, but with context. Use search_document_regex on the memorandum for \"decree\".

The decree may be a \"decree\" but not the word. Could be \"injunction\" or \"restraining order\". Let's search for \"injunctive\". But the checklist items ask for \"decrees\" specifically.

The question: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\": substantive obligations imposed by any decree—what defendants are ordered to do or refrain from doing. So that stay order might be a decree?

Also earlier \"The Court ORDERS, under 5 U.S.C § 705, that Defendants ... are hereby STAYED\" is a decree. Also earlier \"The Court ORDERS, under 5 U.S.C § 705, that Defendants ... are hereby STAYED from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations...\" So that's a decree. Also maybe others: earlier \"The Court ORDERS, under 5 U.S.C § 705, that Defendants NA... are hereby STAYED from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations...\" Also maybe \"The Court ORDERS ...\"\n\nWe need to extract significant terms: e.g., \"Defendants are hereby STAYED from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs’ grants\" etc. Also maybe other decrees: There may be a \"preliminary injunction\" decree, but not fully captured. The search for \"decree\" found only one match in Opinion and Order. Maybe there is a \"Consent decree\" or \"decree\" but not found. We need to check if there are any other decrees in the documents. The search earlier didn't find any. But we might need to read more of Opinion and Order to capture all content around \"order that\" or \"orders that\". Let's search for \"orders that\" or \"order that\" again. But we should read the relevant sections.\n\nWe need to extract dates of all decrees. We saw a decree that was entered on ??? The decree date might be the date of the order; we saw \"dated?\" and \"Page 80 – OPINION\". The decree likely was entered on the same date as the document: maybe 08/06/25? The document header shows \"Filed 08/06/25\". Also the order says \"The Court ORDERS ... effective date\". But we need the date the decree was entered. That might be the date of the opinion and order itself: 08/06/25. The decree might also have a specific effective date within the decree: e.g., \"from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations\" but the decree \"stays\" maybe effective immediately, but we need the decree date of entry: 8/6/25.\n\nAlso \"How Long Decrees will Last\" – e.g., a stay may last until \"the Court orders\" again? Search for \"stay\" or \"until\" may indicate duration. The snippet indicates \"STAYED from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs’ grants\" but that is a stay of those terminations. The duration might be indefinite until a further order. There's maybe a phrase \"until the Court orders\" but not found. Search for \"until the Court\" again. It was earlier matched \"until the Court orders\" but no matches. But still maybe it appears.\n\nWe should read the portion around \"The Court ORDERS\" we saw tokens 43422-43622. Let's read more around that match to capture all terms. Also read earlier around tokens 43422-43622. Let's read tokens 43300-43700 maybe. We'll read 4000 tokens? But we have limit 10k.

The search for \"decree\" found only 1 match in Opinion and Order, but the content didn't show decree text. Maybe there is a \"preliminary injunction\" but not decree. Maybe the decrees are in the \"Order\" portion of the Opinion and Order, like the \"Court ORDERS\" lines. That is an order, but not necessarily a decree. However, the question: Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: substantive obligations imposed by any decree. So we need to find any decree text. Also Dates_of_All_Decrees: dates entered. And How_Long_Decrees_will_Last: duration terms.\n\nWe have seen in the Opinion and Order: \"The Court ORDERS, under 5 U.S.C § 705, that Defendants ... are hereby STAYED from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs’ grants ...\". That is an order, not a decree. However, the Court may issue a decree in the form of a \"Preliminary Injunction\" which can be considered a decree. The text might contain the decree: \"Defendants shall not further terminate, suspend, or cancel Plaintiffs’ grants ...\". That is a substantive obligation. That's part of the order.\n\nBut \"decree\" might refer to \"decree\" as a legal term used in the Order. The search \"decree\" only found 1 match in Opinion and Order but we didn't view that region. Let's search again for \"decree\" in Opinion and Order, but maybe we need to read the region where the match occurs. The last search found match at tokens 20867-21067. We can read that region. That region seems to be the earlier portion not the order. But maybe the decree text is earlier. Let's search for \"decree\" again but maybe using \"decree\" pattern returns only that match. Let's search for \"decree\" again but maybe we need to search for \"decree\" in entire documents again. But we already did. The match was at tokens 20867-21067. That text is about APA claims. Not a decree.\n\nMaybe there is no decree in the Opinion and Order. But the question expects extraction of these items. Maybe there is a decree in the \"Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" but we only saw a small snippet. Let's search for \"decree\" again in that doc. Earlier we saw a match at tokens 16848-17048. That snippet didn't contain a decree. So maybe there is no decree. But then we might need to mark Not Applicable for those keys. But we need evidence that there is no decree. However, we need explicit evidence. The absence of \"decree\" might not be enough. We need to confirm that no decree is present. But maybe the decree is present but not matched by our regex. It could be \"decrees\" or \"decree\". We used pattern \"decree\" and \"decrees?\" which should match both. We saw matches. We also searched for \"\\bdecree\\b\" and got 1 match in Opinion and Order. So only that match. That seems likely that there's no decree. But maybe the decree is not labeled as \"decree\" but as \"order\" or \"injunction\". The question says \"decrees\" but the legal document may use \"decree\" as a term. But it's possible the decree is a \"preliminary injunction\" order. However, the order we saw is not called a decree. But maybe the \"Court ORDERS\" is the decree.\n\nLet's examine the text of the order lines. We saw:\n\n\"Defendants’ April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs’ previously approved grants was unlawful and Defendants are enjoined from implementing those terminations as to grants awarded to either Plaintiffs Oregon Council for the Humanities d/b/a Oregon Humanities or the Federation of State Humanities Councils, including all member Councils of the Federation; \n2. Defendants shall not further terminate, suspend, or cancel Plaintiffs’ grants approved as of April 2, 2025, absent cause specified ... \n3. Defendants shall not obligate, loan, encumber, disburse, or otherwise dispose of the funds committed to Plaintiffs ...\"\n\nThis is a set of orders (obligations). That could be considered a decree (a court order). But the key \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" refers to substantive obligations imposed by any decree. So we could extract those obligations. The dates of decree are likely the date the order was entered: \"Filed 08/06/25\" perhaps. The \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" we saw \"Filed 08/06/25\" in the page. But the decree date might be the date of the Order.\n\nBut we need to format as \"[date]: [decree]\". The date could be \"August 6, 2025\" (08/06/25). The decree text could be the set of orders. But we might need to capture each obligation as separate entries. But the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" maybe can have multiple values: each obligation.\n\nAlso \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" - for an injunction, the duration. The text might say \"the Court ORDERS... the injunction shall remain in effect until ...\". We need to find that. In the snippet we saw \"The Court ORDERS ... that Defendants National Endowment ... are hereby STAYED from implementing ...\". That is a stay. The duration of the stay might be until the Court orders. We need to find that.\n\nLet's search again in Opinion and Order for \"stay\" or \"until\". We earlier searched for \"until\" and found 5 matches. We saw one at tokens 9293-9614. That snippet was not the order. We saw at tokens 43300-43747 we saw the stay. The snippet didn't include duration. But maybe earlier part of the order includes \"The Court ORDERS ... the injunction shall remain in effect until ...\". Let's search for \"until\" again but maybe include context. But we already did. But maybe the match was at tokens 9293-9614 which is earlier. That snippet did not include the word \"until\" but \"until\" might appear elsewhere. Let's search again for \"until\" but maybe with context. The earlier search for \"until\" found 5 matches. We didn't see the specific token ranges. Let's request again.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Opinion and Order\",\"pattern\":\"until\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion and Order", "pattern": "until", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8146, "completion_tokens": 1441, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have partially read Opinion and Order, especially the section that gives the preliminary injunction and orders. We need Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: substantive obligations imposed by any decree? The document includes orders that are part of the decree. We need maybe \"Defendants are enjoined from implementing those terminations as to grants awarded to ...\", and other orders. Also \"Defendants shall not further terminate, suspend, or cancel Plaintiffs’ grants approved as of April 2, 2025, absent cause...\" etc. Also \"Defendants shall not obligate, loan, encumber, disburse, or otherwise dispose of the funds committed to Plaintiffs, including the member Councils of the Federation, through grants approved as of April 2, 2025, except as to Plaintiffs.\" And \"Defendants are STAYED from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs’ grants and from disbursing, encumbering, loaning, granting, or otherwise disposing of the funds committed to Plaintiffs...\"\n\nThese are obligations. Also \"Defendants shall not further terminate, suspend, or cancel Plaintiffs’ grants approved as of April 2, 2025, absent cause specified...\" etc.\n\nSo we can extract those as significant terms.\n\nDates_of_All_Decrees: The decree date? The decree might be the order itself. The preliminary injunction is dated June 2? The document shows \"Case 3:25-cv-00829-SI Document 39 Filed 08/06/25\". So the decree entered on August 6, 2025? But the order refers to \"June 2\" maybe earlier. In the text we saw \"Defendants’ April 2, 2025 terminations\" but the decree date might be \"June 2\"? Let's search for \"June\" in the Opinion and Order. Step 41 found \"June 2\" matches. But we need the date the decree was entered. The document says \"Filed 08/06/25\" which is August 6, 2025. That is likely the filing date. The order may have been entered on that date. So for Dates_of_All_Decrees we need entries like \"08/06/25: Preliminary Injunction and stay\" or \"June 2, 2025: Preliminary Injunction\"? Actually the decree itself is the order as of 08/06/25. But maybe earlier there is a \"Preliminary Injunction\" order dated June 2? Not sure.\n\nLet's search for \"June 2\" within Opinion and Order to see if there's an earlier decree. But we already saw \"June 2\" matches but we didn't see context. Let's read around that region. We'll need to read tokens around 41 matches maybe 41. Let's search again for \"June 2\" with context. We'll use search_document_regex on Opinion and Order pattern \"June 2\" again but maybe get context. Actually step 41 earlier used search_document_regex on Opinion and Order pattern \"June 2\" and found 5 matches. But we didn't read those contexts. Let's read one of them. We'll do search_document_regex again but maybe with higher context_tokens to see which part. But we can also read the tokens around match 1.

We have some decree text: preliminary injunction orders. Need to find decree dates and durations.\n\nFrom the recent read (Step 73), we saw the Court orders and mentions \"June 2\" maybe date of decree? Not sure. The Opinion and Order likely has the decree text. We need to identify all decrees. The decree appears to be the \"Preliminary Injunction\" granted. The decree likely entered on a specific date (maybe 8/6/25? That's the filing date). But the decree date is likely the date the order was issued, which might be 8/6/25? The document shows \"Filed 08/06/25\". The order may have been issued on that date.\n\nAdditionally, there might be other decrees like \"stay\" of terminations. But that is part of the preliminary injunction.\n\nWe need to extract:\n\n- Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: substantive obligations imposed by any decree: e.g., Defendants are enjoined from implementing terminations, shall not further terminate/suspend/cancel grants, etc. Also stay orders.\n\n- Dates_of_All_Decrees: date the decree was entered: likely 08/06/25. Also maybe other decrees? The decree might include \"stay\" as part of the decree: \"The Court ORDERS... that Defendants... are hereby STAYED from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations...\". That is part of decree.\n\n- How_Long_Decrees_will_Last: duration terms: \"until the Court orders otherwise\" or \"until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction\". Also maybe \"stay\" lasts until the Court orders otherwise. So we need to list durations with corresponding decree.\n\nThus we need to read more of the decree to capture all obligations and durations. The decree is likely in the same document \"Opinion and Order\". We need to find the section that enumerates the decree items. We saw part of it in step 73: lines 1-3 show the orders. That contains all obligations. Also step 73 includes the stay. We need to capture all obligations and durations.\n\nWe need to parse the decree text. Let's read more of the Opinion and Order around the decree section. The snippet in step 73 shows the decree items 1-3 and the stay. Also later there might be more items beyond 3. Let's see if there's more items after 3. The snippet ends at 3 and continues. Let's read more tokens around 43300-43747? Already read 43300-43747. That includes some. But maybe the decree items 1-3 are all. The decree items 1-3 are the obligations. After that, the stay order is separate.\n\nWe need to capture the obligations:\n\n1. Defendants’ April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs’ previously approved grants was unlawful and Defendants are enjoined from implementing those terminations as to grants awarded to either Plaintiffs Oregon Council for the Humanities d/b/a Oregon Humanities or the Federation of State Humanities Councils, including all member Councils of the Federation;\n\n2. Defendants shall not further terminate, suspend, or cancel Plaintiffs’ grants approved as of April 2, 2025, absent cause specified in 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7) or further Order of the Court;\n\n3. Defendants shall not obligate, loan, encumber, disburse, or otherwise dispose of the funds committed to Plaintiffs, including the member Councils of the Federation, through grants approved as of April 2, 2025, except as to Plaintiffs.\n\nAlso the stay order: \"The Court ORDERS, under 5 U.S.C § 705, that Defendants National Endowment for the Humanities, National Council on the Humanities, and Michael McDonald are hereby STAYED from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs’ grants and from disbursing, encumbering, loaning, granting, or otherwise disposing of the funds committed to Plaintiffs, including the member Councils of the Federation, through grants approved as of April 2, 2025, except as to Plaintiffs.\"\n\nAlso the decree durations: \"IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction and until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction:\" That indicates the injunction lasts until the Court orders otherwise or until parties agree in writing to amend/supersede/terminate.\n\nThus, for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last we need to list durations: \"until this Court orders otherwise\" and \"until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction.\"\n\nAdditionally, the stay may last until the Court orders otherwise. The stay might also have duration: \"until the Court orders otherwise\" (likely same as injunction). The stay may be indefinite.\n\nThus, we need to capture the decree date: The date of the decree is likely 08/06/25 (filed date). The decree might be entered on that date. Let's check the document for \"ORDERED\" date. The docket shows \"Filed 08/06/25\". The order may be issued on that date. We need to confirm the decree date. The snippet at start of step 73 shows \"Case 3:25-cv-00829-SI Document 39 Filed 08/06/25 Page 81 of 81\". That indicates the order is filed on 08/06/25. The decree likely entered on that date. So Dates_of_All_Decrees: \"08/06/25: Preliminary Injunction and Stay\".\n\nWe might also have other decrees in the document, but likely just this one.\n\nThus, we need to read more of the decree to capture obligations and durations. We have partial text. Let's read more around 43300-43747 again but maybe more. Already read 43300-43747. That covers the decree items 1-3. That should be enough.\n\nBut we need evidence for each obligation and duration. We can use the snippet from step 73 for obligations and stay. For durations, we need the portion that says \"until this Court orders otherwise\" and \"until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction:\" The snippet includes that. We need to capture that.\n\nThus, we can append to checklist:\n\n- Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: list 3 obligations and the stay.\n\n- Dates_of_All_Decrees: one entry: \"08/06/25: Preliminary Injunction and Stay\".\n\n- How_Long_Decrees_will_Last: two entries: \"until this Court orders otherwise: Preliminary Injunction\" and \"until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction\".\n\nBut we need to be careful to format: For Dates_of_All_Decrees values should be \"[date]: [decree]\". So we can produce \"08/06/25: Preliminary Injunction and Stay\" (decree description). For How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, format \"[duration]: [decree]\". So \"until this Court orders otherwise: Preliminary Injunction\" and \"until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction: Preliminary Injunction\".\n\nBut maybe we should include the stay as separate decree? The stay is part of the decree. The decree includes the stay order and injunction. So it's fine.\n\nNow we need to produce an append_checklist with entries.\n\nWe need evidence for each entry: text snippet from step 73. We need to provide source_document: \"Opinion and Order\". Location: page 80 maybe? The snippet shows \"PAGE 80 – OPINION AND ORDER\". Also \"Document 39\". We can use location \"PAGE 80\". For durations, the snippet includes \"until this Court orders otherwise\" and \"until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction\". This is present in the snippet. So we can use same evidence.\n\nThus, we will call append_checklist with patch containing 3 keys: Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, Dates_of_All_Decrees, How_Long_Decrees_will_Last.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each value. Provide text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe need to ensure we include all obligations: 3 items. And the stay. That is 4 obligations. We can treat them as separate entries under Significant_Terms_of_Decrees.\n\nThus, 4 entries.\n\nAlso for Dates_of_All_Decrees: 1 entry.\n\nAlso How_Long_Decrees_will_Last: 2 entries.\n\nThus total 7 entries.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't exceed token limit.\n\nLet's craft the evidence snippets:\n\nFrom step 73 text:\n\n```\nDefendants’ April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs’ previously approved grants \nwas unlawful and Defendants are enjoined from implementing those terminations as to grants \nawarded to either Plaintiffs Oregon Council for the Humanities d/b/a Oregon Humanities or the \nFederation of State Humanities Councils, including all member Councils of the Federation; \n2.  Defendants shall not further terminate, suspend, or cancel Plaintiffs’ grants \napproved as of April 2, 2025, absent cause specified in 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7) or further Order of \nthe Court; and \n3.  Defendants shall not obligate, loan, encumber, disburse, or otherwise dispose of \nthe funds committed to Plaintiffs, including the member Councils of the Federation, through \ngrants approved as of April 2, 2025, except as to Plaintiffs. \nAPA STAY \nThe Court ORDERS, under 5 U.S.C § 705, that Defendants National Endowment for the \nHumanities, National Council on the Humanities, and Michael McDonald are hereby STAYED \nfrom implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations of Plaintiffs’ grants and from disbursing, \nencumbering, loaning, granting, or otherwise disposing of the funds committed to Plaintiffs, \nincluding the member Councils of the Federation, through grants approved as of April 2, 2025, \nexcept as to Plaintiffs. \nPAGE 80 – OPINION AND ORDER \n...\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiffs’ Motion for a 5 U.S.C. § 705 Stay \nand Preliminary Injunction (ECF 7), as stated in this Opinion and\n```\n\nand the earlier part of decree:\n\n```\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiffs’ Motion for a 5 U.S.C. § 705 Stay \nand Preliminary Injunction (ECF 7), as stated in this Opinion and\n```\n\nWe need the duration text:\n\nFrom step 73 earlier: \"and until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction:\" That is the duration.\n\nThus we can provide evidence snippet containing that part.\n\nThus, we need to get the exact text snippet for durations. We need to capture from step 73. The snippet includes that text earlier: In step 73, at the top we have:\n\n```\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiffs’ Motion for a 5 U.S.C. § 705 Stay and Preliminary Injunction (ECF 7), as stated in this Opinion and\n```\n\nBut the duration part appears after that: In step 73 snippet at the bottom: \"and until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction:\" Need to locate that text. The snippet might be in the earlier part of the decree. Let's scroll up a bit. At step 73, after the \"IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\" line, it continues with \"and until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction:\". That text may appear in the snippet. Yes, the snippet in step 73 includes that. So we can use that snippet for evidence.\n\nThus, for durations we can provide that snippet.\n\nAlso for decree date: The date 08/06/25 appears in the snippet: \"Case 3:25-cv-00829-SI Document 39 Filed 08/06/25 Page 81 of 81\". That can be evidence.\n\nThus, we can use location \"PAGE 81\" for date evidence.\n\nThus, we can proceed to append_checklist.\n\nLet's prepare the JSON.\n\nWe need to call append_checklist with patch

We have 4 values for Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, 1 date, 2 durations. Are there any missing? The snapshot indicates all keys have values. Need to verify if all relevant values present. The goal is to extract all checklist items from the documents. There could be more decrees in other documents (like the memorandum or other briefs). We should check if there are additional decrees in other documents. The checklist items: Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, Dates_of_All_Decrees, How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. The extracted values likely from the Opinion and Order. But we should check if other documents contain more decrees. For example, the memorandum might contain a \"preliminary injunction\" also. The opinion and order is the main decree. The memorandum may contain the same decree but not new. The complaint or other documents may mention other decrees (maybe settlement or consent decree). But likely only the Preliminary Injunction in the Opinion and Order. So 1 decree.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that Dates_of_All_Decrees includes the date of the decree, maybe also the day the order was issued? The date \"08/06/25\" is given. But does there also a date of the decree for the Preliminary Injunction? It might be \"June 6, 2025\" in the docket. That is captured.\n\nBut is there any other decree? The \"Order\" might contain a \"Consent Decree\" or \"Settlement Decree\" perhaps. But from search results, only \"preliminary injunction\" appears.\n\nWe should search for \"decree\" again to see if there are other matches beyond the one discovered. The search earlier found matches in the Opinion and Order and memorandum only. The memorandum match snippet didn't show a decree. The search for \"decree\" on all documents earlier found only those two. So likely only one decree.\n\nThus the extraction seems complete.\n\nBut we must ensure that we have appended all values. The last action appended 4 values for Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, 1 date, 2 durations. That seems fine.\n\nWe should verify if any value duplicates or if any missing.\n\nLet's check the Opinion and Order for \"preliminary injunction\" and \"stay\". The decree has multiple terms. We appended 4 significant terms. Are there others? The decree might also include \"stay\" for the defendants. Already included. Also might say \"the Court ORDERS\" etc. The decree may have additional orders like \"The Court ORDERS that defendants shall not...\" we captured. Might also include \"The Court ORDERS that the defendants' actions are restrained\". We have the 4 items.\n\nDates: \"08/06/25: Preliminary Injunction and Stay\". That's correct.\n\nHow_Long: \"until this Court orders otherwise\" and \"until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction\". That covers durations. Are there any other durations like \"for the term of the Preliminary Injunction\" etc. Might be \"until the Court orders otherwise\" covers.\n\nThus likely complete.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we must ensure that there is no \"Not Applicable\" scenario.

The snapshot says 3 keys filled. But we must ensure completeness. The checklist items: Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, Dates_of_All_Decrees, How_Long_Decrees_will_Last.\n\nWe need to check if there are multiple decrees beyond the preliminary injunction. The case may have multiple decrees: The preliminary injunction itself. Are there other decrees? Possibly a consent decree? Search for \"decree\" again. But earlier steps found only matches in those two documents. The preliminary injunction is the only decree. It might be a preliminary injunction, not a decree? But the term \"decree\" may appear in the text: \"the Court ORDERS, under 5 U.S.C § 705, that Defendants ... are hereby STAYED from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations...\". That is a stay, an order. It's not a decree. But the extraction used \"decree\" for the stay? They called \"decree\" but maybe they misinterpreted. The question: Are there any other decrees? Need to search \"decree\" again with context. But we saw only two documents containing \"decree\". Those are the memorandum and opinion. The memorandum likely contains the motion for preliminary injunction. That may have a clause: \"the Court grants in part ...\". The memorandum may mention \"decree\" in the context of \"decree\" as part of the motion? But the extraction shows only 4 significant terms from the order. But maybe there is a \"decree\" in the memorandum that the court is granting a preliminary injunction and staying the April 2, 2025 terminations. The order may refer to \"decree\" incorrectly. But the task is to extract all checklist items. We might have missed that the order contains a \"decree\" itself. The \"preliminary injunction\" may be considered a decree. The order has the \"preliminary injunction\". So the \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" only has \"08/06/25: Preliminary Injunction and Stay\". That seems correct. How_Long_Decrees_will_Last: extracted \"until this Court orders otherwise\" and \"until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction\". But maybe there are more duration statements. Need to search for \"until\" in the opinion and order beyond those matches. But the extraction includes matches 1 at 8926-9126 etc. But those matches were from other sections, not the injunction. Should verify the full text of the injunction section. The excerpt shows the injunction text starting at page 80. We should read that portion to confirm all duration statements. The \"preliminary injunction\" text includes the following: \"IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction and until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction:\" Then lists items. So the durations are \"until this Court orders otherwise\" and \"until such time as the parties agree in writing to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction\". So two durations. That matches the extraction. Are there other durations? Might be \"for a period of 90 days\" etc. But not present. So likely complete.\n\nWe need to verify if any other decrees exist. Search for \"decree\" again. Let's run a search with regex for \"decree\" in all documents.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"decree\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "decree", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10842, "completion_tokens": 792, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The extracted checklist from step 78 includes 4 Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, 1 Dates_of_All_Decrees, 2 How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. Check if any more decrees or terms? The documents include \"Opinion and Order\" with a preliminary injunction. There may be other decrees like \"consent decree\" but step 5 found none. But maybe there's a \"stayed\" order. Also maybe there is a \"temporary restraining order\" but not a decree. The definition of Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: substantive obligations imposed by any decree—what defendants are ordered to do or refrain from doing. The preliminary injunction includes orders, but also the stay. Could there be a separate order of stay that is a decree? The extracted terms mention \"stay\" but the term \"stay\" may be part of the order. But we extracted four items. Are there any other substantive obligations? We might need to read more of the Opinion and Order to ensure no other terms like \"Defendants must not ...\", \"Defendants must pay...\". We should review more sections. The snapshot shows we have many token ranges read. But maybe some pages not read contain additional terms. We need to ensure completeness. The policy: must extract all distinct values. Our current extraction may be incomplete if other terms exist. We need to check more of the document. The \"Opinion and Order\" has many pages; we have not visited all. We saw tokens 0-2000, 2872-3155, etc. But we haven't visited pages after 43747. Document is 43,747 tokens. We have visited up to 43747? The last visited is 43167-43747. That covers near end. So we have visited almost all? We have 39% coverage earlier, but after reading 35000-42000, we have coverage 39%. But that might not cover all pages. We have many ranges but still not full. We need to cover all. The policy says we can't stop until all keys filled or N/A. But we might have missed some terms.\n\nWe should search for \"order that\" or \"orders that\" or \"shall not\" to find more terms. But we already had some. Let's search for \"shall not\" in Opinion and Order. Use search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Opinion and Order\",\"pattern\":\"shall not\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion and Order", "pattern": "shall not", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8514, "completion_tokens": 561, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Step 79 stop. But then step 80 get_checklist shows 3/3 filled. Step 81 search shows more matches but likely not needed. Step 82 search for \"shall not\" again. Current status: 3/3 keys filled, no empty. So we should stop. But we must consider if any checklist items might still be missing: The checklist items are:\n\n- Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\n- Dates_of_All_Decrees\n- How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\n\nWe have entries for all. Are there any other decrees? The documents may have multiple decrees. But we have only one date: \"08/06/25: Preliminary Injunction and Stay\". How_long includes \"until this Court orders otherwise\" and \"until such time as the parties agree in writing...\" These might be sufficient. Could there be other decrees? Search for \"decree\" again. But Step 81 found only one match in Opinion and Order, but maybe there are other decrees like \"consent decree\" but earlier search found none. There might be a \"consent decree\" in the docket? But earlier search for \"consent decree\" found none. So likely all decrees captured.\n\nThus we can stop. The last step 79 indicated stop. But the system says we need to decide again. We should issue stop.\n\nBut we must output JSON only.\n\nThus final answer: {\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All checklist items have been fully extracted with evidence.\"}<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All checklist items have been fully extracted with evidence.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items have been fully extracted with evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7875, "completion_tokens": 353, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
