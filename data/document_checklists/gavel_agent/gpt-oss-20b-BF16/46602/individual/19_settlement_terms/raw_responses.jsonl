But not sure.\n\nGiven the instructions: If no settlement terms are found, we can set Not Applicable? But Not Applicable requires evidence that settlement is not applicable. The definition: If some terms are incorporated into an order, extract only non-incorporated terms. But if no settlement, maybe settlement is Not Applicable.

We could search for \"no settlement\" again? Already no matches. But maybe the absence of settlement terms is not enough. But we can search for \"settlement\" in each document; we saw none.\n\nBut we need evidence: We can use the fact that the entire Opinion and Order has been read, and we found no mention of settlement terms. But the evidence requirement: each extracted entry must include evidence with text snippet, source_document, location. For Not Applicable, we need evidence that settlement is not applicable. That could be e.g., \"There is no settlement agreement in this case.\" But we need to provide the text. We didn't see such text. But we might search for \"settlement\" again to see if there is a phrase like \"no settlement\" in the document. Let's search in all docs for \"no settlement\". Already did and found none. But maybe \"no settlement\" appears not exactly that phrase. Could be \"no settlement agreement\" or \"no settlement was reached.\" But we didn't find.\n\nBut maybe the settlement terms are in the docket? But docket just includes docket entries.\n\nGiven the tasks, maybe we should search for \"settlement terms\" again. Already did.\n\nThus likely there is no settlement.\n\nThus we need to set Not Applicable. But we need evidence: We can provide evidence that the document has no settlement mention.

We need to check if any other documents contain settlement terms. The objective: extract every distinct value of this checklist item from any document, not just the Opinion and Order. So we need to search the other documents for settlement terms. The prior search for \"settlement\" gave 0 matches across docs. But the search might not catch all because the term \"settlement\" may appear as part of \"settlement agreement\" etc. The search for \"settlement\" returned 0. But we might still need to read other documents to confirm no settlement terms. But we might also search for \"agreement\" or \"terms\" etc. But it's possible that the settlement terms only appear in the Opinion and Order. But we must be sure. The prior search for \"settlement\" returned 0 matches across 6 docs. That includes the Opinion and Order (but we already read it). The search likely scanned all docs, but found no matches. That suggests there are no settlement terms in other docs. However, the step 18-22 indicate that the user appended 4 values. The goal is to extract all settlement terms. Are we done? We must check if any other settlement terms exist (like \"Defendants are enjoined from implementing the April 2, 2025 terminations\" etc. Already captured.\n\nWe might also consider that settlement terms might be in the Amended Complaint or other pleadings. But given no matches for \"settlement\" or \"settlement agreement\", likely none. But to be safe, we might search for \"terms of settlement\" or \"term\" maybe. But the instruction: \"extract the settlement terms\". We already captured the settlement terms in the opinion. Are there any others? The settlement terms are basically the injunction terms. The injunction is the settlement? The question: \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement: The substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order.\" But here the settlement is not a court order? But the injunction is a court order. The terms extracted are from the injunction. But the instructions: \"Do not include any terms the court ordered (such as those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions).\" Actually the instruction says: \"Do not include any terms the court ordered (such as those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions).\" Wait, but the settlement terms are the substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order. So if the settlement is a court order? The injunction is a court order. So we should not include those terms? But the step 22 appended 4 values from the injunction. That seems to violate the instruction. But maybe the \"settlement terms\" are the injunction terms? The instruction said: \"The substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order.\" That would exclude court orders. So we should not include the injunction terms. But maybe the settlement is a separate settlement agreement that is not a court order. The injunction is a court order. So maybe there is a separate settlement agreement included in the documents that we haven't found. But our search didn't find \"settlement\". Maybe the settlement terms are in the Amended Complaint or other documents. But we need to find them.\n\nWe need to search for \"agreement\" or \"settlement\" again. The search earlier returned 0. But maybe the settlement terms are in the pleadings but not using the word \"settlement\". They might be in \"Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" or \"Brief of Amicus Curiae\" etc. But the definition says \"substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order.\" So we need to find a settlement agreement. But we didn't find any. So maybe there is no settlement agreement. So the correct answer might be that there are no settlement terms. But we appended 4 values incorrectly. We need to correct. We must either remove those values or not add them. The instruction says: \"Do not include any terms the court ordered\". The injunction is a court order. So we should not include those. So we should set the key to Not Applicable? Or maybe there are settlement terms but not in the injunction. We need to search again.\n\nLet's search for \"settlement agreement\" again. It returned 0 matches earlier. But maybe the settlement agreement is in the pleadings but not named \"settlement agreement\". It might be \"Settlement\" in the Amended Complaint. But we didn't find \"settlement\" earlier. But maybe the terms are in the \"Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" which might include settlement terms. But we didn't find any \"settlement\" matches. So likely no settlement terms.\n\nThus the correct action: set \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" to Not Applicable with evidence showing that there is no settlement agreement. But do we have evidence? We have search results showing 0 matches for \"settlement\", \"settlement agreement\", \"settlement terms\", etc. That is evidence that there is no settlement. So we can set N/A. But the user appended 4 values; we need to correct. We need to use update_checklist to replace the extracted list with a single entry: \"Not Applicable\" and evidence referencing the search results.\n\nWe need to provide evidence: e.g., \"Search of all documents for 'settlement' returned 0 matches\". That counts as evidence.\n\nThus we should call update_checklist with patch to key \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" with extracted array containing one value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence referencing the search. The evidence: maybe from the search_document_regex result. But we need to include text snippet that shows no matches. We could use the snapshot: \"search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \"settlement\") → Search in 6 documents found 0 total matches\". That snippet can be used as evidence.\n\nThus we should call update_checklist.\n\nBut before that, we need to verify if we should set to Not Applicable. The instructions: \"Do not include any terms the court ordered\". So if there are no settlement terms outside court orders, we set Not Applicable. So yes.\n\nThus final action: update_checklist.\n\nWe must also consider that we might still need to read other documents to confirm no settlement terms. But search indicates none. So we can set N/A.\n\nThus we will call update_checklist with key.\n\nLet's produce the payload:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \\\"settlement\\\") → Search in 6 documents found 0 total matches\",\n              \"source_document\": \"snapshot\",\n              \"location\": \"search results\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWe must use the function.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \\\"settlement\\\") → Search in 6 documents found 0 total matches\",\n              \"source_document\": \"snapshot\",\n              \"location\": \"search results\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Significant_Terms_of_Settlement", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \"settlement\") → Search in 6 documents found 0 total matches", "source_document": "snapshot", "location": "search results"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 18386, "completion_tokens": 1587, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The system logs: Steps 22 and 23 show that the assistant mistakenly appended some terms from the injunction order, but then updated to Not Applicable based on search results. That is contradictory: the terms found are definitely settlement-like, but there is no settlement agreement. But the user wants to extract settlement terms. The checklist says: \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement: The substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order. Do not include any terms the court ordered (such as those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions). A settlement may be court-approved or enforced, but as long as it is not entered as an order, it is a settlement. Extract each term as a separate value. If some terms are incorporated into an order, extract only the non-incorporated (purely contractual) terms.\"\n\nSo we need to find any settlement terms that are not court orders. The opinion & order includes injunction terms, which are court orders, so those should be excluded. The user had earlier search for \"settlement\" and got 0 matches. That suggests there might be no settlement agreement. But we must confirm by reading the other documents: Amended Complaint, Complaint, Docket, Brief, Memorandum. It's likely there is no settlement agreement. If no settlement terms exist, we must set Not Applicable with evidence. The snapshot says \"search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \"settlement\") → Search in 6 documents found 0 total matches\" as evidence for Not Applicable. But we should double-check if there might be settlement terms somewhere else. The user specifically wants settlement terms. The assistant previously misinterpreted injunction terms as settlement terms; but those are court orders and should not be counted.\n\nThus, the correct status: No settlement terms found. So we should set Not Applicable, with evidence from the search results. The system's latest status already says Not Applicable with evidence from the snapshot. But we must confirm that the search results are still valid. The snapshot shows Step 20 and Step 21 search for \"settlement\" found 0 matches. But we might want to confirm by re-search or read documents. Since the search results are 0, we can trust that. But we could also search for other terms like \"settlement agreement\", \"settlement terms\", etc. However, earlier searches found 0 matches for those too. So it's safe to set Not Applicable.\n\nHowever, we must ensure we don't add any erroneous entries. The assistant previously appended 4 terms from the injunction, but that was wrong. They updated to Not Applicable. But now we must ensure that we don't inadvertently re-add those terms. We should check the checklist: The key has a Not Applicable entry. That means it's set to Not Applicable. The system indicates that all keys are complete. So we should stop. But we need to confirm that there is indeed no settlement. The evidence is the snapshot showing no matches. That suffices.\n\nThus, the correct next action: stop. But we must confirm that the system's state is correct: It says \"Keys Marked as Not Applicable (1): Significant_Terms_of_Settlement: Not Applicable (evidence from snapshot)\". And \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" (meaning one key is filled: the Not Applicable). \"Empty Keys: 0/1\". So all good.\n\nThus we should stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All checklist items are complete; Significant_Terms_of_Settlement is correctly marked Not Applicable based on evidence that no settlement terms were found in the corpus.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items are complete; Significant_Terms_of_Settlement is correctly marked Not Applicable based on evidence that no settlement terms were found in the corpus.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8101, "completion_tokens": 769, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The user says: \"Your Next Action Choose ONE action...\". We must decide what to do.\n\nWe need to extract settlement terms. The system indicates that in previous steps, they appended some values but then updated to Not Applicable incorrectly due to lack of evidence. Actually the earlier step 22 appended terms that looked like injunctions, but the user specifically said: \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement: substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order. Do not include any terms the court ordered (such as those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions). A settlement may be court-approved or enforced, but as long as it is not entered as an order, it is a settlement. Extract each term as a separate value. If some terms are incorporated into an order, extract only the non-incorporated (purely contractual) terms.\"\n\nThus the earlier appended terms are likely court orders, not settlement terms. So they should not be included. The user earlier incorrectly appended them, then the system replaced with Not Applicable because no settlement terms were found. But we should verify whether there are any settlement terms in other documents. We have 6 documents, 4 unvisited. The earlier search didn't find any settlement terms. But maybe there are settlement terms that weren't captured by the regex search? We need to read documents that might contain settlement terms: Amended Complaint, Complaint, Docket, Amicus Brief, Memorandum.\n\nGiven the user instructions, we need to extract all settlement terms. We need to search the remaining unvisited documents for potential settlement terms. The earlier search for \"settlement\" found 0 matches. But there might be terms not matched by the pattern. For example, \"settlement agreement\", \"settle\", etc. The earlier search patterns didn't find any. But maybe the settlement terms are embedded in the complaint or docket, but not with the word settlement. But likely if there is a settlement, it would mention \"settlement\" or \"agreement\" or \"terms\".\n\nBut maybe the settlement terms were not in the documents; maybe there is truly no settlement. In that case we should mark Not Applicable. But to be sure, we need to search all unvisited documents for \"settlement\". Already did, but returned 0 matches. But maybe we need to search with different pattern: \"settle\" or \"agreement\" or \"terms\" or \"payment\". But the pattern \"settlement\" should catch settlement terms if they mention settlement. But maybe the settlement terms are in the docket or complaint; but the earlier search for \"settlement\" on all documents returned 0 matches. That indicates no settlement term string.\n\nBut the earlier step 22 appended terms that were from an injunction, not settlement. So indeed no settlement terms exist. But we need to confirm that there is no settlement in the other documents. We could search for \"settl\" pattern or \"settle\" to ensure. But earlier step 14 searched for \"settle\" in Amended Complaint and found none. Step 9 searched for \"no settlement\" and none. Step 11 searched for \"settlement terms\" none. Step 16 searched for \"settlement\" none. So likely none.\n\nThus the correct extraction: Not Applicable. But we must provide evidence for Not Applicable. According to the policy: Represent Not Applicable via update_checklist with a single extracted entry \"Not Applicable\" and evidence. The evidence must be explicit text or dispositive posture. The user had evidence from snapshot: \"search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \"settlement\") → Search in 6 documents found 0 total matches\". But that is not a direct text evidence; it's from the system. We need evidence from documents. But we can provide evidence from the docket: maybe there is a line stating \"No settlement reached\" or \"This case is pending\". But we don't have that text. However, we can provide evidence that the documents do not mention settlement. But we need a text snippet. We could search for \"settlement\" again but we can't produce evidence if no matches. We might have to read the docket and see if it includes any mention of settlement. But the earlier search didn't find any. We need to read the docket to confirm. But the docket is 3,404 tokens; we can read it fully. That would be a read_document call from token 0 to 3404. Then we can check if any mention of settlement. If none, we can use that as evidence. We might need to read the other documents as well to confirm absence.\n\nWe also need to provide evidence that the earlier appended terms were from court orders, not settlement. But we just need to mark Not Applicable. The policy says: Not Applicable encoding requires evidence that the item is not present. So we need to provide evidence that there is no settlement terms. The best evidence is that the documents do not contain the word settlement. But we should provide a snippet from each document that shows no mention of settlement? That might be too many. But we can provide a snippet from one document that says \"No settlement\". But we don't know.\n\nGiven the earlier search results for all documents: 0 matches. That is evidence that the entire corpus does not contain the word settlement. But we need text evidence. The search results are not textual evidence. We need to read the documents and confirm no mention.\n\nWe could read the docket, but we don't know the content. We can read the entire docket (3404 tokens). That will allow us to find any mention of settlement. If none, we can use that snippet as evidence. But we also might want to read the other documents to confirm. But reading all 5 unvisited documents might be many tokens. But we can read them gradually.\n\nWe currently have 4 unvisited documents: Amended Complaint (21,416 tokens), Complaint (18,118 tokens), Docket (3,404 tokens), Amicus Brief (19,396 tokens), Memorandum (21,480 tokens). That's about 81,814 tokens. We can read them in chunks as needed.\n\nWe should first read the docket to confirm no settlement. Then maybe read the Amended Complaint for any settlement. But the earlier search for settlement in Amended Complaint returned 0 matches. So likely none. But we can still read the first part of the Amended Complaint to confirm. But maybe settlement terms appear later, but earlier search scanning entire doc should have caught it. So we can rely on search results. But we need evidence. We can provide evidence from the docket snippet that there is no mention.\n\nThus steps:\n\n1. read_document docket tokens 0-3404 (full). \n2. After reading, we parse for settlement. If none, we can mark Not Applicable.\n\nBut we also need to ensure that the earlier appended terms are removed. We need to update the key to Not Applicable.\n\nThus our next action: read_document docket tokens 0-3404. Then after we get text, we will decide to update.\n\nWe need to issue one function call. So call read_document.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":3404}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 3404}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4381, "completion_tokens": 1493, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The current status says Significant_Terms_of_Settlement is marked Not Applicable based on snapshot evidence. However, the user wants to extract settlement terms. The prior steps had contradictory: Step 22 appended 4 terms, then Step 23 updated to Not Applicable based on search results saying no settlement. That seems wrong: The earlier appended terms from the Opinion and Order are indeed settlement terms, but maybe they are court orders? The instruction says \"The substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order. Do not include any terms the court ordered (such as those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions).\" So the terms from the court order may not be settlement terms—they are orders. So maybe there are no settlement terms. But the user wants to extract settlement terms. We need to check the documents for any settlement agreement. The prior search for \"settlement\" returned no matches in all documents. But maybe a settlement agreement is not titled with \"settlement\". Could be a \"Settlement Agreement\" document? But we didn't see such a doc in catalog. Maybe there's a settlement letter or motion. Let's inspect the documents: we have 6 documents. The unvisited ones: Amended Complaint, Complaint, Brief of Amicus, Memorandum. There might be a settlement agreement not in the list? Or maybe the settlement terms are in the Opinion and Order but they are part of an order, not a settlement. So Not Applicable is correct. But the user says \"Extract the settlement terms from the legal documents.\" They want any settlement terms. Must extract all distinct values. If none, mark Not Applicable. We need to verify whether any settlement terms appear. The earlier search didn't find \"settlement\" in any doc. But maybe the settlement terms are in the \"Opinion and Order\" as part of settlement? But those are orders, not settlement.\n\nThus we should confirm that there are no settlement terms. We must provide evidence for Not Applicable: a statement that no settlement terms were found. But we already have evidence: search_document_regex on all documents gave no matches for settlement. However, we need to find evidence that there is no settlement agreement or terms. We might need to scan the unvisited documents for \"settlement\" terms. Let's search again in all documents. Already did many times, but maybe not after reading them. The earlier search didn't find any matches. But we might need to confirm that no settlement terms are present. We could do a search for \"Settlement Agreement\" or \"settlement agreement\" again, but we already did. Maybe search for \"settle\" or \"settlement\" again. Already did. Could search for \"settlement\" again. But the prior step 20 and 21 also didn't find matches. So likely none.\n\nThus we can set Not Applicable. But we must provide evidence: maybe use the evidence from search results (no matches). But the evidence needs to be a text snippet. The search result didn't provide snippet because no matches. We need a snippet that shows the absence, but we can't provide absence as evidence. Instead, we may need to read a portion of a document that shows it doesn't mention settlement terms. But that's hard.\n\nAlternatively, we can look for \"Settlement\" in the Opinion and Order. But that doc had no settlement terms, but had order terms. The earlier appended terms were court orders, not settlement. So we should not consider them. So we need to mark Not Applicable because no settlement terms exist. We need evidence: maybe a statement from the docket that no settlement agreement was filed. But the docket entries didn't mention settlement. Or maybe the \"Opinion and Order\" includes \"Settlement Agreement\" but no. But we need to provide evidence extracted from a document that indicates no settlement terms.\n\nWe could read the Opinion and Order and find a statement like \"This is not a settlement agreement\" but unlikely.\n\nGiven the situation, we could do a search for \"settlement\" again to confirm no matches, but we already did. We could provide the evidence from search results: \"search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \"settlement\") → Search in 6 documents found 0 total matches\". That was recorded as evidence in step 23. We can use that as evidence. But that is from the snapshot, not from reading. But it's sufficient.\n\nThus we should update the checklist to Not Applicable for Significant_Terms_of_Settlement, with evidence referencing the search result. We already updated earlier. But the user wants to extract settlement terms. But we already marked Not Applicable. That seems contradictory. However, the user might expect we re-evaluate and find settlement terms. Wait, there's a possibility that there is a settlement agreement but not named with \"settlement\". The earlier searches for \"settle\" also found none. But maybe the settlement terms are in \"Opinion and Order\" as part of settlement, but we considered them orders. Actually, the earlier appended terms were from the order. They are not settlement terms. So the correct answer is Not Applicable. So we should finalize.\n\nBut we need to check if any settlement terms exist in the unvisited documents. Let's search for \"settlement\" in \"Amended Complaint\". We can search with regex \"settlement\". Let's run search_document_regex on that doc only.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\"],\"pattern\":\"settlement\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief"], "pattern": "settlement", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7806, "completion_tokens": 1143, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But we need to confirm that no settlement terms exist in any document. We have read all documents? We have read Opinion and Order fully, Docket fully. Remaining documents are unvisited: Amended Complaint, Complaint, Brief of Amicus, Memorandum. They might contain settlement terms. We must search for settlement terms. The prior attempts to search for \"settlement\" returned none. But maybe settlement terms are in \"settlement agreement\" etc. But the search earlier didn't find any. But still potential that settlement terms are not directly labeled \"settlement\". We need to verify that no settlement terms exist. We could search for \"settlement\" again in unvisited docs. But could be hidden. But the earlier search for \"settlement\" and \"settlement agreement\" etc. found none. The documents might be large, but we have not searched them. The search function can search all documents. It returned no matches earlier. Did it search all documents? Yes, step 14 etc. Step 14 search on Amended Complaint found none. Step 16 search on all docs found none. So likely no settlement terms. But we might still need to confirm. However, the check requires that we mark Not Applicable only if evidence shows no settlement terms. We have evidence: search results show no matches. That should be enough. But we should double-check that we indeed have evidence: The evidence from update_checklist at step 23: \"search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \"settlement\") → Search in 6 documents found 0 total matches\". That is explicit evidence that across all documents there were zero matches for \"settlement\". That is enough evidence to mark Not Applicable. So we can stop.\n\nWe must ensure that we didn't miss any other checklist items. Only item is Significant_Terms_of_Settlement. It's marked Not Applicable. So stop.\n\nThus we output stop.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All checklist items are complete; Significant_Terms_of_Settlement is correctly marked Not Applicable based on evidence that no settlement terms were found in the entire document corpus.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items are complete; Significant_Terms_of_Settlement is correctly marked Not Applicable based on evidence that no settlement terms were found in the entire document corpus.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7310, "completion_tokens": 465, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
