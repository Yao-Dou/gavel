We have seen two matches from search_document_regex: one in Memorandum with \"Filed 06/25/25\". That is a filing date. But we need to confirm the exact value: \"06/25/25\" is likely 06/25/2025? But maybe it's 06/25/2025 or 06/25/2025? The filing date is a calendar date. The match shows \"Filed 06/25/25\". That could be ambiguous: 06/25/25 (month/day/year). The year is 2025? Might be 2025 or 2025? Usually docket entries show 06/25/25 meaning June 25, 2025. But we need to extract the date as the string \"06/25/25\". But we might also consider that it could be 6/25/2025. But the format is \"06/25/25\". We'll extract exactly that string.\n\nAdditionally, we should search for filing dates in other documents. The other documents include Complaint, Amended Complaint, Docket, Opinion and Order, Brief. Likely the Complaint will have a filing date. The docket might have docket entries with dates. The Opinion and Order may have date of entry. But the filing date is the date the lawsuit was first filed/initiated. That is typically on the Complaint or Amended Complaint. So we should search for \"Filed\" or \"Filed on\" patterns in those documents. We have already searched all documents with regex pattern. It found 2 matches only, both inside Memorandum. That suggests that the other documents may not have that pattern. But maybe the pattern didn't catch because the format is different: maybe \"Filed: 01/01/2020\" or \"Filed 01/01/2020\" etc. But the regex covers many forms. Did it search all documents? Yes, we used search_document_regex on all documents. It found 2 matches total. So likely no other filing date mentions. But the filing date might be in the Complaint or Amended Complaint but not matched. But the pattern might not have matched if the docket uses \"Date of Filing\" etc. But we didn't search for \"Filed\" inside Complaint? The regex covered \"Filed\\s*(on)?\\s*([A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4})\". It covers month/day/year with two-digit year. It matched \"Filed 06/25/25\". It would also match \"Filed 06/25/2025\"? It only matches 4-digit year? Wait pattern: **([A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4})**. This expects 4-digit year. So \"06/25/25\" has 2-digit year, would not match. But the match shows \"Filed 06/25/25\". So maybe the pattern was slightly different? The pattern might have been: \"(?i)Filed\\s*(on)?\\s*([A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4})\". That would not match 06/25/25. But maybe the actual text had 06/25/2025 but the snippet truncated year? Wait snippet shows \"Filed 06/25/25\". Maybe the actual text had \"Filed 06/25/2025\" but truncated due to token display? Or maybe the docket uses \"06/25/25\" to denote 2025. But anyway, we need to extract the filing date. The snippet shows \"Case 3:25-cv-00829-SI Document 8 Filed 06/25/25 Page 9 of 37\". So we can extract \"06/25/25\" as the filing date.\n\nBut we also need to consider that the Complaint itself might have a filing date. Usually a complaint includes \"Filed: 06/25/2025\" or \"Filed 06/25/2025\". But the regex didn't catch. Maybe the filing date appears earlier in the document before the snippet we saw. But we could search again for \"Filed\" pattern in specific documents: Complaint, Amended Complaint, Docket. We can use search_document_regex on those documents separately to see if any matches. But we have the catalog: we can call search_document_regex with doc_names: [\"Complaint\", \"Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", \"Docket\", \"Opinion and Order\", \"Brief of Amicus Curiae ...\"].\n\nBut we should be careful: the regex pattern might miss the filing date if it's formatted differently, e.g., \"Filed: 06/25/2025 (Petition)\". But we can broaden the regex: maybe search for \"Filed\\s*[:\\s]\\s*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\". But we can use the same pattern.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on doc_names: Complaint, Amended Complaint, Docket, Opinion and Order, Brief. Use the same pattern. Then we can capture any matches.\n\nWe also need to ensure we don't re-read tokens already visited. The Memorandum has partial coverage. We have read tokens 3484-3684 and 8490-8690. The \"Filed 06/25/25\" appears within the first match tokens 3484-3684. That's partially visited. But we can read the entire match again or confirm the evidence. But we need to provide evidence. We should include the snippet with the date. We have snippet in the search result. That snippet includes the date. We can record that as evidence. But we might want to read the exact token range that includes the date to capture the exact text. But we can use the snippet from the search result; it's part of the evidence. But we need location: page 9 of 37. So we can set location \"Page 9 of 37\" or \"Document 8\". We'll include that.\n\nNow, we need to extract all distinct filing dates. Currently we have one: 06/25/25. But maybe there are multiple filings: e.g., the docket may list multiple entries with dates of filing. But the filing date is the first filing of the lawsuit. That might be the same across all documents: the date the Complaint was filed. So we might only have one distinct value. But we should confirm if the Complaint or Amended Complaint have a filing date. The Complaint might have a different date if filed earlier. But the docket shows the \"Filed\" date. But we need to check these documents.\n\nWe should run search_document_regex for \"Filed\" pattern across all relevant documents.

We have partially visited the Memorandum, we saw a match with \"Filed 06/25/25\". That is a filing date. But maybe other documents also have filing dates. We need to find all distinct filing dates across all documents. We should search again across all documents or read more of the memorandum. The memorandum already has a match. The other documents likely have filing dates, e.g., Complaint probably has \"Filed 06/25/25\" or similar. We should use search_document_regex on all documents again with pattern for dates. But we already did that and found only 2 matches in the memorandum. But maybe the regex didn't catch other dates because the pattern didn't match the format in other docs. We could search with a more general date pattern: e.g., \"Filed\\s+(?:on\\s+)?(?:[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4})\". The earlier pattern is fine. But maybe other docs have \"Filed\" with a month name or numeric? The regex should catch. Maybe the other docs have no \"Filed\" text. Might be docket entries. The Docket might have \"Filed: 06/25/2025\" etc. The Complaint might have a docket entry at the top. We need to ensure we capture all distinct filing dates.\n\nWe should search all documents again for \"Filed\" pattern. But we already did search_document_regex on all documents and found 2 matches only. It might be that other documents have no \"Filed\" or that the pattern missed them because they use a different format like \"Filed: 2025-06-25\" or similar with hyphen. We can broaden the regex to include hyphen separated dates or other. But instructions: use search_document_regex to jump to likely sections; then confirm with read_document. So we can search for \"Filed\" alone maybe. Or search for \"Filed\" across all docs. Let's attempt search_document_regex with pattern \"(?i)Filed\" to find all occurrences. That might produce many matches but we only need the date. Then we can read the surrounding context to capture the date. We'll likely get many matches; we need to parse them. But this is the next action. We can do a search_document_regex on \"all\" documents for pattern \"(?i)Filed\\s*(?:on\\s*)?([A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}|\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2})\".\n\nLet's do that. Use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern as described, flags [\"IGNORECASE\", \"MULTILINE\", \"DOTALL\"], top_k maybe 20, context_tokens maybe 200. That will give matches.\n\nWe should check if the pattern includes numeric year 25 vs 2025. In memorandum, it was \"06/25/25\". That is two-digit year. Our pattern with \\d{4} won't match that. So we need to also allow two-digit year: \\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4}. So pattern: \\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4}.\n\nThus pattern: \"(?i)Filed\\s*(on\\s*)?([A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4}|\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2})\".\n\nLet's use that. We'll search all docs. That should find matches. Then we will read the context to extract date. That will produce evidence. Then we will append the extracted values. We need distinct values. We'll likely get just \"06/25/25\" maybe also \"06/25/25\" from other docs.

We have search results with many matches. We have seen matches in Amended Complaint: multiple matches showing \"Filed 06/11/25\" and \"Filed 06/25/25\" in other documents. Likely each document may have multiple filing dates. We must extract all distinct values. We should get evidence for each.\n\nWe need to read the documents around the matches to confirm the dates. We already have matches in Amended Complaint: tokens 0-110 snippet shows \"Filed 06/11/25\". That's one date. In Memorandum, tokens 3484-3684 snippet shows \"Document 8 Filed 06/25/25\". That's another date. Are there other dates? Possibly in Complaint or others. Let's search again for \"Filed\" maybe other dates. But we already had search 4 that found 100 matches. We saw some matches in the other docs. We need to extract unique distinct filing dates across all documents. We have at least two: \"06/11/25\" and \"06/25/25\". Possibly other dates like 06/25/24? But let's search quickly. We can run search_document_regex again but narrower? But we already have results for all docs. We need to parse the matches for each doc. We saw matches for \"Amended Complaint\" with date 06/11/25. In \"Memorandum\" with 06/25/25. There may be others in \"Complaint\" and \"Opinion and Order\" and \"Brief of Amicus\". Let's search in those docs for \"Filed\". But we can call search_document_regex with doc_names specifying those. Let's search for pattern again but maybe limit to all docs. But we already have results from step 4 for all docs: 100 matches, but only some displayed. Likely other docs also contain \"Filed\". Should we read each doc's first page? We can read the beginning of each doc to capture \"Filed\" line. Usually first page contains docket info.\n\nWe should read the first 200 tokens of each doc to capture any \"Filed\" info.\n\nBut we saw that \"Amended Complaint\" first 110 tokens already had \"Filed 06/11/25\". That is captured. For \"Complaint\" first 110 tokens? Let's read doc \"Complaint\" start. Also \"Opinion and Order\" first 110 tokens? \"Brief of Amicus\" first 110 tokens? \"Memorandum\" first 110 tokens? \"Docket\" maybe contains \"Filed\" but maybe not. Let's read the start of each.\n\nWe need to do read_document for each doc at start tokens 0-200. That will give us evidence.\n\nWe have to ensure no duplicates: list unique dates.\n\nAlso check if there are other filing dates like \"Filed 06/11/25\" appears multiple times but we only need distinct values. So we need to extract \"06/11/25\" and \"06/25/25\". Also maybe \"06/11/25\" appears again in other docs; we can still include evidence each time? But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So each distinct value only once. But evidence should be from the text that shows that value. So we can include evidence from one doc that shows each date.\n\nThus we need to append or update checklist with two entries: \"06/11/25\" with evidence from Amended Complaint page 1, and \"06/25/25\" with evidence from Memorandum page 2 maybe. If other docs also show same dates, we could still provide evidence but no need duplicate.\n\nWe'll need to read the start of each doc as needed.\n\nBut we have already read some portions. For \"Amended Complaint\", we have snippet with date. For \"Memorandum\", we have snippet with date. We don't have evidence for \"Complaint\" or others, but we might not need if not new date.\n\nBut we might need to confirm that there are no other distinct dates. To be safe, we can read the first 200 tokens of each doc and check if \"Filed\" appears with different date.\n\nLet's plan: call read_document for each doc: \"Complaint\" tokens 0-200, \"Opinion and Order\" tokens 0-200, \"Brief of Amicus\" tokens 0-200, \"Memorandum\" tokens 0-200, \"Docket\" tokens 0-200. But we already have some of them partially visited, but not the first 200 for all. For \"Complaint\", we have 0-110 visited; we need 110-200. For others, we may need to read 0-200 if not visited.\n\nWe can read all in one call? No, we can only call read_document once per turn. We must choose one action. We need to extract all distinct dates. We might need to read multiple docs, but we can pick one at a time. Since we have already evidence for two distinct dates, we can append them now, but we need to confirm no more distinct dates. But maybe there are others. But given search results, we saw 100 matches and only two distinct dates. It's likely only those two. But to be safe, we should read at least the first pages of each doc. But we can only do one action now. We could choose to read one doc that we haven't looked at yet to verify if there's a new date. The doc with highest chance of new date maybe \"Opinion and Order\" or \"Brief of Amicus\". Let's pick \"Opinion and Order\" first page.\n\nThus next action: read_document for \"Opinion and Order\" tokens 0-200. Then after reading, we will parse. But we also need to add the extracted dates.\n\nBut maybe we should first append the two dates. But we could also decide to read documents before adding. The instructions: after each read or search, we need to append the extracted values. So we should read, then append.\n\nThus next action: read_document for \"Opinion and Order\" tokens 0-200.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Opinion and Order\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Opinion and Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8928, "completion_tokens": 1295, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Also 05/15/25 appears multiple times.\n\n- Possibly other documents: Docket, Opinion and Order, etc. We haven't read Docket or Opinion and Order. Docket might have a filing date. Opinion and Order likely has a date of order, not filing. Only filing dates of documents in docket? The docket might list the date the complaint was filed. But likely already captured in Complaint. We should check Docket for filing date. Also Opinion and Order might have date of order, but not filing. The task: extract filing date of lawsuit, which is the date the lawsuit was first filed. That's likely the Complaint or Amended Complaint first filed? The filing date of each document may vary. But the filing date of each document is the date it was filed. The checklist item \"Filing_Date\" likely refers to the lawsuit's filing date. Maybe just one value: the earliest filing date. But spec says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we include all filing dates. So include all dates seen.\n\nThus we need to gather:\n\n- 05/15/25 (Complaint)\n- 06/11/25 (Amended Complaint)\n- 06/25/25 (Memorandum)\n- 07/07/25 (Brief)\n\nAlso maybe Docket has a filing date?

Actually memorandum shows \"Filed 06/25/25\" in step 8 match 1. Also Brief shows \"Filed 07/07/25\". Also Docket shows entries with dates. But the filing date refers to the lawsuit first filed/initiated with the court. That's likely the Complaint date: 05/15/25. However we should gather all distinct filing dates found across documents. The question: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document\". So we must list all distinct dates that appear. That includes Complaint filed 05/15/25, Amended Complaint filed 06/11/25, Memorandum filed 06/25/25, Brief filed 07/07/25, maybe others.\n\nAlso the docket entries show filings of other documents but we only care about lawsuit first filing? But spec says \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" That is likely the Complaint date. But we must extract distinct values found in any document; if other documents show filing dates of other documents, those are not the lawsuit initiation? But they still contain dates. However the definition suggests we should capture the filing date of the lawsuit. So only the initial filing date. But if there are multiple possible dates due to different courts? In this case, the Complaint date is 05/15/25. But we might also have docket entry for \"Complaint. Filing fee\". That also indicates the complaint filing date. But it's same 05/15/25. So we likely have one unique value.\n\nBut the search results also show Amended Complaint filed 06/11/25. That is later; not the first filing. So not relevant. But the instruction says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" That might include the amended complaint date. But the definition is the lawsuit first filed/initiated. So we should only take the initial filing date. But if there is evidence that the lawsuit was first filed earlier than the Complaint? Unlikely.\n\nThus we should extract a single value: 05/15/25.\n\nBut we need evidence from documents. We have evidence from Complaint (tokens 0-200 shows \"Filed 05/15/25\") and from Docket entry. Also from Amended Complaint indicates 06/11/25 but not first filing. But we could choose to exclude it.\n\nBut the instruction might be ambiguous. But I think better to include only filing date of lawsuit. That is Complaint file date.\n\nThus we need to append that entry with evidence.\n\nWe must also maybe confirm that no other earlier filing date exists? Search for \"Filed\" earlier in the docket: the docket has a line 2025-05-15 for Complaint. That matches. So only one.\n\nThus next action is append_checklist with key Filing_Date, one entry with value \"05/15/25\" and evidence from Complaint and Docket.\n\nAlso we need to ensure the evidence includes text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe have token ranges. For Complaint tokens 0-200 snippet: we saw \"Case 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 1 of 34\". So evidence: text snippet, source \"Complaint\", location \"tokens 0-200\" or maybe \"Page 1\". For Docket, token 0-178 snippet: we saw \"Complaint. Filing fee in the amount of $405 collected. ... (Entered: 05/15/2025)\". That also indicates filing date. But we can include that too.\n\nThus we will append checklist for Filing_Date with two evidence entries? But we need each extracted entry must include evidence. For a single extracted value, we can provide multiple evidence pieces. Yes each entry must have evidence array. We can provide one or multiple evidences.\n\nThus produce append_checklist patch.\n\nLet's craft JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"05/15/25\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 1 of 34\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-200\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Complaint.

But other documents may also mention \"Filed 06/11/25\" etc. The requirement: \"Filing_Date: The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So we should only record the initial filing date: 05/15/25. So we already have that value. But the initial filing date appears in Complaint and Docket. We might not need to add Amended Complaint's date. But we must ensure no duplicate.\n\nWe have one extracted value. But the checklist might expect a single value. We already appended 1 value. But we need to confirm if any other document might have a different date that could be considered the filing date. For example, the Complaint might have multiple docket entries? But likely only one. The Docket shows the same date. The Amended Complaint and others show later dates. So we probably only need 05/15/25.\n\nThus the checklist key Filing_Date is complete with 1 value. We should check if any other documents have a different date maybe 05/15/25 as well. But we might also have 05/15/2025 in long form. But we need to capture distinct values; 05/15/25 and 05/15/2025 are considered distinct? They are same date but different representation. Might need to standardize. We should include both? But typical extraction would include both representation but they refer to same date. But we might consider them distinct values. However the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if representation differs, they are distinct. We have 05/15/25 and 05/15/2025. We have evidence from Complaint: \"Case 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25\" and from Docket: \"Complaint. Filing fee in the amount of $405 collected. ... (Entered: 05/15/2025)\". So we should record both distinct values: \"05/15/25\" and \"05/15/2025\". But the date is same. But it's distinct representation. Probably we should include both.\n\nThus we need to append the second value. Use append_checklist with key Filing_Date, value \"05/15/2025\" with evidence from Docket. We already appended \"05/15/25\". So we need to add second.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"05/15/2025\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"(Entered: 05/15/2025)\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-178\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "05/15/2025", "evidence": [{"text": "(Entered: 05/15/2025)", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 0-178"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10755, "completion_tokens": 826, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Already extracted 05/15/2025 from Docket and 05/15/2025 from Complaint. But there might be other filing dates: e.g., Amended Complaint filed 06/11/25. Also docket shows multiple filings: 05/15/2025 Complaint, 06/11/2025 Amended Complaint, 06/25/2025 Motion for Preliminary Injunction, etc. We need all distinct filing dates of lawsuit first filed/initiated. Usually filing date refers to original complaint filing. But maybe include all docket entries that indicate filing of documents? The requirement: \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" That would be the initial complaint filing date. That is 05/15/2025. But also there might be other initial filings like the Amended Complaint filed 06/11/25, but that's not the first. So only one date. But we have two extracted values: 05/15/2025 (two sources). But duplicate. We need unique values. We should deduplicate: only one distinct value. But we have two entries, but they are same. We should consolidate: keep one entry? We can keep one. Since we have duplicate evidence, we may want to append one and then update to replace duplicate? The system says each entry must have evidence. We can keep two entries with evidence from two documents. Both represent same date but different documents. That might be acceptable as separate entries. But requirement says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\". Distinct value is the date itself; but we could provide multiple entries for same date if evidence differs? Usually we provide one. But we can provide two entries: but they would not be distinct values; they'd be same value. The instruction: \"Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So unique value means date string. So only one entry. We have evidence from two documents, but we should combine evidence into one entry? The evidence field is array. Each entry can have multiple evidence items. So we create one extracted entry with value \"05/15/2025\" and evidence from both documents. That seems appropriate.\n\nWe have not yet appended consolidated entry. We currently have two entries appended earlier. We need to update to combine or correct duplicates. So we should issue update_checklist to replace the entries for Filing_Date with a single entry containing both evidence. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"patch\":[{\"key\":\"Filing_Date\",\"extracted\":[{\"value\":\"05/15/2025\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"Case 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 1 of 34\",\"source_document\":\"Complaint\",\"location\":\"tokens 0-200\"},{\"text\":\"(Entered: 05/15/2025)\",\"source_document\":\"Docket\",\"location\":\"tokens 0-178\"}]}]}]}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "05/15/2025", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 1 of 34", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "tokens 0-200"}, {"text": "(Entered: 05/15/2025)", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 0-178"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10616, "completion_tokens": 632, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Currently we have one date: 05/15/2025 from Complaint and Docket. But there may be other filing dates in other documents or multiple filings. We saw earlier that search_document_regex found matches in Amended Complaint, Brief, etc. We need to find all distinct filing dates. Likely there are multiple. We have a match for 06/11/25 in Amended Complaint. Also maybe 05/15/25 is the original filing; 06/11/25 might be amendment filing. Also other documents might have other dates like 07/01/2025 etc. Need to read more to confirm. We should search for \"Filed\" pattern again with date pattern to catch all. But we already had matches list with 100 matches including many duplicates. But we didn't collect them all. We need to systematically extract all distinct filing dates across documents. Step 13 found 20 matches in Amended Complaint with 06/11/25. Also earlier Step 3 found no matches in other docs. But Step 13 shows many occurrences of \"Case 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25\". So we should capture 06/11/25.\n\nAlso from Step 12 and 15 we captured 05/15/25. Are there other dates? The original complaint filed 05/15/2025. The amendment filed 06/11/2025. Possibly other filings like docket entry for Motion, etc. But the filing date likely refers to lawsuit first filing. The amendment date might still be considered a filing date for that document. But the checklist is for filing date of lawsuit first filed/initiated. The amendment filing date may be considered a filing date for the amended complaint but not the initial lawsuit. Usually the filing date is the first filing. So we should only include 05/15/2025. But the earlier Step 13 shows 06/11/25 matches; but that is for Amended Complaint, which is a separate filing. But the original lawsuit was filed 05/15/2025. Therefore only one distinct date. But the checklist might require all distinct filing dates across documents, maybe including amendments. The phrase \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" That is singular. So only 05/15/2025. But step 13 shows \"Filed 06/11/25\" as well. But that's a later filing. I think only the initial filing is needed. So we should not append 06/11/25. We already have 05/15/2025. But we must confirm that no other earlier date appears in other documents. We should search for \"Filed\" date pattern again but check if any date earlier than 05/15/2025. But all dates likely same or later. So we can just confirm.\n\nBut we should verify that 05/15/2025 appears in Complaint and Docket. We have evidence. The filing date is 05/15/2025. Should we also capture 05/15/25 (without 2025)? Both appear; but we should standardize to full date. In evidence we have \"05/15/25\" and \"05/15/2025\". The value should be \"05/15/2025\". We have evidence from Complaint tokens 0-200 with \"Filed 05/15/25\". That is ambiguous but likely 2025. We also have Docket evidence \"(Entered: 05/15/2025)\". So use 05/15/2025.\n\nCheck if there is any other date pattern in Docket or other docs. We may search again but we already saw many matches. But to be safe, we can search for any \"Filed\" with date pattern across all documents to gather all dates. But we must avoid duplicates. Let's search again but with a pattern capturing date. Use search_document_regex on all documents pattern: \"(?i)Filed\\s*(on\\s*)?(?:[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}|\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4})\". We can get top_k 20, but we need all. But we can do multiple calls. But maybe easier: use search_document_regex on all documents again with pattern but maybe top_k 20 covers all. But we saw earlier 100 matches. That would include all. But we can just read the search result to confirm all distinct dates. But we don't want to read all 100 matches. But we can extract distinct dates from the search results.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex with top_k 20, but that will only give 20 matches. We need all. But maybe we can set top_k 200? The tool's limit top_k <= 20. So we cannot get all at once.\n\nInstead, we can read the previously retrieved matches from Step 13. That had 20 matches in Amended Complaint. They all show 06/11/25. So we have that date. But we should not add it.\n\nBut maybe there are other filing dates in other docs like \"Filed 07/01/2025\" etc. But we didn't see. Could be in Brief or Memorandum. The search earlier didn't find matches in those docs. So likely only 05/15/2025 and 06/11/2025.\n\nThus, we have all distinct filing dates: 05/15/2025. Confirm no earlier date. The initial filing is 05/15/2025. So we are done.\n\nBut we must ensure that the checklist entry for Filing_Date currently contains only one value. It does. So we can stop. But we must verify that the checklist has no other keys. It shows 1 key with values and 0 empty. So we can stop.\n\nBut we should also consider that the value list might be incomplete if we need to include amendment. But the checklist definition says \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So only initial filing. So final answer is to stop.\n\nThus, we should output stop JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All distinct filing dates (initial lawsuit filing) have been extracted and recorded.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct filing dates (initial lawsuit filing) have been extracted and recorded.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9642, "completion_tokens": 1335, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Step 17 they stopped, but system says we can still continue if gaps. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" The filing date is the date lawsuit was first filed. We have only 05/15/2025. But there might be other documents like Amended Complaint, Brief, etc. They might include later filing dates for amendments, but only need initial lawsuit filing. So if all documents have same filing date 05/15/2025, we already have it. But we need to ensure no other filing dates like earlier or later. The docket likely contains the same. But we haven't fully read all documents, but we might have missed a filing date in, say, the Amended Complaint, which might mention \"Filed 06/20/2025\" for amendment. But we only care initial lawsuit filing. That is the date the lawsuit was first filed. That should be same across documents. But we need to confirm that there isn't a different date elsewhere, like the Complaint is filed 05/15/2025, but the Amended Complaint may be filed 07/01/2025. But that would be for amendment, not initial. So not relevant.\n\nThus we only need to ensure that there is no other initial filing date in other documents. The system says we've extracted Filing_Date from Complaint and Docket. But the Complaint has the filing date 05/15/25. The Docket also 05/15/2025. So we have. We need to verify if other documents might have a \"Filed\" field earlier. For instance, the \"Opinion and Order\" may also include docket entry with date. But likely not. But we should check if any other documents have a \"Filed\" statement that could indicate a different date. However the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" That means if any document contains a different filing date (e.g., maybe the \"Memorandum\" includes \"Filed 05/15/2025\" too). But we only need each distinct value. If all documents contain same date, we have one distinct value. We should confirm that no other distinct dates exist. For safety, we could scan the remaining documents for \"Filed\" statements. But we already did search_document_regex for \"Filed on ...\" and found matches. But we might want to inspect the matches. But we did earlier search and found matches across many documents, but those may include multiple matches per doc.\n\nHowever we may need to confirm that the filing date is indeed the first filing. The docket entry might show \"Entered: 05/15/2025\". That is the filing date. For other documents, \"Filed\" might refer to when those documents were filed (e.g., brief). Those could be later dates. We need to differentiate initial filing date from subsequent filings? The requirement: \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So we should only capture the initial filing date of the lawsuit, not later documents. So we need to verify that the date we extracted is indeed the first filing date. The complaint is the initial filing. The docket entry shows \"Entered: 05/15/2025\". The complaint also has \"Filed 05/15/25\". So that is correct. There may be other documents that also show \"Filed 05/15/2025\" because they are copies, but not earlier. So we likely have all distinct values: just one.\n\nThus we can stop. But we need to ensure that the checklist is complete and no gaps. We have 1/1 filled. So we can stop. But the system says \"stop attempt 1/2\" meaning we can stop now. They will allow second stop. We should call stop. But to be thorough, maybe we should check if any other documents have a different filing date for the initial lawsuit. But given all documents likely share the same date, no need. But let's inspect maybe the \"Amended Complaint\" might have \"Filed 07/01/2025\" which is an amendment, but that would be a later filing date. But we are only capturing initial filing. So should not include.\n\nThus we can stop.
