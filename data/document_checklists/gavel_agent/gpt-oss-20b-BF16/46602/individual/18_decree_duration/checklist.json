            "text": "The Court finds that Plaintiffs have provided declarations and other submissions discussing harms experienced by a representative sample of member Councils. See generally ECF 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 36-1.34 Additionally, although the specific number of terminated grants may vary from Council to Council, the Federation\u2019s claims in this case depend not on evidence that differs from Council to Council, but whether Defendants\u2019 decision to mass terminate grant funding to the Federal/State Partnership violates federal law and constitutional principles. Accordingly, the Court joins other district courts around the country that have concluded in similar contexts that associations have standing to bring cases on behalf of their members. In other words, what Plaintiffs request is not a universal injunction. They do not request an injunction applying to \u201cany person\u201d or against Defendants writ large. Plaintiffs\u2019 request for relief properly is limited to themselves, and for the Federation, within the relief afforded by direct and associational standing."
