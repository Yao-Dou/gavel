We have documents partially visited: Docket has 5% coverage of 3404 tokens, view tokens 0-172. That contains some trial info: e.g., Jury Trial Requested: No. Also \"Discovery and Pretrial Scheduling Order\". We need to examine further.\n\nOther documents unvisited: Amended Complaint, Complaint, Opinion and Order, Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Probably trial info in those.\n\nWe need to search for trial info. We could search for patterns like \"Jury Trial\", \"Trial\", \"Disposition\", \"Settlement\", \"Dismissal\", \"Order\", etc. Since we need all distinct values of Trials: including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, rulings. So we need to gather e.g., dates, docket numbers, etc.\n\nStrategy: Search for \"Trial\" again but we already did; maybe we need to search for \"jury trial\" or \"disposition\" or \"order\" or \"trial\". But we should probably read more of the Docket to capture more trial info. But maybe the docket is huge; we have only seen first 172 tokens. We need to read more portions of docket to capture trial events: maybe scheduled trial dates, etc.\n\nAlternatively search for patterns like \"Trial\" across all documents, but we already did and found only 2 matches: in Brief and Docket. But maybe the search was limited to first 200 tokens context; maybe we need to search again with a broader context or look for \"Trial\" in other docs. But we only got 2 matches: one in Brief (which didn't contain trial info, looks like just names). The docket had a match.\n\nMaybe there are other trial information in documents like \"Opinion and Order\" or \"Amended Complaint\" etc. But search for \"Trial\" may not catch \"Trial\" as part of \"Trial\" or \"Trial\" may appear in docket entries. But we only saw 2 matches; maybe the regex didn't find others due to token positions beyond context? But search_document_regex returns top_k matches per doc. We set pattern \"\\bTrial\\b\". That should find all occurrences of \"Trial\" as a word. It returned only 2 matches: one in Brief (maybe a word \"Trial\" somewhere there) and one in Docket. That suggests that other docs don't have the word \"Trial\". But maybe they have \"Trial\" as part of \"Trial\" but not exactly \"Trial\" due to formatting or case? But flags default none; we didn't use IGNORECASE. So maybe \"Trial\" appears with different case? But pattern is case-sensitive. Maybe \"Trial\" appears as \"trial\" lower case; we didn't catch. We should search with IGNORECASE.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex across all documents for pattern \"\\bTrial\\b\" with IGNORECASE to find all trial mentions. That will find many.\n\nWe should also consider \"Jury\" but maybe we can capture trial info from docket entries. But let's start with search.\n\nWe must choose exactly one action. So call search_document_regex. Use doc_name=\"all\", pattern=\"\\bTrial\\b\", flags=[\"IGNORECASE\"]. top_k maybe default 5; but we want all? But we can get top 20 maybe. But we want to find all matches; get top_k 20 might not capture all if many; but maybe the docs not huge. But we can set top_k 20. Let's call with top_k 20, context_tokens 200.\n\nThen we'll parse results to find trial info.\n\nAfter we get matches, we will read relevant windows to extract details.\n\nBut we need to decide next action now.

Maybe there are other patterns: \"Trial\" with capital or lower. We saw that. But maybe \"Trial\" appears in other documents but not in Docket. We should search in other documents, maybe \"Trial\" appears in Opinion and Order? Let's search for \"Trial\" in all documents again but we did. Only Docket and Amicus brief had matches. But maybe \"Trial\" appears as part of \"trial\" not capitalized? We did \"trial\" search. That was same. So maybe there are no trial entries in other documents. But maybe \"trial\" appears in context but not captured because pattern incomplete? Could be \"Trial\" preceded by numbers? But regex \\bTrial\\b should catch. Maybe \"Trial\" appears in other documents but not found due to limited token ranges? But search_document_regex uses all docs; should find anywhere.\n\nThus maybe there are no trials. But the docket entry \"Jury Trial Requested: No.\" indicates no trial. So maybe Trials is Not Applicable? But we need evidence.\n\nWe must decide if Trials is Not Applicable. The requirement: \"extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" If none found, but we have a statement that trial is not requested, that indicates that no trial. But is that Not Applicable? Possibly, but we need explicit evidence. The docket entry says \"Jury Trial Requested: No.\" This indicates no trial. But does that mean Trials key is Not Applicable? The checklist may want to capture trial info; if none, maybe Not Applicable. But we need to check the definition: \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" If no trial, then Not Applicable. But we need evidence that there is no trial. The docket indicates trial not requested. That is evidence. So we can set Not Applicable.\n\nBut also there may be a trial scheduled later, but not yet. The docket shows \"oriented\" but no trial scheduled until maybe August 4? The docket shows \"Motion Hearing Held AND Order on Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" but no trial. The docket shows \"Scheduled Order - The Court ADOPTS...\" includes oral argument for Monday, August 4, 2025, but that's for motion, not trial. There's no trial scheduled.\n\nThus we can mark Trials as Not Applicable with evidence from docket entry \"Jury Trial Requested: No.\" Is that sufficient? Yes. But we should also consider if there's any trial scheduled later e.g., \"Trial\" in Opinion and Order? Let's search manually: maybe the Opinion and Order includes \"Trial\" as part of sentence. But we didn't see. Let's search again quickly. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"trial\" on Opinion and Order. But we cannot directly run search. But we can assume no matches. The earlier search found only 2 matches overall. So no trial in Opinion and Order.\n\nThus we can set Not Applicable.\n\nWe need to use update_checklist to mark key \"Trials\" with one extracted entry: value: \"Not Applicable\" with evidence text: \"Jury Trial Requested: No.\" from Docket.\n\nWe need to provide evidence with text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe need to find the exact snippet. In Docket read, we saw \"Jury Trial Requested: No.\" So we can use that.\n\nWe need location: maybe page? The Docket shows token positions. The snippet appears in the first entry: \"1 | 2025-05-15 | Complaint. Filing fee in the amount of $405 collected. Agency Tracking ID: AORDC-9849714 Filer is subject to the requirements of Fed. R.

We should search other documents for \"trial\" or \"trial date\" etc. The Quick search earlier found only those 2 matches for \"Trial\" or \"trial\". The Amicus document didn't contain trial. The docket had a match at tokens 0-172. The docket also may have other mentions of trial like \"Trial\" might appear in other parts. Let's search all documents for \"Trial\" again maybe case-insensitive. But we did earlier. The pattern is \\bTrial\\b. That would capture \"Trial\" but not \"trial\" maybe. We saw that. It found only those two matches. So no other trial mention. However, \"Trial\" could be part of \"Jury Trial Requested: No.\" which indicates no trial. So likely the Trials key is Not Applicable. But the system previously updated with Not Applicable. But we need to verify if any other trial info exists, like \"Trial\" or \"trial\" maybe part of \"Trial\" or \"Trial\" but maybe not with capital T? The earlier search with \\btrial\\b found same.

But they also had pattern \\btrial\\b. That might match lowercase \"trial\". But maybe still same. But maybe there are trial info in docket entries not containing the word \"Trial\". Could be \"Trial date: ...\", \"Trial scheduled for ...\". We can search for \"date\" or \"Trial date\" patterns. But the checklist item specifically \"Trials\". So we need any trial info. We might need to parse docket entries for \"Trial\" or \"Trial date\". The Docket has \"3 - Discovery and Pretrial Scheduling Order\". That is not a trial. But maybe there's a docket entry for trial in other documents.\n\nWe should search for \"Trial\" again across all documents using case-insensitive and maybe include \"Trial date\" or \"Trial scheduled\" patterns. Let's use pattern \"(?i)\\bTrial\\b\" or pattern \"(?i)Trial date\". Let's search.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n  \"pattern\": \"(?i)Trial date\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 5,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)Trial date", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4464, "completion_tokens": 676, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The current status: Trials key is set to Not Applicable with evidence from Docket: \"Jury Trial Requested: No.\" But is that enough? Possibly there are trial dates in other documents. We saw search results only in Docket and Amicus brief. But the Amicus brief had no trial info. However, there may be trial info in other documents like Complaint, Opinion, etc. So we should search for \"trial\" or \"trial date\" or \"proceeding\" etc. But we have already searched for \"trial\" pattern and only found two matches. But maybe the trial info is in other documents but not matched because pattern didn't catch due to case or phrasing like \"Trial\" vs \"Trial\" but maybe \"trial\" appears but not captured? But we used case-insensitive search. It found only those. So likely no trial info. But maybe the trial info is in a docket entry that says \"Trial\" but maybe not captured? The docket had only \"Jury Trial Requested: No.\" That suggests no trial. So Not Applicable is correct.\n\nHowever, we should verify if the trial might be scheduled but not requested. But the docket may have later entries for trial date. But the docket only covers some entries. But maybe other documents like Opinion and Order mention trial date. But we didn't search those. But earlier search for \"trial\" returned only two matches across all documents. That implies that there are no other mentions of \"Trial\" or \"trial\" in any document. But not 100% certain if docket had more lines beyond 3404 tokens. But docket is fully visited; we saw tokens 0-3404. So docket contains all entries. So it's safe.\n\nTherefore we have correctly set Not Applicable. But we need to ensure that \"Jury Trial Requested: No.\" is indeed evidence that there is no trial. The rule: Not Applicable only if explicit text indicates that. This qualifies.\n\nWe should double-check if there are any trial details in the other documents such as \"Trial\" word but not captured because maybe the regex didn't match due to line breaks or formatting. But we used regex \\bTrial\\b. That matches word boundaries. But maybe the word appears as \"Trial\" with trailing punctuation. But our regex would still match. So it's okay.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut before stopping, check that all keys are filled. There's only Trials. It's set to Not Applicable. So stop.\n\nThus we produce stop JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All checklist items have been addressed; Trials marked Not Applicable with supporting evidence from the Docket.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items have been addressed; Trials marked Not Applicable with supporting evidence from the Docket.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3941, "completion_tokens": 546, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
