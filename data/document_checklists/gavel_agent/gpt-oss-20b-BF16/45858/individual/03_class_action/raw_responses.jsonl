We have search results showing matches with \"individual plaintiffs\" and \"ten individual plaintiffs\" etc. The documents partially visited but we didn't read full. We need to extract distinct values: likely \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity\" etc. Also maybe class action? No class action appears. So the value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity\" and maybe \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as thirteen residents of Camp Integrity\" (different documents). Also maybe \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...? The complaint might have class action? The order \"Order Clarifying Scope\" mentions \"Plaintiffs who wish to camp with others\" etc. But not necessarily a class action.\n\nThus we should gather evidence from multiple documents. The search results already provide snippets. But we need to read the relevant sections to capture description. Use read_document on the sections: e.g., from \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" match 1 tokens 540-740 shows \"Camp Integrity and ten individual plaintiffs filed their complaint\". That gives description. Also match 2 tokens 783-983 includes \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are ten residents of Camp Integrity\". That's good. Also match 3 tokens 1152-1466 includes description about \"Individual Plaintiffs have submitted requests...\". But description of individuals is \"ten residents of Camp Integrity\". Also other documents mention thirteen residents; match 3 tokens 2821-3021 mentions \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are thirteen residents of Camp Integrity\". So we need at least two distinct values: ten residents, thirteen residents. Also maybe mention of \"ten individual plaintiffs\" and \"thirteen residents\". We need to extract each distinct value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity\" and \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as thirteen residents of Camp Integrity\". Also we might include \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ... (not class action)\". No class action found. So we need to mark class action as Not Applicable? The key is Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs. If only individual, we still produce entries for individuals. No Not Applicable needed unless class action is present and not applicable? The requirement: extract every distinct value of this checklist item found. So we just provide entries for individuals. So we need to read more to confirm description. We have snippet. But we need evidence: text snippet, source document, location. Use read_document for each. We could use search_document_regex to get context and then read to confirm. We already have search results with context. We could use read_document to read relevant windows to capture text. Let's pick a doc: \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\". For tokens 540-740 and 783-983 and 1152-1466. But we might not need to read all. We can read a window covering 540-740 to capture \"ten individual plaintiffs\". Then read 783-983 to capture \"ten residents of Camp Integrity\". Let's do one read_document for that doc covering tokens 540-800 maybe to capture both. But the tokens 540-740 and 783-983 are separate ranges. We could read 540-1000 to cover both but that's within 10k tokens. So we can read 540-1000. Then we can extract from that window.\n\nAlso for other doc: \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" tokens 2821-3021 includes \"thirteen residents of Camp Integrity\". So read that doc from 2800-3100.\n\nAlso maybe \"Order Clarifying Scope of Preliminary Injunction\" tokens 875-1075 mention \"Plaintiffs who wish to camp with others and not to those who maintain wholly individual campsites.\" That description might not be about individuals. Might not need.\n\nPotential also \"Verified Complaint\" might have class action? But we haven't visited. Might not need.\n\nThus we will read two windows.\n\nFirst read_document for doc \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" start 540 end 1000.\n\nSecond read_document for doc \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" start 2800 end 3100.\n\nThen after reading, we will append two entries.\n\nSo next action: read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\",\"start_token\":540,\"end_token\":1000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 540, "end_token": 1000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5661, "completion_tokens": 982, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have read a portion of the Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order: tokens 540-1000, which includes \"Camp Integrity and ten individual plaintiffs filed their complaint\". So plaintiffs are individual. Also earlier we saw matches: \"ten individual plaintiffs\", \"individual plaintiffs\" etc. We need to extract the classification: Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entity of Camp Integrity. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nWe need to provide evidence snippet. From the read snippet, we have tokens 7-10: \"Camp Integrity and ten individual plaintiffs filed their complaint\". And tokens 18-19: \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are ten residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing\". So we can extract description: \"ten residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entity of Camp Integrity.\" So value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entity of Camp Integrity\".\n\nWe should add to checklist via append_checklist. But we may need to confirm if any other document indicates class action. Search for \"class action\" maybe none. The earlier search matched \"class action\" but that was in context of \"such action taken by the City is an attempt to circumvent the preliminary injunction\" etc - not plaintiffs. But we can search again for \"class action\" to confirm no plaintiffs as class. But likely no. So we can append the single value.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with key Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, extracted value with evidence: from \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" snippet. We need evidence with text snippet, source_document, location. We can use location \"Page 2 of 16\" or token range. Provide token offsets or page. We'll use tokens 7-19 for description. Let's provide evidence text: \"Camp Integrity and ten individual plaintiffs filed their complaint\" and \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are ten residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing\". Provide source_document: \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\", location: maybe \"tokens 7-19\" or \"Page 2 of 16\".

We already have one value: Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entity of Camp Integrity. But we need to check if there are other values in other documents. The search earlier found multiple matches in other documents that mention \"ten individual plaintiffs\" or \"thirteen residents\" etc. The class action status may vary: This case seems to be individual plaintiffs, not a class action. But maybe some documents mention a class action? In the search results, we saw \"class action\" phrase in other documents. For example, Order Clarifying Scope of Preliminary Injunction had \"such action taken by the City is an attempt to circumvent the preliminary injunction.\" But earlier in that snippet, it may mention \"class action\" or \"individual plaintiffs\". Let's search for \"class action\" in the remaining documents.\n\nWe have not yet read the other documents fully. We did partial reads. To find if any document indicates a class action status, we should search for \"class action\" pattern in all documents. The search in step 2 found 11 matches across 7 docs. We saw matches in Order Clarifying Scope of Preliminary Injunction: tokens 875-1075 snippet shows \"...apply only to Plaintiffs who wish to camp with others and not to those who maintain wholly individual campsites.\" That indicates individual plaintiffs. But also earlier we might find \"class action\" mention. The snippet didn't show \"class action\" but maybe earlier part had phrase. But the search matched pattern \"class action|individual plaintiffs\". The snippet didn't include \"class action\" but maybe the regex matched \"individual plaintiffs\". So we need to find distinct values: possibly \"Class Action\" or \"Individual\" with description. It might be only individual.\n\nBut there may be multiple sets: \"ten individual plaintiffs\" vs \"thirteen residents\". The description can differ. The requirement: Every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So if there are multiple distinct descriptions, we need separate entries. For example, \"ten residents of Camp Integrity\" vs \"thirteen residents of Camp Integrity\". They are distinct values? The value string includes description. So we should list each unique description.\n\nThus we need to extract from other documents: In Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, there is mention: Individual Plaintiffs in this action are thirteen residents of Camp Integrity... So that is a distinct description. Also earlier in the same doc, maybe \"ten residents\" etc. There might be other documents like Complaint which might mention the number of plaintiffs. So we should search for \"individual plaintiffs\" and capture the descriptions.\n\nSimplify: We should search all documents for \"individual plaintiffs\" and capture the following sentence that includes the number. Let's perform search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"individual plaintiffs.*?ten|thirteen|[0-9]+\". But we need to capture the sentence.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the relevant documents fully. But we can also search for the pattern \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are\". That appears in some. Let's search that phrase.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are [^\\\\.]*\\\\.\" to get the sentence.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are [^\\\\.]*\\\\.\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Individual Plaintiffs in this action are [^\\.]*\\.", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6449, "completion_tokens": 748, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The current extraction only captured the \"Individual\" description from the TRO order. But there may be other documents indicating class action status. We need to scan other documents.\n\nWe saw search results earlier: \"class action|individual plaintiffs\" matches. In Order Clarifying Scope of Preliminary Injunction, we saw a snippet: \"such action taken by the City is an attempt to circumvent the preliminary injunction. Cfi tla cC 14 As further clarification, the 400 square foot adjustment for camps of up to four persons ... applied only to Plaintiffs who wish to camp with others and not to those who maintain wholly ... individual campsites.\" That seems to mention \"individual campsites\". But not necessarily class action status.\n\nWe need to find if any documents mention \"class action\" or \"class\" or \"class action\" with plaintiffs. The search for pattern \"class action|individual plaintiffs\" found 11 matches across 7 documents. Let's consider each.\n\nMatches summary:\n\n- Order Clarifying Scope of Preliminary Injunction: 1 match (tokens 875-1075). The snippet shows \"Plaintiffs who wish to camp with others and not to those who maintain wholly individual campsites.\" This indicates class vs individual, but not explicit designation of class action. But we could maybe extract \"Plaintiffs: Individual (with description?)\". But that snippet doesn't give description.\n\n- Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss: 1 match (tokens 1518-1718). The snippet shows \"On August 11, 2023, Camp Integrity and ten individual plaintiffs filed their complaint...\" So again individual plaintiffs.\n\n- Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order: 4 matches. We already captured one. Others may include description of \"ten residents of Camp Integrity\" etc.\n\n- Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction: 5 matches. Some matches show \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are thirteen residents of Camp Integrity\". So that's a different number: thirteen.\n\nAlso \"Class Action\" maybe appears somewhere. Let's search again for \"class action\" specifically.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex pattern \"class action\" across all documents.\n\nWe need to capture all distinct values. There's mention of \"class action\" maybe not present, but we should confirm.\n\nAlso \"class action status\" might be indicated by \"class action\" or \"class action plaintiffs\".\n\nWe need to capture the designation: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\".\n\nThe current extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entity of Camp Integrity\". That is one distinct value.\n\nWe need to check if there are other distinct values: maybe \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as thirteen residents of Camp Integrity..\"? That would be a distinct value, because description differs.\n\nAlso we might have \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity...\" and \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as thirteen residents...\" So we need to extract both.\n\nAlso maybe there is a class action designation: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" (maybe the case is a class action). We need to see if any document indicates class action. Search for \"class action\" again. It might appear.\n\nWe also need to check the Verified Complaint and Ex Parte Application for TRO and PI, Notice of Exparte Application for TRO and PI for Injunctive Relief to Halt Implementation of San Rafael Code 19.50 and SMC 19.20.080(c) on August 16th 2023. That might mention \"class action\" or \"class\" or \"class action plaintiffs\". We haven't read that document yet. It is unvisited.\n\nAlso the Docket may have information.\n\nAlso the Order Conditionally Granting Defendant's Emergency Motion for Limited Relief From Injunction (1,945 tokens) might mention class action.\n\nThus we need to search for \"class action\" across all documents to determine if there are any class action designations.\n\nLet's plan next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"class action\". That will give matches with context. Then we can read relevant sections to confirm if class action status is indicated. Also we should search for \"class action\" or \"class action plaintiffs\" maybe.\n\nAdditionally, also search for \"class action\" and potentially \"class\" but that might be too broad.\n\nBut the spec: we only need to extract values for \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". That is either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". So if any document indicates class action, we need to capture that. There may be a single value \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" if it's a class action. Possibly the case is a class action. But from the snippet earlier, it seems the plaintiffs are ten or thirteen individuals. That suggests maybe not a class action but individual plaintiffs. But maybe the plaintiffs also form a class? It's unclear.\n\nThe description may include \"ten residents of Camp Integrity\" and \"thirteen residents of Camp Integrity\" as different sets. These are distinct values. So we should extract both.\n\nAlso, the Verified Complaint might have a description of plaintiffs. We haven't read it yet. It likely contains the initial complaint. It may mention \"ten individuals\" or \"thirteen individuals\". We should read it to confirm.\n\nThus next action: read from Verified Complaint at appropriate token ranges to find \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are ...\". The complaint likely has a \"Parties\" section.\n\nBut the complaint is 23,398 tokens, unvisited. We should read a section where the parties are described. Use read_document to read tokens covering likely section: maybe tokens 2000-3000? But we don't know. Alternatively, we can search for \"Individual Plaintiffs\" in the complaint.\n\nThus we can use search_document_regex on the complaint for pattern \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are [^\\\\.]*\\\\.\" That would locate the description. That pattern used earlier for other documents. So we can search on the complaint.\n\nAlso search for \"class action\" in the complaint.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on \"Verified Complaint...\" doc for pattern \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are [^\\\\.]*\\\\.\" and maybe \"class action\" pattern.\n\nBut we need to decide on one action per turn. The best next step is to search for \"class action\" across all documents. That will give us context for class action designation. Then we can decide if we need to set \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or not.\n\nBut we also need to capture the second individual description. We have only captured the description for ten residents. We need to capture the description for thirteen residents. That appears in the \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" matches. So we need to read the snippet at tokens 2821-3021 or 2936-3136 etc. We haven't appended that. So we should append that value.\n\nTherefore, we need to extract the second distinct value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as thirteen residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entities Camp Integrity and the Homeless Union.\" (From snippet).\n\nWe also need to capture \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entity of Camp Integrity\" (already extracted). But we might want to update to include \"along with the entity of Camp Integrity\" or just use the description.\n\nThus next step: we need to read the relevant token range in \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" for the snippet with description. Then append that entry.\n\nWe also need to check if any other description appears. The order \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" had the description for ten residents. The \"Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\" also had \"ten individual plaintiffs\". That matches same description. The \"Order Clarifying Scope of Preliminary Injunction\" also had \"ten individual plaintiffs\". So we have consistent description.\n\nBut the \"Order Granting in Part...\" had \"thirteen residents\". So we need to capture that.\n\nThus next action: read_document on \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" for tokens covering the description. The snippet we saw earlier, tokens 2821-3021 or 2936-3136. We need to read that range. Let's read tokens 2800-3100 to include the description. That is within 37,021 tokens. The token ranges provided show 2821-3021 had description. So we can read tokens 2800-3100.\n\nThus next action: read_document on that doc from start_token 2800 to end_token 3100.\n\nBut we should check that we haven't already visited that range. The document catalog shows we have visited tokens 2273-2543, 2821-3136, 3305-3505. So we have partially visited 2821-3136. That means we have already read 2821-3136. Wait, the catalog shows we visited those ranges. Yes, we have partially visited 2821-3136. So we have already read that snippet. Actually we saw that snippet in step 5 search results. But we didn't append it. So we can now append that value. We don't need to read again.\n\nThus we should use append_checklist to add the new value \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as thirteen residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entities Camp Integrity and the Homeless Union.\" with evidence from that snippet: tokens 2821-3021 (or 2936-3136). We need to provide evidence text, source_document, location. We can use the snippet we already saw in the search results. That snippet is:\n\n\"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are thirteen residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entities Camp Integrity and the Homeless Union. Docket No. 1 ¶ 1; FAC at 10, 12. The MCP encampment where Plaintiffs2 reside receives donations...\"\n\nThus we can use that as evidence.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with key Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs and new value.\n\nWe need to ensure we provide evidence list with text, source_document, location.\n\nWe need to use the snippet. The snippet includes \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are thirteen residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entities Camp Integrity and the Homeless Union.\" That's the description. We'll include that as evidence.\n\nThe location: token offset range 2821-3021 or 2936-3136. Let's use 2821-3021 as location. Provide page? Not needed. Just location.\n\nThus we will call append_checklist with patch.\n\nWe may also consider the possibility of a class action designation. But we haven't seen any explicit \"class action\" text. However, the \"Order Clarifying Scope of Preliminary Injunction\" might include mention of \"class action\" but not. The search pattern \"class action|individual plaintiffs\" didn't find \"class action\" except maybe not. But we should search for \"class action\" across all docs. But we can't do two actions in one turn. We need to focus on the next immediate missing value: the description for thirteen residents. That is a distinct value. So we should append that. Then we can later search for class action.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.\n\nProceed.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as thirteen residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entities Camp Integrity and the Homeless Union.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are thirteen residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entities Camp Integrity and the Homeless Union.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 2821-3021\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Individual, described as thirteen residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entities Camp Integrity and the Homeless Union.", "evidence": [{"text": "Individual Plaintiffs in this action are thirteen residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entities Camp Integrity and the Homeless Union.", "source_document": "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "location": "tokens 2821-3021"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7010, "completion_tokens": 2680, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
{"step": 7, "run_id": "2af525ce-5276-4806-8069-ed1d6d415307", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T13:26:34.826687-05:00", "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have extracted two values for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: one for ten residents, one for thirteen residents. But check if there are more distinct values? We have also identified from Order Clarifying Scope of Preliminary Injunction: it mentioned \"Plaintiffs who wish to camp with others and not to those who maintain wholly individual campsites.\" That might be classification? But the pattern \"individual plaintiffs\" might mention \"ten individual plaintiffs\" and \"thirteen individual plaintiffs\". Also maybe the Complaint could have more? But we haven't read the Complaint.\n\nThe summary says 2 values extracted. Are there other distinct values? The question: \"Extract the class action status from the legal documents.\" We need every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. We have at least two distinct values: ten residents and thirteen residents. But maybe there are also class action? The documents refer to \"Camp Integrity and ten individual plaintiffs\" indicates not class action, but maybe there is a class action? No class action is indicated. These are individual plaintiffs. So two entries.\n\nBut we should verify if there are more distinct values: maybe the Complaint has 10 individual plaintiffs, maybe also mentions class action? Likely not. The Complaint could have 10 plaintiffs. We might need to read the Complaint to confirm. Also maybe the Order Clarifying Scope of Preliminary Injunction includes reference to \"Plaintiffs who wish to camp with others and not to those who maintain wholly individual campsites.\" That might be a classification but not a distinct value (just description). But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So distinct values: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entity of Camp Integrity\" and \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as thirteen residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entities Camp Integrity and the Homeless Union.\"\n\nAdditionally, maybe there's a \"Class Action\" mention? I didn't see \"class action\" but maybe some other document. Quick search: The search_document_regex earlier looked for \"class action|individual plaintiffs\". It found 11 matches but many were about \"individual plaintiffs\". It found no \"class action\" matches. So likely no class action. So we have two values.\n\nWe must make sure the checklist has only one key: Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs. Already appended two values. Are there more not yet found? We might still need to check the Complaint and maybe the Docket to ensure no other distinct values. But likely same numbers. The Complaint likely lists 10 plaintiffs. The Docket may list 10 as well. But we might double-check. But we have the requirement to extract all distinct values. We have two distinct values: ten and thirteen. But maybe there are also \"ten residents\" (first) and \"thirteen residents\" (second). They are distinct. We have them. Are there any other distinct values? Possibly \"Camp Integrity and ten individual plaintiffs\" and \"Camp Integrity and thirteen individual plaintiffs\". But those are included. So we have two. So we might be done. But must ensure we didn't miss any mention of class action. It might not exist. But we should confirm by searching again for \"class action\" across all documents. The earlier search found 11 matches, but matches were likely all about individual plaintiffs. Let's re-search with pattern \"class action\". But we can just call search_document_regex with pattern \"class action\" to confirm none. That would be a quick check. But we might already have enough. The goal is to stop when all keys are either complete or Not Applicable. We have 1 key, we have provided two distinct values. We need to check if that's complete. Are there any other possibilities? For example, maybe a document says \"Class Action\" somewhere else. But the earlier search only looked for \"class action|individual plaintiffs\". It returned 11 matches. None seemed to include \"class action\". But maybe \"class action\" is capitalized differently. We can search for \"Class Action\" too. But the earlier pattern used IGNORECASE? Probably default. So it's case-insensitive. So it would catch \"Class Action\". So no match. So no class action. So we have all values.\n\nThus we should stop. But before stopping, we should verify the checklist state. The last action was append_checklist with two values. We should call get_checklist to confirm. But we could just stop. But if we want to be safe, we could call get_checklist. However the instruction: \"Stop when every key is either complete or Not Applicable.\" We have one key, with two values. That likely is complete. There's no indication of more distinct values. But to be safe, we can issue get_checklist to confirm. But we can also stop. The instructions: \"When stopping, return only JSON with decision: stop\". We can stop. But we might risk missing a value. But risk is low.\n\nGiven the evidence we have, I think we are done. We should stop.\n\nThus output final stop JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs values have been extracted from the available documents.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs values have been extracted from the available documents.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7209, "completion_tokens": 1099, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The checklists says there is 1 key filled, 0 empty. But we need to consider if any other documents might contain additional distinct values. We have 7 documents, but only partially visited. There are unvisited documents: Verified Complaint and Ex Parte Application for TRO and PI, Docket, Order Conditionally Granting Defendant's Emergency Motion for Limited Relief From Injunction. Also we haven't fully read Order Clarifying Scope of Preliminary Injunction, Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, etc. Those might have class action status? But the earlier search with regex \"class action|individual plaintiffs\" found matches in several docs, but only 11 matches with some. They found 4 in Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (+1 more docs). That suggests there may be other doc with \"class action\" phrase. We didn't see any \"class action\" mention in the extracted values.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values of Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs. We have two: one indicates Individual plaintiffs (ten residents + entity), other indicates Individual plaintiffs (thirteen residents + entities). But could there also be a \"Class Action\" designation? We need to search for \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or phrase \"class action\" in the documents. The search earlier didn't find any mention? But earlier search pattern \"class action|individual plaintiffs\" found 11 matches. That includes maybe \"class action\" matches. But we didn't capture any. We need to check other docs.\n\nThus the next action should be to search remaining unvisited documents for patterns indicating class action or individual plaintiffs. We can use search_document_regex on unvisited docs: pattern \"class action|individual plaintiffs\". That will give us matches. Use doc_names array to limit to unvisited docs. Then we can read those matches to confirm and extract.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on unvisited documents: Verified Complaint and Ex Parte Application for TRO and PI, Docket, Order Conditionally Granting Defendant's Emergency Motion for Limited Relief From Injunction, Order Clarifying Scope of Preliminary Injunction, Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.\n\nAlso maybe Order Clarifying Scope of Preliminary Injunction partially visited, but still not fully.

The search pattern included \"class action|individual plaintiffs\". The results show many matches for \"individual plaintiffs\" but no \"class action\" matches. But we must ensure we have captured all distinct values. There are two distinct values: one describing \"ten residents of Camp Integrity\" and the other \"thirteen residents of Camp Integrity\". Both mention entities Camp Integrity and Homeless Union. The first also mentions the entity Camp Integrity (not Homeless Union). The second includes Homeless Union. We need to double-check if any other value exists. The search results didn't include any \"class action\" but we should verify that in the unvisited documents maybe there is 'class action' mention.

These are unvisited. We might need to search them for 'class action' or 'individual plaintiffs'.

But the instruction: \"Choose ONE action each turn\". We need to decide next action. We have two distinct values extracted. We should confirm if there are any missing. We could search again for 'class action' specifically to see if any mention. But we already have search results with pattern \"class action|individual plaintiffs\" and found 16 matches. None seemed to be \"class action\". We might search for 'class action' alone to confirm. But maybe some doc mentions \"class action\" but not captured due to regex? We used IGNORECASE? Did we use flags? The search_document_regex earlier didn't specify flags; default is no flags. So maybe the term 'Class Action' is capitalized. But regex without IGNORECASE won't match 'Class Action' if we searched 'class action'. But we didn't search for 'Class Action'. So we might need to search for 'Class Action' with capital C. But earlier we might have captured 'class action' but maybe with different casing. Let's use search_document_regex with pattern \"Class Action\" (exact case). But we could also use IGNORECASE. But the pattern \"class action|individual plaintiffs\" didn't capture 'Class Action' because of case mismatch. So we might be missing any class action mention. Let's search for \"Class Action\" to see if any appears.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Class Action\". Also maybe search for \"class action\" with IGNORECASE. Better to search for \"Class Action\" with IGNORECASE, but we can just search for 'Class Action' with IGNORECASE to capture all.

Currently only two values extracted: from two documents. But there may be more values in other documents: Verified Complaint, Docket, Order Conditionally Granting etc. We need to search for \"class action\" or \"individual plaintiffs\" and gather all distinct values. We have already found matches for \"individual plaintiffs\" in various places. We need to extract unique values: likely two distinct: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity\" etc. The earlier steps extracted two values: one from Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (likely \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity\" maybe) and one from Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (likely \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as thirteen residents of Camp Integrity\" etc). But we haven't extracted the Class Action value; maybe none. Actually the pattern suggests the plaintiffs are individual, not class action. There may be a \"Class Action\" mention in some docs like Verified Complaint. Let's search for \"class action\" in all docs. The earlier search step 11 found 0 matches for \"Class Action\". So no explicit mention. So the status may be that all plaintiffs are individual. So we need to capture all distinct values: two values: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity\" and \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as thirteen residents of Camp Integrity\". Maybe also \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity and entity of Camp Integrity\" etc. But we should capture distinct values. Let's check the matched text for each:\n\nFrom Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, match 2: lines 18-19: \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are ten residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entity of Camp Integrity.\" So description: ten residents of Camp Integrity (plus entity). So value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ten residents of Camp Integrity (plus entity of Camp Integrity)\". But the requirement: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". So we can use \"ten residents of Camp Integrity\" maybe.\n\nFrom Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, match 3: \"Individual Plaintiffs in this action are thirteen residents of Camp Integrity who do not otherwise have stable housing, along with the entities Camp Integrity and the San Rafael Homeless Union.\" So description: thirteen residents of Camp Integrity (plus entities). So value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as thirteen residents of Camp Integrity (plus entities Camp Integrity and the San Rafael Homeless Union)\". But we may decide to include full description. But maybe we should keep description minimal: \"thirteen residents of Camp Integrity\". The spec says \"brief description of the individuals when applicable\". So we can include \"ten residents of Camp Integrity\" and \"thirteen residents of Camp Integrity\". That seems fine.\n\nBut we need to confirm that no class action. We searched for \"Class Action\" and found 0. So we can mark key as completed with two values. But we need to ensure that we have extracted all distinct values. We should also search for \"class action\" in other documents like Verified Complaint and Docket. Although earlier step 11 didn't find any. So no class action. So we have two distinct values.\n\nWe have already appended those two values earlier. But need to ensure we added both. Step 4 appended one, step 6 appended another. Let's check: Step 4 appended value from \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" (the first value). Step 6 appended value from \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" (the second value). So we have both. Are there any other distinct values? Possibly there might be a mention of \"Class Action\" in other docs like \"Order Conditionally Granting Defendant's Emergency Motion for Limited Relief From Injunction\" but search didn't find. So done.\n\nBut we need to check if any other \"individual plaintiffs\" mention with different description: e.g., in \"Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" match 3 maybe? We saw match 3 lines 1152-1352: description: \"Individual Plaintiffs have submitted requests to the city for shelter placement...\" but description not about number of individuals. That match 3 is not about number of individuals; it's just general. But the description \"ten residents of Camp Integrity\" is earlier. So only two distinct values.\n\nThus we need to stop. But we must ensure that we didn't miss any \"Class Action\" mention. Search again: maybe \"class action\" appears with lower case. Search with regex \"class action|individual plaintiffs\" we already did. But \"Class Action\" case-sensitive maybe not found. But we can search ignoring case: pattern: \"(?i)class action\". But step 11 used pattern \"Class Action\" which is case-sensitive. But earlier step 10 used pattern \"(class action|individual plaintiffs)\" with IGNORECASE? It didn't specify flags. But probably default no ignore. But earlier step 10 used pattern without flags. It found matches for \"individual plaintiffs\" but not \"class action\". So likely no class action. So we can finalize.\n\nWe need to ensure that the key is fully filled: no empty keys left. The status says 1/1 key filled. So we can stop.\n\nThus we should issue stop.\n\nBut we need to check that the extracted values are correct: We didn't see the actual extracted values in the system. We need to confirm that the values exist. The system says \"Keys with Extracted Values (1): Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: 2 values\". So we have two values. Good.\n\nThus we can stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All distinct Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs values have been extracted and the key is now complete.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs values have been extracted and the key is now complete.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10129, "completion_tokens": 1292, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
