We already have many regex matches. We need to extract all distinct appeals: parties appealed to which appellate court. We need to find all appeals in documents. We have many matches. We need to read or search for \"appeal\" pattern. We already searched all documents, got 66 matches. We should parse those matches for appeal information. We need to extract each distinct value 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]'. So we need to read the full context around each match to get parties and court. We can use search_document_regex to get matches with context. But we already have matches list. We need to read the content around each match that includes the parties and court. We can use read_document to read token ranges for each match. But could be many values. Perhaps easier: use search_document_regex to get all matches again but maybe include more context. We can request top_k 20 per doc. The results will give context. But we already have match lists with tokens. We can read each token range. But that might be many: 66 matches across 15 docs. That's too many. We need to identify unique appeals, maybe fewer. We could parse some matches manually.\n\nLet's examine match 1 in doc (001): appears to show \"United States Court of Appeals For the First Circuit\" and parties: \"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS\". So one appeal: those parties appealed to US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nMatch 2 in doc (001) shows \"Defendants, Appellants.\" and \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\". So parties: Defendants (list earlier). Court: US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit? Actually the match shows \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\" but no appellate court mentioned. Might be implied? The preceding text might mention appellate court. But we need to capture appellate court. Might need to read surrounding context.\n\nMatch 3 in doc (001) is about government appellants moving court. Might not contain appellate court.\n\nMatch 1 in doc (002) shows \"DISCOURSED\" about stay pending appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. But parties? \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" again.\n\nWe might need to extract all appeals. Let's plan: Use search_document_regex to get all matches with context. Then parse. But we need to produce final output. We can do incremental extraction: read each doc's relevant ranges.\n\nWe can read doc (001) entire content? 15k tokens. We can read in chunks. But maybe just read the matches ranges.\n\nGiven many matches, perhaps we should focus on distinct appeals. Let's identify likely distinct appeals:\n\nFrom doc (001):\n- Appeal 1: Plaintiffs (American Public Health Association; etc.) appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Evidence: match 1 tokens 0-133.\n\n- Appeal 2: Defendants (list of institutes) appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit? Actually match 2 tokens 681-881: shows \"Defendants, Appellants.\" and \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\" but no appellate court. But likely to be same appellate court. Could be to the First Circuit as well.\n\n- Appeal 3: \"Government appellants\" mention moving for appeal. Likely to the First Circuit.\n\nFrom doc (002):\n- Appeal 4: The stays pending appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Parties: maybe the parties in the case? The text mentions \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". The parties: likely same as earlier.\n\nBut there may be multiple appeals: maybe one for the American Public Health Association (APHA), another for the Defendants, and maybe one for the Government. They all appeal to the First Circuit. So we might have 3 distinct appeals but same court. But we need distinct values: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\". So each unique combination of parties and court counts as a value. So we might list 3 entries.\n\nWe need evidence for each. We can read the token ranges containing the parties and court.\n\nThus tasks: read doc (001) tokens 0-133 for appeal 1. read doc (001) tokens 681-881 for appeal 2. read doc (001) tokens 1998-2198 for appeal 3 maybe. But we need to confirm parties. Let's read 1998-2198. Also read 2062-2262 maybe. Let's read 1998-2262. That range covers the appeal text.\n\nAlso read 1998-2198 already includes parties? Let's read 1998-2198. That range includes part of the text about \"the government appellants here (collectively \"the Department\") then moved the district court for a stay of its order pending appeal\". It doesn't list parties. But earlier match 681-881 lists defendants. So we have parties there.\n\nThus we have these 3 appeals.\n\nAdditionally, doc (002) match 1 tokens 471-681 includes the court and mention of \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". But parties? It might refer to the same parties. But we might treat it as the same appeal. But we might need to capture each distinct appeal. It's ambiguous.\n\nLet's check doc (002) match 1 tokens 471-681: includes text \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". The parties are not in that snippet. But earlier in match 1 it might have parties? Actually the snippet starts with \"STITUTES OF HEALTH v. AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSN.\" So parties: \"United States of America - Departments of Health and Human Services\" maybe? But not sure.\n\nGiven complexity, maybe limit to the appeals we can be certain: the one in doc (001) tokens 0-133, the one in doc (001) tokens 681-881, and maybe the one in doc (001) tokens 1998-2198. Let's read those.\n\nWe'll perform read_document for each range.\n\nAlso we might need to read doc (001) tokens 1998-2198.\n\nLet's do calls sequentially. But we only can do one function call per turn. We need to choose one. Maybe pick read_document for doc (001) tokens 0-133.\n\nBut we already have evidence from match 1. But still need to read to confirm. Let's read that range.\n\nThus I will call read_document for doc (001) tokens 0-133.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\" (001)\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":133}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": " (001)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 133}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8123, "completion_tokens": 1501, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to extract every distinct value: format 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]'.\n\nWe need to look at extracted text to identify parties and court. Likely from 001: It lists parties: American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); Brittany Charlton; Katie Edwards; Peter Lurie; and Nicole Maphis. And court: United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. So entry: Appeal: American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); Brittany Charlton; Katie Edwards; Peter Lurie; and Nicole Maphis appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nAlso 001 has other appeals: \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\" etc. But parties: Defendants, Appellants?

We have seen some in search results: In document (001) match 2: \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\" etc. Also maybe (002) has appellate court mention. Also maybe other docs. We need all distinct appeals: parties and appellate court. Likely multiple. We need to search for \"appeal\" pattern across corpus. But we already did search; but only partial matches. We need to read relevant sections fully to capture parties and appellate court.\n\nWe should search for \"appeal\" again but maybe with pattern \"appeal from\" or \"appeal to\". But we need distinct values. Probably we need to read each match to get full context. We have many matches but limited coverage. We can search for \"appeal\" again but maybe use regex to capture \"appeal to\" or \"appeal from\" etc. But with large matches we can read relevant tokens around each match. We need to capture each appeal entry.\n\nIt might be easier to use search_document_regex with pattern \"appeal\" to get matches with context. We already have 66 matches across 15 docs. We could iterate through each doc and read each match region to extract parties and appellate court.\n\nWe need to decide one action now. We could use search_document_regex again to get all matches again, but we already did. But maybe we need to read some uncovered tokens; we have partially visited many docs. We need to locate each appeal.\n\nWe could use search_document_regex with pattern \"appeal from\" to find each. But we need parties too.\n\nMaybe best to read document (001) token ranges that contain \"appeal\" in context: we have match 2 tokens 681-881. That snippet includes \"Defendants, Appellants.\" and \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\" and then some parties. We need to read that entire match 2 region including before and after to capture parties list. The snippet we saw already includes parties: \"Defendants, Appellants.\" but not parties list. The parties likely earlier in document: match 1 includes parties list: \"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION; IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW); BRITTANY CHARLTON; KATIE EDWARDS; PETER LURIE; and NICOLE MAPHIS,\". Those are likely appellants.\n\nSo we need to extract an entry: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" So for this case: parties: list above, court: United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit? Wait the match 2 says \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\" but the court of appeal is not named there. The appeal is to the First Circuit. The match 1 earlier shows \"United States Court of Appeals For the First Circuit\" at top. So the appeal is to First Circuit. So we need to capture that.\n\nThus we need to read enough to capture that.\n\nWe also have match 4? etc. But need to capture all distinct appeals across documents.\n\nAlso in document (002) there is mention of \"appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". That's another appeal.\n\nAlso maybe other docs. We need to systematically capture all.\n\nWe might do a search for \"United States Court of Appeals\" and see which docs mention. But we need appeals.\n\nWe could read each match region for match 2, 1, 4 etc.\n\nGiven limited tokens per call, we can read match 2 region fully (681-881). That's within 1000 tokens. We can read that. Then we can append the extracted appeal.\n\nBut we also need to capture other appeals: We saw match 1 tokens 0-133 shows the appellate court header but not parties. But we might need combine with match 2 for parties. But we can rely on match 1 to get court. But maybe we can extract both from match 1? But match 1 only shows header. We may need to read match 1 to confirm court. But we already know.\n\nWe also have match 4? Let's identify other matches that likely contain appeals. Search results show many matches, but not all. We could search for \"appeal\" again and read each region. But that could be many.\n\nAlternatively, we could search for \"appeal from\" to narrow.\n\nBut we might need to cover all distinct appeals; maybe there are only two or three. The case 001 has one appeal. The case 002 has one appeal. Others might have appeals too.\n\nLet's scan the provided match list: For (001) we saw matches 1-9. Among them, match 2 contains \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\" and parties list. Match 4 also has similar content. But we need to see all.\n\nFor (002) matches include mention of \"appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" etc.\n\nThus we need to extract at least two appeals.\n\nAlso maybe other docs have appeals, e.g., the \"Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion for a Stay\" might refer to appeal. But we need to check.\n\nBetter to search for pattern \"appeal\" again but restrict to top_k maybe 20 matches per doc. Then read each match region fully.\n\nWe already have 66 matches across all docs. But we can search again with top_k 20 per doc. But we might need to parse each.\n\nHowever, we can also use search_document_regex again to get all matches with context. Then we can read each region.\n\nBut we have to choose one action per turn. We can't do all in one go. We need to read each match region one by one.\n\nWe could start by reading document (001) tokens 681-881 to capture the parties and appellate court. Then append the extracted entry.\n\nBut we also need to capture other appeals. After finishing (001), we can then read (002) match 1 region. But we need to decide next action. Since we only need one action per turn, we can start with reading the match 2 region.\n\nThus let's request read_document on (001) tokens 681-881.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"(001)\",\"start_token\":681,\"end_token\":881}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "(001)", "start_token": 681, "end_token": 881}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9707, "completion_tokens": 1389, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

That indicates an appeal from district court to appellate court. The parties: Defendants (not named). Or the parties listed earlier: The parties: American Public Health Association; IBIS reproductive health; etc. But the appeal is from district court to US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (document 001 is likely an appellate order). The extracted value: \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\" But we need to capture the parties and the appellate court. The parties: Defendants (or the named parties). The appellate court: United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nAlso, document 002: In match 1: \"stayed pending the disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". That indicates an appeal is pending in First Circuit. But the appeal parties? The parties are the same as earlier: the parties in the case: American Public Health Association; IBIS etc. But the text says: \"disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\" So we might extract another appeal: \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\" But we might want to avoid duplicate.\n\nNeed to extract distinct values. We should ensure no duplicate. Since both docs refer to same appeal, it's same value. But we must include the parties and court. So one entry: \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\"\n\nBut we need evidence: from doc 001 tokens 681-881 snippet: \"Defendants, Appellants.\" and \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\" and earlier doc 001 header includes \"United States Court of Appeals For the First Circuit\". That may give court.\n\nAlso doc 002 snippet: \"disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" indicates appellate court.\n\nWe should read more to confirm appellate court name.

So evidence.\n\nThus we need to append a new entry.\n\nWe need to call append_checklist with key \"Appeal\" and extracted entry with value and evidence.\n\nWe need evidence: we can use two pieces: from doc 001 tokens 681-881 snippet for parties and appellate court maybe.

And also from doc 001 header: \"United States Court of Appeals For the First Circuit\".\n\nBut the header snippet is tokens 0-133 where we saw \"United States Court of Appeals For the First Circuit\". That can be used.\n\nThus, evidence array: two entries.\n\nWe need location: page numbers? In doc 001 tokens 0-133 is page 1. So location: \"Page 1\". For tokens 681-881, page 1 also.

It likely contains mention of appeal to First Circuit. We need to read a region containing that. The read snippet shows \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" inside. That indicates appeal. But we need to capture parties and court.\n\nIn (002) snippet: \"United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of Massachusetts, case No. 1:25–cv–10787, and paragraph II of the June 23, 2025 order of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, case No. 1:25–cv–10814, are stayed pending the disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". It doesn't mention parties. The parties likely in case heading: \"Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association\". The parties: Institutes of Health (plural) as plaintiffs? Actually \"Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association\" indicates plaintiffs: Institutes of Health (plural) vs. American Public Health Association. So the appeal parties: likely the same parties, but the appeal is from the district court to the First Circuit. So we can produce \"Appeal: Institutes of Health and American Public Health Association appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\" Might need to verify if parties are plaintiffs or defendants. Actually in a case, the appellate parties are the same as the original parties, but the appellant is usually the party that lost in the district court. But we don't know which side appealed. But we can still say \"Appeal by the parties (Institutes of Health and American Public Health Association) to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". The wording \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\" is required.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values. There may be multiple appeals. Possibly other documents mention appeals. Search for \"appeal from\" again or \"appeal to\" across documents. Our search earlier returned only 2 matches: Docket and Memorandum of Law. The Docket match didn't show content. We might need to read the Docket to find appeal details. But the Docket likely contains docket entries referencing appeals. But perhaps not needed if we already captured the main appeal.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have all distinct values. There might be multiple appeals in the docket: e.g., appeal from US district court for first circuit. Possibly also the appeal is from district court to second circuit, but unlikely.\n\nLet's search again for \"appeal from\" across all documents. But we may need to read sections.

Need to verify if any other appeals exist. Search results earlier found matches in various documents. We saw \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" in (002). Also possibly other appeals. Let's search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\" again but maybe longer. But we saw 1 match in (002). Also likely other appeals described in other documents, such as in Complaint or Docket? Search in Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief could contain references to appeals. Also possibly in Memorandum of Law etc.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct appeal values. So far we have one: from (001). Let's capture the evidence snippet for that appeal. We need to look at the part of (001) that contains the appeal. The previous read_document of (001) tokens 1998-2262 includes a paragraph about \"the government appellants here (collectively \"the Department\") then moved the district court for a stay of its order pending appeal, which the district court denied.\" That indicates an appeal but not specifying court. But earlier the search for \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" found a match in (002). That match includes the phrase about stay pending the disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. That indicates an appeal to that court. So we should extract: \"Appeal: Department appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\" But we need to include parties. The snippet earlier: \"the government appellants here (collectively \"the Department\") then moved the district court for a stay of its order pending appeal, which the district court denied.\" So parties: Department (government appellants). Appear. The court: United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nAlso, maybe other appeals: The order (002) may also have mention of \"appeal from\" 3 matches. Search_document_regex earlier found 3 matches in Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion for a Stay of the Court's June 23 Partial Judgments. We might want to read those. Let's search again for \"appeal from\" but maybe we need to capture text. But the search already gave matches. We need to read the context to extract the parties and court. Let's retrieve those matches. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"appeal from\" and top_k maybe 5. But we need the context.

We need to find all distinct values of Appeal. We have found one from (001). We need also to check other documents: (002) might have appeals. Also the memo says \"Defendants seek a stay pending appeal of the Court's June 23, 2025 orders and judgments, ... from the First Circuit.\" That is an appeal. Also the docket may include mention of appeal? The search results for \"appeal to the\" found one in Docket and one in the memorandum of law for preliminary injunction. But we haven't read those. We also have the \"Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\" in (001) (appeal from). That's the one we appended. We need all distinct appeals: For each appeal, we need parties and appellate court. So we need to extract from other documents:\n\n- The memorandum in support of defendants' motion for a stay... includes \"Defendants respectfully seek a stay pending appeal of the Court’s June 23, 2025 orders and judgments, or for a stay of at least 14 days so that Defendants may seek a stay pending appeal from the First Circuit.\" That is an appeal from the district court to the First Circuit. Parties: Defendants (likely the list of defendants). But we should capture the parties as \"Defendants\" or more specific list? The format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]'. The parties are the appealing party/parties. In this memo, the appealing party is Defendants. So \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". Need evidence. We need to read the relevant portion to confirm.\n\nAlso there might be other appeals: The docket maybe has mention of \"Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" - we saw a search for that pattern found 1 match in (002). Let's inspect that match: The search for \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" found 1 match in (002). We haven't read that. We need to read that part to extract the parties. Let's read (002) around that match. We need to find the token position of that match. We can use search_document_regex with pattern \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" and doc_name \"(002)\". That will return the match context. Then we can read to confirm parties.\n\nWe also need to search for \"appeal to the\" in Docket maybe? Search earlier found 1 match in Docket but we didn't read. That might also mention an appeal. The Docket snippet didn't show the appeal phrase; let's search again with pattern \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" maybe. But we saw no matches earlier. The Docket match had only \"appeal to\" but not \"to the\". Let's check again: earlier search for \"appeal to\" found 1 match in Docket, but we didn't read. Let's read that portion to see if it includes parties.\n\nAlso we may need to search for \"appeal from\" in other docs: we saw (001) has \"Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\". That is the one we appended. We may need to check other docs for \"appeal from\" too but likely not.\n\nAlso search for \"appeal to the\" found 2 matches earlier: 1 in Docket, 1 in memorandum of law for preliminary injunction. That memorandum may also mention an appeal. We need to check that.\n\nBut we have to be efficient. Let's search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" in the entire corpus to confirm all matches.\n\nWe have already a match in (002). We should also search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" in Docket? But earlier search for that pattern returned 0. So only (002).\n\nNext search for \"appeal to the\" but maybe we need the parties. The Docket match might include parties? Let's search for \"appeal to\" in Docket again with context. We'll use search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"appeal to\". It earlier found 1 match but we didn't read. Let's retrieve context. We need to read the Docket snippet.

Likely others exist: from (002), from the memorandum, maybe other documents.\n\nWe need to find all distinct appeals: each with parties and appellate court. We need to search for patterns like \"appeal to\". Already searched. There were matches in Docket and in memorandum. Also \"appeal from\" matches. The (002) read excerpt shows \"disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". That implies an appeal pending to First Circuit. Parties? The excerpt mentions \"defendants\" and \"plaintiffs\". But need parties: likely \"defendants\" appealed to First Circuit. That was the motion for stay pending appeal. So the appeal parties: Defendants. Court: United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nAlso in (001) we had \"Defendants, Appellants.\" It might be an appeal from District Court to First Circuit? The excerpt: \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\". So parties: Defendants (Appellants). Court: United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit? Actually the text just shows \"APPEAL FROM ...\" It doesn't mention the appellate court, but the index indicates maybe the appeal to the First Circuit. The (002) shows that.\n\nAlso maybe there is an appeal from the First Circuit? But not.\n\nAlso in the memorandum: \"Defendants respectfully seek a stay pending appeal of the Court’s June 23, 2025, orders and judgments, or for a stay of at least 14 days so that Defendants may seek a stay pending appeal from the First Circuit.\" So again parties: Defendants. Court: United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nAlso maybe other documents contain \"appeal to\" but we haven't seen them. We could search again for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" but already did. Maybe \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\" but no matches. Maybe \"appeal to the First Circuit\" but not found. But we have at least two distinct appeals: one from the District Court to First Circuit by Defendants. Another maybe from the First Circuit to some higher court? Unlikely.\n\nBut maybe there is an appeal by Plaintiffs? The earlier search results show \"Defendants, Appellants.\" So the appeal parties are Defendants. So likely only one distinct appeal.\n\nBut the requirement: extract every distinct value. If only one, then we already have it. But we need to confirm that there are no other appeals. Let's search \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\" etc. But we can search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for\" with variations. But we can do a broad search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\" again. But earlier search returned no matches. But maybe the text had \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" which we found in (002). So maybe just that.\n\nAlso in the docket, maybe there is mention of appeal to First Circuit. But not.\n\nThus likely only one appeal.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have the parties and court. We have evidence from (001) and (002). We should create one extracted value: \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\" But we need to include parties: \"Defendants\" and the court.\n\nLet's search again for \"Defendants, Appellants.\" to confirm parties. The excerpt from (001) includes:\n\n\"Defendants, Appellants.\" So parties: Defendants.\n\nThus we can produce one entry.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have evidence: we have evidence from (001) tokens 681-881 shows \"Defendants, Appellants.\" Also from (002) tokens 300-800 show mention of appeal in U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. We can provide evidence from both documents.\n\nWe have already appended one value earlier. But we may need to update if we want to refine. The earlier appended value likely used same evidence. But the instruction says we need to extract all distinct values. If only one distinct, then we are done. But we need to check if there is another distinct appeal. Let's search in remaining partially visited documents for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" pattern again. Maybe in the memorandum we saw earlier.

But maybe there are more appeals in other documents. We need to extract all distinct appeals. We have seen references to appeals in (002) referencing United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, but did we extract? The earlier append likely had from (001). We need check other documents.\n\nWe have partial coverage for many docs. We should search for \"appeal\" maybe more matches in other docs. Already did search_document_regex earlier but maybe we need to read those matches to extract more appeals.\n\nThe search results earlier: Step 17 shows matches in (001) and the memorandum. Those include \"Defendants, Appellants\" and \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\" etc. Also the memorandum shows Defendants seeking stay pending appeal from First Circuit. Also (002) shows the appeal in US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nWe need to extract each distinct value: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nSo we need list of appeals: \n1. From (001): likely some appeal by Defendants (maybe National Institutes of Health etc.) from US District Court for District of Massachusetts to US Court of Appeals for First Circuit.\n\nBut check the text: in Step 17 snippet: \"Defendants, Appellants.\" Then \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\". So parties: Defendants (list of institutes). Court: US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. But the snippet doesn't explicitly say \"to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" but earlier we saw a search for that phrase in (002). That indicates the appeal is to that court. So we might extract: \"Appeal: Defendants (National Institutes of Health, etc.) appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\" But we need to confirm.\n\nAlso (002) likely contains an appeal of both partial final judgments to US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The snippet shows \"disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". So we can record: \"Appeal: Defendants (National Institutes of Health, etc.) appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\" Also maybe there is an appeal by Plaintiffs? Search for \"appeal\" in Plaintiffs' Motion? Might not.\n\nThus we need to read the relevant sections in (001) and (002) and also the memorandum to capture all parties.\n\nWe have already read (001) tokens 681-881 which contains the list of institutes and \"Defendants, Appellants.\" That snippet is good. We might need to read more around to see if it lists the appellate court. But maybe the appellate court is mentioned elsewhere. We have read (001) tokens 1998-2262 which might include references to the appeal. Let's search again in (001) for \"United States Court of Appeals\" or \"First Circuit\". But we only have parts of (001). Might need to read more tokens.\n\nAlso read (002) tokens 300-800 includes the appeal mention. So we can extract from (002). Let's read (002) tokens 300-800, which we already have, containing the appeal mention. That snippet includes the phrase \"disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". Good.\n\nNow we need to extract the parties: In (002) snippet, parties are \"NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH v. AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSN.\" and also \"BARRETT, J., concurring\". But the appeal is by defendants? The snippet says \"Defendants, Appellants.\" So the parties are National Institutes of Health, etc. But we might need to list the parties as they appear: \"National Institutes of Health, et al.\".\n\nWe should also extract the appeal in the memorandum. The memorandum snippet shows \"Defendants respectfully seek a stay pending appeal of the Court’s June 23, 2025, orders and judgments, or for a stay of at least 14 days so that Defendants may seek a stay pending appeal from the First Circuit.\" This indicates the appeal is from the First Circuit. The parties are same as above.\n\nThus we will produce two entries? Actually there may be one appeal; but we might want separate entries for each distinct appeal. But the parties are same; maybe we consider each court citation as a distinct appeal? The requirement is \"EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the same appeal appears in multiple documents, we should only have one entry. So we should deduplicate. We have one appeal: Defendants (National Institutes of Health, etc.) appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. So we need one entry.\n\nBut we need confirm that the parties are indeed the defendants listed. We need to capture the exact value.\n\nFrom (001) snippet: lists many institutes. We should capture the entire list? The value format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So we can produce: 'Appeal: National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute of Nursing Research, National Library of Medicine, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, John E. Fogarty International Center for Advanced Study in the Health Sciences, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, and Center for Scientific Review appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.'\n\nBut we must ensure evidence snippet includes the parties list and appellate court. The parties list snippet is in (001) tokens 681-881. The appellate court snippet is in (002) tokens 300-800. We can provide evidence from both.\n\nThus we need to append an entry with evidence from both documents.\n\nWe should read more tokens in (001) to capture the full list. The snippet includes the list. Good.\n\nWe should also read (002) tokens 300-800 again to ensure we capture the appellate court. Already have snippet. We'll use that.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with key \"Appeal\", extracted value as described, evidence from (001) tokens 681-881 and (002) tokens 300-800.\n\nBut we need to ensure no duplicate. The current extracted value likely is from (001) only? The earlier append maybe included something else. Let's check: earlier at Step 6, they appended 1 value. But we don't know what that value was. It might be the same. But to be safe, we should check if that value is already there. But we cannot query checklist. We can call get_checklist to see if the key already has values. That might be better. But the instructions say we may use get_checklist. It might be efficient. Let's call get_checklist for 'Appeal'.\n\nWe can do get_checklist to see current values.

But need to extract all distinct values of Appeal from any document. We have only 1 extracted value: from (001). But we likely have more appeals. We saw earlier from search results: In Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion for a Stay ... there was \"Defendants respectfully seek a stay pending appeal of the Court’s June 23, 2025, orders and judgments, or for a stay of at least 14 days so that Defendants may seek a stay pending appeal from the First Circuit.\" Also earlier, in the \"Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\" we have \"Defendants, Appellants.\" So there might be appeals by Defendants to the First Circuit. Also possibly the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction might involve an appeal? Let's search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" we saw match in (002) - but that was about stay pending the disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Does it specify parties? It might be about the appeal from the district court, but the parties? The text snippet didn't include parties. The earlier search for \"appeal from\" found the match in (001) with parties: Defendants, Appellants. That is an appeal from the district court. The other \"appeal from\" matches in the memorandum for stay: presumably Defendants appealing from the First Circuit? Actually the wording: \"Defendants respectfully seek a stay pending appeal of the Court’s June 23, 2025, orders and judgments, or for a stay of at least 14 days so that Defendants may seek a stay pending appeal from the First Circuit.\" That indicates appeal from the First Circuit? Wait: \"pending appeal from the First Circuit\" means the appeal is pending from the First Circuit to higher? Actually if they are appealing to the First Circuit, then the appeal is pending from the First Circuit? The phrasing is ambiguous. The earlier snippet: \"Defendants respectfully seek a stay pending appeal of the Court’s June 23, 2025, orders and judgments, or for a stay of at least 14 days so that Defendants may seek a stay pending appeal from the First Circuit.\" Means the appeal is from the First Circuit; they are appealing from the First Circuit to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit? That doesn't make sense because the First Circuit is the appellate court. Might be they are appealing from the First Circuit to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit? Actually the First Circuit is the appellate court; so \"pending appeal from the First Circuit\" means the appeal is pending from the First Circuit to a higher court? But there is no higher court. So maybe it's \"stay pending appeal from the First Circuit\" meaning they want a stay pending the appeal from the First Circuit to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit? That would be redundant. So perhaps it's \"stay pending appeal from the First Circuit\" meaning the appeal is pending to the First Circuit; so the parties are appealing from the district court to the First Circuit. So the parties are the Defendants. So we have an appeal: Defendants appealing to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Similarly, the earlier match in (001) says \"Defendants, Appellants. APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\". That implies the parties are Defendants, Appellants. So we have one appeal: Defendants appealing to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. But what about the parties? Could be also \"Defendants, Appellants\" for that appeal. Also maybe the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction could involve an appeal? Not sure.\n\nWe should search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\" maybe other matches. Search for \"appeal to the United States\" etc. But we already saw 0 matches for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\". But maybe other pattern: \"appeal to the\". We saw no matches. But earlier search for \"appeal to\" found matches in Docket and memorandum of law. But those might not contain the court name. But we may need to find explicit \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" to confirm parties. We saw that snippet in (002). That snippet didn't include parties. But the earlier \"appeal from\" snippet included parties.\n\nThus we have at least one appeal: Defendants, Appellants, appealing to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\nBut maybe there are multiple appeals: e.g., other parties like \"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH\" maybe appealing? In the \"appeal from\" snippet, the parties listed are \"Defendants, Appellants.\" That is one appeal.\n\nAlso, the \"appeal from\" snippet shows \"Defendants, Appellants.\" That indicates the parties are Defendants; they are appealing. So the appeal is already captured. But we might need to extract the value: \"Appeal: Defendants, Appellants appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\" But the requirement: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" So we need to format accordingly.\n\nWe have only one value currently. The question: Are there more distinct appeals? We need to check if there are appeals by plaintiffs or other parties. Search for \"appeal of\" might find other. But maybe also \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" appears again. Let's search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" again. We saw only one match. But maybe other documents contain \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" with different parties. But likely not.\n\nLet's search for \"appeal to the\" generally. In Docket we saw match, but no parties. That may not be relevant.\n\nAlso, \"appeal from\" else? The earlier match in (001) is one. The others in memorandum for stay are also part of the same appeal (Defendants). So we have possibly one distinct appeal.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have all appeals. The earlier step 20 indicated that only 1 value for Appeal was extracted. So perhaps we need to add another? But maybe the earlier extraction of one value was incomplete: maybe we extracted the appeal incorrectly? Let's examine the earlier extracted value: It seems from (001) tokens 681-881. The snippet shows parties: \"Defendants, Appellants.\" But the actual extracted value might have been something like \"Defendants, Appellants appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\" But maybe we didn't capture the court? Wait the snippet in 001 includes only the parties and the court: \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\". That does not include the appellate court. So we might need to find the appellate court in the same document. Perhaps earlier read of (001) from tokens 1998-2262 might include the appellate court mention. Let's check that snippet: It might contain the court name. But we didn't extract. So we need to read more of (001) to confirm the appellate court. But we have already read tokens 1998-2262 earlier. That snippet may contain the appellate court. But we didn't see it. It might be part of the heading of the opinion. But we might need to confirm.\n\nLet's search for \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" in (001). We can do a regex search in (001) for that phrase. That will return the match.

So next action: search_document_regex on Docket for \"appeal to\" with context to get snippet. Or maybe read specific token ranges around that match. We saw earlier search_document_regex on Docket (pattern: \"appeal to\") found 1 match. We should read that part. But we also need to ensure we get all appeals. Maybe there are other appeals in other documents. Let's search again for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\" across all documents. We did earlier and found none. But maybe other circuits? \"appeal to the\" blank. Let's search \"appeal to the\" again; earlier found none. So likely only First Circuit. But there might be appeal from to another court? We saw earlier \"appeal from\" matches. That could be \"appeal from the United States District Court\". Those likely refer to appeals from district court to appellate court. Might be same appeal. We need to extract each distinct value. So we already have one: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\" We need parties: possibly \"NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\" vs \"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION\" etc. The snippet shows \"NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH v. AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSN.\" So parties: National Institutes of Health and American Public Health Association. But the appeal is from district court. So we should capture that.\n\nMaybe also other appeals in the docket or other documents. Let's search docket for \"appeal to\" again but we already did. But we should read that snippet. Let's do search_document_regex on Docket for \"appeal to\" with context. That will give snippet. We have to then append new value.\n\nAlso check if Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief might mention appeals? Search for \"appeal\" we did earlier but found no relevant mention of appeals. So likely only appeal is the First Circuit.\n\nBut let's be thorough: search all documents for \"appeal to the\" again maybe omitted. We did earlier and got none. But maybe pattern \"appeal to the\" was not found because of line breaks. But we can search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the\" maybe we already did. So it's likely only that one.\n\nThus we need to add the appeal from (002) as well. But we may have already appended from (001). Wait step 6 appended 1 value from (001). That likely was the appeal. Actually step 13 read (001) tokens 1998-2262, which likely included the appeal text. So we already have one appeal. But we might have to ensure that we have all appeals. Is there another appeal in (002)? The snippet in (002) also references appeal in the First Circuit. But the same appeal may be repeated. But we should treat as same distinct value. Should we duplicate? No, we should not duplicate. So if the appeal is the same, no need to add. But we need to make sure we didn't miss if (002) indicates a different appeal. Let's read (002) token 450-700 snippet we saw earlier. It shows the same sentence. So it's same appeal. So no new value.\n\nBut there might be other appeals in other documents (maybe the docket mentions an appeal). Let's search docket again. Search_document_regex on Docket pattern \"appeal to\" was found earlier. It says 1 match. Let's read that to confirm. So we need to read the relevant token range in Docket. The search result likely includes context tokens. But we need to read the tokens around that match. The snippet earlier shows tokens 17061-17635, 17880-18174 partially visited. But which of those contains the match? Not sure. But we can search again for \"appeal to\" specifically in Docket. Let's do search_document_regex on Docket pattern \"appeal to\".

But we need all distinct appeals across all documents. Steps 22-26 show multiple searches for \"appeal\" and \"appeal to\". We need to identify if there are additional appeals. We have already extracted one appeal: maybe \"v. AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSN.\" appeal to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. That is one. Are there others? Search for appeals in other documents: \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\" maybe. But we saw none. There might be appeals in other documents like \"Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" in (002) we saw. But that is the same appeal? Let's read more context to see if it's the same or a different case. Could be a second appeal: same 1:25-cv-10787 or 1:25-cv-10814. But the case number is different. The text in (002) refers to stay pending disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. That indicates there is an appeal pending. So we need to extract this appeal too. We already have one appeal from (001) (the appeal in that document). But the text in (001) maybe also mentions the appeal. But we need to confirm. The initial appended value from (001) probably captured \"NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH v. AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSN.\" appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. That may be the same appeal referenced in (002). But we need to extract all distinct appeals; this may be the same. But we need distinct values. So if same, only one record. But maybe there is also an appeal in \"Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment\" or \"Memorandum\" documents. We should search for \"appeal\" pattern again but maybe we should specify patterns like \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the\". Already searched. But maybe there is \"appeal from\" references to other courts. We could search for \"appeal from the United States District Court\". But we need the appellate court. So maybe also \"appeal from the Court of Appeals\". But we might need to search for \"appeal from\" pattern.\n\nBut we should read the (001) to capture all appeal details.

We have read tokens 0-133, 681-881, 1998-2262, 2371-2571, 5547-5832, 7575-7775, 13937-15434. The appended value was 1. Could there be another appeal mention in those tokens? Let's search for \"appeal\" again in (001) but maybe we need to read more tokens to capture other appeals. We could search for \"appeal\" pattern in (001) again to see if any other matches exist beyond the ones we already read. But we have already searched entire documents for \"appeal\". The search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"appeal\" found 66 matches: 9 in (001), 10 in (002), 7 in Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (+6 more docs). So there are 9 matches in (001). We read some sections, but maybe we didn't cover all 9. We need to find all appeals. But we probably only captured one. There may be other appeals in (001) such as appeals to other circuits or state courts. Let's search for \"appeal to the\" pattern again in (001). We already searched for \"appeal to the\" globally and found none. But maybe \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" appears only once. But there might be other appeals to other circuits. Let's search within (001) for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\". But we did search globally and found none. So likely only one appeal in (001). But there are 9 matches in (001) for \"appeal\" which might include other references like \"appeal from\" or \"appeal to\" or \"appeal to the\" etc. But the actual appeal may be only one.\n\nWe need to examine other documents for additional appeals. Search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" globally found only match in (002). But we also need to check for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the\" with other circuits: maybe \"Second Circuit\", etc. But search pattern \"United States Court of Appeals for the [A-Za-z]+ Circuit\" found only one match in (002). So likely only that appeal. But maybe there are appeals to other courts like \"appeal to the Court of Appeals of Massachusetts\" etc. But search for \"appeal to the Court of Appeals\" might find.

We should search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" again might yield multiple matches. Step 21 found one match in (002). Step 23 found 5 matches in Complaint. Step 24 found one match in (002). So we need to read those contexts.\n\nWe should read token ranges in (002) where match occurs. But we don't know token range. We can search again with regex to get context. Use search_document_regex on (002) for pattern \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". Already did step 21 and 24. We can do again to get context. Let's call search_document_regex to get context. That will provide context tokens. Then parse.\n\nAlso for Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, we need to find appeals. We saw matches but not context. Let's search that doc for same pattern to get context. Then read.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for pattern \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" and maybe \"appeal to\" to capture.\n\nLet's do search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\" across Complaint. Also \"appeal from the United States District Court\". We'll use search_document_regex with doc_names array including Complaint... and pattern.\n\nWe'll do one search that includes both patterns? We can search for \"appeal\" might bring many but we want context. Maybe better to search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\" in Complaint. Also \"appeal from the United States District Court\". Let's just search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\" in Complaint. That should capture any appeal.\n\nAlso we need to capture the parties: e.g., from (001) we had appeal from Defendants to First Circuit. For (002) it might be appeal from? Let's see step 25 snippet shows \"The Government may raise its arguments ... pending the disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". It doesn't mention parties. Maybe earlier in (002) there is mention of who is appealing. We need to read earlier part of (002) near that phrase. So search that phrase and get context.\n\nAlso for Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, we need to read context of appeal.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Complaint and (002) for phrase. We'll get two results. Use doc_names array. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\" (002)\"],\"pattern\":\"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", " (002)"], "pattern": "United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8137, "completion_tokens": 804, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But likely there are more appeals in other documents: for example, in memorandum for stay of court's June 23 partial judgments, there is mention of \"stay pending appeal from the First Circuit\". Also other documents may mention appeals, e.g., \"appeal from district court\" etc. We need to extract all distinct values of appeal: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\". We must find all unique appeals across all documents.\n\nCurrent extracted: from (001) we saw \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\". The extracted value likely is something like \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" or maybe \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". But we need to examine the extracted value from step 6.\n\nWe haven't seen the exact value. But we need to add any new appeals. We have search results showing appeals mention in other documents: e.g., \"Defendants respectfully seek a stay pending appeal of the Court’s June 23, 2025 orders and judgments, or for a stay of at least 14 days so that Defendants may seek a stay pending appeal from the First Circuit.\" Also \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" is present in (002) snippet.\n\nAlso \"Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\" appears in (001). That is an appeal from the district court to the First Circuit likely. But the standard extracted format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]'. So for the (001) we glean: \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". Also maybe \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" from the memorandum for stay.\n\nWe need to search for other matches. We have search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"appeal to the\" and found 0 matches. But pattern \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\" had no matches. But we saw \"appeal to the First Circuit\" patterns? Search \"appeal to the First Circuit\"? Not done. But we might find other appeals.\n\nWe have snippet from (002) showing \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" appears. But the snippet didn't show an explicit appeal statement. Might be a reference to pending appeal. Might need to read more.\n\nWe also have Docket: 1 match of \"appeal to\" but snippet shows docket info, not an appeal statement. That might be a docket entry for appeal? But the snippet didn't show details.\n\nGiven we have extracted 1 value, but likely more. We need to read more of (002) around tokens 475-675 where the appeal mention appears. The snippet shows \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". We should read more context around that to confirm an appeal. The snippet: \"United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of Massachusetts, case No. 1:25–cv–10787, and paragraph II of the June 23, 2025 order... are stayed pending the disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". So that is an appeal pending: \"appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". But who is appealing? The parties: the plaintiffs? The defendants? The context: The memorandum is for defendants' motion for stay pending appeal. So the defendants are seeking a stay pending appeal. The \"appeal\" is presumably by the defendants? But the appeal is pending by the defendants? The text: \"Defendants respectfully seek a stay pending appeal of the Court’s June 23, 2025 orders and judgments... so that Defendants may seek a stay pending appeal from the First Circuit.\" So the appeal is by the defendants. But we need \"parties\" e.g., \"Defendants\" or \"Plaintiffs\". In (001), the parties are plaintiffs. The extracted value likely \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\".\n\nIn (002) we need \"Appeal: Defendants appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". But we must confirm from text.\n\nAlso maybe there are appeals from other parties in other documents. The search results show 66 matches for \"appeal\" across many docs. But we only extracted one. We need to locate each distinct appeal.\n\nWe should read the memorandum for stay more thoroughly. That document is partially visited but only 35% coverage. We saw snippet of the first match; we should read further around tokens near 82-453. But we might need to open more tokens to see the context of the appeal. Let's read more of that document.\n\nWe should also search for \"appeal from the United States District Court\" in (002) to see if there is explicit appeal statement. Let's search that.\n\nAlso for \"appeal to the first circuit\" maybe.\n\nWe can do a search_document_regex on (002) pattern \"appeal from\" again? Already done: earlier search in (002) found 0 matches? Actually step 21: search_document_regex on (002) pattern \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\", found 1 match. Step 22: search_document_regex on (001) pattern \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" found 0. Step 24: search_document_regex on all docs pattern \"United States Court of Appeals for the [A-Za-z]+ Circuit\" found 1 match in (002). So only (002) has the mention.\n\nThus we need to read (002) around that match to extract the parties. Let's read tokens 400-800 maybe. Already read 300-800 earlier. Let's inspect that 300-800 snippet: step 16 read_document 300-800. It might contain the phrase. Let's retrieve that snippet to see. But we don't have the content. We can read again with more context. Let's read 400-900 maybe.\n\nAlso read more of the memorandum for stay to confirm the parties.\n\nAlso need to check if there are appeals in other docs like \"Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\". Search for \"appeal\" pattern gave 5 matches? Step 29 had search in that doc? Actually step 29 searched \"appeal\" in the memorandum for stay. Step 25? Wait: Step 29 search did not mention the other doc. That was the memorandum for stay.\n\nBut we should check the \"Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" for appeals. Did we search there? Step 21 had search for \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" pattern in (002). Not relevant. Step 29 search for \"appeal\" was on the memorandum for stay. Step 28 search for \"appeal\" in (001). The other docs might have appeals too.\n\nWe could search for \"appeal to the\" on all docs again? We did and found 0. But maybe the phrase \"appeal to\" is used. But we saw earlier step 8: search_document_regex on all docs pattern \"appeal to\" found 2 matches: 1 in Docket, 1 in memorandum for preliminary injunction. That might contain appeals. Let's examine those matches.\n\nWe haven't seen the content of those matches. We need to read them. Which documents? Docket match: we saw snippet earlier? Actually step 8: search_document_regex on all docs pattern \"appeal to\" found 2 matches: 1 in Docket, 1 in Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction. We need to read those.\n\nWe should read the Docket match: token range 17422-17622. We saw snippet earlier but not the specific phrase. That snippet shows docket info but not the appeal. It might be an appeal docket entry.\n\nWe need to read that snippet fully. Let's read Docket tokens 17422-17635 or 17422-17670 to see the context.\n\nAlso read the memorandum of law tokens around the match. We don't know the token range. But we can search again for \"appeal to\" in that doc with context tokens maybe 200? But we can search again and get top matches.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Docket pattern \"appeal to\" to get match context. But we already did that search. We can request the match context again. But we can just read the tokens range 17422-17635 that we saw snippet. We need to read that region. Let's do read_document on Docket tokens 17400-17650 maybe.\n\nAlso read the memorandum of law tokens around the match. But we don't know the match location. We can search again for \"appeal to\" on that doc with context 200 tokens.\n\nLet's plan: Call search_document_regex on Docket pattern \"appeal to\" again but with maybe top_k 1. Then read that region.\n\nThen call search_document_regex on the memorandum for preliminary injunction doc pattern \"appeal to\" again to get match region.\n\nBut we may also need to search for \"appeal from\" in that doc.\n\nBut let's start with Docket.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Docket tokens 17400-17650. Because we have seen snippet 17422-17622. Let's read 17400-17650.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":17400,\"end_token\":17650}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 17400, "end_token": 17650}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8146, "completion_tokens": 2029, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS”. The checklist item requires the format 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' We have parties: \"Defendants, Appellants.\" The appellate court: \"United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\" is actually the lower court? Wait \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\" indicates appeal from that court. The appellate court likely is United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. But the extracted value might need to mention that the appeal is to the First Circuit. We saw earlier mentions: search results show matches referencing First Circuit. Need to extract all distinct appeals. There might be multiple appeals: from (001) we have one: Defendants, Appellants. Appeal from District Court to First Circuit. There's also likely an appeal by plaintiffs? But the document indicates \"Defendants, Appellants\" are appealing. Also, \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" is mentioned in multiple documents. Also, in Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion for a Stay of the Court's June 23 Partial Judgments they mention \"stay pending appeal from the First Circuit.\" That indicates an appeal pending to First Circuit.\n\nAlso, in (002) we have mention of \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" in a stay. So we might need to capture that as an appeal: \"Defendants, Appellants\" appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. There's also maybe an appeal by the plaintiffs? Not sure.\n\nWe need to extract every distinct value. So we should look through documents for \"appeal\" patterns that indicate parties and court.\n\nFrom earlier search, we saw matches 1-9 in (001). Only match 2 seems to have parties and court: \"Defendants, Appellants. APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\". That indicates the parties (Defendants, Appellants). Court lower: District Court. But the appellate court might be implied: The appeal goes to First Circuit. But the text does not explicitly say \"appeal to the First Circuit\" there; but there is \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" elsewhere.\n\nIn (002) we saw a match 1 in search for \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\". That text is about stay pending appeal. But does it specify parties? It mentions \"United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" but not parties.\n\nWe need to find if there is explicit mention of appeal parties and target court. The pattern might be from (001) \"Defendants, Appellants.\" and \"APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\". That indicates the parties and the lower court. But the appellate court is not stated in that sentence. But maybe earlier in the document it's stated that the appeal is to the First Circuit. The earlier part of (001) had \"United States Court of Appeals For the First Circuit\" at the top of the document. So that indicates the appellate court. So we can combine: Parties: Defendants, Appellants. Appear to First Circuit. The text may not be in the same sentence but we can still form the value.\n\nBut the requirement: \"Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\". We need to provide evidence for both parties and court. So we need evidence snippets showing parties and court. We can provide two evidence snippets: one snippet containing parties, another containing court. That's allowed.\n\nWe also need to capture other appeals if exist. Search for \"appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\" found only in (002) and (001) maybe earlier. There's also \"appeal to the Court of Appeals\" search returned 0. \"appeal to the Court of Appeals\" returned 0. So only First Circuit. There might be \"appeal to the Court of Appeals\" but not found.\n\nAlso, \"appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\" is from (001). That indicates the lower court, not the appellate court. But the appellate court is known from document heading. We can still include it. There is also \"appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\" maybe repeated elsewhere? Let's search again: step 28 had that part.\n\nAlso, \"appeal from the United States District Court\" appears in (001) match 2. In other documents, maybe \"appeal from the United States District Court\" repeated? Not sure.\n\nAlso, \"appeal from the United States Court of Federal Claims\" may appear but not relevant.\n\nWe should search for \"appeal from the United States District Court\" in all documents. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"appeal from the United States District Court\". Already search in step 27 for \"appeal to the Court of Appeals\" returned 0. But we can search for this pattern again.
