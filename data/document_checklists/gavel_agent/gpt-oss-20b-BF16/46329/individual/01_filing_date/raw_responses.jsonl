But maybe the pattern didn't capture. Could search for \"Filed\" with colon or \"filed on\". Let's search more broadly for \"filed\" with regex ignoring case. But we must avoid too broad. We can search for \"filed\" word boundaries. But we did a search for \"\\bfiled\\b\" and got 0. Maybe the text uses \"filing\" or \"Filing\". Search for \"filing\". Let's search for \"filing\" or \"Filed\". Use pattern \"(?i)filing\" maybe. But risk many hits. We could search for \"Filed\" pattern in Complaint, but we did. Maybe the Complaint has a heading like \"Filed: 4/2/2025\". We should read more of the Complaint near start. We read 0-4000 tokens earlier, but that covered 11% of document. The filing date might be after token 4000 or before 0, but we didn't read before 0. The Complaint is 35k tokens. We only read 0-4000. The filing date might be at the very start, before token 0? Actually start token 0 is earliest. Maybe the filing date is after 4000. We haven't read entire document. We need to find all Filing_Date. The Docket shows multiple dates. But the Filing_Date should be the initial filing date of the lawsuit. That is likely 04/02/2025. But there may be other filings, like the Motion for Preliminary Injunction filed later. But the checklist expects distinct Filing_Date values. But the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if other documents contain filing dates for other filings, we also need to capture them? The Filing_Date is defined as the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court. So probably only one date: the first filing. But other documents may mention \"Filed: 4/7/2025\" or \"Filed: 4/10/2025\" but those might be subsequent filings. The instruction says \"first filed/initiated\". So we might only need the first filing date. But to be safe, we should check if any other documents mention a filing date earlier than 04/02/2025? Unlikely. But check docket entries: earliest is 04/02/2025. The docket entry tokens 25-225 mention \"filed by American Public Health Association\" but no date. The start of docket tokens 25-225 includes \"filed by ... (Entered: 04/02/2025)\". That indicates filing date. So we may have only one value. But we should still search for \"filed\" in other documents to see if any earlier date appears. But it's likely not. We might proceed to stop. But we must confirm that no other documents have earlier filing date. We could search for \"filed\" in the Complaint and other documents. But search on Complaint returned 0. But maybe the Complaint uses \"Filed:\" in the heading. But we didn't search for \"Filed:\" pattern. Let's search for \"Filed:\" in Complaint. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"Filed:\" maybe with optional spaces. Use pattern \"Filed\\s*:\".\n\nBut maybe the complaint uses \"Filed:\" with capital F. We can use regex \"(?i)Filed\\s*:\". Let's do search_document_regex on Complaint with that pattern. That will return matches. Then if any dates appear, we capture them. But we should create evidence for the date. But we already have evidence from Docket. If we find another date, we must add that. But if it's same date, no need to duplicate. But we must ensure distinct values. If same date appears, we should not duplicate. But if we find a later date, but that's not the first filing, we shouldn't include? But spec says all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. The definition of the item is \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So later filings not relevant. So we should only capture the first filing date. Thus only one value. But we need to confirm that the docket entry indeed is the first filing. The docket entry has \"filed by American Public Health Association, ... (Entered: 04/02/2025)\". That is the filing date. So yes.\n\nThus we can stop. But check if we need to search for any other documents that might contain a \"Filed\" date earlier. Unlikely. But to be safe, we can search for \"filed\" in all documents to see if any earlier date appears. But since we already have evidence of first filing, we can stop.\n\nThus next action: stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct Filing_Date values (04/02/2025) have been extracted with supporting evidence.\"\n}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct Filing_Date values (04/02/2025) have been extracted with supporting evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8960, "completion_tokens": 1145, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Use regex for dates in format mm/dd/yyyy or month day, year. But maybe the filing date appears as \"Filed\" or \"Filed on\" etc. The pattern used earlier didn't find matches. But maybe there are dates like \"April 2, 2025\" etc.\n\nWe can search all documents for \"April 2, 2025\" or \"04/02/2025\". But we already found 04/02/2025. There might be other filing dates for other documents (e.g., the complaint might have a filing date, the orders might have docket dates). The filing date of the lawsuit is the date the complaint was filed. That is likely the same across many documents. But there might be multiple filings: e.g., initial complaint, supplemental complaint, etc. We need all distinct filing dates found in any document. So we might need to search for all dates in documents and capture those that are associated with filing.\n\nBetter approach: search all documents for \"Filed\" followed by date. Use regex: \"(Filed|filed|Filing Date|filing date)\\s*[:\\-]?\\s*(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}|[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4})\". They did earlier on all docs and found no matches. But maybe the date appears differently, like \"filed on 4/2/2025\", or \"filed 4/2/2025\". The earlier regex didn't include \"on\". We can modify regex: \"(?:filed|Filed|Filing Date|filing date|filed on)\\s*(?:on\\s*)?(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}|[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4})\". Let's search across all docs.\n\nWe also need to capture other dates like \"June 23, 2025\" etc but not filing. But we only need filing dates.\n\nLet's search all docs with regex that includes \"filed\" and date.\n\nAlso maybe there is \"filed with the court on\" etc. Let's use regex that looks for \"filed\" word and date.\n\nWe can use regex: \"(?i)(filed)\\s*(?:on\\s+)?(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}|[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4})\".

We should search remaining documents for filing dates. We saw no matches in earlier regex search on all documents. But maybe some documents have date in other format. Could be \"Filed on April 2, 2025\" or \"April 2, 2025\". Our regex earlier may not catch. But we can search again with a more inclusive pattern: maybe \"Filed on\" or \"Filed:\" preceded by any.

The docket may have multiple entries with filing dates. We saw step 6 found 5 matches in Docket. Might be multiple docket entries. But only one was appended. So maybe there are multiple filing dates in docket. Need to read more of docket. We have partially visited docket tokens 25-2500. We should read further portions to find all filing dates.

Which one was extracted? Step 8 appended 1 value. We need to find all distinct values from docket. Let's get the search results from step 6? We have no details.

But maybe \"Filing Fee\" etc. But filing date might be in the complaint header. Let's search for \"Date:\" or \"Filing Date\" in Complaint. Use regex. Let's search complaint for pattern \"Filing\" or \"filed\". We saw step10 search for \"filed\" found 0 matches. But maybe \"Filed\" with capital? Already searched. Maybe \"Filed:\"? Let's search complaint for \"Filed:\" pattern. Use regex. Also search for \"Filed\" not part of \"filed\". Let's attempt search_document_regex on Complaint for pattern \"\\bFiled\\b\". That was step10. 0 matches. Maybe \"Filing\" appears. Search for \"Filing\". Step2 had pattern with \"Filing\" but found none. However maybe the complaint header contains \"Filed: 04/02/2025\" but we didn't capture due to pattern. Let's search for \"04/02/2025\" directly. Search in Complaint. That may find dates. Let's search for \"\\b04/02/2025\\b\". Use regex. Also maybe \"April 2, 2025\". Search. Let's do search_document_regex on Complaint for pattern \"(April\\s+2,\\s+2025|04/02/2025)\". But we need to choose one action. We can search all documents for date patterns. But we already did many searches. But maybe we need to read more of the docket beyond 2500 tokens to see earlier date? We saw docket's earliest match at tokens 25-225. That likely contains the filing fee and \"filed\" etc. But maybe the docket at earlier tokens might contain the filing date earlier. But the docket start at token 25; maybe earlier tokens before 25 not read. We might need to read from 0 to 25. But the docket view we had tokens 25-2500. So we haven't read tokens 0-25.

However, requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have only found one value 04/02/2025. But we should verify if any other documents contain filing dates. The docket shows multiple entries with 04/02/2025. Might be the same date. But maybe other documents like complaint may have a filing date earlier or same. Need to check all documents for any filing date. The extraction so far used search regex on docket and complaint. But not on other documents. There might be a filing date in the complaint itself. The complaint may include \"Filed: April 2, 2025\" in the header. Let's search all documents for \"Filed:\" or \"filed\" with date. We did search regex earlier but not all documents after step 13. Step 13 search regex on all documents had 0 matches for pattern \"(?i)(filed)\\s*(?:on\\s+)?(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}|[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4})\" and found 0. That implies maybe the complaint didn't have such pattern. But maybe the complaint used different date format like \"April 2, 2025\" or \"4/02/2025\". But the regex should catch both. It didn't, maybe because the complaint is not in the search results due to some reason. But we can search again. Or maybe the complaint uses \"Filed: 04/02/2025\" but our regex may need to account for spaces. The pattern \"(?i)(filed)\\s*(?:on\\s+)?(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}|[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4})\" should catch \"filed 04/02/2025\" or \"filed 4/2/2025\". It didn't find any matches. So maybe the complaint doesn't have any filing date text. But the docket shows the filing date. Maybe there is no other filing date. However, the problem states \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have only one date. But we need to confirm if there might be other documents with a filing date of the same or different date. The docket shows multiple entries with same date 04/02/2025. Perhaps the complaint itself may have a date in the header like \"April 2, 2025\" but not captured. But we can search again with a broader pattern. Let's search for \"2025-04-02\" pattern. But we already did search for \\b\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\\b and found 10 matches in docket. But maybe other documents have \"2025-04-02\" or \"April 2, 2025\". Let's search all documents for \"2025-04-02\" or \"April 2, 2025\" or \"04/02/2025\". Use regex search_document_regex on all docs for pattern \"04/02/2025\" or \"2025-04-02\". But we can also search for \"2025\" and \"April\" etc. But we need to find filing dates. Maybe the docket is the only source. But we need to confirm no other filing date. The complaint may have \"Filed: 2025-04-02\" but the regex would catch \"2025-04-02\"? Our earlier regex didn't include hyphen format; only slash or month name. So maybe we should search for hyphen format. Let's do a search on all docs for pattern \"\\b2025-04-02\\b\". We'll search all docs. Also maybe \"April 2, 2025\" pattern. But we did earlier search for month day year. That didn't find. But maybe the complaint uses \"04/02/2025\" with leading zeros? Should catch. But didn't. Maybe the complaint is not scanned properly. But maybe it's in a different token range not yet read. The complaint has 35k tokens; we read 0-4000. The filing date might be outside that range, maybe later. But usually filing date is in the header near top. So maybe we didn't parse correctly. Let's search for \"filed\" across all docs again but with broader pattern. Search for \"\\bfiled\\b\" alone? But we did earlier search for \"\\bfiled\\b\" and found 0 matches? step 10 search for \\bfiled\\b in complaint returned no matches. But maybe the word \"Filed\" is part of \"filing fee\" and not \"filed\". Indeed the docket shows \"filed by American Public Health Association\" but that's not a filing date. So the complaint might not have \"filed\" word. Maybe the filing date is in the docket only.\n\nGiven the current status, we have one value. But maybe we need to confirm if there are any other distinct filing dates in any documents. To be safe, we should search all documents for any date that could be a filing date. But we might not want to read large amounts. We can search for patterns with hyphen format, month day year, or slash format. Let's search all documents for date patterns: \"\\b\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\\b\" we already did step 6 and step 14 found 10 matches in docket only. Step 14 shows 10 matches across docket only. So no other doc has slash date. For hyphen format, search all docs for \"\\b\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}\\b\". Let's do that.

We have evidence from docket. We should maybe confirm evidence. The evidence snippet from docket match includes the date. We should append that evidence. But we already appended in step 8. It says \"Successfully appended 1 value for 1 key: Filing_Date\". So we have that entry. But we need to check if the evidence included the exact snippet. It might have been from a search with context. The evidence likely includes the snippet from Docket. But to be safe, we can re-append or update? If we think we have all values, we can stop. But we need to confirm that we haven't missed any other filing dates. Did we search all documents for date patterns? Step 16 searched all documents for \\b\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}\\b found 6 matches all in Docket. So only docket has 2025-04-02. So that's likely the only filing date.\n\nThus we can stop. But the last status says Keys with Values 1/1. So we can stop. We need to return decision stop.\n\nThus we output stop JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct Filing_Date values have been extracted and the checklist key is complete.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct Filing_Date values have been extracted and the checklist key is complete.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7314, "completion_tokens": 868, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
