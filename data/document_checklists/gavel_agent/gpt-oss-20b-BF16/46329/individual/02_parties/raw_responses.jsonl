But likely same parties. Might have other documents like orders referencing parties. But we should capture all distinct parties.\n\nWe have evidence from complaint. We should also search for \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" across all docs. But we could rely on complaint text. But to be thorough, we could read other documents for parties. But question: \"Extract the parties involved from the legal documents.\" That likely means all parties across documents. The complaint seems to be the primary. Docket might list parties too. But easier: we can list parties from complaint. But to ensure completeness, maybe search for \"Plaintiff\" again in other docs. But we can do a search for \"Plaintiff\" across all documents to capture any other parties. But the search results already included many matches, but not necessarily all parties. But we might just use complaint.\n\nGiven the requirement to extract all distinct value, we should list each party separately with \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\" prefix. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\n\nWe need evidence snippet for each. For each party, find snippet from complaint.\n\nLet's capture each:\n\nFrom complaint: Plaintiffs: \n- American Public Health Association\n- IBIS Reproductive Health\n- International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW)\n- Brittany Charlton\n- Katie Edwards\n- Peter Lurie\n- Nicole Maphis\n\nDefendants:\n- National Institutes of Health\n- Jay Bhattacharya, in his official capacity as Director of the National Institutes of Health\n- United States Department of Health and Human Services\n- Robert F.

We could provide one evidence snippet that contains all plaintiffs; but each entry must have evidence. Could use same evidence for multiple entries.

Defendants: National Institutes of Health; Jay Bhattacharya, in his official capacity as Director of the National Institutes of Health; United States Department of Health and Human Services; and Robert F.

Also there may be other documents with parties but probably the same. But the requirement: Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So we need to capture all parties across files. There may be other parties in other documents, e.g., the Order (001) may have parties listed. We should search for \"Plaintiffs\" and \"Defendants\" across documents.\n\nWe have search regex earlier that found many matches for \"Plaintiff|Defendant\" but we haven't extracted them. We need to read those matches to confirm.\n\nWe should search for \"Plaintiff:\" pattern or \"Defendant:\" but the complaint uses \"Plaintiffs,\" label not \"Plaintiff:\" but we can still extract.\n\nBetter to search for \"Plaintiffs,\" and \"Defendants,\" or \"Plaintiff:\" etc.\n\nWe should search all documents for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" with context. Use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Plaintiff|Defendant\" maybe anchored.\n\nWe have seen search result earlier. It found 222 matches across 15 docs. We need to capture all parties. We should read each match to extract parties.\n\nHowever we could use search_document_regex with pattern that captures the block of parties listing. For example, pattern \"(?s)^(?i)(Plaintiff[s]?:? .*?)(?=v\\\\. |\\\\.\\\\s*Defendent|Defendant[s]?:? )\". But safer: we could just read the top of each complaint where parties are listed.\n\nMaybe easier: use search_document_regex to find \"Plaintiffs,\" and \"Defendants,\" that appear near each other. Then read each match.\n\nBut we already have the complaint parties extracted. We should also capture parties in other documents: e.g., the order (001) may list parties as well. Let's search for \"Plaintiffs,\" in order (001). The matches earlier show \"Plaintiffs\" in different contexts. We need to read where parties listed. Let's inspect match 1 of 001 search result: tokens 8-208 includes the parties. That is the same as complaint? The order document likely has parties listed as well. Let's read that match. We can read from doc \"(001)\" tokens 8-208. That is within the order. But we need to ensure we capture all parties. The complaint already contains all parties. The order likely repeats same list. But to be safe, we should read the order's parties too.\n\nSimilarly, other documents may not list parties. The other documents like Docket, etc. may not list parties. But we can search for any \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" lines and extract.\n\nWe should compile a complete set: Plaintiffs: American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW); Brittany Charleton; Katie Edwards; Peter Lurie; Nicole Maphis. Defendants: National Institutes of Health; Jay Bhattacharya, Director; United States Department of Health and Human Services; Robert F.

Also, sometimes the parties may be listed with \"Plaintiff(s)\" plural. Not case sensitive.\n\nWe need to append these entries to checklist.\n\nWe should check that we haven't already appended any entries; none yet. So we need to append.\n\nWe should construct patch with key \"Who_are_the_Parties\" and extracted entries list, each with evidence.\n\nWe need to provide evidence snippet with text, source doc, location.\n\nWe can use complaint text from earlier. For each party, we can use the snippet that contains the party name. For example, for \"American Public Health Association\" we can use \"American Public Health Association\" from complaint. For \"IBIS Reproductive Health\" snippet. For \"International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW)\" snippet. For \"Brittany Charleton\" snippet. For \"Katie Edwards\" snippet. For \"Peter Lurie\" snippet. For \"Nicole Maphis\" snippet. For \"National Institutes of Health\" snippet. For \"Jay Bhattacharya, in his official capacity as Director of the National Institutes of Health\" snippet. For \"United States Department of Health and Human Services\" snippet. For \"Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his official capacity as Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services\" snippet.\n\nAlso maybe there are other parties: \"National Institutes of Health\" is listed twice? We should list distinct values. We should include each unique description.\n\nThus total entries: 7 plaintiffs + 4 defendants? Actually 5 defendants? Let's count: Defendants list: National Institutes of Health; Jay Bhattacharya; United States Department of Health and Human Services; Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. That's 4. So total 11 entries.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't duplicate any. We'll create entries accordingly.\n\nWe should include evidence location: we can say location: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, page 1\" or token range. We can approximate using the earlier snippet. For example, the complaint snippet shows tokens 0-2000. So location: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, tokens 0-2000\" or \"page 1\". Provide snippet.\n\nNow we need to output function call append_checklist.\n\nLet's build patch: {\"patch\": [{\"key\":\"Who_are_the_Parties\",\"extracted\":[...] }]}\n\nEach extracted entry: {value: \"...\", evidence: [ {text:\"...\", source_document:\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location:\"page 1\"} ] }\n\nWe need to provide evidence snippet for each. We can choose the snippet that contains the party. For example:\n\nAmerican Public Health Association: snippet from complaint: \"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION;\"\n\nSimilarly for IBIS Reproductive Health: snippet: \"IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH;\"\n\nInternational Union...: snippet: \"INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW);\"\n\nBrittany Charleton: \"BRITTANY CHARLTON;\"\n\nKatie Edwards: \"KATIE EDWARDS;\"\n\nPeter Lurie: \"PETER LURIE;\"\n\nNicole Maphis: \"NICOLE MAPHIS\"\n\nNational Institutes of Health: \"NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH;\"\n\nJay Bhattacharya snippet: \"JAY BHATTACHARYA, in his official capacity as Director of the National Institutes of Health;\"\n\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services: \"UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES;\"\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr.: \"ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., in his official capacity as Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services,\"\n\nWe should ensure each value is prefixed with \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\"? The requirement says formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'. So we need to include that prefix. So for each entry, value should be like \"Plaintiff: American Public Health Association\". The description includes the original text.\n\nThus we need to embed \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\".\n\nThus values:\n\n\"Plaintiff: American Public Health Association\"\n\n\"Plaintiff: IBIS Reproductive Health\"\n\n\"Plaintiff: International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW)\"\n\n\"Plaintiff: Brittany Charleton\"\n\n\"Plaintiff: Katie Edwards\"\n\n\"Plaintiff: Peter Lurie\"\n\n\"Plaintiff: Nicole Maphis\"\n\n\"Defendant: National Institutes of Health\"\n\n\"Defendant: Jay Bhattacharya, in his official capacity as Director of the National Institutes of Health\"\n\n\"Defendant: United States Department of Health and Human Services\"\n\n\"Defendant: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his official capacity as Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services\"\n\nNow evidence: for each, we provide snippet. We'll use the complaint snippet. Provide location as \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, page 1\". Or maybe token range.\n\nWe must ensure each evidence snippet includes the party name. Provide snippet like \"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION;\" etc.\n\nWe will produce the function call.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Who_are_the_Parties\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: American Public Health Association\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION;\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: IBIS Reproductive Health\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"IBIS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH;\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS (UAW);\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Brittany Charleton\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"BRITTANY CHARLTON;\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Katie Edwards\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"KATIE EDWARDS;\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Peter Lurie\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"PETER LURIE;\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Nicole Maphis\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"NICOLE MAPHIS\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: National Institutes of Health\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH;\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: Jay Bhattacharya, in his official capacity as Director of the National Institutes of Health\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"JAY BHATTACHARYA, in his official capacity as Director of the National Institutes of Health;\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: United States Department of Health and Human Services\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES;\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"page 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: Robert F.

But we need to ensure we have all parties in all documents. The current coverage: partially visited many docs. We need to verify if any other documents contain additional parties beyond those captured. For example, the docket lists parties, maybe includes \"Suzanne Schlossberg\" as counsel or \"American Institute of Biological Sciences\" etc. But those are not parties? The parties list includes plaintiffs and defendants. The docket shows \"American Public Health Association, Ibis Reproductive Health, United Auto Workers, Brittany Charlton, Katie Edwards, Peter Lurie, Nicole Maphis\" as plaintiffs. Also \"Jay Bhattacharya, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., National Institutes of Health, United States Department of Health and Human Services\" as defendants. Those match the same list. The docket also mentions \"American Institute of Biological Sciences, etc.\" but those are amicus curiae not parties. So likely the parties list is complete. But we need to double-check other documents for maybe additional parties like \"United Auto Workers\" is included. Already included.\n\nBut there might be other parties in the brief of amici or in memos? They could include \"Suzanne Schlossberg\" as counsel or \"American Institute of Biological Sciences\" as amicus. But not parties.\n\nThus we likely have all parties. But to be safe, we should search all documents for \"Plaintiff:\" and \"Defendant:\" patterns to confirm no missing parties. The earlier search in all documents found 222 matches: 20 in (001), 20 in (002), 18 in Brief of Amici Curiae etc. Those may contain party names too. There could be parties like \"American Institute of Biological Sciences\" etc. But those might be amicus. But still could be parties? But likely not.\n\nWe should search for \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\" patterns across all documents to capture any missing parties. Use search_document_regex on all with pattern \"(?i)(Plaintiff|Defendant)[^\\n]{0,200}\". That will return matches. But we already did step 3 and 8. Step 3 search had many matches but we didn't parse all. Step 8 search in docket had matches. But step 3 had 222 matches across many docs. We haven't processed them. We need to read more. We should search all again but maybe with a narrower pattern to find \"Party\" names specifically. But we already have list.\n\nWe need to confirm full list: plaintiffs: American Public Health Association; IBIS Reproductive Health; United Auto Workers (UAW); Brittany Charleton; Katie Edwards; Peter Lurie; Nicole Maphis. Defendants: National Institutes of Health; Jay Bhattacharya, Director; United States Department of Health and Human Services; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Secretary.\n\nAlso maybe \"United States Department of Health and Human Services\" might be separate entity from NIH. Already included.\n\nThus we have 7 plaintiffs and 4 defendants = 11 entries. That matches extracted.\n\nWe should check if any other documents mention \"Suzanne Schlossberg\" as counsel, but not party. We should not include counsel as party. So okay.\n\nThus the checklist is complete. We should check if any other documents mention \"American University\" etc. But those are amicus.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut before stopping, we should verify that we have all required evidence. Each extracted value has evidence from Complaint. Good.\n\nWe should confirm that the key \"Who_are_the_Parties\" is complete: all 11 values. We should ensure no duplicates. We have 11 distinct entries.

We already have 11 entries from Complaint. But we must ensure all parties across all documents.\n\nWe saw Docket had matches referencing parties. But the parties list in Complaint may be exhaustive? The Complaint lists plaintiffs: American Public Health Association, Ibis Reproductive Health, United Auto Workers, Brittany Charlton, Katie Edwards, Peter Lurie, Nicole Maphis. Defendants: National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya (official capacity), United States Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (official capacity). That's 11 parties.\n\nAre there other parties in other documents? The Docket includes same parties. The other documents may mention other parties? Briefs may mention other parties (like amici). But the parties for the case are those. We need to confirm that no other parties are in other docs. For example, the \"Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion for a Stay\" might mention parties. But likely same.\n\nHowever, let's search for \"Plaintiff:\" pattern across all documents. Already did search for \"(?i)(Plaintiff|Defendant)[^\\n]{0,200}\". That found 222 matches across 15 docs. But those matches may include other parties, maybe not. We need to read additional tokens to capture any parties not in Complaint.\n\nBut we have 222 matches; many could be duplicates or include other parties like \"American Institute of Biological Sciences\" etc from amici. But those are not parties for the case; they are amici. The checklist item is parties involved in the legal documents: meaning plaintiffs and defendants. So parties are the legal parties of the case. So we likely only need those 11. But we should double-check if any other documents mention additional parties, like in orders maybe mention \"United States Department of Health and Human Services\" etc. But those are already included.\n\nThus we may be done. But we must ensure that the extracted list is complete. The \"current status\" shows 1 key filled 11 values. Are there any other parties in other docs? Let's search again for \"Plaintiff:\" globally to see if any additional unique parties are mentioned. The prior step 3 search found 222 matches. We need to read some of those contexts to confirm whether they introduce new parties.\n\nBut we cannot read all 222 matches. We should sample some matches that could contain new parties. Let's search again with regex pattern capturing party names. Perhaps search for \"Plaintiff:.*?;\" pattern? But names may not include semicolon. Let's search for \"Plaintiff:\" pattern and examine. But we already did search. The results were mostly in Complaint and Docket. But maybe other documents contain parties like \"American Institute of Biological Sciences\" etc as amici. But those are not \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\".\n\nThe Docket shows \"Summons Issued as to Jay Bhattacharya, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., National Institutes of Health, United States Department of Health and Human Services.\" But not \"Plaintiff:\".\n\nThus, likely we are done.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the extracted list contains ALL distinct values. We have 11 entries. Are there any duplicates? They are distinct. We should double-check if the parties list includes \"United Auto Workers\" spelled \"United Auto Workers\" vs \"United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW)\" - that's the full description. Those are same. Good.\n\nBut we must ensure the formatting: 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'. Our entries match.\n\nNow we should check if there is any missing party like \"American Public Health Association\" appears as \"American Public Health Association;\" the entry \"Plaintiff: American Public Health Association\". Good.\n\nNow we need to ensure the evidence for each entry. We have evidence from Complaint page 1. That is fine.\n\nNow, we must decide whether to stop or to update? We already appended 11 entries. But we must check if any of those entries are missing evidence or duplicates. But likely fine.\n\nWe should check if any other parties appear in other documents like \"American Institute of Biological Sciences\" which is an amicus but not part of case parties. So we ignore.\n\nThus we can stop. But we must ensure that the checklist status shows keys filled 1/1, empty 0/1. So we can stop.\n\nBut we need to double-check that we didn't miss any party. Did the Complaint also include \"American Public Health Association\" etc. That covers all plaintiffs and defendants.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nWe should produce stop with JSON: {\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All parties extracted\"}.\n\nBut we must ensure we haven't missed any party. Let's quickly search for \"United States Department\" etc. But those are in the list.
