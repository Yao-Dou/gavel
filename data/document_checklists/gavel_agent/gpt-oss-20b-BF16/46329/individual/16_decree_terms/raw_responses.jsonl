First, we need to locate relevant court orders with decree terms. Likely the \"Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment\" or \" (001)\", \"(002)\" etc. We need to search for \"decree\" or \"decree terms\" patterns like \"The Court orders\", \"The Court decrees that\", \"decree\", \"Order\" with substantive obligations. We could use search_document_regex on all documents for \"decree\" or \"orders that\". But the instruction: we have to extract all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. So we need to search for the substantive obligations ordered by the court. That may be in an order like \"The Court orders that the parties shall ...\", \"shall pay\", \"shall refrain from\", etc. We need to pull each term as separate value. This is a complex extraction. We might start by searching for \"orders that\" or \"ordered that\" patterns. But we need to ensure we capture only court orders, not settlement agreement terms. The documents are all orders or opinions. So we can search for \"order that\" pattern. But we need to extract each distinct obligation. That may be many. However, the requirement: extract every distinct value. So we need to read the documents and gather all obligations.\n\nGiven the complexity, we might need to read the main order documents that likely contain decree terms: \"Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment\" is likely the main decree. Also \"(001)\" and \"(002)\" maybe parts of the same order.\n\nThus we need to read those documents. We can start by reading the first 10k tokens of the \"Findings...\" doc to see if it contains obligations. Or we can search for \"shall\" or \"must\" patterns. But searching for \"shall\" across all might be too many hits. But we can limit to order documents.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex with doc_names specifying the order docs and pattern \"order that\" or \"decree that\" etc. But we need to capture obligations. Maybe easiest: read the entire \"Findings...\" doc? It's 27k tokens, above 10k limit. We can read first 10k to see. Then maybe read next segments.\n\nBut we need to produce evidence for each extracted term. Could be many. But we can start with one term.\n\nGiven the policy, we should make one action per turn. So we could choose search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"order that\". That will bring contexts. Then we can parse. But we need to extract obligations. Might be many.\n\nMaybe we should search for \"shall\" in the order docs. That might yield many obligations.\n\nBut we need to extract all distinct obligations. We could parse all obligations from the entire document. But we must ensure each is separate.\n\nGiven the time, we can start by searching for \"The Court orders that\" phrase. That might capture the beginning of obligations. Let's perform search_document_regex on doc_names of the orders: list the names: \" (001)\", \" (002)\", \"Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment\", \"Memorandum and Order\", \"Order\", \"Order of Court\", \"Stipulated Protective Order\", \"[Proposed] Rule 54(b) Partial Final Judgment\".

We need to find decree terms: substantive obligations ordered by court. Could be in \"Order\" (like a final order). The \"Memorandum and Order\" may have some decree terms. Also \"Order of Court\" maybe longer. We should search for patterns like \"orders that\" or \"the Court orders that\" etc. But earlier searches didn't find matches.

Already did search_document_regex on all docs pattern \"orders? that\". Found 3 matches. But maybe we need to read those matches. The matches were in (002), Complaint, and Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment.

Alternatively, we can read the entire (002) document to find decree terms. But it's 18,986 tokens; but we can read relevant parts.\n\nAlso the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief likely contains the court orders? But usually a complaint does not have terms. The Order of Court doc (679 tokens) might contain the decree terms.\n\nLet's look at \"Order of Court\" doc. It hasn't been visited.

Already did search and found 0 matches. So decree terms may not use the word \"decree\". But they are likely in court orders. So we should search for \"orders that\" or \"The Court orders that\" or \"the Court orders\" etc.\n\nWe could search for \"orders that\" again but we already did.

Need to search for \"orders that\" in all documents; we did earlier but found only some. But maybe \"orders\" or \"order that\" but not \"orders that\". Also could be \"The Court orders that\" etc. We might need to read other documents: e.g., \"Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment\" (almost 27k tokens, partially visited). Also \"Stipulated Protective Order\" etc. Maybe the decrees are in \"Order\" documents like \"Order\" for partial separate final judgment. We might need to search for \"The Court orders\" or \"orders that\" or \"order that\" across all documents again. But earlier search found none in many. Perhaps the decrees are within \"Memorandum and Order\" which we read fully and had no matches. The \"Order\" document is small, no content. The other unvisited documents may contain decrees.\n\nWe need to extract each distinct term: these are substantive obligations ordered by the court, e.g., \"The Court orders that the defendant shall pay $X\" etc. We need to find each term. So we need to search for patterns like \"orders that\" or \"order that\" across all documents. Maybe also \"The Court orders\" or \"orders to\". Let's search again but maybe with pattern \"orders? to\" or \"ordered to\" etc. But we need only terms directly ordered. Could be \"The Court orders that the parties shall...\" Let's search for \"orders that\" again but maybe with case-insensitive. Already did. Found matches only in a few documents. But maybe some decrees are not captured by that pattern. For example, the order might have \"The Court orders the following\" and then list items like \"- The parties shall ...\". So we need to find \"orders\" or \"order\" maybe with colon after. Let's search for \"order[s]? that\" again across all documents. Already did, but maybe we need to search for \"order that\" (no s). We did \"order that\" earlier. But maybe the decree uses \"orders\" plural. We did. So maybe the decrees are in \"Order\" documents not captured by those patterns because they might be in \"Order\" doc that is small and maybe has no \"orders that\".\n\nWe have unvisited documents: Docket, Order of Court, [Proposed] Rule 54(b) Partial Final Judgment, etc. The Order of Court (679 tokens) might contain the decree. Let's read it. Also the [Proposed] Rule 54(b) Partial Final Judgment (1,247 tokens) may contain the decree.\n\nAlso some documents might be large: \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\", \"Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\", etc. But those are pleadings, not decrees.\n\nSo likely the decrees are in the \"Order of Court\" or \"Memorandum and Order\" which we read but had no terms. The \"Order\" document (191 tokens) maybe is a brief order but might contain the decree. But we read, saw only case header lines, no content. So maybe the order text is after page 6? But we read only 191 tokens but maybe the order content is after page 6. But we saw only page headers. So maybe the order content is beyond tokens 191. But the document might be longer, maybe 191 tokens is entire doc? But we saw page lines but no content. So likely the decree is in \"Order of Court\" doc.\n\nThus next action: read_document \"Order of Court\" tokens 0-679 (full doc). Then parse for orders.

But maybe decree terms are in other documents, such as \"Memorandum and Order\" or \"Order of Court\" etc. But earlier search of \"decree\" returned no matches in many docs. Perhaps the decree terms are not labeled \"decree\" but \"orders\" or \"orders that\". Could be a consent decree. We need to find substantive obligations ordered by the court. So we need to find order text: \"The court orders that X\" etc.\n\nWe have read some documents partially. The \"Memorandum and Order\" is fully read but earlier search for \"orders that\" had no matches. But maybe the decree terms are in the \"Order\" documents. But \"Order\" is only 191 tokens and likely a short order. Let's inspect \"Order\" content was just page numbers. So not.\n\nThe \"Order of Court\" 679 tokens read, but we didn't see content. Let's read more of it. We need to read from 0-679 tokens fully. We have already read it. But maybe the decree terms are in that order: we need to read the content. Let's read from 0-679 again, but we already did. But we didn't see content. The read_document returned just page numbers of the order: seems like a docket summary rather than order text. Possibly the actual decree is in the \"Memorandum and Order\" which we read fully. But earlier search for \"orders that\" found none in Memorandum and Order. But maybe the decree terms are in the \"Memorandum and Order\" but not containing \"orders that\" phrase. Could be \"The court orders that\" but we didn't find matches. Maybe the phrase is \"The Court orders\" but we searched that earlier and found none.\n\nWe might need to search for \"shall\" or \"shall\" but that gives many. We need to find specific obligations like \"The court orders that the parties shall comply with X\" etc.\n\nLet's search for \"shall\" in the \"Memorandum and Order\" to find obligations. But we would need to read the entire doc. It's only 1407 tokens, fully read. We can extract obligations. But we need \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" which include obligations ordered by the court.\n\nAlternatively, the decree terms might be in the \"Order\" documents like \"Order\" and \"Order of Court\" but those are short. Maybe the \"Order\" documents are the actual decree orders. The \"Order\" listing pages might be a docket summary but maybe the actual order is elsewhere.\n\nLet's search for \"The Court\" in \"Memorandum and Order\". But earlier search for \"court orders\" didn't find. But maybe the decree terms are in the \"Order\" documents beyond the pages shown. But those orders are only 191 tokens; maybe it's a docket with no decree text.\n\nAlternatively, the decree terms might be in a \"Memorandum and Order\" that we read fully but didn't capture. Let's re-read the \"Memorandum and Order\" fully to capture any obligations. We already read 0-1400 tokens, but the doc is 1407 tokens. We might need to read last tokens 1400-1407. That's small. Let's read 1400-1407.\n\nBut the earlier read_document returned 1400 tokens, but we need the rest. Let's read 1400-1407.\n\nAlso, we might need to search for \"order\" or \"orders\" in that doc. Let's perform search_document_regex on that doc for \"order\" or \"orders\" with context. But earlier search for \"orders that\" returned none. But maybe the phrase is just \"orders\". Let's search for \"orders\" pattern. But many \"orders\" may appear. But we need the full decree terms.\n\nBetter approach: locate the actual decree documents. Possibly the case is a consent decree. The decree terms may be in the \"Memorandum and Order\" which is the court's order. Let's read the entire doc again to see obligations.\n\nWe have the content from 0-1400 tokens that we saw earlier. Let's read from 1400-1407.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Memorandum and Order\",\"start_token\":1400,\"end_token\":1407}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum and Order", "start_token": 1400, "end_token": 1407}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7122, "completion_tokens": 926, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have done searches for \"orders that\" etc but none produced decree terms. We might need to search for \"decree\" or \"decrees\" but none found. The decree terms may be in the Order or Memorandum and Order. But those are fully visited, maybe no decree text. Could be in other documents like Briefs, Motions. We need to search for \"decree\" pattern in all documents. Step 30 had no matches, step 32 also no matches. But maybe decree terms appear as \"term\" or \"terms\" in context of \"decree\" but not the word \"decree\". Could be in the \"Order\" or \"Order of Court\". Let's inspect those docs; they were fully visited but maybe we didn't read full content. But we saw only header pages. Could there be a decree in a different doc like [Proposed] Rule 54(b) Partial Final Judgment? That might include decree terms. Also the \"Memorandum and Order\" may include some decree terms.\n\nWe need to find 'decree' content. Let's search again with a broader pattern: maybe \"§\" or \"decree\" but we already did search for \"decree\" and found no matches. That suggests no occurrence of the word \"decree\". But the checklist says to extract substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions. These may not be labeled with the word \"decree\". Instead, they might be in the \"Order\" or \"Order of Court\" documents. They might include \"The Court orders that\" etc. We already searched for \"orders that\" and found matches in some documents but they didn't include obligations. Maybe the content wasn't captured because the match snippet didn't include the obligation. We need to review the matched sections to see if they contain obligations.\n\nWe saw matches in (002) for \"order that\" but snippet didn't show obligations.\n\nIn Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, match snippet didn't show obligations either.\n\nIn Findings of Fact etc match snippet didn't show.\n\nThus maybe there are no decree terms in the corpus. But we need to confirm \"Not Applicable\" if no decree terms exist. But we must provide evidence. How to show Not Applicable? We need to find explicit text that indicates no decree terms. For example, \"This case does not involve a decree\" or \"the court declined to issue a decree\". Or we can find evidence that no decree terms appear by scanning full documents and not finding any. But we cannot scan all 15 documents manually. We might search for patterns indicating \"decree\" synonyms like \"order\" but that's too broad.\n\nBut the checklist might accept that if no decree terms found, set Not Applicable. But we need evidence that no decree terms exist. To do that, we could search for \"decree\" again across all documents. Already done and found none. But evidence needed: we need a snippet of text that shows absence? We cannot show absence. But we can show that the search returned zero matches, but the evidence requirement says each extracted entry must include evidence. For Not Applicable, we need supporting text that explicitly indicates not applicable. Not just absence. So we need explicit text.\n\nPerhaps a document says \"This is not a decree\" or \"no decree was entered\" etc. Could exist.\n\nLet's search for \"decree\" again maybe with case-insensitive? Already did. Might be \"decrees\" etc. Step 30 had none. Step 32 also none.\n\nWe could search for \"decree\" or \"decrees\" in all documents again. But we already did. Could be hidden in a different doc type like Briefs. But we didn't search those.\n\nLet's search in \"Brief of Amici Curiae\" etc. But likely not.\n\nMaybe the decree terms appear in \"Order\" or \"Order of Court\" but we didn't read full content; but those were fully visited but we only saw header pages. So maybe the content is longer but not shown in the snippet we saw. The read_document earlier of Order and Order of Court only returned header pages but maybe the content is longer but the tool read only 191 tokens for Order, 679 for Order of Court. That might be entire content? Order of Court is 679 tokens; likely includes the order content.\n\nLet's search in \"Order of Court\" for \"orders that\" again? Already did. But we didn't see obligations.\n\nLet's read \"Order of Court\" again with more tokens. But we already read entire doc (0-679). Let's inspect content again. The snippet probably only header lines. But maybe the content is longer and truncated? But tool read 679 tokens, likely entire doc. But we didn't see the order text. Perhaps the content is after page 4? But we saw page 1-6 of 6 for Order doc. That suggests the entire doc is header pages. So no decree terms.\n\nThus likely no decree terms in the corpus.\n\nBut we need evidence that no decree terms. We can search for \"decree\" again across all docs to confirm no matches. Step 30 and 32 found no matches. But we need to provide evidence: we can show that search returned zero matches, but that is output, not evidence from document. The evidence must be text snippet from a document. But if no decree terms exist, maybe the correct answer is Not Applicable. But we need evidence that the decree is not applicable. Where could we find such statement? Possibly in a memo or order stating \"No decree was entered\" or \"The Court has not entered a decree\" etc. Might be in the \"Memorandum and Order\" or \"Order of Court\" or \"Order\" documents.\n\nLet's search for \"decree\" again but maybe the word appears in a different case-insensitive form like \"decree.\" with period. But regex search should catch. Could search for \"decree.\" but we did.\n\nLet's search for \"decree\" in \"Memorandum and Order\" again. But we read entire document and saw no such word.\n\nThus maybe the court did not issue a decree; the case is about other orders. So we set Not Applicable.\n\nBut we need evidence: maybe some document states \"the Court does not issue a decree\" or \"this is not a decree\".\n\nLet's search for \"decree\" again but maybe the word appears in a different doc not yet visited. We could search all docs again but we already did. But to be safe, we can search for \"decree\" in \"Brief of Amici Curiae\" etc. Let's search all docs for \"decree\" again. That will return context if any. But we already did and got none. But maybe the earlier search didn't include the new docs because they were unvisited. But step 30: search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"decrees?\" returned no matches. That should include all docs, including unvisited. So no decree.\n\nThus we can assert Not Applicable with evidence that the search returned no matches. But we need evidence from a document. We could use the \"findings of fact\" doc showing that no decree terms? That doc might not mention decree.\n\nAlternatively, we could set Not Applicable and provide evidence as a citation to the fact that the search returned no matches. But the evidence requires text from a document, not tool output.\n\nMaybe there is a statement like \"This case does not involve a decree\" in the docket or something. Let's search for \"decree\" again in the docket. But step 22 had matches for \"shall\" etc. But not decree.\n\nLet's search for \"decree\" in docket.

Need to read the actual Order content maybe separate document \"Order\" has more pages? Actually \"Order\" is 191 tokens, maybe includes the decree content. We saw only page numbers. That might just be a summary. Let's examine the content: step 37 gave the content of \"Order\" which is just page listing. So maybe the \"Order\" is a docket page, not the decree.\n\nMaybe the decree terms are in the \"Memorandum and Order\" but we searched for \"orders that\" and \"decree\" and found none.

But maybe the decree terms are in the \"Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment\" which may be at the end of the document.

They likely just refer to the decree but not the terms.\n\nThe decree may be in the \"Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment\" but the content we saw didn't show any terms. Maybe we need to read further down, beyond 19000 tokens. That document is 27,406 tokens. We have only read up to 19000. There may be more after that. Let's read from 19000 to 20000.
