The goal: extract \"Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not\". We have seen limited search results: only \"settlement\" in Docket, no relevant mention. The \"Findings of Fact...\" search for court-enforced etc didn't find. So likely we need to read more documents, maybe the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief or other documents where settlement might be mentioned.\n\nWe need to search for \"Kokkonen\" or \"retains jurisdiction\" or \"settlement\" and \"court-enforced\" but earlier search didn't find. So we need to read documents more thoroughly. Maybe the settlement is not mentioned - maybe it's not applicable. But we need evidence of \"Not Applicable\" if no settlement. But the instruction: \"Whether a settlement (not entered as an order/judgment) is court-enforced.\" If there is no settlement, then maybe not applicable? But the key expects a Yes/No. If no settlement, maybe \"No\"? Wait, definition: \"Answer 'Yes' if the court explicitly retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement without incorporating it into an order or judgment (e.g., Kokkonen retention), and 'No' if it is a private agreement with no retained jurisdiction.\" If there is no settlement agreement at all, it's not applicable? The instruction says \"whether a settlement (not entered as an order/judgment) is court-enforced.\" If no settlement, then maybe Not Applicable. But the guidelines: \"Not Applicable Encoding\" says we need explicit evidence of Not Applicable. We haven't found that. So we need to search for settlement agreements. Possibly the settlement is in a separate doc. Search for \"Settlement Agreement\" found 0 matches. But maybe \"Settlement\" appears in \"Stipulated Protective Order\" etc. We can search \"settlement\" across all docs again, but we already did and found only in Docket. But maybe Docket includes settlement? Let's read Docket near the found region to see if any mention of settlement. They didn't mention settlement there. So likely no settlement. But we need evidence that there is no settlement. That might be tricky.\n\nPerhaps the settlement could be in a document not yet searched, like \"Memorandum and Order\" etc. We could search for \"Settlement\" in all documents again? Already did. But maybe earlier search found only one match. The Docket snippet didn't include settlement, but the search found match in Docket at tokens 13988-14188. That snippet didn't show settlement. So maybe the match was due to the word \"settlement\" in context of \"Settlement\" but maybe not. The snippet shows \"Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., National Institutes of Health...\" no settlement. So maybe the match is irrelevant. So maybe no settlement.\n\nGiven that, we might set Not Applicable if we can find explicit evidence that there's no settlement. But we don't have that. We could search for \"settlement\" in the Complaint or other docs. Let's search again for \"settlement\" across all docs. But we did and got 0 except Docket. That likely is it. But maybe the search didn't capture because \"settlement\" appears in a different form? Could be \"settlements\". But pattern \"settlement\" would match \"settlement\". Maybe \"settlement\" appears only in Docket snippet where it's irrelevant. So no settlement.\n\nThus likely the key is Not Applicable. But need evidence. We could look at the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. Read a section. But it might mention a settlement? But it's a complaint; no settlement.\n\nWe can search for \"settlement\" in the Complaint. Let's do search_document_regex for \"settlement\" in the Complaint. Or we could read the first part. Since we don't know, better to search all docs again but maybe pattern \"settlement\" with word boundary? But we already did.\n\nWe might need to search for \"settle\" etc. But to be safe, we can read the Complaint to confirm no settlement. But we need to find evidence that no settlement is court-enforced. But we could set Not Applicable if it says there is no settlement? But we don't have explicit.\n\nAlternatively, we could read the \"Memorandum and Order\" which might contain settlement info. But we don't know.\n\nGiven limited time, maybe easiest: set Not Applicable with evidence that no settlement exists. But we cannot confirm. But guidelines: Not Applicable only if explicit evidence. Since we don't have, we should not set.\n\nThus we need to find if settlement exists. Likely no settlement. So we need to search for \"settlement\" across all docs again. But we did. So maybe we need to read the entire Docket? But we saw only partial. But the match might be a false positive.\n\nWe could open the Docket fully to look for settlement. But 20k tokens. We can read relevant parts around tokens 13988-14188. That snippet did not mention settlement. So likely no settlement. But we need evidence that settlement is not court-enforced. We could set \"No\" if there's a private agreement? But no settlement.\n\nThus probably the key remains empty. We need to search for \"settlement\" across all documents again but maybe pattern \"settlement\" is too broad; we might search for \"settlement\" in \"Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion for a Stay...\" etc. But we could search for \"settlement\" across all.

We need to confirm if any document indicates settlement not court-enforced. Perhaps there might be a settlement agreement separate from court order. We need to look for settlement agreement. We did search for \"Settlement Agreement\" earlier and found none. But maybe the settlement is in the docket? Search docket for \"settlement\". The earlier search steps found matches in Docket but only with \"settlement\" maybe part of docket notes. But we need evidence of non-court enforcement. Could also be that no \"No\" value exists, but we need to confirm. We must check all documents to see if any mention \"court does not enforce\", \"no court enforcement\", \"private agreement\" etc. We already searched all documents for those patterns and found none. But maybe the text is in a specific document that wasn't fully visited (e.g., Order of Court, Stipulated Protective Order). We could search all documents for \"court retains jurisdiction\" again, but we already did. But we could search for \"retains jurisdiction\" again; we saw earlier match. That gave Yes. To ensure no \"No\", we could search for \"does not retain jurisdiction\" or \"no court enforcement\" etc. We did that earlier and found none. But maybe the text is not captured by regex because of formatting (e.g., \"court does not retain jurisdiction\"). We could search for \"does not retain\" or \"does not retain jurisdiction\". But earlier we searched \"does not retain jurisdiction|does not have jurisdiction|no court enforcement|court does not enforce|court not retain jurisdiction\" and found none. Could search for \"private settlement\" earlier we searched and found none. So maybe indeed there is only Yes.\n\nHowever we must consider that we have only extracted one value \"Yes\". The question: \"Extract the court enforcement status from the legal documents. Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to confirm if there is a \"No\". We should search for \"court does not enforce\" and \"private agreement\" again to be safe. But we might need to read more of the documents to see if there's a \"private settlement\" mention.\n\nThe current state: Docket partially visited, Order fully visited, Findings partially visited (15800-17000).

The settlement might be in a \"Stipulated Settlement Agreement\" or \"Settlement Agreement\" document. The docket may list a settlement agreement. We could search docket for \"settlement agreement\" but earlier search for \"Settlement Agreement\" returned none. But maybe the docket contains \"Settlement Agreement\" spelled differently. Let's search docket for \"settlement\" again but check context. Use search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"settlement\". It found 1 match earlier but we didn't see it.

The Docket is partially visited, only tokens 13988-14188. They haven't read the Docket's settlement mention. So maybe there's a settlement mention that indicates it is not court-enforced.

That was from Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment. We need to confirm if there are any other distinct values.

The current status shows 1 value extracted. We need to check if there might be a second value, e.g., 'No', from other documents. The search_results earlier show no matches for \"does not retain jurisdiction\" etc. But maybe some other documents mention a private settlement or no court enforcement. We should search the remaining unvisited documents for patterns like \"court retains jurisdiction\" or \"retains jurisdiction\" or \"Kokkonen\" or \"court-enforced\" etc. The search earlier covered all documents but only found 1 match in the Order document. But maybe not all unvisited documents have been searched. The earlier search 28-29 used pattern \"court retains jurisdiction|Kokkonen|court-enforced|retains jurisdiction|private agreement|no court enforcement\". It found only the match in the Order. That may be the only mention. But maybe there's a 'private agreement' mention in other documents. But the pattern included 'private agreement', but no match. So likely no other mention.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure we haven't missed any 'No' values. The current value extracted is likely 'Yes'. Let's check the extracted value.\n\nWe need to find the extracted value that was updated in step 20. We don't have the evidence snippet. We need to find the source text that says \"court retains jurisdiction\" etc. The search snippet in step 28-29 shows context but not the actual phrase. Let's examine the snippet: It shows lines from the document at tokens 16127-16327. The snippet content:\n\n```\n      \n     Guidance,\" was listed as \"[pending].\"  R. 3228. \n     On May 15, 2025, it appears that Dr. Memoli was provided an \n     expanded list from the Office of General Counsel \n     [74] \n      \n     \n     Case 1:25-cv-10787-WGY     Document 151     Filed 07/02/25     Page 75 of 103\n     R. 3536.  Again, usage of this list was mandatory: \n     [75] \n      \n     \n     Case 1:25-cv-10787-WGY     Document 151     Filed 07/02/25     Page 76 of 103\n      \n     3541.   \n     The terminations continued.  See March 26, 2025 (R. 1639 - \n     1641); March 31, 2025 (R. 2488); April 1, 2025 (R. 760-761; \n     1274\n```\n\nThis snippet does not contain \"court retains jurisdiction\". So maybe the earlier search result didn't show the actual match because we didn't include enough context. We need to read the actual part of the document that includes \"court retains jurisdiction\" to capture the evidence.\n\nThus we need to read the portion of the Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment that likely contains the phrase. The earlier read_document calls read tokens 15800-17000, then 16000-17000, then 16000-16500. But maybe the phrase is outside those ranges. We need to inspect the entire document for \"court retains jurisdiction\" pattern.\n\nGoal: find all distinct values: Yes or No. If only Yes found, then we have all values. But we need to provide evidence snippet that shows Yes. The earlier update_checklist likely had evidence; but we cannot see it. We need to retrieve the actual text again for evidence.\n\nWe can search again for the pattern \"court retains jurisdiction\" and then read the context.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex on the Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment for pattern \"court retains jurisdiction|Kokkonen|court-enforced|retains jurisdiction\". Then read the context. But step 28-29 already did that but returned a match at tokens 16127-16327, but snippet didn't show the phrase. Maybe the snippet is truncated. We might need to search again with more context tokens or different pattern to capture the phrase.\n\nWe can search again for \"court retains jurisdiction\" alone, with context tokens 200. Then read the snippet.\n\nThus choose search_document_regex on the specific document with pattern \"court retains jurisdiction|Kokkonen|court-enforced|retains jurisdiction\" maybe with larger context. Let's do that.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"Kokkonen\" to find the specific clause. But we need the evidence snippet.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on the Order document for pattern \"court retains jurisdiction|Kokkonen|court-enforced|retains jurisdiction\". Provided earlier, they did that. But we can increase context tokens to maybe 500 to capture more. But snippet may still not show.\n\nBetter: search for \"Kokkonen\" alone. Let's do that.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment, pattern: \"Kokkonen\", flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"].\n\nThen read the snippet. That should capture the sentence with Kokkonen retention.\n\nSo we will call search_document_regex with doc_name = \"Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment\", pattern \"Kokkonen\", flags [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k maybe 5, context_tokens maybe 300.\n\nThat will return matches with context that we can then read.\n\nThus the next action: search_document_regex.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment\",\"pattern\":\"Kokkonen\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":300}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment", "pattern": "Kokkonen", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 300}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5246, "completion_tokens": 1315, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We should search for \"court does not enforce\" etc. They did searches but no matches. But we need to ensure full coverage. There are many unvisited documents. Probably need to search all documents for patterns indicating court enforcement or lack thereof. Since we only have one value, but maybe there could be a No value in other documents (e.g., a private settlement). We need to confirm. So next action: search all documents for patterns indicating court unenforced or private agreement. But they already did search for \"private agreement\" etc, no matches. But still maybe the phrase \"no court enforcement\" may appear elsewhere. But search didn't find. Could be phrases like \"the court will not enforce\" or \"the settlement is not court-enforced\". Let's search for \"court will not enforce\" or \"does not retain jurisdiction\". Also maybe \"court does not retain jurisdiction\". Let's search with pattern \"court does not retain jurisdiction|court does not enforce|does not retain jurisdiction|does not enforce\" etc. Already search 22 and 23 didn't find matches. But we might want to search all documents again with pattern \"retains jurisdiction\" etc to double-check. But we already have matches. But we need to confirm if there is any No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is \"Not applicable\" if settlement is private. But we have one value Yes. But we need to ensure no other value. The instructions: extract every distinct value. So we need to confirm that only Yes exists. To be safe, we can search for \"No\" or \"Not court enforced\" etc. But to verify, we need to read or search. Let's perform a search for \"court does not enforce\" across all documents. They did earlier but no matches. Let's do a broader search: pattern \"court does not enforce|court does not retain jurisdiction|does not retain jurisdiction|does not have jurisdiction|no court enforcement|not court enforced|private settlement|private agreement\". That matches step 23, no matches.\n\nBut perhaps the phrase \"court will not enforce\" or \"court will not retain jurisdiction\". Let's search for \"court will not enforce\". Also \"court will not retain jurisdiction\".\n\nWe can run search_document_regex on all documents with pattern: \"court will not enforce|court will not retain jurisdiction\".

We need to search for patterns indicating \"private agreement\" or \"no court enforcement\". The prior searches didn't find matches.
