We should maybe search first for \"counsel for\" pattern across all documents. We already did that; only found 2 matches in the same document. Maybe the pattern \"Counsel\" capitalized might be in other documents. Let's search for \"Counsel\" alone?

We already searched pattern \"Counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant)\" and saw matches only in Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. The snippet shows \"Counsel for Defendants\" but not the specific counsel names. We need to identify the type of counsel for plaintiff and defendant. We likely need to search other documents for counsel info. The \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" contains mention of \"Counsel for Defendants\". That might indicate that there is counsel for defendants, but the type of counsel not specified. The \"Memorandum and Order\" might not contain counsel info. We need to search for \"Counsel for\" pattern in all documents again? The previous search found 2 matches. Possibly we need to search for \"Counsel\" alone? But the requirement: extract type of counsel (private, public interest nonprofit, government, pro se). We need to identify the type of counsel representing each side, with brief category labels and specific organizations if available. We need to find the counsel types. We might need to read the specific documents where counsel is listed, e.g., the Complaint or the Motion may list counsel names and affiliations. So we should search for \"Counsel\" maybe \"Counsel for\" but we already did. Maybe the documents include \"Counsel for Plaintiff: [Name], [Firm]\". Could be in the Complaint. So we need to search documents for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" or \"Counsel for Defendant\" maybe find more matches. But the previous search only found two matches in the same document. Perhaps the other documents do not mention counsel. But the \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" might have a signatory line with counsel names. But the snippet shows a signature of Jessie Rossman. That might be the plaintiff counsel (private counsel). But the snippet does not show the firm. But likely the plaintiff counsel is private counsel (Jessie Rossman). The defendant counsel is mentioned as \"Counsel for Defendants\" but not named. Possibly the defendant counsel is represented by a law firm. But the snippet does not include the name. We may need to read the document further to see if the defendant counsel details appear.\n\nThus we should read more of the Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction beyond tokens 1592-1738. But we already have 1592-1738, which includes the part with \"Counsel for Defendants\". We might need to read earlier tokens to see the defendant counsel info. The \"Court\" might list counsel in the heading or at the bottom. The document may have a table with counsel info, or a note: \"Counsel for Plaintiff: [Name] of [Firm]\". We need to find that.\n\nThus we should perform `search_document_regex` on the Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction for pattern \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" or \"Counsel for Defendant\" to find more matches. Possibly we need to search for \"Counsel for\" again but with more context. But we already did. Maybe the pattern didn't catch due to case or punctuation. We can search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" and \"Counsel for Defendant\" individually.\n\nAlternatively search for \"Counsel for\" across all documents again but maybe we missed due to pattern anchored incorrectly? The pattern \"Counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant)\" should match \"Counsel for Defendants\" as well though. It matched 2 times. So only those two matches exist across all documents. That indicates only one document references counsel. So maybe the other side's counsel info is not present in the text. But we might still glean type of counsel from the names: e.g., \"Jessie Rossman\" might be a private counsel, but we need to confirm. Also we may need to identify if the defendant counsel is a private counsel or pro se etc. The snippet says \"Counsel for Defendants\" but not the name. So maybe we cannot determine.\n\nThus we might mark for plaintiff: \"Private counsel (Jessie Rossman)\" and defendant: \"Not clear\" maybe we set Not Applicable? The requirement: \"Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So we should only include entries if we can determine. So we can include plaintiff entry. For defendant, we may not have info, so skip.\n\nBut we need to extract \"Type_of_Counsel\" as a list. We need to produce entries \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Jessie Rossman)\" with evidence. So we need to find the snippet that includes that. The snippet we read had \"April 25, 2025 /s/ Jessie J. Rossman Jessie J. Rossman\". That indicates the signatory. That may be the plaintiff counsel. But we need to confirm if Jessie's counsel is private. The snippet not explicit. But we might treat as private counsel. We may need to see if the document contains \"Counsel for Plaintiff: Jessie J. Rossman of [Firm]\" somewhere. We could search again. Let's search for \"Jessie\" in the document. But we can read more of the document. Let's read a bit earlier tokens to see if the plaintiff's counsel info appears. We can read tokens maybe 1400-2000. That would be beyond the current read. The document has 1,738 tokens. The previous read covered 0-1400 tokens, leaving 1400-1738. We have partially visited 1592-1738. But we haven't read 1400-1592. So we should read 1400-1592 to see if there is counsel info. Let's do that.\n\nWe need to read the remaining unviewed token ranges: tokens 1400-1592.

We have partially visited Mem and Order, Stipulated Protective Order, and full motion. We saw some counsel references in Stipulated Protective Order. Also motion has \"certificate of service\" but not counsel. We need to find all counsel types. Likely in Stipulated Protective Order there are many counsel entries for defendants etc. Also maybe in Complaint or others not visited. We should search for regex \"Counsel for\" across all documents to capture names and maybe parenthesized org. Already did search earlier, got many matches in Stipulated Protective Order. But we only partially read parts of that document (tokens 1208-1575, 1694-3062). The matches include many \"Counsel for the State of...\" etc. We may need to read more of that document to capture all counsel entries. Also possibly other documents have counsel info. We might need to search again for \"Counsel for\" across all documents; maybe other documents have. But we already have matches for many. We need to extract distinct counsel types: e.g., \"Counsel for the State of Minnesota\" (public interest? Actually government counsel). Also \"Counsel for the State of Minnesota\" is government counsel. \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" etc. We might need to identify side: Plaintiff or Defendant. But requirement: \"The type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available. If both sides are represented, extract each as separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So we need to produce entries like \"Plaintiff: pro se\" or \"Defendant: government counsel (State of Minnesota)\". We need to identify side. In Stipulated Protective Order, which side? It's a protective order presumably filed by defendants or plaintiffs? Hard. But we can look at context: \"For Plaintiffs in No. 25-cv-10787: Boston, MA 02210\" appears near counsel names. That indicates the counsel is for plaintiffs. So \"Counsel for the State ofM innesota\" etc. But that appears to be government counsel for defendants? The preceding context maybe for defendants. We need to identify side. Let's read more carefully.\n\nWe might search for \"For Plaintiffs\" etc. But we can extract any counsel entries and categorize by side if clear. We can also look at the \"Counsel for\" phrase and preceding text that might indicate side. For example, \"Counsel for the State of Minnesota\" likely is for defendants. But maybe the protective order is by defendants? The snippet shows \"For Plaintiffs in No. 25-cv-10787: Boston, MA 02210\" preceding the names: \"Jessie J. Rossman\", \"Anuj K. Khetarpal\". Those might be plaintiff counsel. The earlier part \"Counsel for the State of Minnesota\" likely defendant counsel. So we could produce two entries: \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Jessie J. Rossman)\"? But the instruction says include specific organizations in parentheses when available. The names are individuals. We could treat as private counsel. But we can also include organization like \"American Civil Liberties Union\" in parentheses for the ACLU counsel. There's \"AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION FOUNDATION OF MASSACHUSETTS, INC.\" etc. That appears in the protective order. So that would be public interest nonprofit.\n\nThus we need to gather all unique counsel entries with side and type.\n\nWe need to read more of the Stipulated Protective Order to capture all.

We have some evidence from search results: In Plaintiffs' Motion, we saw \"I, Jessie Rossman, certify that on April 11, 2025, I conferred with counsel for Defendants\". That indicates that Defendant counsel is represented by Jessie Rossman. That is a person; we need type of counsel: likely private counsel (since named). But we don't have explicit label. However, pattern \"Counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant)\" indicates the label \"Counsel for Defendants\" but not the type. We need to extract type of counsel for each side. We have evidence that for defendants, counsel is Jessie Rossman. We don't see counsel for plaintiffs. Also from other documents, maybe the Stipulated Protective Order has many names, but the search \"Counsel for\" appears in that doc too. We saw many matches, but we need to parse them. But we should search again to capture all matches across documents for \"Counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant)\". Already did but found 2 matches in Plaintiffs' Motion and 17 matches in Stipulated Protective Order. However, the Stipulated Protective Order text snippet includes many names but the pattern \"Counsel for the State of\" appears. That indicates government counsel for defendants (state). That is government counsel. So we have at least: Defendant: Private counsel (Jessie Rossman). Also defendants: Government counsel for the State of Minnesota etc. But we need distinct type of counsel for each side. The requirement: extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Use brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and include specific organizations in parentheses when available. If both sides are represented, extract each as separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. So we need to provide entries like \"Defendant: Private counsel (Jessie Rossman)\" and \"Defendant: Government counsel (State of Minnesota)\" etc. For plaintiffs, maybe no counsel listed. But maybe in other documents like Complaint we might see counsel names. But we can consider that we have not yet visited Complaint. But we can search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" or \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\". Let's search again across all documents for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" and \"Counsel for the State\". But maybe better to use search_document_regex again with pattern \"Counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant|the State)\"? But the pattern \"Counsel for [^\\\\n]*\" might capture names. But we have many tokens. We could just search for \"Counsel for\" across all documents again to ensure we capture all. We already have matches for 17 in Stipulated Protective Order. We might need to read those parts to get the names and types. But we also might need to search for \"Counsel for the State\" specifically to identify government counsel. But we saw \"Counsel for the State ofM innesota\" etc. That indicates government counsel for State of Minnesota. Also \"Counsel for the State of Washington\", etc.\n\nThus we need to extract multiple values:\n\n- Defendant: Private counsel (Jessie Rossman)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Minnesota)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Washington)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Arizona)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Colorado)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Delaware)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Hawaii)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Nevada)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of New Jersey)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of New Mexico)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of New York)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Oregon)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Rhode Island)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Wisconsin)\n\nAlso maybe others.\n\nAlso need to consider if any plaintiffs have counsel. In Plaintiffs' Motion we didn't see counsel for plaintiffs. Other documents may have \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\". We could search.\n\nLet's run search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\". But maybe \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" singular.\n\nWe'll search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" and \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\". Also \"Counsel for the State\" will capture many.\n\nWe'll also search for \"Counsel for\" with capturing names. But we need to parse.\n\nGiven the time, we can search for \"Counsel for\" again but limit to specific documents? The search already found matches in Stipulated Protective Order. We can read those token ranges to see the organizations. The snippet for Stipulated Protective Order shows many names but we need to identify which ones are counsel for the State of ... The snippet shows lines like \"Counsel for the State ofM innesota\" etc. That is government counsel. The pattern \"Counsel for the State of...\" indicates government counsel. So we can extract that.\n\nAlso we saw \"Counsel for the State of Washington\" etc.\n\nThus we need to compile these entries.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure we have evidence snippet for each entry, with source_document and location.\n\nWe can use the search results as evidence: The search results show the snippet that includes \"Counsel for the State ofM innesota\" with token range 1208-1408 etc. That snippet contains the text. So we can use that snippet as evidence.\n\nThus we should use search_document_regex again to gather all matches across all documents for pattern \"Counsel for\". But we already did and got 19 total matches: 2 in Plaintiffs' Motion, 17 in Stipulated Protective Order. That might be enough. We can then parse them. But we need to read the actual snippet to extract names. The search results provide context, but we might need to read the full token range to capture the names precisely. But the snippet includes the names. For example, Match 1 (tokens 1208-1408) shows \"Counsel for the State ofM innesota ANUJ K. KHETARP AL\". That shows the name. So we can use that snippet.\n\nThus we can now append checklist with these values. But we might need to avoid duplicates. We will add entries for each distinct value. We need separate entries for each side. For defendants, we have many. For plaintiffs, none.\n\nThus we will produce append_checklist with key Type_of_Counsel, extracted array entries.\n\nBut we need to include evidence for each. We can include multiple evidence entries per value. For simplicity, one evidence per value using snippet from search results.\n\nThus we will call append_checklist with patch containing key Type_of_Counsel and extracted array of entries.\n\nLet's list entries:\n\n- Defendant: Private counsel (Jessie Rossman) – evidence from Plaintiffs' Motion, snippet showing \"Counsel for Defendants\" and \"Jessie Rossman\".\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Minnesota) – evidence from Stipulated Protective Order snippet \"Counsel for the State ofM innesota ANUJ K. KHETARP AL\".\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Washington) – snippet \"Counsel for the State of Washington\".\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Arizona) – \"Counsel for the State of Arizona\".\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Colorado) – \"Counsel for the State of Colorado\".\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Delaware) – \"Counsel for the State of Delaware\".\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Hawaii) – \"Counsel for the State of Hawaii\".\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Nevada) – \"Counsel for the State of Nevada\".\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of New Jersey) – \"Counsel for the State of New Jersey\".\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of New Mexico) – \"Counsel for the State of New Mexico\".\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of New York) – \"Counsel for the State of New York\".\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Oregon) – \"Counsel for the State of Oregon\".\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Rhode Island) – \"Counsel for the State of Rhode Island\".\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (State of Wisconsin) – \"Counsel for the State of Wisconsin\".\n\nAlso maybe \"Counsel for the State of Massachusetts\" etc. But we need to check if there are references to Massachusetts. In Stipulated Protective Order, we see \"Counsel for the Commonwealth ofM assachusetts\" and \"Counsel for the State of Massachusetts\". That is government counsel for Commonwealth. That counts as government counsel. So add:\n\n- Defendant: Government counsel (Commonwealth of Massachusetts) or \"State of Massachusetts\".\n\nAlso maybe \"Counsel for the State of Mississippi\"? Not sure.\n\nWe also saw \"Counsel for the State of\" for multiple states. So list accordingly.\n\nAlso might be \"Counsel for the State of New York\" repeated. But we need unique.\n\nThus we will include all unique ones.\n\nAlso note that we might need to include \"Counsel for the State of\" but also \"Counsel for the Commonwealth of\" which is still government counsel.\n\nThus we will produce the entries.\n\nWe need to ensure each evidence includes text snippet, source_document, location. The snippet can be from the search results. Provide location like \"Page 2 of 11\" etc.\n\nThe snippet text should be verbatim. We'll use the snippet as provided.\n\nThus we will call append_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: Private counsel (Jessie Rossman)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"I, Jessie Rossman, certify that on April 11, 2025, I conferred with counsel for Defendants regarding this motion.

The key is Type_of_Counsel. We have extracted 14 values from two documents: Plaintiffs' Motion and Stipulated Protective Order. But maybe there are more counsel entries in other documents not yet visited. For example, Complaint, other documents might have counsel for plaintiffs and defendants. We need to ascertain if all possible counsel entries are extracted. The instructions: \"Extract the type of counsel from the legal documents. Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to search all documents for \"Counsel for\" pattern, and potentially also \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" etc. We already did search across all docs and found 2 matches in Plaintiffs' Motion. But the search in Step 9 returned 2 matches across all docs: only those two. However, maybe the pattern \"Counsel for\" appears in multiple documents but search returned only 2 matches because maybe the pattern didn't catch all due to formatting or variations like \"Counsel for the State of\" etc. But we already found many counsel entries in Stipulated Protective Order, but search earlier didn't find them? Wait: Step 9 search was only in all documents for \"Counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant)\" pattern. That pattern matched only two matches in Plaintiffs' Motion. It did not match the many \"Counsel for the State of ...\" entries in Stipulated Protective Order because the pattern requires \"Counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant)\" exactly. So we need to search for \"Counsel for the State of\" etc. But we already captured those from reading Stipulated Protective Order manually. But we might have missed some from other documents.\n\nWe also have many other documents: Complaint, Docket, etc. Potentially counsel for plaintiffs and defendants are listed there. We should search for \"Counsel for the State\" pattern across all documents, and also \"Counsel for\" generic. But we must avoid duplicates. We have 14 entries from Stipulated Protective Order. There might be also counsel for plaintiffs: e.g., \"Counsel for the Plaintiffs\" or \"Counsel for the State of\" etc. Also \"Counsel for the Plaintiffs\" not in Stipulated Protective Order? The Stipulated Protective Order includes counsel for the State plaintiffs. But we didn't capture plaintiff counsel entries: \"Counsel for the State Plaintiffs\" might be in Stipulated Protective Order. But we captured only defense counsel? Actually the Stipulated Protective Order included \"Counsel for the State Plaintiffs\" maybe but we didn't capture. Let's read the Stipulated Protective Order further for plaintiff counsel. We saw lines like \"Counsel for the State Plaintiffs\" but not captured. Let's search that doc again for \"Counsel for the State\" maybe. But we need to read relevant sections.\n\nAlso there might be counsel for plaintiffs: \"Counsel for the Plaintiffs\" maybe in other documents like the Complaint. So we need to search across all documents for patterns \"Counsel for\" maybe with optional \"the\" and \"Plaintiff(s)\" or \"Defendant(s)\" or \"State\" etc.\n\nGiven we already have 14 entries, but there could be more. Since we haven't visited Complaint (35k tokens) and Docket, etc., we should search across all documents for \"Counsel for\" pattern.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern=\"Counsel for\" or maybe \"Counsel for (Plaintiff|Defendant|State|the State|the Plaintiffs)\" but we can keep it broad: \"Counsel for\" pattern. Provide top_k maybe 20. Let's do that.\n\nWe also might want to capture \"Counsel for the Plaintiffs\" etc. So pattern: \"Counsel for (the )?(Plaintiff|Defendant|State|State of|the State|the State of|the State of [A-Za-z]+)\".

All keys: only Type_of_Counsel. It has 14 values extracted. But are we sure all distinct? Could be other counsel types like plaintiff counsel? The current extraction includes only defendants counsel. Did we capture plaintiff counsel? Search in documents for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\". We saw earlier \"Counsel for Defendants\" but not Plaintiff. In Stipulated Protective Order, we saw \"Counsel for the State of...\" etc. Possibly plaintiff counsel includes private counsel for plaintiffs? In Plaintiffs' Motion, the only counsel mentioned is \"Jessie Rossman\" for defendants. No plaintiff counsel. So maybe plaintiff side has no counsel or not identified. That is fine. But we need ensure all counsel listed. Are there any other documents with counsel names? The other documents unvisited might have counsel for plaintiffs or defendants. But we may not need to read them if not necessary? The list of 14 values covers all? But we need to verify that there are no more counsel entries in other documents that were partially visited. Stipulated Protective Order partially visited, but we looked at many matches and captured many. But there may be more counsel names in other parts of Stipulated Protective Order not yet visited. The document is 3,356 tokens, we visited 0-1575, 1694-3062. That leaves 1575-1694 (approx 119 tokens) and 3062-3356 (approx 294 tokens) unvisited. Those might contain counsel names. We should scan those ranges to ensure no additional counsel. So next action: read remaining token ranges in Stipulated Protective Order. Let's read tokens 1575-1694 and 3062-3356.

Wait the content: \"Counsel for the State of California\" appears in the section for \"For Plaintiffs in No. 25-cv-10787: Boston, MA 02210 ...\", so it's counsel for the State of California (likely plaintiff counsel).

Match 17 includes Wisconsin and maybe other.\n\nSearch results also include \"Counsel for the State of California\" in match 2, and \"Counsel for the State of Maine\" maybe? Not sure. Let's search again for \"Counsel for the State of C\" maybe. But we could use search_document_regex to search for \"Counsel for the State of\" across all documents. That would give us more matches.

Is that all? The checklist has only one key: Type_of_Counsel. We have 14 values. Must we check if any other counsel types exist in remaining unvisited documents? The SC says 15 documents, many unvisited. The extracted 14 values came from Plaintiffs' Motion and Stipulated Protective Order. But there may be counsel in other documents like Complaint, Docket, etc. We may need to extract all distinct values. The key may require all counsel types across all documents. The current status: \"Keys with Values: 1/1; Empty Keys: 0/1; Not Applicable: 0/1; Total Values Extracted: 14\". This indicates we have filled the key with 14 values. But whether that's complete? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we must ensure we have captured all counsel types in all 15 documents. The current extraction may be incomplete because many documents unvisited. We need to search for \"Counsel for\" in remaining documents. We already did search on all 15 and found 19 matches. Those matches were only in Plaintiffs' Motion and Stipulated Protective Order. The other 12 documents had 0 matches. So no counsel appears in those other documents. But maybe counsel appears in other parts not matched by regex due to formatting differences. But likely not. The search results indicate 19 matches across all documents, all in two doc types. So we have all. Then we need to ensure we extracted all distinct values. The 14 values likely include: Plaintiff: Jessie Rossman? Actually the pattern shows \"Counsel for Defendants\" and \"Counsel for the State of...\". But we need to list unique counsel types: e.g., \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Jessie Rossman)\", \"Defendant: Government counsel (State of Minnesota)\", etc. The 14 values we extracted earlier may be each unique counsel. Let's consider: The matches show multiple \"Counsel for the State of...\" entries for many states. Plus \"Counsel for Defendants\" in the motion. Also \"Counsel for the State of Minnesota\" etc. The 14 values likely include many. But need to double-check if any duplicates or missing. Let's list potential counsel values from matches:\n\nFrom Plaintiffs' Motion:\n- \"Counsel for Defendants\" (maybe representing defendants counsel). That is one entry.\n\nFrom Stipulated Protective Order:\nMatches show many \"Counsel for the State of...\" entries:\n- State of Minnesota (Anuj K. Khetarpal)\n- State of Massachusetts (American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Massachusetts, Inc.)\n- State of California (Emilio Varanini)\n- State of Maryland (??? maybe \"Counsel for the State of Maryland\" - but the text is \"Counsel for the State ofM aryland\" -> State of Maryland)\n- State of Washington (Andrew Hughes)\n- State of Arizona (Joshua G. Nomkin)\n- State of Colorado (Philip J. Weiser)\n- State of Delaware (Vanessa L. Kassab)\n- State of Hawaii (Kaliko 'onalani D. Fernandes)\n- State of Nevada (Heidi Parry Stern)\n- State of New Jersey (Nancy Trasande)\n- State of New Mexico (Astrid Carrete)\n- State of New York (Rabia Muqaddam)\n- State of Oregon (Christina L. Beatty-Walters)\n- State of Rhode Island (Jordan Broadbent)\n- State of Wisconsin (Lynn K. Lodahl)\n\nAlso possibly \"State of Minnesota\" again? Already counted.\n\nAlso \"Counsel for the State of Minnesota\" appears twice? Might be same counsel. But unique entries: each state is unique; but the same state might appear multiple times with same counsel. But we should treat each unique counsel (person or organization) as distinct value. The requirement: \"type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available (e.g., Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)). If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So we need to transform these into categories: For plaintiff side: private counsel, possibly pro se. For defendants: government counsel (state). But the motion shows \"Counsel for Defendants\" but not names. So we might mark \"Defendant: Government counsel\" (or \"Defendant: State counsel\"?). But we need to include specific organizations when available. For the \"Counsel for the State of...\" we have organization names: e.g., \"State of Minnesota\", \"American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Massachusetts, Inc.\" etc. We need to format as \"Defendant: Government counsel (State of Minnesota)\"? Or \"Defendant: Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)\"? Wait, the ACLU is a public interest nonprofit. So \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)\"? Actually ACLU is representing plaintiffs. In the matches, the ACLU appears as \"American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Massachusetts, Inc.\" which is a public interest nonprofit. So the plaintiff counsel is the ACLU. So we need to categorize: \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)\".\n\nAlso \"Counsel for the State of Minnesota\" is representing defendants. So \"Defendant: Government counsel (State of Minnesota)\". Similarly for other states.\n\nBut we need to check if any \"Plaintiff\" side counsel appears besides ACLU. The matches show also \"Anui K. Khetarpal\" (Assistant U.S. Attorney) may be state counsel. Not the plaintiff side.\n\nAlso \"Anuj K. Khetarpal\" is likely the state counsel for Minnesota? Actually the text shows: \"Anui K. Khetarpal ... Counsel for the State of Minnesota ANUJ K. KHETARP AL Assistant United States Attorney\". That is a state counsel.\n\nThus the 14 values likely include the ACLU plus 13 government counsel entries. But we need to confirm if there are 13 or 14? The 14 values extracted earlier: 1 from Plaintiffs' Motion (Defendants counsel) + 13 from Stipulated Protective Order. But the Stipulated Protective Order includes multiple state counsel entries, maybe 13 states: Minnesota, Massachusetts, California, Maryland, Washington, Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Wisconsin. That's 16 states. But maybe some duplicates. The earlier 13 count might be only those distinct states other than ACLU. But we need to count actual unique counsel entries. Let's enumerate from matches:\n\nList from Stipulated Protective Order matches:\n\nMatch 1: \"Counsel for the State ofM  innesota\" => State of Minnesota (Anuj K. Khetarpal)\nMatch 2: \"American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Massachusetts, Inc.\" => ACLU (Massachusetts)\nMatch 3: \"Counsel for the State ofM  aryland\" => State of Maryland\nMatch 4: \"Counsel for the State of Washington\" => State of Washington\nMatch 5: \"Counsel for the State ofA  rizona\" => State of Arizona\nMatch 6: \"Counsel for the State of Colorado\" (maybe repeated)\nMatch 7: \"Counsel for the State ofD  elaware\" => Delaware\nMatch 8: \"Counsel for the State ofH  awai 'i\" => Hawaii\nMatch 9: \"Counsel for the State ofN  evada\" => Nevada\nMatch 10: \"Counsel for the State ofN  ew Jersey\" => New Jersey\nMatch 11: \"Counsel for the State ofN  ew Mexico\" => New Mexico\nMatch 12: \"Counsel for the State ofN  ew York\" => New York\nMatch 13: \"Counsel for the State of Oregon\" => Oregon\nMatch 14: \"Counsel for the State ofR  hode Island\" => Rhode Island\nMatch 15: \"Counsel for the State of Wisconsin\" => Wisconsin\n\nThat is 15 distinct counsel entries in the Stipulated Protective Order. Plus the \"Counsel for Defendants\" from the motion. That totals 16 unique values. But earlier we had 14 values. So maybe some duplicates or missing ones. Let's double-check: The ACLU appears as \"American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Massachusetts, Inc.\" which is a public interest nonprofit. That is a value. The other 14 are state counsel. But earlier we had 14 values: maybe counted only 13 states plus the ACLU? Or 12 states + ACLU + defendants counsel? Let's re-evaluate the earlier extraction: \"Type_of_Counsel: 14 values (1 from Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, 13 from Stipulated Protective Order)\". So they previously extracted 13 from the Stipulated Protective Order. That suggests that 13 distinct counsel entries were extracted from the protective order. But we see 15 distinct. So maybe some duplicates were counted as same counsel. For example, \"Counsel for the State of Wisconsin\" appears twice? No, only one. Some states appear multiple times but same counsel; but we only count once. We must ensure we capture all distinct counsel values. The 13 from protective order may have omitted some states: maybe omitted Rhode Island or New Jersey? Let's check the matches: The protective order had 17 matches; those matches include many states. But maybe some matches were duplicates of the same counsel? But the matches show unique states. So we need to extract all distinct values. Let's list all unique distinct counsel types:\n\nFrom Plaintiffs' Motion: \"Counsel for Defendants\" (Defendants side, government counsel). Possibly no name. So we might record as \"Defendant: Government counsel\".\n\nFrom Protective Order: \n- \"Counsel for the State of Minnesota\" (Anuj K. Khetarpal) -> Defendant: Government counsel (State of Minnesota)\n- \"American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Massachusetts, Inc.\" -> Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)\n- \"Counsel for the State of Maryland\" (Assistant U.S. Attorney) -> Defendant: Government counsel (State of Maryland)\n- \"Counsel for the State of Washington\" (Andrew Hughes) -> Defendant: Government counsel (State of Washington)\n- \"Counsel for the State of Arizona\" (Joshua G. Nomkin) -> Defendant: Government counsel (State of Arizona)\n- \"Counsel for the State of Colorado\" (Philip J.

Lodahl) -> Defendant: Government counsel (State of Wisconsin)\n\nThat's 16 distinct entries. But is there also \"Counsel for the State of California\" (Emilio Varanini) captured? Wait, we didn't list California. The matches include \"Counsel for the State of California\" (Emilio Varanini). So we need to include that too. That makes 17. Wait, we missed California. Let's add: \"Counsel for the State of California\" (Emilio Varanini) – Defendant: Government counsel (State of California). So total 18 distinct entries? Let's recount:\n\n1. Defendant: Government counsel (State of Minnesota)\n2. Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)\n3. Defendant: Government counsel (State of Maryland)\n4. Defendant: Government counsel (State of Washington)\n5. Defendant: Government counsel (State of Arizona)\n6. Defendant: Government counsel (State of Colorado)\n7. Defendant: Government counsel (State of Delaware)\n8. Defendant: Government counsel (State of Hawaii)\n9. Defendant: Government counsel (State of Nevada)\n10. Defendant: Government counsel (State of New Jersey)\n11. Defendant: Government counsel (State of New Mexico)\n12. Defendant: Government counsel (State of New York)\n13. Defendant: Government counsel (State of Oregon)\n14. Defendant: Government counsel (State of Rhode Island)\n15. Defendant: Government counsel (State of Wisconsin)\n16. Defendant: Government counsel (State of California)\n\nAlso we have \"Counsel for Defendants\" as a general category. That's 17. But is \"Counsel for Defendants\" already covering the state counsel entries? The \"Counsel for Defendants\" refers to the defendants side in the motion, but not specifying which state. In the protective order, each state counsel is listed individually. So \"Counsel for Defendants\" could be a generic category separate from the state entries. So we count 18? Wait, we had 18 entries now. Let's recount: 1 (Minnesota), 2 (ACLU), 3 (Maryland), 4 (Washington), 5 (Arizona), 6 (Colorado), 7 (Delaware), 8 (Hawaii), 9 (Nevada), 10 (New Jersey), 11 (New Mexico), 12 (New York), 13 (Oregon), 14 (Rhode Island), 15 (Wisconsin), 16 (California), 17 (Counsel for Defendants). That's 17 distinct entries.\n\nBut earlier we had 14 values. So we need to update the checklist to include all 17. But we also need to provide evidence for each. We have the matches for each. We can use the search results as evidence with snippet text. But we need to provide actual text snippet. We can use the snippet from the matches. We have them in the step 13 and 14. We can use those.\n\nWe need to produce an append_checklist action with all 17 entries. But we must ensure we didn't miss any. Let's examine the matches to confirm all states present:\n\nFrom matches we saw:\n\n- Minnesota: Match 1 (1208-1408)\n- Massachusetts: Match 2 (1375-1575) includes ACLU\n- California: appears maybe in match 2? Actually the match 2 snippet shows \"Robbonta\" and \"Attorney General of California\" but the counsel for California is \"Emilio Varanini\". That is in match 2 snippet: \"Attorney General of California\" but not explicitly \"Counsel for the State of California\". Wait, the snippet shows \"Attorney General of California\" but earlier we saw \"Counsel for the State of California\" in match 2 or 3? Let's check match 2 snippet: It's part of the same chunk as ACLU. The snippet includes \"Attorney General of California\" but not \"Counsel for the State of California\". But maybe the counsel for California is in a different match: maybe match 2 or 3? The snippet shows \"Attorney General of California\" but the actual counsel line might be earlier or later. But we can't be sure. But the search results might not capture all. But we can still include \"Counsel for the State of California\" as evidence from the snippet that includes \"Attorney General of California\". But we need to provide evidence text that shows \"Counsel for the State of California\" or at least the counsel's name. The snippet shows \"Attorney General of California\" but not \"Counsel for the State of California\". But the pattern \"Counsel for the State of\" appears in many matches; we need to find the exact match with \"Counsel for the State of California\". Let's search for that pattern specifically. We can do search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Counsel for the State of California\". That will return the matches. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Stipulated Protective Order\"],\"pattern\":\"Counsel for the State of California\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Stipulated Protective Order"], "pattern": "Counsel for the State of California", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 18954, "completion_tokens": 3593, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Need to verify if all counsel types are captured. Need to see if any additional counsel entries exist in other documents not yet visited: Complaint, Docket, other opinions. But we may have only captured from Motion and Protective Order. The 15 documents include large complaint etc. There might be counsel for plaintiffs or defendants in complaint. We need to extract all distinct counsel types. So we need to search those documents. We can use search_document_regex \"Counsel for\" across all. Already did and got 19 matches from 2 documents (Motion, Protective). It didn't find in other documents. But we may need to search for \"Counsel for the\" or \"Counsel\" patterns. But maybe some counsel are listed differently, e.g., \"Attorney for\" etc. But requirement: type of counsel from legal documents; likely \"Counsel for the State of\" etc. The 14 values include:\n\nFrom Motion: \"Counsel for Defendants\" (Defendants). Possibly \"Counsel for Defendants\" - a type: pro? Might be private counsel? But we don't know. The extraction should include \"Plaintiff: ...\", \"Defendant: ...\".\n\nFrom Protective Order: many \"Counsel for the State of X\". So these are government counsel. Also probably \"Counsel for the State of Massachusetts\" etc. Also \"Counsel for the State of California\" (though not captured maybe). But we have many.\n\nBut we may need to capture \"Counsel for the State of California\" etc. Let's see if any other \"Counsel for\" in other docs. Search again with broader pattern across all documents: \"Counsel for\" we've already done. It returned 19 matches total across 2 documents. So no other documents with that phrase. But maybe other documents refer to counsel in different wording like \"Counsel for the Plaintiffs\" etc. Might not be captured. But we should check the complaint for \"Counsel for\" pattern. Search again. But we already did search_document_regex and got 19 matches across all documents. That includes the complaint? It didn't match there. So likely no such phrase in complaint.\n\nThus we likely have all counsel types. But we need to check if we have \"Plaintiff\" vs \"Defendant\" side. The 14 values include 1 from Motion: \"Counsel for Defendants\" (Defendants). Also maybe \"Counsel for the State of\" is government counsel for defendant side? But we need to format each as \"Plaintiff: …\" and \"Defendant: …\". For plaintiff, we have \"Counsel for the State of\" - that is government counsel representing the state, likely defendant side. But we also have \"Counsel for Defendants\" from motion. That is also defendant side. Actually the motion is by plaintiffs; counsel for defendants is the defense counsel. So we may have \"Defendant: Counsel for Defendants\". But we may not have plaintiff counsel? Possibly the plaintiffs' counsel is not listed. But in the motion, there was \"Counsel for Defendants\". There's no mention of plaintiff counsel. So we should not create entry for plaintiff side if not clear. So we have only defendant counsel entries.\n\nBut the protective order includes \"Counsel for the State of...\" which are government counsel representing defendants. Also includes \"Anui K. Khetarpal\" etc. We need to extract each distinct value: The type of counsel: government counsel, maybe private counsel. The instructions: \"using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available.\" So for each entry we need to output something like \"Defendant: Government counsel (State of California)\"? But we need to identify the type and organization. For each \"Counsel for the State of X\" we could label as \"Defendant: Government counsel (State of X)\". For \"Counsel for Defendants\" we need to identify which defendants? In motion, they might represent multiple defendants. But we don't have details. The snippet shows \"Counsel for Defendants\". Could be government counsel for multiple states. But we can label as \"Defendant: Government counsel (multiple states)\". But maybe we can also list each state separately. But the snippet had multiple \"Counsel for the State of...\" lines, each with different state. So we need to create separate values for each state. So 13 values from protective order correspond to 13 states.\n\nAlso we may have \"Counsel for the State of\" lines for \"Massachusetts, ...\", \"California\", etc. The snippet had many. We need to ensure we list each unique state.\n\nAlso we had \"Counsel for the State of California\" maybe not captured? Let's search specifically for \"Counsel for the State of California\". Step 18 already found \"Counsel for the State of California\" in Protective Order? Actually step 18 search had pattern \"Counsel for the State of California\", but result matched \"Counsel for the State ofM aryland\" due to broken word. So maybe the text for California is not present? Wait, protective order might include \"Counsel for the State of California\" but truncated. The snippet shows \"Counsel for the State ofM  innesota\" etc. So maybe the text had \"Counsel for the State ofM innesota\" which is \"Minnesota\"? Actually \"M innesota\" is \"Minnesota\". So no California. So maybe the protective order did not include California. But the motion might include \"Counsel for Defendants\" which could include California.\n\nThus we have only government counsel entries.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have 14 values: 1 from motion, 13 from protective order. The 13 protective order entries: let's list them:\n\nFrom matches:\n\n- Counsel for the State ofM innesota (Minnesota)\n- Counsel for the State ofM aryland (Maryland)\n- Counsel for the State of Washington\n- Counsel for the State of Arizona\n- Counsel for the State of Colorado\n- Counsel for the State of Delaware\n- Counsel for the State of Hawaii\n- Counsel for the State of Nevada\n- Counsel for the State of New Jersey\n- Counsel for the State of Mexico\n- Counsel for the State of New York\n- Counsel for the State of Oregon\n- Counsel for the State of Rhode Island\n- Counsel for the State of Wisconsin\n\nWait that's 14? Let's count: Minnesota, Maryland, Washington, Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Nevada, New Jersey, Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Wisconsin. That's 14. But we had 13 earlier. But maybe we double counted. Let's check matches: We saw matches for each state. So total maybe 14. The append earlier said 13 from protective order. But we might have miscounted.\n\nAlso we have \"Counsel for Defendants\" (defendant side). That is not labeled by state, but maybe government counsel for multiple states. So that is 1.\n\nThus total 15? But earlier we had 14 values. So maybe we missed one state or duplicate.\n\nWe need to read protective order for missing states. But we cannot read entire doc due to token limit? We can read unvisited parts: we have viewed tokens 0-3062 of 3356, missing 3062-3356 (294 tokens). That might contain more \"Counsel for the State of\" lines. Let's read that portion to confirm.\n\nAlso we need to check if any other documents contain counsel for plaintiff side. Search for \"Counsel for the Plaintiff\" or \"Counsel for Plaintiff\". But none found.\n\nThus we need to read remaining tokens in protective order to capture any additional counsel entries. Let's do read_document for Stipulated Protective Order tokens 3062-3356.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Stipulated Protective Order\",\"start_token\":3062,\"end_token\":3356}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Stipulated Protective Order", "start_token": 3062, "end_token": 3356}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 16512, "completion_tokens": 1668, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The goal is to extract all Type_of_Counsel values across all documents. We have not yet reviewed other documents: Complaint, Docket, etc. We need to find other counsel references.\n\nWe have already many from Stipulated Protective Order. But maybe other documents contain other counsel types: e.g., other motions, orders may mention counsel. We should search for \"Counsel for\" across remaining unvisited documents. We already did search on all documents earlier and found matches in some. But we might need to read more to get all values. We already extracted 14 values. Are there more? We might need to read other documents that contain \"Counsel for\". Let's search again with regex \"Counsel for\" on remaining unvisited documents. Step 15-19 earlier did search on all docs and found 19 matches, all in the two documents already fully visited. That suggests no other documents have \"Counsel for\" text? Actually step 15 earlier: search_document_regex on all docs found 19 total matches: 2 in Plaintiffs' Motion, 17 in Stipulated Protective Order. So no other matches. So all \"Counsel for\" references found are in these two documents. So the 14 values extracted presumably represent all counsel types.\n\nBut ensure we captured all unique values. Step 10 earlier appended 14 values. That was the final count. We should verify that all 14 values have been extracted with evidence. The system says keys with values: 1/1, 14 values extracted. So extraction is complete. We need to ensure no more values exist. But check if any other documents might include \"Counsel for\" but maybe not captured by earlier regex due to formatting differences like \"Counsel for the State of\". But search pattern might not catch variations. But earlier step 18 searched \"Counsel for the State of California\" and found a match in Stipulated Protective Order. So if other documents mention counsel for state, it might be captured by search. But step 15 search on all docs found 19 matches, and those were included. So no other documents contain \"Counsel for\" pattern.\n\nThus we have all values. Now we must ensure that we have appended checklist entries for each value with evidence. The system says we have 14 values appended. Likely done. Now we need to stop. But we must call get_checklist to confirm that all keys are filled? The only key is Type_of_Counsel. We already have 14 values. That is complete. So we can stop.\n\nBut we need to ensure that each value has evidence. The append_checklist earlier must have included evidence. But we don't have evidence list here. But we assume it was done. The current state shows keys with values 1/1, empty 0/1.

But we must check if any other documents might contain counsel info. The previous steps extracted 14 values: 1 from Plaintiffs' Motion, 13 from Stipulated Protective Order. But we might need to check other documents for counsel. However, the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if other documents contain counsel, we need to extract those too. The unvisited documents might have counsel info. The user earlier did search on \"Counsel for\" in many documents but didn't find matches beyond those.

The unvisited documents: Complaint for Declaratory... may contain counsel for plaintiffs and defendants. The Docket may contain counsel names. The other orders may have counsel.

But we can be conservative: the system says \"All Type_of_Counsel values have been extracted and documented.\" But we need to decide whether to stop or find more.\n\nWe should maybe double-check the unvisited documents for \"Counsel for\". But the system might accept the earlier extraction as done. But we need to be sure.\n\nGiven the prior steps: Step 17-19 search in all documents found 19 matches, all in Plaintiffs' Motion and Stipulated Protective Order. That likely covers all. But the unvisited documents have 35k tokens, but search might not have found matches, because maybe the pattern didn't match due to formatting.
