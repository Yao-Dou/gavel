We have partial matches in the search results from earlier. We saw many matches with \"facts\" in doc (001),(002),(Findings of Fact...). Those are partial. We need to read more to capture facts. The best approach: search for \"fact\" or \"facts\" maybe we already did. But we need to extract specific facts values. The Factual_Basis_of_Case likely is a free-form text; we might need to extract distinct facts: e.g., \"the Department has not established a strong likelihood of success on its jurisdictional argument...\" But that's more facts. But we need each distinct value. The extraction might be huge. But we can append multiple extracted entries, each with evidence. We can search for \"fact\" again maybe with context. But we already have matches. We might need to read more token ranges to capture more facts. The doc (001) has 15k tokens; we looked at 8779-8979, 12000-12200, 13694-13894. We might need to read other parts: maybe earlier sections. The doc (001) presumably is a decision; facts likely earlier. Maybe at beginning. So we should read from start token 0-1000.\n\nAlso doc (002) similar. Also the Findings of Fact doc has facts. That doc is large; we saw only few matches. Might need to read more. But we might not need to extract all facts? But requirement: extract every distinct value. That might be huge. Maybe the answer expects to extract the facts from the \"Findings of Fact\" doc since it is titled that. That doc likely contains all facts. Perhaps we should read entire document? But we must limit to 10k tokens per call. The doc is 27k tokens; we can read in parts. We can read from beginning to maybe 10k. That may capture many facts.\n\nGiven the time, we could read the Findings of Fact doc fully in multiple reads: first 0-10k, then 10k-20k, then 20k-27k. But each read is a turn.

We need to read more parts. We should decide to read more token ranges. We should aim to capture all factual basis.\n\nBetter approach: Search for \"factual\" or \"fact\" or \"evidence\" etc. But we have already seen many facts. Let's search for \"facts\" in the entire document. But we have already earlier search showing 16 matches across 15 docs. But we want all facts. However, the definition: \"Factual_Basis_of_Case: Refers to the facts or evidence upon which the case is built. These facts are essential ... includes details of events, evidence, background.\" So we need to extract the facts that support the case. That includes the events being challenged: the Executive Orders, the directives, the grant terminations, etc. We need to extract each fact as a separate entry? Usually, the checklist item may be a single value summarizing all facts? Hard to parse. But we can extract key facts: e.g., \"The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) terminated grants.\" Another fact: \"Executive Orders 14151, 14168, 14173 were issued on January 20-21 2025.\" Another: \"HHS issued a Secretarial Directive on DEI-Related Funding on February 10, 2025.\" etc.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values.

That may bring us matches. Let's do search_document_regex on that doc for pattern \"Executive Order\". That will give matches with context. Then we can extract facts. Also search for \"Directive\" or \"Memorandum\" etc. But we should capture facts.

The court concludes what has been occurring at HHS and NIH with respect to disruption of grants, grant making process, pipeline of future scientists.

We need to include evidence with text snippet. So we must produce append_checklist for key Factual_Basis_of_Case with multiple entries. Each entry has evidence list (text, source_document, location). We need to gather evidence from the text we read. We have read tokens 0-27000 of the Findings of Fact doc. So we can extract from there. Let's pick some key facts. The doc is huge; but we can extract a few key facts: The court's findings that HHS and NIH have been violating APA by depriving grants; the events like the President issuing EO 14151, EO 14168, EO 14173 on Jan 20 and 21 2025; the Secretarial Directive on Feb 10, 2025; the Lauer Memoranda on Feb 12, 2025; the March 2025 guidance. Also the parties: Plaintiffs include American Public Health Association, etc. We can also note that the Court found that there was pervasive racial discrimination in selecting grants for termination. Also that the Court found gender discrimination. And that the Court found discrimination on LGBTQ+.\n\nBut the question: \"Extract the checklist item from the legal case documents as completely as possible.\" We need to extract all distinct values of the checklist item. So we should extract each distinct factual basis: each event description. But maybe too many. But we should be thorough. Could list each event: 1) The President issued EO 14151 on Jan 20, 2025. 2) The President issued EO 14168 on Jan 20, 2025. 3) The President issued EO 14173 on Jan 21, 2025. 4) The Secretarial Directive on Feb 10, 2025. 5) The Lauer Memoranda on Feb 12, 2025. 6) The Lauer Memoranda on Feb 13, 2025. 7) The Institute's terminations on Feb 28, 2025. 8) The March 2025 guidance. 9) The Court's findings of racial discrimination. 10) The Court's findings of gender discrimination. 11) The Court's findings of LGBTQ+ discrimination.\n\nAlso background: The Consolidated actions were originally filed on May 1, 2025. The parties: Plaintiffs: American Public Health Association et al; defendants: NIH, etc. The Court concluded that HHS and NIH have disrupted grants.\n\nThus we should create entries for each distinct factual element. Provide evidence snippet from the doc.\n\nWe need to identify evidence location: token ranges? But we have token numbers. For each fact we can give approximate page number.\n\nWe have large text; we can just provide snippet. For location, we can provide page number as per the doc: e.g., Page 1, Page 2, etc. For example: the text about the President issuing EO 14151 is at page 16? Let's locate. In the snippet, it says \"b. Executive Order 14168 On January 20, 2025, the President also issued Executive Order 14168...\" That is around page 16 maybe. We can approximate.\n\nBetter to use token range: but we can just give location as page number e.g., \"Page 16\". Provide snippet.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each entry. Provide at least one evidence object.\n\nThus we will produce append_checklist with key \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" and list of extracted values.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't miss any distinct facts. But we can include many.\n\nGiven the large amount, we might produce maybe 10-12 entries.\n\nLet's identify:\n\n1. Event: President issued EO 14151 on Jan 20, 2025. Snippet: \"b.

Provide text from doc exactly. Use snippet. Provide source_document \"Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment\".\n\nLocation: give page number maybe.\n\nLet's craft JSON: Use append_checklist.\n\nWe'll produce patch with key \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" and extracted array of objects.\n\nEnsure each extracted entry has \"value\" string summarizing the fact. And evidence array with one evidence object containing text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nLet's create values. For each, the value maybe the fact statement. Eg: \"President issued EO 14151 on January 20, 2025.\" etc.\n\nWe need to include evidence snippet exactly as in the doc. We'll use the text from the snippet. Ensure we keep the snippet verbatim.\n\nWe'll produce about 14 entries.\n\nLet's gather snippets:\n\nFrom snippet earlier:\n\n- For EO 14151: The text: \"b. Executive Order 14151 On January 20, 2025, the President issued Executive Order No. 14151, entitled 'Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.' Exec. Order 14151, 90 Fed.

February 12, 2025 – The Lauer Memoranda\". And \"5. February 13, 2025 – The Lauer Memoranda\". Or the text.\n\n- Grant terminations: \"8. February 28, 2025 – The Grant Terminations Begin On February 28, 2025, the first batch-terminations occurred.\"\n\n- March 25 Guidance: \"14. March 25, 2025 – Staff Guidance (Priorities Directive)\". Also earlier \"The March 25 Guidance settled on an examples list of: 'China,' 'DEI,' 'Transgender issues,' 'Vaccine Hesitancy', 'COVID-related' research.\"\n\n- Racial discrimination: \"The Court has found as fact that there was pervasive racial discrimination in selecting grants for termination.\" Page 8.\n\n- Gender discrimination: \"The Court finds by the fair preponderance of the evidence that the grant terminations here at issue demonstrate an unmistakable pattern of discrimination against women’s health issues.\" Page 8.\n\n- LGBTQ+ discrimination: \"The Court’s factual finding that there has been extensive discrimination against everyone whose lived experience of their sexuality is in any way different from the executive orthodoxy expressed in the President’s fiat, see Exec. Order 14168, 90 Fed. Reg. 8615 (Jan. 20, 2025), is fully affirmed.\" Page 8.\n\n- Consolidated actions reassigned: \"The actions were randomly reassigned to this Court on May 1, 2025.\" Page 6.\n\n- Plaintiffs: The list at top: \"American Public Health Association; Ibis Reproductive Health; International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers; Dr. Brittany Charlton; Dr. Katie Edwards; Dr. Peter Lurie; Dr. Nicole Maphis; ...\". Page 1.\n\n- Defendants: List: \"National Institutes of Health; JAY BHATTACHARYA; JAYANTA BHATTACHARYA; NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH; ...\".

The checklist only has that one key. We need to check if all applicable values are extracted. Should we review the document for any other facts? The summary says there were 14 extracted values. We need to ensure completeness. The rule: we need to extract \"every distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" For Factual_Basis_of_Case, we need details of relevant events, evidence, background.\n\nGiven the huge document, there may be more facts. But we have captured many. But could there be others? The earlier search found \"facts\". The task: we probably need to extract all factual basis items, which could be many: e.g., dates, events, parties, etc. The extracted values include executive orders, directives, dates of actions, claims of discrimination, etc. Might be missing: e.g., the exact text of the \"Findings of Fact\" that the Court found pervasive discrimination, etc. But the summary might have captured many.\n\nWe must decide if all relevant values have been extracted. The extraction summary says 14 values extracted. But the summary states there are no empty keys; maybe we considered all. But maybe we need to verify if any other factual basis items exist beyond the 14.\n\nThe definition: \"Refers to the facts or evidence upon which the case is built. These facts are essential in the legal process and are used to support legal claims or decisions. It typically includes: 1. Details of the relevant events—For example, what happened, when it happened, where it happened, and who was involved. 2. Evidence – Physical evidence, documentary records, witness testimonies, etc., that support these facts. 3. Background information—Context or explanatory facts that provide additional understanding.\"\n\nThus we need to capture maybe more: e.g., the Court's findings on discrimination, the plaintiffs and defendants, the docket number, the filing date, the parties names, etc. We have some of those: the Plaintiff names, defendant names, docket number, filing date. We might have missed e.g., the docket number (Case 1:25-cv-10787-WGY). That is a factual basis. Also the date of filing (07/02/25). We included maybe some of that? We didn't include docket number or filing date. We included some facts: \"consolidated actions were randomly reassigned to this Court on May 1, 2025.\" That is a fact. We also have \"Plaintiffs include...\" and \"Defendants include...\". The docket number is not included.\n\nThus we need to add missing items: docket number, filing date, maybe the court, the case type, etc. Also maybe the \"order to randomize\" etc.\n\nThus we should append missing values: docket number, filing date, maybe the court: \"United States District Court for the Northern District of California\" (or similar). The document likely has that. We need evidence. We need to read the relevant part of the document containing docket number and filing date. The document \"Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment\" is 27k tokens. We have read 0-27000 tokens. We have not read the entire 27k; but we have 0-27000 covering most. The docket number might be near the beginning. We probably didn't capture it. Let's search for \"Case 1:25-cv-10787-WGY\" or \"Filed\". We have some matches in Step 4. There was a match with \"Case 1:25-cv-10787-WGY Document 151 Filed 07/02/25 Page 16\". That includes docket number and filing date. We should include those as facts. Also the case number itself is a fact. So we need to append these.\n\nAlso maybe the \"court\" identity: \"United States District Court for the Northern District of California\" appears at the top of the document. We need to extract that.\n\nThus next action: read a portion of the document near the start to capture docket number, court, filing date, and maybe the \"case type\" like \"Complaint\" etc. Also maybe the parties list. We have plaintiff/defendant names. But maybe include the case type: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". That is a fact.\n\nThus we need to read from tokens 0-500 to capture header. Let's call read_document on that document, start_token 0, end_token 500. Then we will append new values. So next action: read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":500}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order for Partial Separate and Final Judgment", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 500}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 25774, "completion_tokens": 1011, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The extracted values seem to be about executive orders, directives, dates, etc. But maybe more facts exist like plaintiffs list, defendants list, etc. But those were included in the extracted values.\n\nWe must confirm if all possible facts are captured. The list includes executive orders, secretarial directives, memoranda dates, first batch of terminations, staff guidance examples, court findings on discrimination, etc. Are there other facts like \"The Court found pervasive racial discrimination\" etc. Might be in other documents like Brief of Amici, Complaint, etc. But we might need to include facts like \"The Court found that the grant terminations were discriminatory against women's health\" etc. Already included.\n\nBut maybe we need to include facts from other documents: Complaint might list facts of plaintiffs, etc. But the extraction may require all factual basis. However, the example extracted values include many facts. But could be missing some like \"The Court found that the grant terminations were due to ...\". But can't guarantee.\n\nWe can search for \"factual\" again across all documents to see if more facts exist. But we already searched earlier for \"facts\" and found many matches. But we didn't extract all. Maybe we need to search for \"facts\" again but with broader context. Let's search for \"facts\" in all documents. But we previously did search for \"facts\" and got 16 matches; but we didn't capture all. However, we might need to capture facts from other documents like the Complaint, Amici, etc. The example values likely cover most. But we need to be thorough.\n\nTo ensure completeness, let's search for \"factual\" or \"fact\" in all documents again. Use search_document_regex on all docs for \"fact\" or \"facts\". But that might produce many matches. But we only need to capture any facts not yet extracted. Let's search for \"fact\" in all docs.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)fact\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)fact", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 24043, "completion_tokens": 509, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Let's search in Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for \"fact\" or \"facts\". Already saw some matches but maybe not all. But the Factual_Basis_of_Case items likely include facts like dates, events, etc. The current list includes executive orders, directives, grant terminations, etc. Might be missing facts from Complaint or other documents. We should search for \"facts\" in Complaint and maybe others.\n\nBut we have the \"search_document_regex\" results for Complaint showing 10 matches. Some of these matches may contain facts. We need to extract each distinct factual basis. We should read those matches to capture facts. Since we already have 14 values, we might need to add more.\n\nWe must avoid redundancy. Let's search Complaint for \"fact\" again maybe capturing more. Already did search. But we might need to read the match windows to see if any new facts not already captured. For example, the Complaint mentions \"terminals changed beginning in February 2025\" etc. That might be a factual basis. Also \"NIH has not referenced or met any of the standards\" is a fact.\n\nWe need to use append_checklist to add new values. Since we have 14 values already, we will add any new ones.\n\nWe should perform search_document_regex on Complaint for \"fact|facts\". But we need to capture new facts not already in list. Let's review matches:\n\nMatch 1 (tokens 871-1071): includes \"terminals changed beginning in February of 2025, when Defendants issued a series of directives to terminate large numbers of grants\" etc. That's a fact.\n\nMatch 2 (tokens 2265-2465): includes Dr. Charlton and Dr. Edwards etc. That includes facts about Dr. Charlton having five grants terminated.\n\nMatch 3/4 (tokens 3901-4101 etc): includes overview of NIH structure.\n\nMatch 5 (11718-11918): about strategy plan.\n\nMatch 6 (12194-12394): about Next Generation Researchers Initiative.\n\nMatch 7 (13756-13956): about NIH issuing directives.\n\nMatch 8 (14245-14445): about memo.\n\nMatch 9 (18893-19093): about termination notices.\n\nMatch 10 (21268-21468): about specific grants terminated.\n\nThese contain facts.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct facts. We need to determine which facts are not already in our 14 list. The 14 list includes executive orders, directives dates, grant termination dates, staff guidance, evidence of discrimination, etc. The new facts may include: \"NIH grants have been terminated since February 2025\", \"NIH issued a series of directives\", \"Dr. Charlton had five grants terminated\", \"NIH has not referenced standards\", \"NIH terminated grants for certain categories\", \"NIH issued a memo to IC chief grant management officers\", \"NIH terminated grants for certain categories and ended funding for certain research\", etc.\n\nWe need to add each distinct fact.

Then next turn read 2265-2465, etc.\n\nBut we only have to choose one action per turn. The current state: 14 values already extracted. We need to add more.

We should read those windows.\n\nWe need to extract facts: e.g., \"In February 2025, Defendants issued directives to terminate large numbers of grants.\" That's a fact.

Already have some matches. We need to read those windows to extract facts.\n\nAlso we might search for \"NIH\" \"grant\" \"terminated\" etc.\n\nBut easier: We can read the Complaint's factual allegations section from token 3901-4101. Let's read more around that region.\n\nWe also need to read tokens 5000-10000 maybe to capture rest of factual allegations.\n\nBut we have many facts in the Complaint's earlier part: e.g., \"In late February 2025, Defendants upended NIH’s enviable track record\" etc.\n\nWe should read the Complaint from 0 to maybe 8000 to capture early facts.\n\nWe already read 0-5000.

Let's read tokens 3000-4000 maybe.\n\nWe also need to read the Complaint's \"FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\" heading part for more facts.\n\nWe also need to read the Complaint's factual allegations section for each plaintiff.\n\nWe need to extract facts like: Dr. Charlton had five grants terminated; Dr. Edwards had at least six; Dr. Lurie had a grant terminated; Dr. Maphis had a grant refused; etc.\n\nAlso facts about NIH program, etc.\n\nWe also need facts about the parties: \"NIH is the largest funder\", etc. But those are background facts. They may be relevant to Factual_Basis_of_Case.\n\nAlso facts about the Directive: \"Defendants issued directives to terminate grants.\" etc.\n\nWe might also need facts about the plaintiff organizations, e.g., APHA has members whose grants terminated.\n\nThus, many facts.\n\nWe should systematically go through the Complaint's factual allegations section and extract each fact as separate value. The number may be large.\n\nBut the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" So Factual_Basis_of_Case: facts or evidence. So all facts present in the case.\n\nThus, we need to include all facts across all documents.\n\nThis could be many. We could be exhaustive but might be huge.\n\nBut maybe the earlier 14 values from Findings of Fact cover the main facts. The Complaint might contain similar facts, but maybe repeats.\n\nBut we should still include distinct facts not in those 14.\n\nBut we don't know what those 14 are exactly.\n\nWe could retrieve the list of extracted values from the checklist to see which facts are already captured. But we don't have that. We can call get_checklist.\n\nWe should call get_checklist for Factual_Basis_of_Case to see current values. That will show the 14 extracted values.

We have read 0-5000, 11718-11918, 12194-12394, etc. But many parts remain. We need to locate sections with factual allegations.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex to find \"FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\" in Complaint. That match appears around token 3901-4101. That includes the section. We could read that specific token range fully. That range has many facts. We should read it.\n\nLet's perform read_document on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, tokens 3901-4101. That covers the factual allegations header and some content. But we might need more.\n\nLet's read from 3901 to maybe 4500 to capture the first paragraph of factual allegations. Then we can extract facts.\n\nWe can use read_document. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":3900,\"end_token\":4600}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 3900, "end_token": 4600}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14275, "completion_tokens": 918, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

It's already marked as filled with 14 values; check list says 1/1 filled. No empty keys. So we might stop. But we must ensure that all factual basis values have been extracted. Since the prior actions say 14 values from Findings of Fact. But the Complaint also contains many factual allegations. The checklist may require all factual basis items across all documents. Since we have only 14 from the findings, but the complaint also has factual allegations, so likely not complete. The current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning they think it's complete. But we need to be sure if all factual basis items are captured. The instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" So we must ensure all factual basis items across all relevant documents. We have not yet extracted from Complaint, other orders, etc. So need to continue. We saw read_document of complaint tokens 0-5000, 3900-4600 etc. We need to read more of complaint to capture factual allegations. We should look for \"FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\" sections. We already read some. We need to read entire complaint to extract all factual basis items. The complaint has many factual allegations across sections A, B etc. We may need to read from 5000 to maybe 15000 tokens. Let's plan to read a chunk of complaint, maybe 5000-10000 tokens. That is 5000 tokens. Let's do read_document on complaint tokens 5000-10000. That should cover next part. Use read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":5000,\"end_token\":10000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 5000, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14847, "completion_tokens": 384, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But there might still be more values in other documents that were not captured. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" Factual_Basis_of_Case includes facts or evidence in the case. The Findings of Fact likely contains many facts. They extracted 14 values. But maybe other documents contain additional facts that haven't been extracted. We need to ensure completeness. We have many documents, partially visited. We haven't visited many. Could be more facts. The \"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" might include facts from Complaint, etc. So we need to search for \"fact\" or \"facts\" across all documents to gather all unique facts. The prior search found many matches. But we only extracted 14 from Findings of Fact. We might need to read more tokens from other documents to find more facts.\n\nWe need to decide what to do: maybe search for \"facts\" in all documents, then read some of the highlighted passages. But we must be efficient. The search_document_regex can return top_k matches per document. We could search for pattern \"fact\" or maybe \"facts\" or \"factual\" or \"factual allegations\". We already did search for \"(?i)fact\" and \"(?i)factual\". But they returned matches across many docs. But we haven't read those matches. We need to read those to extract facts.\n\nWe could search for \"(?i)factual\" across all documents. But they already got 17 matches. We need to read each match. But maybe there are many more. We could search for \"(?i)facts\" pattern. But the main risk: we might miss facts that are not labelled with \"fact\" but are just facts described. But we can approximate.\n\nGiven the requirement to extract all distinct factual basis values, we should search for typical phrases: \"the facts\", \"facts of the case\", \"factual allegations\", \"factual basis\". But this is a huge document. However, we have partial coverage from Complaint. The Complaint likely contains factual allegations and background. In step 16, they had 14 values from Findings of Fact. Step 18 and 19 included the Complaint. So we should extract facts from Complaint also.\n\nThus we need to read the Complaint for more facts. The Complaint is partially visited view tokens 0-10000, etc. We need to read additional token ranges that likely contain facts. We can search for \"FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\" or \"FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\" heading. The Complaint snippet earlier shows the heading \"FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\" and then a list. We need to read that section fully. Maybe we need to read from the start of the Complaint at the \"FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\" heading. That would be at token around 3900-4600? But they already read 3900-4600 earlier. That snippet includes some facts about NIH. But there might be more facts later. We already read 5000-10000. But the Complaint continues beyond 10000 maybe. We have tokens 10000-? There's no coverage beyond 10000, but the document is 35,423 tokens. So many facts may be after 10000. We need to read those.\n\nAlso other documents like Docket, (001), (002), etc. may contain additional facts.\n\nBut maybe the 14 values from Findings of Fact include all facts of the case? The case is a declaratory and injunctive relief, likely about NIH policy. The Complaint includes allegations about NIH's policy. So there may be many facts. The 14 values might be from Findings of Fact, but maybe the Complaint also contains facts that are not in Findings of Fact. But the Findings of Fact is the court's summary of facts, so may incorporate all facts. But they might not include all factual allegations from Complaint. But the Findings of Fact is likely authoritative.\n\nGiven the instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" So if the Findings of Fact summarises the facts, that may be enough. But we need to verify if any facts are missing. We can search for \"FACTS\" in other documents. Let's search for \"(?i)FACTS\" across all documents. Or search for \"Factual allegations\" across all documents.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex with pattern \"(?i)FACTS\" or \"(?i)Factual allegations\". Use top_k 20. Then read the matches. But we need to read the actual content.\n\nHowever, the system says we should choose only one action per turn. We will do a search first. That will return matches with context. Then we will read the matches. But we need to read the text to extract values. The search returns context tokens around each match. That might be enough to extract facts. But the search may not return all facts.\n\nAlternatively, we could read the entire Complaint to capture facts. But that's 35k tokens, too large. We can read targeted tokens around \"FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\" heading. Let's find the token range for that heading. The snippet earlier at 3900-4600 includes the heading. But we need more after 4600. Let's read from 4600-12000? That would cover next facts. But we already have 5000-10000 snippet. Let's read 10000-16000 maybe. That might capture more facts.\n\nBut we need to identify facts that might not be in Findings of Fact. The Complaint may contain more details. But the Findings of Fact already summarises. But maybe the Complaint includes assignment of facts not mentioned. But the requirement: facts or evidence upon which case is built. The Findings of Fact is the court's version of facts, but the complaint's allegations are also facts. So we should extract from Complaint.\n\nSo we will read from Complaint tokens 10000-16000. Let's do that.\n\nBut we need to ensure we don't re-read tokens we already read. We have coverage tokens: 0-10000, 11718-11918, 12194-12394, 13756-13956, 14245-14445, 18893-19093, etc. So we haven't read 10000-11718? Wait 0-10000 covers 0-10000. Next coverage is 11718-11918. So 10000-11718 is unvisited. That includes 1700 tokens. We should read that range. Also 10000-12000 maybe. Let's read 10000-12000. Then maybe 12000-14000 etc.\n\nWe need to find facts. The snippet at 3900-4600 has facts about NIH. The Complaint continues after 5000-10000 with many facts about NIH policies. So we should read 10000-12000, maybe 12000-14000.\n\nThus next action: read_document Complaint for tokens 10000-12000.\n\nBut we must ensure we do not re-read tokens that were visited 0-10000. We haven't read 10000-12000. So ok.\n\nLet's do read_document.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":10000,\"end_token\":12000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 12000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10906, "completion_tokens": 1566, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
