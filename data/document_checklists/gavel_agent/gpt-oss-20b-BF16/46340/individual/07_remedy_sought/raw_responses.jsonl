We have seen some matches: Complaint shows plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment, injunctive relief; Order shows United States seeks an emergency stay. Also Order Re Preliminary Injunction shows plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, attorney's fees, etc. We need to extract each distinct value: \"Plaintiff: declaratory judgment\", \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\", \"Plaintiff: attorney’s fees and costs\"? Probably yes. For defendants: \"Defendant: emergency stay of preliminary injunction\" maybe. Also maybe defendant seeks something? In Order Re Preliminary Injunction, maybe defendants request something? We saw maybe defendant's motion? But need remedy sought by each party. So we need to capture remedies requested by plaintiffs and defendants. In Order, the United States (defendant) seeks emergency stay. So \"Defendant: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction\". Also maybe \"Defendant: ...\"? Let's search for \"seeks\" pattern in Order again but we saw only that. Also check \"seek\" in Order Re Preliminary Injunction for defendant side: maybe \"defendants seek ...\"? We saw \"plaintiffs filed a motion ...\". No. So only remedy sought by defendants is emergency stay. Also maybe \"Defendant: ...\"? Also maybe \"Defendant: ...\"? The order might have \"The United States seeks an emergency stay\" so that's the remedy. Also maybe \"Defendant: ...\"? Should also capture attorneys fees as remedy sought by plaintiffs? The clause \"and attorney’s fees and costs\" likely remedy sought. So that's \"Plaintiff: attorney’s fees and costs\". Also maybe \"Plaintiff: declaratory judgment\" and \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\". Also \"Plaintiff: declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331\" maybe? But we just need remedy: declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs. Also \"Plaintiff: ...\"? We need to capture each unique value. So we need to read those parts again to get evidence. We have some snippets but need to read full context for clarity. We should read relevant portions from Complaint, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, and Order. Let's read from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief around tokens 2890-3100 we already have; that includes \"Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\" Also earlier we saw \"Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\" and \"and injunctive relief\". Actually we saw earlier \"Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\" and maybe \"and injunctive relief\" somewhere. Let's search again for \"injunctive relief\" in Complaint. We saw earlier search match at tokens 200-400 but that was contact info. But earlier we saw \"injunctive relief\" in search results. Let's read a bit around that. Let's read from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief around tokens 200-400 maybe doesn't show. Let's search for \"injunctive relief\" again but maybe we need to read from tokens 8136-8336 in Order Re Preliminary Injunction for the phrase \"the complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief\". We already have snippet. For the attorneys fees, we need to capture \"attorney’s fees and costs\". So we can read that snippet.\n\nAlso need to read from Order: tokens 954-1154 for \"The United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251\".\n\nThus we need evidence for each remedy.\n\nWe need to produce append_checklist with key \"Remedy_Sought\" and for each entry: value string like \"Plaintiff: declaratory judgment\" etc. Each entry must include evidence array with text, source_document, location. For location we can use page number or token range. In snippet we have tokens. We can use location e.g., \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, tokens 2890-3100\" or page 6 of 44. Provided snippet shows page 6.\n\nWe can include evidence for each remedy from different document. Let's gather evidence:\n\nFrom Complaint snippet: \"Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\" Also earlier we saw \"Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\" That's remedy. Also maybe \"Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief\" but that we need to locate. We saw \"the complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief\" in Order Re Preliminary Injunction. That includes both. But to get \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\" we can use that snippet. For \"Plaintiff: declaratory judgment\" we can use Complaint snippet.\n\nFor \"Plaintiff: attorney’s fees and costs\" we can use snippet from Order Re Preliminary Injunction.\n\nFor \"Defendant: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction\" we can use snippet from Order.\n\nThus we need to read these tokens if not already. We have already read some tokens. But we may need to read the snippet for \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\" but it's from Order Re Preliminary Injunction snippet we already saw. That snippet is tokens 8136-8336. We have that. For attorneys fees snippet also from same file. For defendant, snippet tokens 954-1154. Already read.\n\nWe need to ensure we have evidence for each. The evidence text must be verbatim snippet. We can use the snippet we have. So we need to produce append_checklist.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with all four entries.\n\nWe need to ensure that we provide evidence array with one evidence per entry.\n\nLet's construct the JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Remedy_Sought\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: declaratory judgment\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 6 of 44, tokens 2890-3100\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"the complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorney’s fees and costs.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Order Re Preliminary Injunction\",\n              \"location\": \"Tokens 8136-8336\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: attorney’s fees and costs\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"the complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorney’s fees and costs.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Order Re Preliminary Injunction\",\n              \"location\": \"Tokens 8136-8336\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"The United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251, Exclusions From Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs, 90 Fed.

But orders may not request; they are court decisions. So only pleadings: Complaint, Ex Parte Motion.\n\nAlso the Order maybe a court order requiring \"emergency stay\" which is a remedy requested by United States (defendant). That is already included.\n\nWe need to search the Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause. Let's read it. We need to read its text. It might contain remedy requests: \"temporary restraining order\", \"injunction\", \"injunctive relief\", \"injunction to enjoin\", \"injunction to prevent re-implementation of EO 14251\".\n\nThus we should read the Ex Parte Motion.

Also maybe \"injunctive relief\" for specific parts like \"injunctive relief to enjoin\" etc. The Complaint likely has a paragraph enumerating remedies: declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, damages? Let's search in Complaint for \"remedy\" or \"remedies\" or \"injunctive\" or \"injunction\". We already searched \"remedy\" and \"injunctive relief\". But maybe we didn't capture all. Let's search for \"remedies\" or \"remedy\" again. We saw 2 matches earlier. But maybe more matches exist. Let's do a regex search for \"remedy\" or \"remedies\" across all documents. But we already did that: found 2 matches in Order Re Preliminary Injunction. That might indicate the Complaint didn't have the word \"remedy\". But the Complaint had \"seek a declaratory judgment\" and \"seek injunctive relief\". Those were captured. There might be other remedy requests like \"injunctive relief\" is counted. Also possibly \"attorney’s fees and costs\" is a remedy. Also \"emergency stay\" we captured.

We have already extracted 4 values: Plaintiff declaratory judgment, Plaintiff injunctive relief, Plaintiff attorney's fees and costs, Defendant emergency stay. But we likely have more remedies, especially from the Ex Parte Motion (temporary restraining order, various enjoinings). Also from the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: likely other remedies: \"declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs\" – maybe also \"specific performance\" etc? Let's inspect other documents.\n\nWe haven't fully reviewed Order and Order Re Preliminary Injunction beyond the limited windows. We could search for \"remedy\" pattern again but we might need more. Let's search for \"request\", \"seek\", \"seeking\", \"seek\", \"request\" etc. But we should focus on Remedy_Sought. The Ex Parte Motion clearly contains many requests: temporary restraining order, enjoining defendants from implementing EO 14251, etc. We need to extract each requested remedy separately. The text in the Ex Parte Motion is lengthy, but we have the whole document read (tokens 0-3482). We need to parse each specific remedy request.\n\nFrom the Ex Parte Motion, we saw at lines 5-7 the request: \"that this Court issue a temporary restraining order, to remain in effect until such time as the Court can further consider the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims, as follows:\" Then enumerated (1) enjoining Agency Defendants and Agency Head Defendants and their agents and successors from implementing or otherwise giving effect to the March 27 Executive Order ... (2) enjoining the Secretary of Transportation ... (3) enjoining Defendant agency heads ... (4) rescinding any and all guidance or direction that has already issued ... So these are remedies requested by plaintiffs. Also earlier the motion title: \"EX PARTE MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE WHY PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION SHOULD NOT ISSUE\". So remedy: TRO, and order to show cause? But the remedy is the TRO; the motion is to obtain a TRO. Also \"order to show cause why preliminary injunction should not issue\" is the request. Maybe \"order to show cause\" is a remedy.\n\nAlso in the Order Re Preliminary Injunction, after the complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and attorney’s fees and costs. Also the complaint may request \"injunctive relief\" (that's included). Also the complaint may request \"declaratory judgment\" (included). Also \"attorney's fees and costs\" (included). In the Order, the United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction. That's included.\n\nWe probably also need to extract from the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief other remedies beyond the ones already captured. The Complaint may also request \"injunctive relief\" and \"attorney's fees and costs\" etc. But we captured those. But there might be more: \"declaratory judgment\" we captured. Maybe \"specific performance\" or \"injunctive relief\" includes \"injunctive relief\" but we have that. The Complaint could also request \"injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of EO 14251\" etc. But we need to check.\n\nWe haven't read the Complaint beyond tokens 2890-3100 and earlier tokens 200-400, 11098-11298, 11973-12173, 12339-12539, 21609-21809. Those windows may not cover all remedies. We need to search for \"remedy\" or \"seek\" or \"request\" within the Complaint. But we only did limited search earlier. We need to find all remedies in the Complaint.\n\nAlso we might need to search for \"injunctive relief\" again but maybe earlier. We did earlier search for \"injunctive relief\" and got the matches. But there may be other remedies in the Complaint like \"declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs, and [others]\". We captured those 3. But maybe also \"specific performance\" or \"injunctive relief to enjoin\" etc. Let's search for \"specific performance\" in the Complaint. Also \"injunctive relief\" we captured. Maybe \"injunctive relief\" is repeated, but we only need distinct values.\n\nWe also need to capture remedies requested by defendants? The Order has a remedy requested by the United States: emergency stay. Also maybe the Order includes other remedies: \"emergency stay\" only. So we have 1 defendant remedy.\n\nWe also need to capture remedies requested by plaintiffs in the Order Re Preliminary Injunction? The complaint sought injunctive relief; but the Order may request \"emergency stay\" only. So we have 3 plaintiff remedies (declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs) and 1 defendant remedy (emergency stay). But from Ex Parte Motion, there are many more plaintiff remedies: TRO, order to show cause, enjoin defendants from implementing EO, enjoin Secretary of Transportation from issuing orders, enjoin agency heads from submitting reports, rescind guidance/direction, etc. We also need to capture \"temporary restraining order\" as a remedy. Also \"order to show cause\" is a remedy. Also \"enjoin\" actions are remedies. So many.\n\nThus we need to read the Ex Parte Motion to capture all remedy requests. We have the entire text. We need to parse the enumerated list.\n\nLet's locate the enumerated list:\n\nIn the excerpt, after \"as follows:\" we have:\n\n(1) enjoining Agency Defendants and Agency Head Defendants and their agents and successors from implementing or otherwise giving effect to the March 27 Executive Order entitled “Exclusions From Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs,” (“Exclusion Order”) including by: a. Refusing to recognize as exclusive representatives of bargaining unit employees unions who were certified exclusive representatives prior to the Exclusion Order; b. Terminating or otherwise treating as ineffective collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) that were in effect prior to the Exclusion Order’s issuance; c. Suspending or terminating voluntary payroll dues deductions for union members or refusing to process dues deduction requests pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7115; d. Eliminating the use of official time as set forth in Chapter 71 of Title 5 and binding CBAs and reassigning employees who performed official time pursuant to Section 6(a) of the Exclusion Order; e. Refusing to participate in proceedings before the Federal Labor Relations Authority; and\n\n(2) enjoining the Secretary of Transportation from issuing orders excluding subdivisions of the Department of Transportation pursuant to Section 5 of the Exclusion Order;\n\n(3) enjoining Defendant agency heads from submitting reports identifying additional subdivisions to be excluded from Chapter 71 pursuant to Section 7 of the Exclusion Order; and\n\n(4) rescinding any and all guidance or direction that has already issued that relates to implementing or enforcing the Exclusion Order, including the March 27 Memorandum from Charles Ezell to Heads and Acting Heads of Departments and Agencies entitled “Guidance on Executive Order Exclusions from Federal Labor-Relations Programs.”\n\nAlso earlier: \"that this Court issue a temporary restraining order, to remain in effect until such time as the Court can further consider the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims, as follows:\" So the remedy: temporary restraining order. Also \"order to show cause why preliminary injunction should not issue\" as remedy? The title suggests it's to show cause why preliminary injunction should not issue. The remedy: order to show cause. But maybe the remedy is to have the court issue an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue. We can treat that as a remedy: \"order to show cause regarding preliminary injunction\". But the description: \"EX PARTE MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE WHY PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION SHOULD NOT ISSUE.\" So we can extract two remedies: \"temporary restraining order\" and \"order to show cause why preliminary injunction should not issue.\"\n\nAlso the enumerated items 1-4 can be considered remedies: \"enjoin Agency Defendants... from implementing EO 14251\" etc. We can treat each enumerated item as a separate remedy: (1) enjoin agency defendants from implementing the EO; (2) enjoin Secretary of Transportation from issuing orders; (3) enjoin agency heads from submitting reports; (4) rescind guidance/direction. That gives 4 remedies. So total from Ex Parte Motion: 2 + 4 = 6 remedies.\n\nThus overall we have: 3 from Complaint, 6 from Ex Parte Motion, 1 from Order. That totals 10 remedies.\n\nWe need to extract each unique remedy string. Format: \"Plaintiff: [remedy]\" or \"Defendant: [remedy]\".\n\nThus we need to produce entries for each remedy.\n\nWe need evidence: snippet from document, source_document, location (page, section). We have the Ex Parte Motion as doc name: \"Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause\". We need to provide evidence for each remedy from that doc. The excerpt covers relevant lines. We can provide snippet like \"temporary restraining order...\" etc. Also for enumerated items, we can provide snippet lines that include the phrase. The location: we can approximate page numbers. The doc has 7 pages. The excerpt lines: The lines show \"EX PARTE MOTION ...\" etc. We can use page numbers: The excerpt shows page numbers: e.g., \"Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD Document 15 Filed 04/07/25 Page 1 of 7\" at top. So we can use page 1 for the initial request. The enumerated list appears on page 3? We need to check location. The excerpt shows page numbers in the text: e.g., \"Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD Document 15 Filed 04/07/25 Page 2 of 7\" at top of page 2. The enumerated list appears across pages 3-4. But we can approximate location as page 3. For each remedy, we can provide location: page 3 or 4. We can provide token ranges? But we don't have token numbers. We can provide page numbers.\n\nAlso for the other docs: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: we need evidence. We have snippet from tokens 2890-3100 with \"Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\" So we can provide that as evidence.\n\nAlso for Plaintiff: injunctive relief and attorney's fees and costs: evidence from Order Re Preliminary Injunction tokens 8136-8336. But we also might need to capture the remedy \"injunctive relief\" from the Complaint too? We extracted it earlier. The snippet \"the complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorney’s fees and costs.\" is from Order Re Preliminary Injunction. But we also need to capture \"injunctive relief\" from Complaint. But we didn't capture that yet. We have only extracted declaratory judgment from Complaint. We didn't extract injunctive relief from Complaint. But maybe the Complaint also requests injunctive relief. We need to verify. We could search for \"injunctive relief\" in Complaint. We already searched earlier and matched tokens 200-400 and 8136-8336. The match in Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief shows same snippet? The match tokens 200-400 only shows header. So we need to read more of the Complaint to find the remedies. We should read more tokens in the Complaint. We have partially visited the Complaint with token ranges: 200-400, 2890-3100, 11098-11298, 11973-12173, 12339-12539, 21609-21809. We haven't read the part that includes the remedies. We should read more of the Complaint to capture the remedies. Let's read a larger window near the remedy section. We need to locate the remedy request. Usually the Complaint will have a section like \"WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays...\" but the remedies requested might be earlier. We can search for \"seek\" or \"request\" in the Complaint. But we have \"search_document_regex\" earlier for \"seek\" found 5 matches in Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief but we didn't view them? We had matches maybe but not read. The search returned matches but we didn't read the content. Let's perform a new search_document_regex on the Complaint for \"seek\" to get context. We can also search for \"injunctive relief\" again but to get context. But we need to read. Let's use search_document_regex on \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" for pattern \"injunctive relief\" with more context. That will give us the snippet around the remedy. Then we can append.\n\nAlso we need to capture \"attorney's fees and costs\" from the Complaint too? The complaint might request attorney's fees and costs as well, but we already captured attorney's fees and costs from the Order Re Preliminary Injunction. But the Complaint may also request them. We need to check.\n\nThus we need to read more of the Complaint to capture all remedies.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex on the Complaint for \"injunctive relief\" with context tokens 200. Then read that snippet.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n  \"pattern\": \"injunctive relief\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 5,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "pattern": "injunctive relief", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8764, "completion_tokens": 2886, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Currently we have 4 remedy_sought values. But need to ensure all distinct values across all documents. We have from Complaint, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Order. We might have more in other docs: Docket may contain filings. Ex Parte Motion also likely includes remedies sought (temporary restraining order, etc). That doc was fully visited, but no remedy extraction yet. Need to extract remedies sought from Ex Parte Motion. Also possibly other documents (Docket?) may have remedy requests. But likely the main remedies in motions.\n\nAlso might be remedies sought in Order? We have one: emergency stay of preliminary injunction. Maybe also other orders include requests? But we have only one from Order.\n\nWe should read from Ex Parte Motion to identify remedy(s). It likely includes requests for TRO and order to show cause, enjoining defendants from implementing EO 14251, etc. We need to extract each requested remedy as separate value: \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order\" etc. Also maybe \"Plaintiff: order to show cause\" but that's a procedural request, but still remedy? The requirement: remedies each party asks the court to grant, not what the court ultimately ordered or settled. So includes TRO, order to show cause, injunction, declaratory judgment, attorney's fees. So we need to parse Ex Parte Motion for remedies.\n\nWe have full document text above. Let's search for \"tres\" maybe \"temporarily restraining order\" etc. We saw in the excerpt: \"the court can further consider the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims, as follows: (1) enjoining Agency Defendants ... (2) enjoining the Secretary of Transportation ... (3) enjoining Defendant agency heads ... (4) rescinding any and all guidance ...\" So remedies: enjoin, rescind, etc. Also earlier: \"request, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b) and Local Civil Rule 65.1(a), that this Court issue a temporary restraining order, to remain in effect until such time as the Court can further consider the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims.\" Also request for order to show cause. Also possibly request for injunctive relief (the same). So we need to extract distinct remedies.\n\nWe need to read more of the Ex Parte Motion text to capture all remedies. Let's read from token 0-3500 we already have entire doc. But we may need to locate all remedy statements. We can use search_document_regex on Ex Parte Motion for pattern \"tres\" or \"injunctive\" etc. But maybe easier: read again but we have entire doc. Let's search for \"temporary restraining\" and \"injunctive\" within the doc.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on that doc.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause\",\"pattern\":\"temporary restraining\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause", "pattern": "temporary restraining", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8575, "completion_tokens": 624, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We already have 4 values found: \"Plaintiff: declaratory judgment\", \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\", \"Plaintiff: attorney’s fees and costs\", \"Defendant: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction\".\n\nBut there may be more. We need to ensure we extracted all distinct remedy sought from all documents. We have partially visited some documents. We might need to read more of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Order Re Preliminary Injunction to find more remedies. Also maybe Order (the \"Order\" doc) might contain remedies sought? Usually the order is the decision, not the remedy sought. But maybe the order includes the request for emergency stay? Already captured.\n\nWe also need to check if Ex Parte Motion for TRO includes remedies sought; but that's a motion, not a complaint. But the question is \"remedies each party asks the court to grant\". The Ex Parte Motion likely requests a temporary restraining order. But it might be a request for a TRO to stay the preliminary injunction. That is a remedy sought by plaintiffs? Actually the plaintiffs are requesting a TRO to stay the preliminary injunction. That is a remedy sought by plaintiffs. But the remedy sought is a \"temporary restraining order\" (TRO) to stay the preliminary injunction. But we already captured \"Defendant: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction\" from Order. That might be the same remedy. But we might need to capture the plaintiffs' remedy in the Ex Parte Motion. But that is a request for a TRO, which is a remedy sought. Also the order may not contain remedy sought. So we should read Ex Parte Motion to find remedy sought. But the Ex Parte Motion is fully visited, so we have the text. We need to search within it for remedy. We can search for \"temporary restraining\" or \"TRO\" or \"stay\". Let's search for \"TRO\" in the Ex Parte Motion. Use search_document_regex on that doc with pattern \"temporary restraining\" or \"TRO\" etc. But we need to parse the remedy. The Ex Parte Motion contains \"request ... to issue a temporary restraining order, to remain in effect until such time as the Court can further consider the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims\". That is a remedy sought by plaintiffs: a temporary restraining order. So we should add \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order\" or \"Plaintiff: TRO\". Also maybe they want a \"stay\" of the preliminary injunction. That is a remedy: staying the preliminary injunction. That is a remedy sought by plaintiffs. But the order text says \"Defendant: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction\". That was the defendant's request? Wait, the defendant is the United States. The order says \"The United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction\". So that is the defendant's remedy sought. The plaintiffs in the Ex Parte Motion want a TRO to stay the preliminary injunction. So that remedy is also a stay of the preliminary injunction. So the remedy sought by plaintiffs is \"temporary restraining order to stay the preliminary injunction\". We might capture that as \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order to stay the preliminary injunction\". But the format requirement: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]'. So we can put \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order to stay the preliminary injunction\". That may be too long but it's fine.\n\nAlso the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief might contain more remedies: e.g., \"injunctive relief\" we captured, \"declaratory judgment\" captured, \"attorney's fees and costs\" captured. Are there other remedies like \"injunctions\" or \"injunctive relief\" maybe \"injunctive relief\" and \"injunctive relief to stay the preliminary injunction\"? Not sure.\n\nAlso the Order Re Preliminary Injunction might contain the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, attorney's fees and costs. Already captured. Might also contain \"injunctive relief\" etc.\n\nAlso maybe there's \"injunctive relief to halt the enforcement of EO 14251\" etc. But that is likely part of injunctive relief.\n\nAlso maybe \"injunctive relief\" and \"injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the executive order\" is captured under injunctive relief.\n\nAlso maybe \"injunctive relief\" includes \"injunctive relief to stay the preliminary injunction\" but that's in the order. Already captured.\n\nWe also need to check the Docket maybe not relevant.\n\nWe need to ensure no other remedy sought from other documents. The Order document might be a decision, but maybe it includes \"the Court granted the Plaintiffs relief...\" but that's not remedy sought.\n\nLet's search the Order document for \"seek\" or \"seeks\" or \"request\" etc. But the order may not have remedy sought.\n\nHowever, maybe the Order includes \"The United States seeks an emergency stay...\" which we captured. That is the only remedy from Order.\n\nWe should confirm if the Order includes any other remedy sought. But the Order may contain the defendant's request for stay of the preliminary injunction. That is captured.\n\nAlso the Order might contain the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief? But the order is the court's decision, not the plaintiffs' request.\n\nThus likely the remedy sought list is 5 items: 4 from previous plus 1 from Ex Parte Motion.\n\nBut we also need to check if the Ex Parte Motion includes any other remedies: e.g., \"injunctive relief\" like \"stay the preliminary injunction\" maybe we captured. Also maybe \"injunction\" to stop certain actions. But that's the same as TRO.\n\nAlso the Ex Parte Motion might request \"temporary restraining order\" which is a remedy sought. So we will add \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order\".\n\nAlso, the Ex Parte Motion might also request \"a stay of the preliminary injunction\" which we captured as the defendant's remedy. But maybe the plaintiffs also request a stay. But we should capture all distinct remedy sought. So we add \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order to stay the preliminary injunction\". But maybe it's better to split: \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order\" and \"Plaintiff: stay of the preliminary injunction\". But the same remedy is the same. But the requirement: \"Include requests from both plaintiffs and defendants. Extract each requested remedy as a separate value, formatted as: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]' or 'Defendant: [remedy].'\"\n\nThus we can add \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order\" and \"Plaintiff: stay of the preliminary injunction\". But that may duplicate the defendant's \"emergency stay\" but it's still requested by plaintiffs. The defendant's remedy is \"emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction\". The plaintiffs also want a temporary restraining order to stay the preliminary injunction. So we have two separate remedies: \"temporary restraining order\" and \"stay of the preliminary injunction\" for plaintiffs. But the defendant also requests \"emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction\". That is similar but we will keep as separate.\n\nThus we likely have 6 distinct remedies:\n\n1. Plaintiff: declaratory judgment\n2. Plaintiff: injunctive relief\n3. Plaintiff: attorney’s fees and costs\n4. Defendant: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction\n5. Plaintiff: temporary restraining order\n6. Plaintiff: stay of the preliminary injunction\n\nBut maybe #6 is redundant with #5? But they are distinct: TRO is a remedy; stay of the preliminary injunction is a remedy. But the TRO is to stay the preliminary injunction. But it's still a separate remedy. But we can list both.\n\nWe need to confirm that the Ex Parte Motion includes \"temporary restraining order\" and \"stay of the preliminary injunction\". Let's search the Ex Parte Motion text for \"temporary restraining order\" and \"stay\". We saw in the text: \"request ... to issue a temporary restraining order, to remain in effect until such time as the Court can further consider the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims\". And \"enjoining ... from implementing ...\". But we saw \"stay\" maybe not present. Let's search for \"stay\" or \"stay\" in the motion. The Ex Parte Motion text includes a section about \"enjoining ... from implementing ...\". It didn't include \"stay\" but the remedy is TRO. However, the TRO is to stay the preliminary injunction, but not explicitly in the Ex Parte Motion. But we can still include \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order\" as remedy sought. The stay is inherent in the TRO.\n\nWe should also search for \"injunctive\" in the Ex Parte Motion. But we saw the Ex Parte Motion includes \"temporary restraining order\" and \"stay of the preliminary injunction\" not explicitly but we can include.\n\nSearch for \"temporary restraining order\" in Ex Parte Motion. We'll search again. Use search_document_regex on Ex Parte Motion with pattern \"temporary restraining\" or \"TRO\". Let's do it.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause\",\"pattern\":\"temporary restraining\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause", "pattern": "temporary restraining", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9136, "completion_tokens": 1938, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But maybe there are more. We need to ensure all distinct values in any document. Let's review the documents: we have Complaint, Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Ex Parte Motion (already visited fully), and Docket (unvisited). We likely need to search Docket for remedy requests? Docket may contain docket entries with requested relief. We should search for \"remedy\" or \"seek\" or \"request\" etc. But we already extracted maybe from Complaint and Order and Order Re Preliminary. Let's examine the extracted values: we know they came from 1 from Complaint, 2 from Order Re Preliminary, 1 from Order. But there might be more in Docket or other parts of Complaint or Order not yet read. We should search for \"remedy\" across all documents, maybe including Docket.

The Order may contain requested remedies by parties. We should check that Order. There is also the Order Re Preliminary Injunction with some remedies. We have 4 values already. But there might be more from Order. Let's search the Order for \"remedy\" and \"injunctive relief\" etc. Use search_document_regex on Order with pattern \"remedy|injunctive relief|seek|request\" maybe.

But we already extracted 4: 1 from Complaint, 2 from Order Re Preliminary, 1 from Order.

That is a remedy. Did we include that? The current extracted values: 4 entries. Which ones? We don't know but likely include: \"Plaintiff: enjoin the Exclusion Order\" (from Complaint), \"Defendant: enjoin the Exclusion Order\"? Wait that is plaintiff. The Order Re Preliminary likely has two remedy requests: Plaintiff seeks \"injunctive relief to enjoin the Exclusion Order\" and Defendant seeks \"injunctive relief to ...\"? Actually Order Re Preliminary may have both parties' requests. Let's examine the Order Re Preliminary we have partially visited tokens 1013-1213 (probably early part).

Also the Ex Parte Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause was fully visited; but maybe it contains \"remedy sought\" like \"temporary restraining order\" and \"order to show cause\" etc. But we already extracted from that? Wait step 12 search found matches in Ex Parte Motion; but we haven't appended those remedies? The current status says only 4 values from Complaint, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Order. The Ex Parte Motion presumably includes a request for a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause; but maybe those were not included. But maybe the Remedy_Sought key is already intended to capture all remedies sought across all documents, including motions. The Ex Parte Motion was fully visited but we didn't extract its remedies.

Let's search in Ex Parte Motion for \"temporary restraining\" and \"order to show cause\" etc. But the Ex Parte Motion was fully visited; we can read relevant sections. But we haven't extracted from it. So we need to read windows containing \"temporary restraining order\" etc. Let's search again with regex. Probably we need to extract \"temporary restraining order\" and \"order to show cause\" requested. Also \"stay of injunction\" etc. Also \"emergency stay\" we already have from Order. Also \"preliminary injunction\" we have from Order Re Preliminary Injunction. Also \"declaratory judgment\" we have from Complaint. Also \"injunctive relief\" we have. Also \"emergency stay\" we have. Also \"temporary restraining order\" and \"order to show cause\" from Ex Parte Motion. Also maybe \"injunction\" and \"temporary restraining order\" from Ex Parte Motion. Also \"emergency stay\" from Order. Maybe also \"injunction\" from Order Re Preliminary Injunction.\n\nCheck the Ex Parte Motion: The search earlier shows multiple matches. Let's read around the matches. Use search_document_regex on Ex Parte Motion with pattern \"temporary restraining\" to get matches. But we already did, but we didn't read the context. We can read tokens around the match. For example match 3 tokens 1523-1723 includes the request: \"request... that this Court issue a temporary restraining order...\". Also maybe earlier matches include the title and \"temporary restraining order\". Let's read windows around each match. Let's call read_document for tokens 1500-1700. Also maybe other remedies: \"order to show cause\" also present. Let's search for \"order to show cause\" or \"OSC\" or \"show cause\". Let's search for \"order to show cause\" pattern. Use search_document_regex.\n\nThus we should next action: search_document_regex on Ex Parte Motion for pattern \"order to show cause\" and maybe \"temporary restraining order\". But we already have matches for temporary restraining order. But we need to confirm extracts. Let's do search for \"temporary restraining\" again but read tokens around them.\n\nBut the system: we can call search_document_regex to get matches. But we already did search earlier. But we can still do again to get context. We might need to read text for evidence. Let's call read_document for tokens 1500-1700. Also maybe tokens 1200-1400 for earlier match. Let's see. But we need one action per turn. So we can choose read_document. But we need to provide evidence. So we need to read the text containing remedy. Let's read tokens around match 3: 1523-1723. That window should contain the remedy. We'll read 1500-1700. That will give us the context. Then we will append the remedy for Defendant? Actually the motion is by plaintiffs requesting remedy from court: \"temporary restraining order\" and \"order to show cause.\" The request is from plaintiffs. So we should add \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order\" and \"Plaintiff: order to show cause\". But maybe the motion also requests \"injunctive relief\" or \"declaratory judgment\"? But for now, we see remedy.\n\nAlso maybe the docket may contain \"remedy sought\" but not likely.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Ex Parte Motion for tokens 1500-1700.

But we need to extract every distinct value of Remedy_Sought. We have 4 values, but maybe more exist. We need to ensure all remedies sought are extracted from all documents. We have searched many but maybe not all. We have not searched the Docket. Docket may have remedy requests? Dockets usually have case info, not remedy. But perhaps docket has some remedy statements in summary? Usually not. But we should search for \"remedy\" in Docket too. However we haven't visited Docket yet. We might need to search Docket for \"remedy\" or \"injunction\" or \"stay\" etc. But the requirement: \"remedies each party asks the court to grant, not what the court ultimately ordered or what the parties settled.\" So we need to extract remedy requests from the pleadings and motions. We have:\n\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: likely requests declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. We have 1 value from that doc. But maybe there are more remedy requests (e.g., injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of Exec Order). The 1 value we extracted earlier might be \"Plaintiff: declaratory judgment and injunctive relief\". But we need to extract each separate remedy: e.g., \"Plaintiff: declaratory judgment\" and \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\". But the instructions say \"format as: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]' or 'Defendant: [remedy]'.\"\n\nWe should check the complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief text around where it says \"Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant\" etc. The snippet shows \"Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant\" but not the rest. We might need to read more tokens to capture remedy details. The snippet we read earlier 2896-3096 shows part of that clause. Let's search again within Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief specifically for \"seek a declaratory judgment\" or \"injunctive relief\". But we have already searched for \"injunctive\" and found 0 matches in step 15. But that was \"injunctive\" only. But we might need to read the area around tokens 2896-3096 again to capture the remedy request. But we might need to read the exact remedy request. The snippet shows \"Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant\" but not the rest after that. Let's scroll a bit further after 3096 to include the rest of the sentence. We need to read tokens 3096-3300 maybe. Let's read that range.\n\nAlso, we might need to find other remedy requests in other documents. The Order Re Preliminary Injunction may have plaintiff remedy requests: \"Plaintiffs ask to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\". That's a remedy request. We already captured 2 values from that doc. But maybe there are more remedy requests in that doc: e.g., \"Plaintiffs also seek\" etc. We might need to read more of that doc to capture all remedy requests. We have partially visited it. We saw tokens 1005-1213 (the main remedy request). But there might be other remedy requests further down: maybe \"in addition, plaintiffs seek injunctive relief\" etc. We should search for \"seek\" or \"ask\" or \"request\" around remedy. But we can search for \"seek\" in that doc again but maybe we already did earlier. There were 5 matches found earlier. But we might need to read them. We only saw the first two matches. Let's look at step 16 matches: They show matches from 0-185, 1005-1205, 1246-1446, 1823-2023. But maybe there are more matches after 2000. The search gave 5 matches. We captured 2 from 1005-1205, but maybe 1246-1446 also contains remedy request. That snippet shows \"Plaintiffs have raised serious questions under the First Amendment... and that an injunction would be in the public interest.\" Not a remedy request but a justification. But might not be a remedy request. But the main remedy request is the injunction. So maybe 2 remedy requests: \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief (preliminary enjoin enforcement of Exec Order)\" and maybe \"Defendant: ???\" but defendants might request something? In the Order doc, we saw \"The United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction\". That's a remedy request by the defendant. So that's a remedy: \"Defendant: emergency stay of preliminary injunction.\" So we have 4 values: presumably:\n\n- Plaintiff: declaratory judgment (maybe plus injunctive relief) from Complaint\n- Plaintiff: preliminary injunction (or enjoin enforcement) from Order Re Preliminary Injunction\n- Defendant: emergency stay of preliminary injunction from Order\n- Possibly Defendant: ??? from order? But maybe also \"Defendant: ???\" from other doc? No.\n\nBut we might have missed remedy requests in Ex Parte Motion? That is a request for temporary restraining order: \"Plaintiffs request a temporary restraining order\" etc. The snippet shows they are requesting a temporary restraining order. That is a remedy. So we should extract that as well. Wait we didn't capture that earlier. The Ex Parte Motion was fully visited. But we have not extracted remedy from it. So we should extract \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order\" from Ex Parte Motion. Also maybe the Ex Parte Motion also requests a \"order to show cause\" but that's not a remedy. It's a procedural request. So we add that.\n\nThus we need at least 5 values: 1 from Complaint, 1 from Order Re Preliminary Injunction (injunction), 1 from Order (stay), 1 from Ex Parte Motion (temporary restraining order). Wait we also have maybe a remedy request from the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: \"Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment\" and \"injunctive relief\". That might count as two separate remedies. The instructions: \"Extract each requested remedy as a separate value, formatted as: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]' or 'Defendant: [remedy]'.\"\n\nThus we may need to split the complaint's remedy requests into two values: \"Plaintiff: declaratory judgment\" and \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\". The earlier append maybe added 4 values; but we need to check what those 4 were. We don't know the content of the 4 values. But likely they were:\n\n- Plaintiff: declaratory judgment\n- Plaintiff: injunctive relief\n- Defendant: emergency stay of preliminary injunction\n- Plaintiff: preliminary injunction? Wait that's from Order Re Preliminary Injunction. But maybe they added that too. Actually likely the 4 values were:\n\n1. Plaintiff: declaratory judgment\n2. Plaintiff: injunctive relief\n3. Plaintiff: preliminary injunction (or enjoin enforcement)\n4. Defendant: emergency stay\n\nBut the Order Re Preliminary Injunction is a plaintiff's request for injunction; the Order doc is a defendant's request for stay. So we have 4 values. But we might still be missing the Ex Parte Motion request for temporary restraining order. So we need to append that. Also check if there are other remedy requests in Order Re Preliminary Injunction: maybe they also asked for a \"temporary restraining order\" or \"injunction\" but we already captured. But the complaint may also request a \"injunctive relief\" (which we counted). So total 5 values.\n\nBut we should confirm that the Ex Parte Motion indeed contains a remedy request. The snippet shows \"request ... that this Court issue a temporary restraining order\". Yes.\n\nSo we need to append this new remedy.\n\nWe need to read the relevant part of the Ex Parte Motion to capture the exact wording. We already read tokens 1500-1700 but not the section where they request the temporary restraining order. The snippet at 1500-1700 shows the start of the request. But we need to confirm the wording: \"request ... that this Court issue a temporary restraining order, to remain in effect until such time as the Court can further consider the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims\". We might need to capture that snippet as evidence. We have the snippet from 1500-1700. That is enough.\n\nThus we can append one new entry: \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order\" with evidence from that snippet.\n\nBut we also need to ensure we don't miss any other remedy requests. Maybe the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief might also request \"injunctive relief\" and \"declaratory judgment\". We already have those. The Order Re Preliminary Injunction is a request for preliminary injunction. We have that. The Order is a request for emergency stay. We have that. So we have 5 total.\n\nWe need to check if any other documents contain remedy requests. The Docket is unlikely. But we could search Docket for \"stay\" or \"injunction\" to be safe. But we can proceed with appending the Ex Parte Motion remedy. Then run get_checklist to ensure all keys are filled. But the goal is to stop only when all keys are filled. We only have one key. So as soon as we have all remedies, we can stop.\n\nBut we need to confirm that the required value list is complete. We should ensure no other remedy requests exist in any document. Let's search the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief again for \"injunctive relief\" maybe there are two matches: we saw earlier 0 matches. But perhaps we didn't capture all. Let's search for \"injunctive relief\" again with context. Use search_document_regex on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. But we saw earlier step 10 found 1 match. Let's read that region to confirm the remedy request. But we may not need. We just need to ensure we have all remedies. But we might have missed the \"injunctive relief\" remedy request. But we likely captured it earlier in step 7 when we appended 4 values. But we should double-check if we inadvertently omitted the \"injunctive relief\" remedy. But step 7 appended 4 values. We don't know which ones. But we can assume they included both declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. But to be safe, we might search for \"injunctive relief\" again to confirm the remedy request text. But we can also read the region around 2896-3096 again to see the remedy request. But we already have that snippet. But we might need evidence for each remedy. For \"Plaintiff: declaratory judgment\" we need evidence snippet that says \"Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment\". For \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\" we need evidence snippet that says \"Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief\" or \"injunctive relief pursuant to\" etc. The snippet we have at tokens 2896-3096 shows \"Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant\". It doesn't show the injunctive part. But maybe the next sentence says \"and injunctive relief\". We need to read further tokens to capture that. So we may need to read tokens 3096-3300 to capture the rest. But we already appended the remedies earlier, so maybe the evidence was captured earlier. But we don't have evidence for each remedy. We need to ensure we have evidence for each. But the append action likely included evidence. But we can't verify.\n\nWe can still append the Ex Parte Motion remedy. That will add one new value. That is likely the only missing remedy.\n\nThus we will call append_checklist with one patch for key Remedy_Sought, extracted entry with value \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order\" and evidence snippet from Ex Parte Motion tokens 1500-1700. Provide location: maybe \"Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause\" page 3?

We might need to read more to capture missing remedies. Also Order Re Preliminary Injunction may have more remedies beyond the ones captured. Also Order might have additional remedies sought. And Ex Parte Motion already captured one remedy. The current count 5 may or may not be all.\n\nWe need to verify if any other documents contain remedies sought. The Docket is unvisited; might contain other requests? Probably not. But maybe the Complaint contains multiple remedies: e.g., injunctive relief, declaratory relief, monetary damages? We need to find all distinct remedy requests. Let's search for \"remedy\" or \"injunctive relief\" in Complaint. We already did some search but found limited. We should search for \"injunctive relief\" again but maybe other patterns like \"halt\", \"stop\", \"enjoin\", \"cease and desist\", etc. But the requirement: extract every distinct value of this checklist item. So we must capture every remedy each party asks the court to grant. So we need to scan all documents for remedy requests.\n\nLet's search in Complaint for \"injunctive relief\" and \"injunction\" etc. We already have search results but maybe not all. Let's do a broad search for \"injunctive relief\" and \"injunction\" and \"enjoin\" and \"temporary restraining\" etc. But we want to capture unique remedies. Let's use search_document_regex on Complaint with pattern \"injunctive relief|injunction|enjoin|temporary restraining|cease and desist|monetary damages|declaratory relief|injunctive|injunctive relief|injunction|injunctive relief|injunctive relief|injunctive relief\". But better to use a pattern that captures multiple expressions: \"(injunctive relief|injunction|enjoin|temporary restraining|cease and desist|monetary damages|declaratory relief)\". Let's search on Complaint.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"pattern\":\"(injunctive relief|injunction|enjoin|temporary restraining|cease and desist|monetary damages|declaratory relief)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "pattern": "(injunctive relief|injunction|enjoin|temporary restraining|cease and desist|monetary damages|declaratory relief)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5420, "completion_tokens": 580, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The summary says keys with values 1/1. But we need to ensure we captured every distinct remedy sought from all documents. The current extracted values: 5 values, but we need to confirm if we missed any.\n\nWe have documents: Complaint, Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Ex Parte Motion, Docket.\n\nWe have partially visited many sections of Complaint but not fully. We need to ensure we captured all remedy requests from Complaint, Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction. Also from Docket maybe? Docket unlikely contains remedy requests.\n\nWe have already extracted from Order Re Preliminary Injunction (two remedies). We got from Ex Parte Motion (temporary restraining order). We have 5 values total, but maybe there are more in Order (like injunctive relief, declaratory relief, etc.). The Order might be a court order, not a pleading, but it might request relief? Actually, the Order could be a court order that says \"the court grants injunctive relief\". That is not a request. So maybe not.\n\nBut we might have missed remedies in Complaint: e.g., injunctive relief, declaratory relief, temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction. Also maybe monetary damages. We need to read more of Complaint to capture remedy requests.\n\nLet's inspect the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. We have partially visited tokens 200-400, 2867-3100, 11098-11298, 11973-12173, 12276-12634, 12649-13025, 16942-17142, 21609-21811, 23403-23603, 23707-23907.\n\nBut we might need to read earlier tokens before 200? The complaint likely starts with a statement of jurisdiction, parties, etc. Remedy requests likely appear near the end of the complaint, after the allegations. We have tokens 11973-12173 etc. Maybe remedy requests are near the end. We didn't view the tail end. We need to read later tokens near 25000? Complaint is 25,573 tokens. So we need to view near the end, maybe last 500-1000 tokens. Since we have coverage 9% only, we haven't seen many sections.\n\nThus we need to read more of the Complaint to find all remedy requests.\n\nAlso Order Re Preliminary Injunction we might have missed some. But we have 5 values: 2 from Order Re Preliminary Injunction (I think 2 remedies: preliminary injunction and maybe declaratory relief). But we need to confirm.\n\nCheck the Order Re Preliminary Injunction: It includes \"Plaintiffs ask to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order pending the resolution of the merits of their claims on a fully developed record.\" That is a remedy: preliminary injunction. Maybe also \"enjoin the enforcement of the Executive Order pending the merits.\" Also maybe \"enjoin enforcement\" is same. Also maybe \"enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\" is one. Also \"enjoin enforcement pending the merits.\" That is one.\n\nWe might have also \"enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\" and \"enjoin enforcement pending the merits\" but those are same.\n\nAdditionally, maybe the complaint requests \"injunctive relief\" or \"declaratory relief.\" But we haven't captured.\n\nThus we need to search the Complaint for \"injunctive relief\" or \"injunction\" or \"temporary restraining\" etc. We already did search but may need to read the matches. But we didn't capture the remedy requests.\n\nLet's search the Complaint for \"injunctive relief\" again but maybe we need to read the matches.\n\nHowever, we did search earlier: step 19 search on Complaint with pattern including \"injunctive relief|injunction|enjoin|temporary restraining|cease and desist|monetary damages|declaratory relief\" and found 10 matches. But we didn't read those matches. We need to read them.\n\nWe need to read each match to extract remedy requests.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on Complaint with pattern: \"injunctive relief|injunction|enjoin|temporary restraining|cease and desist|monetary damages|declaratory relief\". We already did that and got 10 matches. We should read each match to see the remedy requests. But the search already returned the context for each match. We need to parse them.\n\nWe can read the matches manually from the logs: We saw match 1 tokens 200-400: it's just header with attorneys, no remedy.\n\nMatch 2 tokens 2867-3067: includes \"Because Defendants’ actions are ultra vires ... the Exclusion Order should be enjoined.\" That's a remedy request: \"enjoin the Exclusion Order.\" So remedy: \"Plaintiff: enjoin the Exclusion Order\" or \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief to enjoin the Exclusion Order.\" We'll format as \"Plaintiff: enjoin the Exclusion Order\" or \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief to enjoin the Exclusion Order.\" The requirement: format: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]' or 'Defendant: [remedy]'. So we will use \"Plaintiff: enjoin the Exclusion Order\" maybe.\n\nMatch 3 tokens 12276-12476: seems to be about orders with law firms, not remedy.\n\nMatch 4 tokens 12434-12634: also not remedy.\n\nMatch 5 tokens 12649-13025: includes \"temporary restraining order\" etc. Let's read: In match 6 tokens 12825-13025: includes \"they filed for a temporary restraining order on March 24, which was granted on March 28.\" So that is a past remedy. Not a request. But maybe the complaint also requests a temporary restraining order. The complaint likely requests a temporary restraining order. The match 6 may mention that. Let's read more around match 5 or 6.\n\nThe match 5 tokens 12649-12849 includes \"a temporary restraining order on March 24, which was granted on March 28.\" That's a past event, not a request. So not.\n\nBut maybe earlier parts of the complaint include \"We seek a preliminary injunction\" etc.\n\nAlso match 7 tokens 16942-17142: no remedy.\n\nMatch 8 tokens 21609-21811: no remedy.\n\nMatch 9 tokens 23403-23603: no remedy.\n\nMatch 10 tokens 23707-23907: no remedy.\n\nThus, only match 2 seems to include a request: \"enjoin the Exclusion Order.\" Maybe also match 1? No. So we need to extract that remedy.\n\nBut we might need to read more of the Complaint near the end to capture remedy requests. Usually, the complaint includes a \"Prayer for Relief\" section near the end listing the remedies sought: injunctive relief, declaratory relief, damages, etc. We haven't seen that. We need to find that section.\n\nLet's search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" or \"PRAYER\" or \"remedy\" in the Complaint. We already searched \"remedy\" earlier and found maybe none? Let's search \"PRAYER\" in Complaint.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on Complaint with pattern \"PRAYER|Prayer|prayer\" maybe.

Order may grant certain relief. Order Re Preliminary may seek preliminary injunction and declaratory etc.\n\nWe need to ensure all distinct values. We have partial coverage; maybe missing some remedies in Complaint (e.g., attorney fees, costs). We saw earlier step 18 append 1 value; step 7 appended 4 values. So 5 total.

Also \"monetary damages\" appears in Order? In Order Re Preliminary there's mention of monetary damages at the end of litigation. That's a remedy. Also \"temporary restraining order\" is a remedy. Also \"preliminary injunction\" is a remedy. The Order may grant damages? The Order might have \"grant\" of \"injunction\" etc. Also \"Attorney's fees\" might be granted?

But careful: regex with quotes. We can search for \"attorney's fees\" separately. Let's search for \"attorney's fees\" in Complaint. Already part of earlier search. But maybe not captured fully. Also maybe \"attorney fees\" no apostrophe.\n\nWe need to find all distinct remedy requests. Let's list potential distinct values:\n\nFrom Complaint (Declaratory/ Injunctive Relief):\n- Declaratory relief\n- Injunctive relief\n- Attorney’s fees and costs\n\nFrom Ex Parte Motion (TRO):\n- Temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nFrom Order Re Preliminary Injunction:\n- Preliminary injunction (preliminary enjoin enforcement)\n- Declaratory relief (maybe included)\n- Injunctive relief (maybe)\n- Monetary damages\n- Attorney’s fees and costs? Not sure.\n\nFrom Order (final order):\n- Injunctive relief? Might be a grant.

Also \"attorney fees\". Also \"costs\". Also \"monetary damages\". Also \"temporary restraining\". Also \"preliminary injunction\". Also \"injunctive relief\". Also \"declaratory relief\".\n\nLet's do search_document_regex with doc_name: \"all\" pattern: \"(attorney's fees|attorney fees|costs|monetary damages|temporary restraining|preliminary injunction|injunctive relief|declaratory relief|injunction|remedy)\". That might return many matches but we can pick distinct remedy phrases.\n\nHowever we should be cautious: The search might return many matches; we only need to capture distinct remedy requests. We may need to read the context to confirm each is a remedy request.\n\nWe can choose to search for \"attorney's fees\" first. Let's do that.\n\nAlso maybe \"monetary damages\" appears in the Order Re Preliminary. Already we saw mention: \"monetary damages at the end of litigation\". That's a remedy request.\n\nAlso \"injunctive relief\" appears in Complaint and Order.\n\nAlso \"temporary restraining order\" appears in Ex Parte Motion.\n\nAlso \"preliminary injunction\" appears in Order Re Preliminary.\n\nAlso \"declaratory relief\" appears in Complaint and Order Re Preliminary.\n\nAlso \"injunction\" appears.\n\nBut we need each distinct remedy as a separate entry: e.g., \"Plaintiff: Declaratory relief\", \"Plaintiff: Injunctive relief\", \"Plaintiff: Attorney's fees and costs\", \"Plaintiff: Monetary damages\", \"Plaintiff: Temporary restraining order\" etc. Also \"Defendant: ???\" maybe some remedies requested by defendants? In this case, maybe defendants ask for dismissal? But likely not.\n\nWe should search for \"defendant\" \"remedy\" maybe.\n\nBut maybe the Order includes \"Defendant: ???\" but not.\n\nBetter to search for \"defendant\" \"remedy\" but not necessary.\n\nIn summary, we need to ensure we have all distinct remedy requests across all documents.\n\nWe have 5 values currently but likely missing \"Monetary damages\" and maybe \"Attorney's fees and costs\" already present? I think we have 5 values: 1 from Complaint, 2 from Order Re Preliminary, 1 from Order, 1 from Ex Parte Motion. Let's examine which are those:\n\nFrom step 7 appended 4 values: likely from Complaint? That may include declaratory, injunctive, attorney fees, and maybe others. Step 18 appended 1 value from Ex Parte Motion. Step 7 appended 4 values for 1 key: Remedy_Sought. So those 4 values likely from Complaint? Actually step 7 appended 4 values after step 6 search. Step 7 appended 4 values for 1 key: Remedy_Sought. Those 4 values presumably from Complaint, include \"declaratory relief\", \"injunctive relief\", \"attorney's fees and costs\", \"monetary damages\"? But the Complaint may not ask for monetary damages. The Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief likely requests declaratory, injunctive, attorney's fees and costs. That's 3 values. But step 7 added 4 values, maybe included \"injunction\" separately? Or \"temporary restraining order\"? But that is from Ex Parte Motion. But step 7 was before reading Ex Parte Motion. So maybe step 7 appended 4 values: declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs, and maybe \"preliminary injunction\"? But Complaint didn't ask for preliminary.\n\nStep 18 appended 1 value: from Ex Parte Motion, likely \"Temporary restraining order\".\n\nStep 18 earlier also appended 1 value from Order Re Preliminary? Wait step 18 appended 1 value for 1 key: Remedy_Sought. That may be from Order Re Preliminary? But step 18 followed reading Ex Parte Motion. Maybe the search after reading Ex Parte Motion returned matches for Order Re Preliminary? Actually step 18 is after read_ex parte motion; then step 18 appended 1 value - probably the TRO. Step 7 appended 4 values from Complaint. So still missing Order Re Preliminary remedies. Step 18 appended only 1, so maybe that was the TRO. The Order Re Preliminary might not have been appended yet. So we still need to extract remedies from Order Re Preliminary.\n\nAlso we might need to append the remedies from Order (final) if any. But step 7 appended 4, step 18 appended 1, so 5 total. But we still need to add remedies from Order Re Preliminary (preliminary injunction, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, monetary damages). That's 4 distinct remedies. But maybe some duplicates with Complaint. Distinct entries: \"Plaintiff: Declaratory relief\" (already in Complaint). But we need to include each distinct value across all documents, not duplicates? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct value means unique string. So if declaratory relief appears in multiple documents, we still only include one entry? Usually we need to include each distinct value, but may want to list each unique remedy. I think duplicate remedy like declaratory relief appears in multiple documents but we only need one entry because it's same value. But the requirement says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to list all distinct remedy values across the corpus. That includes declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs, monetary damages, temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction. Also possibly \"injunction\" (but same as injunctive relief? Might be considered separate). But to be safe, include all distinct phrases: \"declaratory relief\", \"injunctive relief\", \"preliminary injunction\", \"temporary restraining order\", \"attorney’s fees and costs\", \"monetary damages\". That's 6 distinct values.\n\nWe currently have 5 values. Likely missing \"preliminary injunction\" and \"monetary damages\". So we need to extract those from Order Re Preliminary Injunction.\n\nThus next action: search for \"preliminary injunction\" in Order Re Preliminary Injunction. Also search for \"monetary damages\" in same.\n\nLet's perform search_document_regex on Order Re Preliminary Injunction for pattern \"(preliminary injunction|monetary damages)\". Use top_k maybe 5. We'll then read the relevant context to confirm.\n\nWe need to use search_document_regex with doc_name: \"Order Re Preliminary Injunction\", pattern: \"(preliminary injunction|monetary damages)\", flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k: 5.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order Re Preliminary Injunction\",\"pattern\":\"(preliminary injunction|monetary damages)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Re Preliminary Injunction", "pattern": "(preliminary injunction|monetary damages)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11672, "completion_tokens": 2266, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have 5 values: from Complaint, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Order, Ex Parte Motion. But maybe there are more? We need to ensure completeness. We have partially visited many documents but maybe some remedies not captured.\n\nWe saw matches for \"remedy|injunctive relief|enjoin|temporary restraining|declaratory relief|monetary damages\" in Order (3 matches) and Order Re Preliminary Injunction (13 matches). The Append had 5 values. But maybe some other remedies like \"attorney's fees and costs\" etc. In Order Re Preliminary Injunction, there was mention of \"attorney’s fees and costs\" and \"monetary damages\". Also \"injunctive relief\" etc.\n\nCheck if we have captured all distinct remedies. Let's list extracted values we have:\n\nFrom Complaint: likely \"declaratory and injunctive relief\" maybe also \"attorney's fees and costs\" but not sure.\n\nFrom Order Re Preliminary Injunction: \"preliminary enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\" maybe \"monetary damages\" etc.\n\nFrom Order: maybe \"injunctive relief\" etc.\n\nFrom Ex Parte Motion: \"temporary restraining order\" and \"injunctive relief\" maybe.\n\nWe might have missed \"attorney's fees and costs\" and \"monetary damages\" and \"injunctive relief\" etc. Also \"declaratory relief\" etc.\n\nWe need to read more to capture all distinct remedies. Let's search again for \"fees\" or \"damages\" or \"injunctive relief\" in all documents. But we already searched for pattern. But maybe some remedies not captured due to pattern. Let's search for \"fees\" and \"damages\" in Order Re Preliminary Injunction. Also search for \"injunctive relief\" again.\n\nBut earlier search included \"injunctive relief\" pattern. But maybe we missed some matches because of token ranges. But we saw 13 matches for that pattern. We likely captured them. But maybe some remedies are \"injunctive relief\" and \"declaratory relief\" included. For each remedy, we need separate entry. So we might have: \"Plaintiff: declaratory relief\", \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\", \"Plaintiff: monetary damages\", \"Plaintiff: attorney's fees and costs\", \"Defendant: temporary restraining order\", etc.\n\nBut we might have 5 values: maybe \"Plaintiff: declaratory relief\", \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief\", \"Plaintiff: attorney's fees and costs\", \"Defendant: temporary restraining order\", \"Plaintiff: monetary damages\". But not sure.\n\nWe need to confirm each distinct remedy. Let's search for \"fees\" in Order Re Preliminary Injunction to confirm attorney's fees. Also search for \"monetary damages\". Also maybe \"injunction\" etc.\n\nAlso check Order for \"injunctive relief\". The search found 3 matches, but maybe only one remedy.\n\nThus, maybe we have 5 distinct remedies: declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs, temporary restraining order, monetary damages. That covers all 5. But need to verify each is distinct. Are there any other remedies? \"Enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\" is same as injunctive relief. So maybe duplicates. But maybe \"preliminary injunction\" distinct? But that's a type of injunctive relief.\n\nLet's double-check if any other remedy like \"injunctive relief\" appears in Order. We saw \"injunctive relief\" in Order. But maybe no additional. So likely 5 distinct remedies.\n\nThus, we have all. So can stop. But we need to ensure that the extracted list includes all 5 with evidence. The last action appended 5 values. We should verify that those 5 are correct and no duplicates. But we cannot verify content of last append. But we can request get_checklist to confirm. But we don't need to if we trust.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we might use get_checklist to see current values. But it's optional. The instruction: \"Your Next Action: Choose ONE action\". We can choose get_checklist to verify. But we are to stop only when all keys complete. We think it's complete.

The Docket is unvisited. Docket may contain remedy requests? Docket may have docket entries but not remedies likely. But could contain some remedy requests in docket summaries.

The current status: Remedy_Sought has 5 values extracted. The summary says Keys with Values: 1/1, empty 0/1? Wait: earlier it said 1/1? Actually earlier says Keys with Values: 1/1, Empty Keys: 0/1. That seems odd: 1/1 indicates one key and value present, empty keys 0/1? maybe confusion. But we have extracted 5 values. Are we missing any? We need to ensure all remedy sought values in all documents. The steps show 5 values extracted. But maybe there are more remedy sought values that haven't been extracted yet. Let's examine documents for other remedy sought. We have seen from Complaint, Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Ex Parte Motion. But there is also Docket? The Docket may not contain remedy sought. Also maybe there is another document (order, etc). The document list: 5 documents. We have partially visited all except Ex Parte which is fully visited. We need to check if there are any more remedy sought in the remaining partially visited documents. Let's examine from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: we have partially visited many ranges. We might need to read more to catch additional remedy sought. Let's review what we have already extracted:\n\nFrom earlier steps: Step 7 appended 4 values for Remedy_Sought. Step 18 appended 1 value. So total 5. Likely 4 from Complaint and 1 from Order or something. Let's recall which values:\n\nFrom earlier steps, what were the 4 values? Not explicitly shown, but likely includes:\n\n- Plaintiffs: declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs (maybe). \n- Plaintiffs: temporary restraining order? Wait Ex Parte had a TRO.\n\nBut we need to extract remedy sought from each party: \"Plaintiff: [remedy]\" or \"Defendant: [remedy]\".\n\nLet's see the 5 values: maybe:\n\n1. Plaintiffs: declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs, monetary damages. \n2. Plaintiffs: temporary restraining order (maybe from Ex Parte). \n3. Plaintiffs: preliminary injunction (in Order Re Preliminary). \n4. Plaintiffs: maybe something else.\n\nWait, let's analyze each document:\n\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: The complaint likely asks for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs, and maybe monetary damages. Also possibly \"temporary restraining order\" but that was in separate motion.\n\n- Order (Opinion) might contain settlement or order for injunctive relief, monetary damages. But order may be the final order granting or refusing remedy. But the requirement is \"remedies each party asks the court to grant, not what the court ultimately ordered or what parties settled.\" So we should only extract the remedies requested in the pleadings, not the order. But the order might include what was requested by parties? The order may not contain remedy sought. However, the order may have \"the parties requested that ...\" but the order might be the final decision. But the earlier extraction used order to get remedy sought: maybe the order was a settlement? But step 7 appended 4 values maybe from Complaint? Let's re-check step 7: \"append_checklist (Remedy_Sought) → Successfully appended 4 values for 1 key: Remedy_Sought\". That likely came from reading the complaint portion. Step 18 appended 1 value from Ex Parte Motion. So 5 values total: 4 from Complaint, 1 from Ex Parte.\n\nBut we might also have remedy sought in Order Re Preliminary Injunction (the complaint likely included preliminary injunction). But maybe the earlier search didn't pick up that. Let's check: In the Order Re Preliminary Injunction, we saw \"Plaintiffs ask to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order pending the resolution...\" That is a remedy sought. But we didn't count it earlier? Wait step 7 might have included that too? Let's examine earlier steps: Step 7 appended 4 values. Which documents were read before? Step 4 read complaint tokens 2890-3100 (210 tokens). That likely included some remedy sought. Step 8 read Ex Parte Motion. Step 18 appended 1 value from Ex Parte. So maybe the 4 values were: from complaint: declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs, monetary damages. But the preliminary injunction is in the Order Re Preliminary Injunction doc, not the complaint. So we might have missed remedy sought from that doc. Actually step 24 search in Order Re Preliminary found matches, but did not append new values. Did step 24 involve reading? No, just search. Did we append values? Not yet. So we haven't extracted remedy sought from Order Re Preliminary Injunction. That doc is partially visited. So we need to read a section containing remedy sought: likely the complaint portion (the plaintiffs' request). The relevant section is maybe near the beginning of the doc: \"Plaintiffs ask to preliminarily enjoin enforcement...\" which is a remedy sought. We need to extract that as \"Plaintiff: preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\" or something. Also maybe there are other remedy sought from defendants? In that doc, defendants might request something? But likely not.\n\nAlso, the Order doc (the final order) might contain remedy sought from parties? But the Order is a court order, not a pleading. But the order might mention \"the parties seek\" but not sure. But step 7 appended 4 values from the complaint; step 18 appended 1 value from Ex Parte; we still need remedy sought from Order Re Preliminary Injunction. Also possibly from Order (Opinion) if it contains requests (maybe settlement). But the order likely includes \"the parties requested injunctive relief\" but that is a request. Actually the order might be a \"Settlement Agreement\" if the order is a settlement? But it is called \"Order\". The previous steps: Step 24 search in Order: 3 matches. Let's examine those matches: They are fragments of the order, but not obviously remedy sought. In match 1: \"On April 3, 2025, Plaintiffs sued...\" That's part of a statement of facts. So not remedy sought. Match 2: \"of EO 14,251... the government 'suffers irreparable harm...'\" Not remedy sought. Match 3: \"collective bargaining agreements until litigation has concluded. Moreover, any terminated agreements can be reinstated...\" Not remedy sought. So no remedy sought in the Order. So we likely only need to extract from Order Re Preliminary.\n\nAlso the complaint might include \"temporary restraining order\"? But that is from Ex Parte. So we have 5 values: 4 from complaint, 1 from Ex Parte. We need to add 1 from Order Re Preliminary. So we need to read the relevant section. Let's find the remedy sought in Order Re Preliminary. The matches include:\n\n- Match 1: \"Plaintiffs ask to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order pending the resolution of the merits of their claims on a fully developed record.\" So remedy sought: \"preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\".\n\n- Also, maybe the plaintiffs also ask for \"monetary damages\"? But the doc may include a request for monetary damages. We need to look at other sections. The search pattern in step 24 didn't find monetary damages, but step 25 search for \"(preliminary injunction|monetary damages)\" found matches. Let's examine those matches:\n\nMatches 1-5 in Step 25: In match 1, tokens 6739-6939: snippet: \"for a preliminary injunction, or that it otherwise is of any relevance here, including with respect to plaintiffs’ showing of irreparable harm.\" That might be part of the request. But the actual remedy sought might be \"preliminary injunction\" or \"monetary damages\". In match 2: \"The Court determined that plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO should instead be treated as a motion for a preliminary injunction.\" That is not remedy sought. In match 3: about briefs. No.\n\nThus, the remedy sought in that doc is \"preliminary injunction\" (specifically, preliminary enjoin enforcement of the EO). Also maybe \"monetary damages\" if requested. Let's search for \"monetary damages\" in that doc. Step 25 search didn't find. But earlier step 24 search for \"monetary damages\" in Order Re Preliminary found zero? Wait step 24 included \"monetary damages\" in pattern; search found 16 matches across Order and Order Re Preliminary. In Order Re Preliminary, there were probably matches. We need to check match list. In step 24, Order Re Preliminary had 13 matches, but the matches 1-13 listed only the first 13; but we didn't see a \"monetary damages\" snippet. But maybe it was omitted in the truncated text. Could be present in other matches not shown. So we need to read more of the doc to capture remedy sought. Let's search again specifically for \"monetary damages\" pattern in Order Re Preliminary. That might reveal if plaintiffs also requested monetary damages. But the requirement is \"remedies each party asks the court to grant\". Monetary damages is a remedy, yes. So we should include that if requested. Let's search.\n\nWe'll use search_document_regex on Order Re Preliminary for \"monetary damages\".<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order Re Preliminary Injunction\",\"pattern\":\"monetary damages\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Re Preliminary Injunction", "pattern": "monetary damages", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10066, "completion_tokens": 2027, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The description says remedies asked by parties: could be injunctive relief, monetary damages, declaratory relief, etc. So we need to find all distinct remedy requests.\n\nWe need to read more of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief beyond visited ranges to capture any additional remedy requests.\n\nAlso Order and Order Re Preliminary Injunction may have more remedy requests. Order may have \"injunctive relief\" and \"monetary damages\" etc.\n\nWe should search for patterns like \"seek\", \"request\", \"prayer\", \"remedy\", \"injunctive relief\", \"monetary damages\", \"declaratory relief\", \"injunction\", \"temporary restraining order\", \"preliminary injunction\", \"injunction\" etc.\n\nWe need to read more of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. The visited tokens only cover 10%: 200-400, 2867-3100, 11098-11298, 11973-12173, 12276-12634, 12649-13025, 16942-17142, 21609-21811, 23403-23603, 23707-23907, 24384-24670. There's still a lot left. We should read more near the end: maybe the prayer section near the end of complaint (e.g., page 44). Let's read near the end of the complaint: tokens around 24000-25000 maybe contain the prayer. Let's read tokens 24000-25000.\n\nAlso check Order Re Preliminary Injunction for more remedy requests; but we likely have covered those.\n\nLet's search for \"prayer\" in Complaint. But earlier they searched, no matches. But maybe \"Prayer\" is capitalized? Pattern \"(?i)prayer\" no matches. But maybe \"prayer\" is not used; instead \"request\" or \"demands\" etc.\n\nLet's search for \"request\" or \"request for\" in Complaint.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex for Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief with pattern \"request|requests|ask|asks\". But might be many matches.\n\nAlternatively, read more of the Complaint near the end. Let's attempt read_document for Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 24000-25000.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":24000,\"end_token\":25000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 24000, "end_token": 25000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7671, "completion_tokens": 772, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The user has given us a snapshot. They said: \"Your Next Action: Choose ONE action.\" We must comply with instructions. The current status: Keys with Extracted Values: 1/1, 5 values extracted. No empty keys. Not applicable 0/1. Total values 5. Documents in corpus 5. The user says \"Your Next Action: Choose ONE action based on the current state.\" They list options. We must choose the best action. The system says we must stop when all keys are complete. The key is Remedy_Sought. It says we have 5 values extracted. Are we sure that all remedy sought values have been extracted? The snapshot says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\". That indicates that the checklist has only one key, remedy_sought. They have extracted 5 values. But are we sure there are no more? The earlier steps indicated that all remedy_sought values have been extracted and recorded. Step 26 said \"stop - All Remedy_Sought values have been extracted and recorded.\" So we are at step 32, we might have all extracted. But the snapshot shows \"Total Values Extracted: 5\". But maybe there are more. We need to verify by scanning other documents for remedy sought. We saw earlier steps: from Order (1 value), from Order Re Preliminary Injunction (2 values), from Ex Parte Motion (1 value), from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (1 value). So 5. But maybe there are more in the docket? No, docket likely only lists documents. But maybe there are other remedy sought in the Order or the Order Re Preliminary Injunction not captured. But we didn't read entire documents, only partial. We have only partial coverage. But the snapshot indicates 15% coverage for Order Re Preliminary Injunction and 12% for Order, 13% for Complaint, 5% for Docket, 100% for Ex Parte Motion. So there may be more remedy sought in the unvisited portions.\n\nThe instructions say we must not reread fully visited docs. We have partial coverage for many docs; we may need to read more. The current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\". That may be false if we haven't captured all remedy sought. We need to confirm. The user might have done earlier steps that extracted all. But the snapshot says we have 5 values extracted. We might need to verify if there are any more in the remaining unvisited token ranges. The instruction: \"Your Next Action: choose ONE action based on current state.\" We must decide: either stop if we are confident all remedy sought values extracted, or continue reading more. The instructions say we should stop only when every key is complete or Not Applicable. The user current status: \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Empty Keys: 0/1\" suggests it's done. But maybe it's a miscount. Let's examine the earlier steps: Step 7 appended 4 values. Step 18 appended 1 value. So 5 values. But were there any others? Step 13 found 5 matches in Complaint; Step 16 found 5 matches in Order Re Preliminary; Step 24 found 16 matches across Order and Order Re Preliminary. But those may include remedy sought. However, the earlier steps might have appended all.\n\nWe need to check if there are more remedy sought values not captured. Let's search for \"remedy\" in the remaining unvisited portions of each doc. We could do a regex search across all documents for \"remedy\" to get matches. The earlier steps did that: Step 26 found 0 matches in Order Re Preliminary for \"monetary damages\". Step 24 found 16 matches across Order and Order Re Preliminary. But that was for multiple patterns. But we haven't read the matches. We should maybe search for \"remedy\" again with context. But we need to avoid redundant reading. We could call search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"remedy\". That will return matches with context. Let's do that: search_document_regex(doc_name=\"all\", pattern=\"remedy\", flags=[\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k=10, context_tokens=200). That will give matches. Then we can examine them. But the system says we must choose one action. We can choose search_document_regex. That seems appropriate. Or we could choose read_document on the unvisited portions. But searching might be more efficient. The instructions: \"When a target is patternable use search_document_regex.\" Remedy is patternable. Good.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex across all documents for \"remedy\". That will give us matches, and we can extract any new values. So we choose search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"remedy\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "remedy", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8862, "completion_tokens": 1024, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Currently we have 5 values extracted. But we need to verify if any missing. We have seen from complaint, order, order re preliminary injunction, and ex parte motion. We may need to check if any other documents contain remedy requests. We have docket maybe but likely not. Also we might need to check the order for other remedy requests. The order's read_document earlier maybe captured 1 value. But there might be more. We also have Order Re Preliminary Injunction; we have 2 values extracted. But not sure all.\n\nWe also have Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause; we extracted 1 value.\n\nWe might need to confirm if the Order contains remedy requests beyond the one extracted. Let's search the Order for \"pray\", \"request\", \"relief\". But we already used search_document_regex for \"remedy\" which found 1 match. That may include remedy request. But there might be additional remedy requests that didn't match \"remedy\". For example, \"enjoin\" or \"injunction\". We might need to read relevant sections.\n\nLet's read the Order document around tokens covering its \"WHEREFORE\" or \"relief requested\". The Order's coverage includes tokens 954-1154, 2741-2941, 5833-6033, 6302-6502. We may need to read further to see if any other remedy requests. Let's search for \"prayer\" in Order. Also \"enjoin\" etc.\n\nSearch_document_regex on Order for \"prayer\" or \"enjoin\" could find. Let's try search_document_regex on Order for \"prayer\". But we didn't see that earlier. We had search for \"remedy\" found 1 match. But maybe other remedy requests use different wording. Let's search for \"enjoin\" in Order. Also \"injunction\" maybe.\n\nWe should use search_document_regex on Order with pattern \"(enjoin|injunction|prayer|relief requested)\" etc.\n\nAlso check Order Re Preliminary Injunction for any additional remedy requests beyond the two we have. We have 2 values extracted. But we need to confirm if there might be more. The search for \"remedy\" found 2 matches in Order Re Preliminary Injunction. But earlier search for \"enjoin|injunctive relief|stay|injunction|seek\" found 10 matches. We might have extracted only 2 values, but maybe there are more. We need to ensure all distinct remedy requests from that order are captured.\n\nWe also may need to check Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause for remedy requests beyond the one we extracted. We already extracted 1 value. But there might be others. Let's search for \"enjoin\" in that document. But that document is fully visited, but we might not have read all. We can search again.\n\nLet's perform search on Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause for pattern \"enjoin|injunction|temporary restraining|cease and desist|monetary damages|declaratory relief|prayer\" but we already used. But we can search again for \"enjoin\".\n\nBut maybe we already extracted all.\n\nGiven that we have 5 values extracted, but we need to ensure doesn't miss any. Let's examine the search results we have: Step 33 search for \"remedy\" found only 2 matches in Order Re Preliminary Injunction. But we might have 2 remedy requests there. The Complaint we have 1 remedy request. The Order we have 1 remedy request. The Ex Parte Motion we have 1 remedy request. That totals 5.\n\nBut maybe the Complaint also has multiple remedy requests? We saw only one set of relief requested: A, B, C, D, E. But that's one request (the plaintiff asks for several remedies). However, per instruction, each requested remedy as separate value. It says \"Extract each requested remedy as a separate value, formatted as: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]' or 'Defendant: [remedy].'\"\n\nSo if a single request includes multiple remedies, each should be separate. For example, plaintiff requests: A (Declaring...), B (Enjoining...), C (Directing...), D (Granting attorney's fees), E (Granting such other relief...). That is 5 separate remedies from plaintiff. In the current extraction, we have only 1 value from Complaint. Maybe we incorrectly aggregated all into one. The extraction says we have 5 values total, but maybe those are 5 separate items: we have 1 from Complaint, 2 from Order Re Preliminary Injunction, 1 from Order, 1 from Ex Parte Motion. But that might not be correct. We need to parse the complaint and separate each remedy.\n\nLet's check the complaint text we read: In step 32, we saw the \"Relief Requested\" section with items A-E. We need to extract each. So we should append 5 separate entries: \"Plaintiff: Declaring that the Exclusion Order violates ...\", \"Plaintiff: Enjoining defendants ...\", \"Plaintiff: Directing defendants ...\", \"Plaintiff: Granting plaintiffs' attorney’s fees and costs\", \"Plaintiff: Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.\"\n\nAlso maybe there are remedies requested by defendants. But the complaint is from plaintiffs; defendants may not request remedies. But the Order and Order Re Preliminary Injunction may include requests from the defendants. For example, the Order might include \"Defendant: ...\". Let's check.\n\nWe need to extract all remedy requests from all documents.\n\nThus we need to update the checklist: we need to add new values for the complaint, maybe replacing the one we had.\n\nWe also may need to check if the Order Re Preliminary Injunction includes requests from both sides. Let's search for \"Defendant\" or \"Defendants\" or \"plaintiff\" in that order. But we may need to read the order to confirm.\n\nWe have not read the order's \"relief requested\" section. Let's read the order around tokens 200-400 maybe. But we already saw some tokens earlier. Let's search for \"order\" in Order document. Or use search_document_regex on Order for \"enjoin|injunction|prayer|relief requested\". Let's do that.\n\nAlso check Ex Parte Motion: It may include plaintiff's request for temporary restraining order to prevent defendants from action. That is likely a remedy. We need to capture it.\n\nThus we need to do a search on Order for remedy. But we did earlier and found 1 match. But that might have captured only one remedy. But maybe we need to read the entire order to see if there are multiple.\n\nLet's perform search_document_regex on Order for pattern \"(enjoin|injunctive relief|injunction|temporary restraining|cease and desist|monetary damages|declaratory relief|prayer|remedy)\". Use top_k maybe 10. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order\",\"pattern\":\"(enjoin|injunctive relief|injunction|temporary restraining|cease and desist|monetary damages|declaratory relief|prayer|remedy)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Order", "pattern": "(enjoin|injunctive relief|injunction|temporary restraining|cease and desist|monetary damages|declaratory relief|prayer|remedy)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8483, "completion_tokens": 1540, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We already have 5 values extracted. But the instruction says we need to extract all distinct Remedy_Sought values. The current status says Keys with Values: 1/1, Values extracted: 5. But we need to verify if all distinct values have been extracted. There might be more. The prior steps show some values added: 1 from Complaint, 2 from Order Re Preliminary Injunction, 1 from Order, 1 from Ex Parte Motion. That sums 5. But maybe there are other documents with remedy sought.\n\nWe have 5 documents total. We have fully visited Ex Parte Motion, partially visited Order, partially visited Order Re Preliminary Injunction, partially visited Complaint, partially visited Docket. The Docket likely contains maybe orders. But remedies sought might be in the Docket (like docket entries?). But we need to check if any missing remedy sought from Docket. Also maybe the Order or Order Re Preliminary Injunction have more remedy sought items not captured. We should read more parts of Order or Order Re Preliminary Injunction beyond the already visited ranges.\n\nCurrently Order has visited tokens: 954-1294, 2730-3178, 3640-3840, 3860-4160, 4170-4370, 5833-6033, 6302-6502. That covers many sections but maybe not all. We saw earlier \"Order\" has remedy sought items: the Government seeks an emergency stay. Also might be \"grant\" etc. Let's search for \"prayer\" or \"remedy\" again in Order to see if any more remedy sought. But search_document_regex already did a search for \"(enjoin|injunctive relief|injunction|temporary restraining|cease and desist|monetary damages|declaratory relief|prayer|remedy)\" and found 10 matches. We saw those matches. We saw the government seeks an emergency stay. The complaint may have \"granting\" etc. We might have all remedy sought from Order. But maybe there are additional remedy sought from Order such as \"stay\" and \"emergency stay\" etc. But we captured that. But maybe the Order also includes \"grant\" or \"declaratory relief\"? Let's check the earlier search. We saw the Order has a match starting at 970-1170 with \"The United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction...\". That is one remedy: emergency stay. Also later, the order may state \"We grant the government’s request for a stay of the injunction pending appeal.\" That's also a remedy. But that is the order's conclusion, not remedy sought. But remedy sought is what the party asks. So government sought emergency stay. That we captured. Are there others? Ex Parte Motion: the motion likely asks for a temporary restraining order (TRO). That we captured. The Order Re Preliminary Injunction: likely has remedy sought: \"preliminary injunction\" or \"enjoin enforcement of EO\". We captured two values. The Complaint: has \"A. Declaring..., B. Enjoining..., C. Directing..., D. Granting attorney's fees..., E. Granting such other relief.\" So we captured one value: \"Plaintiff: Declaring that the Exclusion Order ...; Plaintiff: Enjoining ...; Plaintiff: Directing ...; Plaintiff: Granting ...; Plaintiff: Granting such other relief.\" But that is multiple items? The system earlier appended 1 value for Complaint. But it might have appended only \"Plaintiff: Enjoining\" etc. Actually we need to check: The append action at step 7 appended 4 values for 1 key: Remedy_Sought. Then at step 18 appended 1 value. So total values 5. Let's see what those values were. They were not shown. We need to check if all distinct remedy sought from Complaint are captured. The Complaint may have multiple remedy items. The earlier step 7 appended 4 values for 1 key. Those could be from Complaint. Step 18 appended 1 value from Ex Parte. So maybe the Complaint had 4 remedy sought, Ex Parte had 1, Order Re Preliminary had 2, Order had 1. But 4+1+2+1 = 8. But the total values extracted reported as 5. So maybe earlier steps miscount.\n\nLet's examine step 7: \"append_checklist (Remedy_Sought) → Successfully appended 4 values for 1 key: Remedy_Sought\". That likely added 4 values from the earlier search results. Which documents? Likely from Complaint maybe. Step 18 appended 1 value for Ex Parte. That would bring total to 5. But that leaves missing remedy sought from Order Re Preliminary and Order. But step 18 said appended 1 value for 1 key. But we have 5 values. Step 30 etc. Step 26 says \"stop - All Remedy_Sought values have been extracted and recorded.\" But later steps show more search and reading. So maybe the system restarted and found more. Now the extraction progress says 5 values. But we need to ensure all distinct values have been extracted. We need to check if any remedy sought in Order Re Preliminary Injunction or Order remains uncollected.\n\nFrom search results, let's identify remedy sought phrases.\n\nFrom Order Re Preliminary Injunction: \"Plaintiffs ask to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order pending the resolution of the merits of their claims on a fully developed record.\" That's a remedy: preliminary injunction. Also \"Plaintiffs request that the court enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order pending the merits.\" Might also ask for \"stay\" or \"temporary restraining order\" etc. But we saw earlier that there might be \"temporary restraining order\" in the Ex Parte. But Order Re Preliminary may ask for \"preliminary injunction\" only. But maybe also \"injunction\" to enjoin. Could be two remedy sought: \"preliminary injunction\" and \"stay\" or \"temporary restraining order\" but that is in Ex Parte. But we need to capture all remedy sought from each party. So likely we have:\n\nFrom Complaint:\n\n- Plaintiff: Declaring that the Exclusion Order, the Exclusion Memorandum, and the associated termination of federal CBAs and grievances violates the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and is ultra vires.\n- Plaintiff: Enjoining the Defendants and their agents and successors from implementing or otherwise giving effect to the Exclusion Order and Exclusion Memorandum.\n- Plaintiff: Directing Defendants to honor the assignment of union dues by continuing to allot union membership dues and to remit any dues that have been collected.\n- Plaintiff: Granting Plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees and costs.\n- Plaintiff: Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.\n\nThat's 5 remedy items.\n\nFrom Ex Parte Motion:\n\n- Plaintiff: Temporary restraining order (TRO) (maybe also request for preliminary injunction? But the motion is for TRO). So remedy: Temporary restraining order.\n\nFrom Order Re Preliminary Injunction:\n\n- Plaintiffs ask to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order; i.e., preliminary injunction.\n\n- Maybe also request for stay? Not sure.\n\nFrom Order:\n\n- The United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251. That is remedy: emergency stay.\n\n- Also maybe request for stay of injunction pending appeal? The order may have requested something else? But likely only one remedy sought.\n\nGiven that, we should have 5 (Complaint) + 1 (Ex Parte) + 1 (Order Re Preliminary) + 1 (Order) = 8 distinct remedy sought values. But the current extraction only has 5. So we need to extract the missing ones.\n\nBut step 7 appended 4 values. Maybe those were the Complaint's 4 items (declaring, enjoining, directing, granting fees) and missing \"granting other relief\" maybe? Step 18 appended 1 value from Ex Parte. So 5. The missing items: \"Granting such other relief\" from Complaint, \"preliminary injunction\" from Order Re Preliminary, \"emergency stay\" from Order. So we need to extract those 3.\n\nThus next action: read relevant sections of documents to capture those values. We need to read from Complaint to capture \"Granting such other relief\" maybe. But we saw that text earlier in Step 32: \"... E. Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.\" That we need to capture.\n\nAlso need to read Order Re Preliminary to capture \"preliminary injunction\" request. We saw earlier in Step 33 match 1 tokens 1013-1213: \"Plaintiffs ask to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order pending the resolution of the merits of their claims on a fully developed record.\" That is the remedy. We need to capture evidence.\n\nAlso need to read Order to capture emergency stay. We saw earlier in Match 1 tokens 971-1171: \"The United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251\". Also we might want to capture \"request for an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction.\" So need evidence.\n\nThus next action: read_document for Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief around tokens where that text appears. We saw tokens 24000-25000 includes that. But we need to capture tokens earlier maybe 24000-25000 where the remedy items appear. We already read that in step 32. It includes the paragraph with A-E. So we can use that to extract \"Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.\" We need to capture that.\n\nBut we need to verify if we have already appended that value. We didn't. So we need to read and append.\n\nAlso read Order Re Preliminary around tokens 957-1213 (already read). We can read that again or use evidence from earlier search. But we might need to capture that text. We already have that text in search results. It's in match 1 tokens 1013-1213 of Order Re Preliminary. So we can use that text. But we need to read or use that evidence. We can read that part to confirm. But we can use search results as evidence? The evidence must be from a document. The search result snippet is from the document. But we might need to provide the exact text. The snippet is provided in step 33. We can use that snippet as evidence. But we need to include the snippet in the evidence. It is the snippet from the search. So we can capture that.\n\nAlso read Order snippet for emergency stay. The snippet is in match 1 tokens 971-1171. That snippet is also available. So we can use that.\n\nThus we can perform append_checklist with 3 new entries.\n\nBut we must ensure we don't duplicate values already extracted. The current extracted list has 5 values. We don't know which ones. But we suspect missing ones. So we should append 3 more values: \"Plaintiff: Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.\" from Complaint; \"Plaintiff: Preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\" from Order Re Preliminary; \"United States: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251.\" from Order.\n\nBut we need to format: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]' or 'Defendant: [remedy]'. For the government, it's \"United States: emergency stay...\" So we use 'United States: ...'.\n\nAlso for Order Re Preliminary, the request from Plaintiffs: \"Plaintiff: preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\". So 'Plaintiff: preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order'.\n\nAlso for Complaint's \"Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper\" is from Plaintiff. So 'Plaintiff: Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.'\n\nBut we also might need to capture \"Plaintiff: Directing Defendants to honor the assignment of union dues...\" etc. But those were already extracted in earlier steps.\n\nThus we need to append these 3.\n\nMake sure evidence includes text excerpt, source_document, location.\n\nThus we need to read the relevant sections to provide evidence. We can use read_document for Complaint tokens 24000-25000 again (but we have already read that). But we can still read again? But we have partially visited and tokens 24000-25000 already read. But we may read again but we could avoid duplicate reading? We can read again but it's okay. But the instruction says never reread fully visited documents. But we have partially visited. But we can read the specific tokens 24000-25000 again? We have visited that portion. We can use that snippet from the earlier read. But we need to provide evidence. We can use the snippet from step 32.\n\nBut we need to include evidence exactly. We can provide the snippet from step 32: It's the paragraph with A-E. But we need to provide the exact text for the \"Granting such other relief\" part. That snippet is:\n\n```\nE.  Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.\n```\n\nWe will include that.\n\nSimilarly, for Order Re Preliminary snippet: \"Plaintiffs ask to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order pending the resolution of the merits of their claims on a fully developed record.\" We'll include that.\n\nFor Order snippet: \"The United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251, Exclusions From Federal Labor‑Management Relations Programs, 90 Fed. Reg. 14,553 (Apr. 3, 2025).\" We'll include that.\n\nThus we can append 3 entries.\n\nLet's do append_checklist with 3 entries.\n\nBut we need to consider the evidence location: we can specify page or token range. For Complaint: location page 41? In snippet, it's near page 41. But we can approximate. The snippet shows \"Page 41 of 44\" earlier. So location: \"Page 41 of 44\" or \"tokens 24000-25000\".\n\nFor Order Re Preliminary: the snippet was tokens 1013-1213. So location: \"tokens 1013-1213\".\n\nFor Order: snippet tokens 971-1171. So location: \"tokens 971-1171\".\n\nThus we can prepare append_checklist.\n\nBut we need to check that we didn't already append these entries. The earlier extracted values were 5. Which ones? Likely were the 4 from Complaint (declaring, enjoining, directing, granting fees) and one from Ex Parte. So missing the \"Granting such other relief\". Also missing the preliminary injunction and emergency stay. So we add those.\n\nThus produce function call for append_checklist.\n\nLet's construct JSON payload.\n\nWe need patch array with key \"Remedy_Sought\" and extracted array of 3 entries.\n\nEach entry: value and evidence array.\n\nEntry 1: value: \"Plaintiff: Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.\"\n\nEvidence: text snippet: \"E.

{"step": 36, "run_id": "97dfeba9-687f-49bd-9717-a156c61ef283", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T06:34:24.964736-05:00", "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have to decide next action. Current status: They already appended 8 values. The checklist has only Remedy_Sought. Are all remedies captured? We need to ensure all distinct values from all documents. We have partly visited many documents. We need to check if any other remedies exist not yet captured. We saw from Ex Parte Motion: maybe it includes \"temporary restraining order\" etc. But we need to ensure we captured all. Let's quickly review the Ex Parte Motion text for remedy requests. They already appended one from Ex Parte: \"United States: emergency stay\" maybe? Actually they appended from Order (not Ex Parte). Ex Parte might include \"temporary restraining order\" as remedy. They appended 1 value for Ex Parte? In append_checklist step 35, they listed 8 values: 2 from Complaint, 3 from Order Re Preliminary, 2 from Order, 1 from Ex Parte. Wait they said 1 from Ex Parte. But earlier they appended from Ex Parte? Step 18 appended 1 value for Remedy_Sought. That likely from Ex Parte. Let's check Step 18: after reading Ex Parte tokens 1500-1700, they appended 1 value. That value likely \"temporary restraining order\". So we have 8 values.\n\nNow we need to confirm if any other remedies exist in any document not yet visited or not yet extracted. Let's examine documents list:\n\n- Complaint: partially visited 13% coverage. Might contain additional remedies beyond what already extracted. We saw at tokens 24000-25000 we got two remedies: \"Granting such other relief\" and \"preliminarily enjoin\". But maybe earlier in complaint there are other requests: e.g., \"injunctive relief\" might include \"injunction\" or \"injunctive relief\" etc. We might have missed \"injunctive relief\" for \"enjoin the defendants\". That is included in the \"Enjoining the Defendants and their agents\" maybe captured as \"preliminarily enjoin\"? Actually remedy list: A. Declaring ... B. Enjoining ... C. Directing ... D. Granting attorney's fees ... E. Granting such other relief. So we captured B maybe as \"preliminarily enjoin enforcement\" but might be \"enjoin the Defendants and their agents\" not \"preliminarily enjoin\". That is a remedy. Did we capture that? In step 35 we appended \"Plaintiff: preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\". But B: \"Enjoining the Defendants and their agents and successors from implementing ...\". That is a distinct remedy. Also \"Directing Defendants to honor ...\" is another remedy. Also \"Granting attorneys' fees\". So we might need to capture these additional remedies. The extracted 8 values currently may not include all from complaint. Let's check.\n\nThe extracted values list: 1: \"Plaintiff: Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.\" 2: \"Plaintiff: preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order.\" 3: \"United States: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251.\" That's all. So we have not captured B, C, D. So we need to add those.\n\nAlso from Order Re Preliminary Injunction: we captured 3 remedies: presumably \"preliminary enjoin enforcement\", \"emergency stay of the district court's preliminary injunction\"?? Wait that is from Order, not from Order Re Preliminary. Actually Order Re Preliminary may request \"preliminary enjoin enforcement\" etc. Let's check again: Step 33 matches show that Order Re Preliminary is asking to preliminarily enjoin enforcement. That we captured. Also maybe it requests \"temporary restraining order\" or \"injunction.\" But we likely captured the ones.\n\nFrom Order: we captured 2 remedies: \"United States: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251.\" Wait that's from Order. Also maybe \"emergency stay\" and \"stay\" etc. Also maybe \"emergency stay\" is just one remedy. But Order may also request \"stay\" of a preliminary injunction of a different order? Actually we saw \"The United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251\". That's the remedy. There may also be \"emergency stay\" of something else? Maybe not.\n\nFrom Ex Parte Motion: we probably captured the request for \"temporary restraining order\". But we need to confirm.\n\nThus we must now read or search for additional remedy requests in Complaint, Order Re Preliminary, Order, Ex Parte, etc. The document catalog indicates that Complaint has 13% coverage; we need to read more to capture missing remedies. Also Order Re Preliminary has 15% coverage; maybe we captured all there. But we should double-check.\n\nAlso we should check the Docket maybe includes remedies? But docket might not include remedies.\n\nThus next action: We should read more of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to capture the remaining remedy items.\n\nWhere did we stop? We have tokens 24000-25000. We need earlier tokens maybe where the relief section appears earlier. The relief section is near page 41 of 44 (token positions 24000-25000). But we saw B, C, D, E. We captured E and maybe also B? But we only captured \"preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\". That is not B. Actually B is \"Enjoining the Defendants and their agents and successors from implementing or otherwise giving effect to the Exclusion Order and Exclusion Memorandum.\" That is not \"preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\". So we need to capture B, C, D. So we need to read more of the relief section to capture all four remedies. The section we read might contain B, C, D. Let's check the snippet we saw:\n\n```\n 13  Relief Requested \n 14  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff pray that this Honorable Court enter an ORDER: \n 15  A.  Declaring  that  the  Exclusion  Order,  the  Exclusion  Memorandum,  and  the \n 16  associated  termination  of  federal  CBAs  and  grievances  violates  the  First \n 17  Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and is ultra vires; \n 18  B.  Enjoining the Defendants and their agents and successors from implementing or \n 19  otherwise giving effect to the Exclusion Order and Exclusion Memorandum; \n 20  C.  Directing Defendants to honor the assignment of union dues by continuing to allot \n 21  union membership dues and to remit any dues that have been collected;  \n  22  D.  Granting Plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees and costs; and \n  23  E.  Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper. \n```\n\nThus B, C, D exist. We captured E and maybe captured a different remedy (preliminarily enjoin). So we need to append B, C, D.\n\nAlso we should check if there were other remedies in earlier part of complaint: maybe \"injunctive relief\" included \"injunction\" etc. But likely that's the entire relief section. There's also likely \"injunctive relief\" requested earlier? But this section is the relief requested. So we need to add B, C, D.\n\nAlso Order Re Preliminary may have more remedies: maybe it also requested \"temporary restraining order\" or \"preliminary injunction\" etc. But we may have captured. But let's check if Order Re Preliminary had \"temporary restraining\" remedy. In the snippet we saw \"Plaintiffs ask to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\". That is remedy. But maybe also \"temporary restraining order\" or \"injunction.\" Let's search again for \"temporary restraining\" in Order Re Preliminary. Step 33 didn't show such match. But we can search again.\n\nAlso Ex Parte Motion may have remedy \"temporary restraining order\" or \"preliminary injunction\". We need to check the content.\n\nThus next action: read more of Complaint to extract B, C, D. We can read the same token range 24000-25000 but we already read that. That snippet included B, C, D. But we didn't extract them. So we need to append them.\n\nThus next action: `append_checklist` with those values. No need to read again. We can just append.\n\nAlso maybe we need to check if there are any other remedies from other documents not yet extracted. Let's search for \"injunctive relief\" in Order Re Preliminary again.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex for \"injunctive relief\" in Order Re Preliminary. But we already searched for \"enjoin|injunctive relief|stay|injunction|seek\" earlier and found 10 matches. But we didn't capture all. Let's see if any of those matches include \"temporary restraining\" or \"injunctive relief\" that could be remedy. But we may need to capture \"emergency stay\" from Order Re Preliminary? Wait Order Re Preliminary is a preliminary injunction order. It might request \"preliminary injunction\" itself. But actually the order is the court's decision. The remedy requested by plaintiffs is \"preliminary injunction.\" The order may not request that. So the remedy is the plaintiff's request. We captured that.\n\nThus we need to capture B, C, D from Complaint.\n\nAlso maybe the complaint includes a request for \"injunctive relief\" to \"enjoin the Exclusion Order\" and \"directing defendants\" etc. So we need to append those.\n\nAlso we should check if Ex Parte Motion had any other remedy: maybe \"temporary restraining order\" and \"injunction.\" But we captured one. But maybe also \"temporary restraining order\" and \"injunction\"? Let's search for \"injunction\" in Ex Parte. But we may not need to. But to be safe, we can search.\n\nGiven the time, we can read the Ex Parte document again to see if there are other remedy requests. We have full coverage. We can search for \"temporary restraining order\" \"injunctive relief\" \"injunction\" \"stay\" etc.\n\nBut maybe step 18 appended 1 value from Ex Parte: \"temporary restraining order\". That might be the only remedy.\n\nThus final step: append B, C, D from Complaint.\n\nThus next action: call `append_checklist` with 3 entries.\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each. Use the snippet from Complaint tokens 24000-25000. Provide text, source_document, location. Use location as \"Page 41 of 44\" or token range. Provide snippet.\n\nThus produce append_checklist with patch for key \"Remedy_Sought\" with 3 entries.\n\nLet's formulate evidence:\n\nValue 1: \"Plaintiff: Enjoining the Defendants and their agents and successors from implementing or otherwise giving effect to the Exclusion Order and Exclusion Memorandum.\"\n\nEvidence text: snippet from complaint: \"B. Enjoining the Defendants and their agents and successors from implementing or otherwise giving effect to the Exclusion Order and Exclusion Memorandum;\" location: Page 41 of 44.\n\nValue 2: \"Plaintiff: Directing Defendants to honor the assignment of union dues by continuing to allot union membership dues and to remit any dues that have been collected.\"\n\nEvidence: snippet: \"C. Directing Defendants to honor the assignment of union dues by continuing to allot union membership dues and to remit any dues that have been collected;\" location: Page 41 of 44.\n\nValue 3: \"Plaintiff: Granting Plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees and costs.\"\n\nEvidence: snippet: \"D. Granting Plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees and costs;\" location: Page 41 of 44.\n\nWe should ensure to include the \"Plaintiff:\" prefix as per formatting requirement.\n\nThus call `append_checklist`.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Remedy_Sought\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Enjoining the Defendants and their agents and successors from implementing or otherwise giving effect to the Exclusion Order and Exclusion Memorandum.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"B.

The task: \"Extract the remedies sought from the legal documents.\" We have extracted some. Need to ensure all distinct values present across all documents. We have partially visited many sections. Need to check if any missing.\n\nList of documents:\n\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: we extracted 5 values. Are there other remedy requests? The complaint includes a \"WHEREFORE\" list: A Declaring, B Enjoining, C Directing, D Granting attorney fees, E Granting such other relief. Also likely \"Plaintiff: Injunctive Relief\" etc. Possibly \"Plaintiff: monetary damages\"? The complaint likely includes \"granting monetary damages\" but maybe not. Check if any other remedy: \"Plaintiff: Injunctive relief\" maybe \"Plaintiff: Injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement.\" We have extracted B and C and D and E. Also \"A\" is declaratory relief. That's a remedy. Need to include \"Plaintiff: Declaring that the Exclusion Order violates...\". That is a declaratory relief.\n\nWe haven't added this. So we need to append a value: \"Plaintiff: Declaring that the Exclusion Order, the Exclusion Memorandum, and the associated termination of federal CBAs and grievances violates the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and is ultra vires.\" Need evidence from complaint. In the excerpt we saw lines 15-18. So we need to append that value. Also maybe \"Plaintiff: monetary damages\"? Not in excerpt. But there may be other remedies like \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief to prevent enforcement.\" Already covered.\n\nSo missing: declaratory relief.\n\nAlso maybe \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of the Exclusion Order.\" Already captured in Value 2? Actually we have Value 1: \"Plaintiff: Granting such other relief...\" Value 2: \"Plaintiff: preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order.\" Value 3: United States remedy. Value 4: \"Plaintiff: Enjoining the Defendants...\" Value 5: \"Plaintiff: Directing Defendants...\" Value 6: \"Plaintiff: Granting Plaintiffs' attorney’s fees and costs.\" So we have 6 values from complaint? Wait we appended 5 values earlier: 1) Granting such other relief, 2) preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order, 3) United States remedy, 4) Enjoining Defendants, 5) Directing Defendants, 6) Granting attorney's fees. That's 6. But we didn't include declaratory relief.\n\nAlso the complaint may have \"Plaintiff: Injunctive relief\" maybe \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement\" but that's same as B? Hmm.\n\nAlso maybe \"Plaintiff: monetary damages\" but likely not.\n\nLet's scan for \"declaratory\" in complaint. We saw \"WHEREFORE, Plaintiff pray that this Honorable Court enter an ORDER: A. Declaring that the Exclusion Order, ...\". So must include.\n\nAlso maybe \"Plaintiff: Injunctive relief to enjoin\" but that's B. We captured.\n\nAlso \"Plaintiff: Directing Defendants to honor the assignment of union dues\" captured.\n\nSo we need to append the declaratory relief value.\n\nAlso maybe \"Plaintiff: Injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of the Exclusion Order\" captured as Value 2? Actually Value 2 was preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order. That is distinct from B, which enjoins the Defendants from implementing the Exclusion Order. They are similar but distinct. So we keep.\n\nAlso \"Plaintiff: Granting such other relief\" is captured.\n\nAlso \"United States: emergency stay\" captured.\n\nAlso maybe \"United States: stay of injunction\" is captured.\n\nAlso maybe \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of the Exclusion Order\" is Value 2? Actually Value 2 was \"Plaintiff: preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order.\" That's like injunctive relief. Good.\n\nAlso we might have \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of the Exclusion Order\" but not sure. It's similar.\n\nAlso \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of the Exclusion Order\" might be separate from \"preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order\"? Actually the complaint and order may refer to different orders. The complaint seeks declaratory relief and injunctive relief to enjoin the Exclusion Order. The order seeks preliminary injunction on Executive Order. So Value 2 is from Order Re Preliminary Injunction, not complaint. So we have separate.\n\nThus the missing is declaratory relief.\n\nAlso maybe \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of the Exclusion Order\" which is B.\n\nThus we should append one more value.\n\nAlso we need to check if there are any other remedy requests in the Order or Order Re Preliminary Injunction or Docket that we haven't captured. The Order (the one in the docket) appears to be an order by the United States seeking emergency stay. We captured that.\n\nThe Order Re Preliminary Injunction contains plaintiff's request for preliminary injunction. We captured that.\n\nEx Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order includes request for temporary restraining order. We captured that.\n\nThus only missing is declaratory relief.\n\nAlso maybe \"Plaintiff: injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of the Exclusion Order\" is captured. Good.\n\nThus we need to append the declaratory relief.\n\nWe should use append_checklist.\n\nWe must provide evidence: from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, page 41 (lines 15-18). Provide text snippet.\n\nLet's craft evidence: \"A.

We might need to search for patterns like \"remedy\", \"injunctive relief\", \"enjoin\", \"stay\", \"declaring\", etc. We already searched for those patterns in Order and Order Re Preliminary and found multiple matches. But maybe we missed some remedy entries.\n\nHowever the prior steps show we searched for many patterns and appended values accordingly. The last step 35 appended 3 values: 1 from Complaint, 1 from Order Re Preliminary, 1 from Order. Step 36 appended 3 more from Complaint. Step 37 appended 1 more from Complaint. So total 12 values.\n\nBut the summary says \"Keys with Values: 1/1, Empty Keys: 0/1, Not Applicable: 0/1, Total Values Extracted: 12\". So remedy_sought has 12 values. That seems plausible.\n\nBut we need to double-check that all possible remedy sought entries have been captured. Let's examine the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: The remedy list likely has a list of six items: A, B, C, D, E, maybe others. Step 36 and 37 captured A, B, C, D, E? Step 35 captured E, plus 2 from other docs. Step 36 captured B, C, D. Step 37 captured A. So all six in Complaint.\n\nOrder Re Preliminary: We captured 1 from Order Re Preliminary (prelim enjoin). Step 35 included \"Plaintiff: preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order.\" That's the remedy. Are there other remedy requests in that order? Maybe the order includes \"stay\" requests from government. But those are the government's remedy. The government (United States) is a defendant? Actually in Order Re Preliminary, the plaintiffs are the unions, defendants are government agencies. The order likely includes \"United States seeks an emergency stay of the preliminary injunction\" which is a remedy sought by the United States. That was captured. Also perhaps \"United States seeks an emergency stay of the preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251\" is one. Are there other remedy requests? Perhaps the government also seeks \"stay\" of the injunction or \"stay\" of the preliminary injunction. We captured that. Are there other remedy requests like \"injunction\" or \"enjoin\" from the government? Could be \"The United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251\" - that's the only remedy. Should double-check if there are \"stay\" requests for the district court's preliminary injunction? The government also might want a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal? That is a remedy sought. We captured that. That's likely all.\n\nOrder: The Order may have remedy requests: \"the United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction\" and \"the government requests a stay of the injunction pending appeal\" etc. We captured 2. Are there any other remedy requests in Order? Possibly \"government requests a stay\" and \"government requests an administrative stay\" etc. But let's search for \"stay\" within Order. We already searched for \"stay\" pattern; we might have captured the two remedy requests. However there may be more \"stay\" requests. Let's examine the matches we saw: In Order, match 1 shows the United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction. That is a remedy. Match 2 shows \"seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction\". That's the same. But maybe later in the order, the government requests a stay pending appeal. That is in the Order, but we may have captured that as part of \"United States: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251\" but not the stay pending appeal. The government requests an administrative stay pending appeal; that is also a remedy sought. Did we capture that? Step 35's value 3 from Order: \"United States: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251.\" That might include the stay pending appeal? The text snippet didn't include mention of pending appeal though. But the snippet might be truncated. Let's check the snippet: \"The United States seeks an emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251, Exclusions From Federal Labor‑Management Relations Programs, 90 Fed. Reg. 14,553 (Ap...\" It doesn't mention pending appeal. However the order may include separate remedy: \"The government requests an emergency stay of the injunction pending appeal.\" That might be captured as separate remedy. But step 35 didn't include that. But step 35 had only 3 values: E. (Plaintiff), prelim enjoin, United States: emergency stay. Maybe they didn't capture the pending appeal stay. But step 35 also had \"United States: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251.\" That might be all.\n\nBut we need to ensure that we didn't miss any remedy requests also by plaintiffs in Order? The plaintiffs may request \"injunction\" or \"stay\" etc. Possibly the plaintiffs requested \"preliminary injunction\" earlier. But that was in Order Re Preliminary. In the Order, the plaintiffs may not request anything else.\n\nAdditionally, the Ex Parte Motion might have remedy requests. We captured 1 value: \"Plaintiff: ...\". Actually step 35 includes 1 value from Ex Parte: \"United States: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251.\" Wait that's from Order. Ex Parte likely had a different remedy request: maybe \"Plaintiff: temporary restraining order.\" But step 35 didn't capture that. Let's check step 35: It listed Value 1: \"Plaintiff: Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.\" Value 2: \"Plaintiff: preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order.\" Value 3: \"United States: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251.\" That Value 3 is likely from Order, not Ex Parte. But the description says Value 3 from Order. So Ex Parte's remedy is not captured? Wait earlier step 18 appended 1 value for Remedy_Sought from Ex Parte. Step 18: \"append_checklist (Remedy_Sought) → Successfully appended 1 value for 1 key: Remedy_Sought\". That value was not listed in step 35. So step 18's value remains in the checklist. So the checklist has 12 values: 6 from Complaint, 3 from Order Re Preliminary, 2 from Order, 1 from Ex Parte. That's 12. Good.\n\nNow the current status shows 12 values extracted. But we need to ensure the checklist is complete: Are there any other remedy sought values in documents not yet fully visited? For example, the Docket might include \"remedy\" but unlikely. The Order and Order Re Preliminary we partially visited - but we might have missed some remedy entries. We should search for patterns like \"stay\", \"enjoin\", \"injunction\", etc. The earlier search for \"stay|injunctive relief|enjoin|temporary restraining|injunction|seek\" across Order Re Preliminary found 5 matches. We captured 3 remedies from that order. But there might be 5 matches, meaning 5 remedy requests? But we captured 3. Let's examine the matches: We saw from step 33: two matches in Order Re Preliminary: tokens 1013-1213 (prelim enjoin) and tokens 8747-8947 (discussion). That second match is discussion about standards; not a remedy request. So only 1 remedy request in Order Re Preliminary.\n\nIn step 24: search of both Order and Order Re Preliminary for \"remedy|injunctive relief|enjoin|temporary restraining|declaratory relief|monetary damages\" found 16 matches: 3 in Order, 13 in Order Re Preliminary. Wait 13 matches in Order Re Preliminary. That seems high. But many of those may be mentions of \"remedy\" or \"enjoin\" but not necessarily remedy requests. Could be repeated mentions in pleadings. But we should ensure we didn't miss any remedy requests. Let's inspect Order Re Preliminary for other remedy requests: The government may seek \"emergency stay\" and \"stay pending appeal\" and \"administrative stay\". That might be 3 remedy requests. But step 35 captured 1, step 35 didn't capture the stay pending appeal or administrative stay. Let's re-check step 35: It lists 3 values, one from Order Re Preliminary: \"Plaintiff: preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order.\" That's the only remedy from Order Re Preliminary. It didn't capture the government's stay requests. But step 35's Value 3: \"United States: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251.\" That is from Order. So the government's stay requests may be in the Order, not Order Re Preliminary. But maybe Order Re Preliminary also contains \"United States: emergency stay of the preliminary injunction\"? Wait the Order Re Preliminary is the order that grants the preliminary injunction. It might not include the government's stay request; that might be in the Order that follows. Actually the order that grants the preliminary injunction may also include the government's request for stay, but the order may be separate. Wait: The order that grants the preliminary injunction might still be the same as the order that includes the stay request? Let's think: In a preliminary injunction case, the order may include the preliminary injunction and may also include that the government requests a stay pending appeal. That might be part of the same order. So indeed the government's stay request is in the Order (not Order Re Preliminary). So we captured that as Value 3.\n\nBut maybe there is also a \"stay\" request from government in Order Re Preliminary? Let's examine the \"Order Re Preliminary\" content: It might be a separate order that is the preliminary injunction itself. The government may have filed a motion for stay, but the order may be separate. So maybe not.\n\nThus maybe 12 values are indeed all remedy requests.\n\nBut we should double-check the Docket: The docket might have a \"motion for temporary restraining order\" that is a remedy request. But the Ex Parte Motion covers that. The docket might list the docket entries but not the remedy. So likely no remedy.\n\nTherefore, I think the checklist is complete. But we should verify that no other documents contain remedy requests. The Ex Parte Motion was fully visited; we captured its remedy. The Complaint fully visited partially; we captured all 6. Order partially visited; we captured 2. Order Re Preliminary partially visited; we captured 1.\n\nBut maybe there are remedy requests in Order Re Preliminary that we didn't capture: e.g., the government may request a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal. But that was captured in Order. So maybe not.\n\nBut we should check if the complaint includes a \"court to grant monetary damages\" or \"costs\" etc. Those are remedies. We captured attorney's fees and costs. Did we capture monetary damages? The complaint might not have requested monetary damages? The complaint may request \"monetary damages\" as a remedy. But let's check the complaint snippet: Step 36, 37, and 35 extracted only 6 items: A, B, C, D, E, maybe also \"F\" or \"G\"? The complaint might have more items beyond A-E. Let's examine the complaint's remedy list: In typical class action, the relief may include: (A) Declaratory relief, (B) Injunctive relief, (C) Monetary damages, (D) Attorney's fees, (E) Costs, (F) etc. But we only captured A-E. Did we capture any monetary damages? I don't see a value for monetary damages. The complaint may not ask for monetary damages. But maybe there's a \"monetary damages\" request. Let's search for \"monetary damages\" within the Complaint. Step 19, 20, others searched for \"monetary damages\" but not found in Complaint? Step 19 searched with \"injunctive relief|injunction|enjoin|temporary restraining|cease and desist|monetary damages|declaratory relief\" and found 10 matches in Complaint. But the appended values didn't include monetary damages. Maybe we missed it. Let's double-check. The complaint might have a remedy like \"monetary damages\" or \"injunctive relief\" or \"declaratory relief\". But the appended values captured only A, B, C, D, E. No mention of monetary damages. But maybe the complaint's remedy list includes \"F. Monies due to union dues\" etc. Or \"F. ...\". But the appended values show only 5 values from Complaint: A, B, C, D, E. But we might have missed \"F\" and \"G\" etc. But the complaint might have more than 6 items? Let's check the snippet of the complaint: Step 36 and 37 refer to \"B. Enjoining the Defendants and their agents and successors from implementing or otherwise giving effect to the Exclusion Order and Exclusion Memorandum.\" \"C. Directing Defendants to honor the assignment of union dues by continuing to allot union membership dues and to remit any dues that have been collected.\" \"D. Granting Plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees and costs.\" \"A. Declaring that the Exclusion Order, the Exclusion Memorandum, and the associated termination of federal CBAs and grievances violates the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and is ultra vires.\" \"E. Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.\" That is 5 items. But the complaint had 6 items? Actually the complaint may have 5 items. Let's confirm: The complaint might have exactly 5 items. So 12 values might be correct.\n\nBut earlier step 35 included \"Value 1: Plaintiff: Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.\" That's item E. Value 2: \"Plaintiff: preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order.\" That's item from Order Re Preliminary. Value 3: \"United States: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251.\" That's item from Order. So 3 values.\n\nStep 36 added 3 more from Complaint: B, C, D. Step 37 added 1 more from Complaint: A. So total 6 from Complaint. Yes.\n\nThus the total 12 values: 6 Complaint, 1 Order Re Preliminary, 2 Order, 1 Ex Parte.\n\nWait we have 6 Complaint, 1 ORPI, 2 Order, 1 Ex Parte = 10. But we counted 12. Let's recount: Step 35: Value 1 (E), Value 2 (ORPI enjoin), Value 3 (Order stay). Step 36: Value 1 (B), Value 2 (C), Value 3 (D). Step 37: Value 1 (A). So that's 1+3+3+1 = 8 values? Wait step 35 had 3 values, step 36 had 3 values, step 37 had 1 value. That's 7 values. But the summary says 12 values extracted. Something off. Let's check the exact counts: In step 35, they appended 1 key with 3 values. Step 36 appended 1 key with 3 values. Step 37 appended 1 key with 1 value. So total values appended so far = 3+3+1 = 7. But the summary says 12. That means there were other values appended earlier, maybe in step 18 or earlier. Step 18 appended 1 value from Ex Parte. That adds 1, making 8. Additionally, earlier steps (1-16?) might have appended other values. Step 7 appended 4 values for Remedy_Sought. Step 18 appended 1 value. Step 35 appended 3 values. Step 36 appended 3 values. Step 37 appended 1 value. So 4+1+3+3+1 = 12. Good. So 12 values total.\n\nThus we have 4 from earlier steps, 1 from Ex Parte, 3 from Order Re Preliminary, 3 from Complaint, 1 from Order. That sums to 12.\n\nBut we need to confirm all 12 values are captured in the final checklist. The summary says \"Keys with Values: 1/1, Empty Keys: 0/1, Not Applicable: 0/1, Total Values Extracted: 12\". So we have all 12. The status says all keys have values. So we can stop.\n\nBut before stopping, we should double-check if any key remains incomplete: only one key: Remedy_Sought. It has 12 values. Are there any missing values? We need to ensure we didn't miss any remedy requests from any document. Let's search again for \"remedy\" or \"injunctive relief\" across all documents to see if any unvisited tokens contain remedy requests.\n\nWe have the document coverage: Complaint: 13% coverage. So there may be other remedy requests outside the visited ranges. But we have captured all items in the complaint list. It likely covers all remedy requests; the complaint's remedy list is known. No other remedy requests outside that list. So coverage is fine.\n\nOrder: 28% coverage. We captured 2 remedy requests. There might be more. Let's search for \"stay\" within Order beyond the viewed ranges. We have views: tokens 954-1294, 2730-3178, 3640-3840, 3860-4160, 4170-4370, 5833-6033, 6302-6502. We have covered all matches for \"stay\" within these ranges. But there may be \"stay\" requests outside these ranges: maybe earlier tokens 0-953, 1295-2729, 3179-3639, 4161-3839? Wait 4160-3639 is wrong. Let's check the ranges: 3640-3840; 3860-4160; 4170-4370; 5833-6033; 6302-6502. So we didn't read tokens 0-953, 1295-2729, 3179-3639, 4161-3839? Actually 4161-3839 is reversed; we saw 3860-4160. So tokens 4161-? we didn't read 4161-? Wait 4160 is inclusive? We read 3860-4160. So 4161-? maybe 4161-? Are there tokens after 4370? We didn't read 4371-5832. So there may be remedy requests in those ranges. But we searched for \"stay\" across the entire Order and got 10 matches. But those matches presumably fell in the viewed ranges. But we didn't read tokens 0-953, 1295-2729, 3179-3639, 4161-? Let's check the tokens for the matches: Step 34 shows 10 matches, but we only saw some of them. The first match (971-1171) is in 954-1294 range. Good. Second match (1094-1294) is also in that range. Third match (2730-2930) is in 2730-3178? Wait 2730-2930 is in 2730-3178 range. Good. Fourth match (2741-2941) also in 2730-3178? Yes. Fifth match (2904-3104) also in 2730-3178? Yes. Sixth match (2978-3178) also in same. Seventh match (3640-3840) is in 3640-3840 range. Eighth (3860-4060) in 3860-4160? Yes. Ninth (3960-4160) in 3860-4160? Yes. Tenth (4170-4370) in 4170-4370 range. So all matches are in the ranges we have read. Good. So no remedy requests outside those ranges.\n\nThus we have all remedy requests in Order.\n\nOrder Re Preliminary: 15% coverage. We have ranges: 0-185, 957-1213, 1246-1478, 1823-2023, 6739-6942, 8131-8978, 11544-11744, 18031-18231, 18419-18873, 19703-19903. We captured the remedy request at 1013-1213 (prelim enjoin). There might be remedy requests outside these ranges: maybe earlier tokens 0-185? That might include an introductory statement of the case, includes ask for preliminary injunction? Actually the complaint might be earlier. But Order Re Preliminary may include a \"stay\" request by the government. That might be in a later section, maybe tokens 18031-18231 or 18419-18873? But we didn't read those sections. But we searched for \"stay\" across Order Re Preliminary and found 5 matches (not just 1). But we only saw one remedy request. The other matches may be in sections not read. Let's check: Step 16: search_document_regex on Order Re Preliminary (pattern: \"remedy|injunctive relief|stay|injunction|enjoin|seek\") found 5 matches. We saw only one remedy request (prelim enjoin). The other matches could be the government requests for stay. But we didn't read them. But step 35 appended 3 values: 1 from Order Re Preliminary (prelim enjoin), 1 from Order (stay), 1 from Order Re Preliminary? Wait step 35 appended 3 values: E (Plaintiff: other relief), prelim enjoin (ORPI), and US: emergency stay (Order). So only 1 remedy from ORPI. But maybe the government requests stay in ORPI and we missed them. But step 35 did not capture those. Did step 35 capture \"United States: emergency stay\" from Order? Yes. But there may be \"United States: emergency stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal\" in ORPI? That might be a separate remedy. But step 35 didn't capture it. But step 35 appended 3 values: E, prelim enjoin, US: emergency stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction of Executive Order 14,251. That is from Order. So not ORPI. So if there were remedy requests in ORPI for stay, they were not captured. But earlier step 18 appended 1 value from Ex Parte. But no mention of ORPI stay.\n\nLet's examine ORPI content: The \"Order Re Preliminary Injunction\" likely includes the preliminary injunction and might also mention the government's request for stay. But the order may have separate section \"The United States seeks an emergency stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal.\" That could be a remedy request in ORPI. But we might have missed it. But step 16 search for \"stay\" in ORPI found 5 matches. But we didn't read them. So we should search for \"stay\" in ORPI to confirm if there are additional remedy requests. We need to read those token ranges: maybe 18031-18231, 18419-18873, 19703-19903. Let's search specifically for \"stay\" in ORPI.\n\nWe should do a search_document_regex for \"stay\" in Order Re Preliminary. Let's call search_document_regex with doc_name \"Order Re Preliminary Injunction\", pattern \"stay\", top_k maybe 10. Then we can read the relevant matches. That may reveal additional remedy requests. Let's do that.\n\nWe need to use the function.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order Re Preliminary Injunction\",\"pattern\":\"stay\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Re Preliminary Injunction", "pattern": "stay", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7945, "completion_tokens": 5246, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have 12 values already. Are there any missing remedies? We need to verify other documents: Complaint, Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Docket, Ex Parte Motion. Already read many sections.\n\nBut we might have missed some remedies that appear in other parts not yet read. Let's review the current coverage.\n\nComplaint: 25,573 tokens, 13% coverage. We have read many chunks but not all. There could be more remedy requests beyond the ones captured. The Complaint likely is the main pleading with remedy requests. We have captured 6 from Complaint. But maybe there are more. We need to examine the parts we haven't read: tokens 0-200? Actually tokens 200-400 covered. 2867-3100, 11098-11298, 11973-12173, 12276-12634, 12649-13025, 16942-17142, 21609-21811, 23403-23603, 23707-23907, 24000-25000. There are still big gaps: 0-200? 200-400 we have? 200-400? yes 200-400 covered. 400-2867? not covered. 3100-11098? not covered. 11298-11973? not covered. 12173-12276? not covered. 13025-16942? not covered. 17142-21609? not covered. 21811-23403? not covered. 23907-24000? not covered. So many missing.\n\nThus we might have missed remedies in those sections. So we need to search for remedy-related patterns in Complaint. We can use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"remedy|injunctive relief|enjoin|temporary restraining|cease and desist|monetary damages|declaratory relief|prayer\" to capture all remedy requests. But we already did many searches earlier. But maybe not all. We should search again with a broader pattern that includes \"request for\" etc. But we need distinct remedy requests. The complaint likely lists remedies in a numbered list. We captured A-F maybe. There might be more like \"grant a preliminary injunction\", \"grant permanent injunction\", \"grant monetary damages\", etc.\n\nWe have 6 from Complaint. Let's list them: from earlier extracts: Value 1: \"Plaintiff: Granting such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.\" Value 2: \"Plaintiff: preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order.\" Value 3: \"Plaintiff: Enjoining the Defendants and their agents and successors from implementing or otherwise giving effect to the Exclusion Order and Exclusion Memorandum.\" Value 4: \"Plaintiff: Directing Defendants to honor the assignment of union dues by continuing to allot union membership dues and to remit any dues that have been collected.\" Value 5: \"Plaintiff: Granting Plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees and costs.\" Value 6: \"Plaintiff: Declaring that the Exclusion Order, the Exclusion Memorandum, and the associated termination of federal CBAs and grievances violates the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and is ultra vires.\" That's 6. Are there more? Perhaps \"Plaintiff: Monetary damages\" etc. Should search again for \"damages\" or \"monetary damages\" in Complaint. We have earlier search at step 13 found 5 matches. But we didn't extract monetary damages maybe. Let's search for \"damages\" more specifically.\n\nWe'll perform search_document_regex on Complaint for \"damages\" or \"monetary damages\". Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"],\"pattern\":\"damages\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief"], "pattern": "damages", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7492, "completion_tokens": 835, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We might need to read more portions of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to find any additional remedies. Also Order and Order Re Preliminary Injunction may have more.\n\nWe should search for patterns like \"request\", \"seeks\", \"asks\" or \"prayer\" etc. But we already did many searches. We might need to read more of the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief that hasn't been visited. The coverage is 13%.

Also maybe in the opening paragraphs. Let's search for \"prayer\" again with regex. Already did search for \"(?i)prayer\" and found none. Perhaps the prayer is at the end of the complaint. We might need to read the last part of Complaint. We have tokens 24000-25000 visited. The prayer might be at around 25500? We haven't visited that. The complaint is 25,573 tokens; we have visited up to 25000. We need to read 25000-25573. That might contain the prayer.\n\nAlso, the complaint may contain \"request\" or \"ask\" or \"seeks\" etc. But we already have many remedy entries. But to be safe, we should read the remaining part of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: tokens 25000-25573.\n\nAlso, we might need to check the earlier part tokens 0-200 and 400-2867 for any additional remedy requests. But we can read them later.\n\nAlso, Order and Order Re Preliminary may have other remedy requests. But we have some entries from Order: we had 3 values. But we need to verify if any more. Let's check unvisited tokens in Order: we visited 954-1294, 2730-3178, 3640-3840, 3860-4160, 4170-4370, 5833-6033, 6302-6502. Total tokens 6655. So remaining: 0-953, 1295-2729, 3179-3639, 4161-4169, 4371-5832, 6034-6301, 6503-6655. So many missing. We might need to read those as well. But maybe the remedy requests are mainly in the earlier part of the Order (like \"seek a preliminary injunction\"). Search for \"seek\" in Order gave 1 match earlier. But there may be more. We should read the unvisited parts.\n\nSimilarly, Order Re Preliminary Injunction: we visited many but still missing many parts. We have tokens: 0-185, 957-1213, 1246-1478, 1823-2023, 6739-6942, 8131-8978, 11544-11744, 18031-18231, 18419-18873, 19703-19903. So missing: 186-956, 1214-1245, 1479-1822, 2024-6738, 6943-8130, 8979-11543, 11745-18030, 18232-18418, 18874-19702, 19904-19991. So many. But we already got 3 remedies from there. Might be more.\n\nAlso, Ex Parte Motion we fully visited. We have 1 remedy there.\n\nSo we need to search for more remedy requests in the remaining parts. Let's consider reading the last part of Complaint: tokens 25000-25573. That might include the prayer and any additional remedies.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, tokens 25000-25573.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":25000,\"end_token\":25573}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 25000, "end_token": 25573}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5237, "completion_tokens": 1087, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have 12 extracted values for Remedy_Sought. Are we missing any? We need to ensure all distinct values across all documents. We saw earlier that we appended 12 values. We need to verify if any missing.\n\nWe have coverage: 15% of complaint, 5% docket, 28% order, 15% order preliminary, 100% motion. We might have missed some remedies in docket or order or preliminary. The search earlier found matches: many. But we appended 3 from Order Re Preliminary, 2 from Order, 1 from Ex Parte Motion, 6 from Complaint.\n\nLet's inspect coverage: In Order, we have 28% coverage, but not all. There might be more remedies in order. Similarly for preliminary injunction we saw 15% coverage; but we appended 3 values. Might be more.\n\nWe should search for patterns like \"remedy\", \"injunctive relief\", \"enjoin\", \"stay\", \"cease and desist\", \"monetary damages\", \"declaratory\", \"prayer\" that might include remedy requests. But we must only include remedies sought by parties, not outcomes. For Order or Preliminary Injunction, the remedies sought might be in the Order's \"Prayer\" or \"Requests\" section. But an Order is a court order, not a pleading. It might contain \"The Court orders that...\" So remedy sought might be in the \"Prayer\" of the Complaint. But maybe the Order also includes \"Request for preliminary injunction\" but that's not remedy sought; it's the request. So we might have missed remedies sought in the Order's \"Premise\" or \"Request for Preliminary Injunction\"? The Order is a court decision; but the remedy sought by parties would be in the pleadings, not in the order. But maybe there is a \"Prayer\" in the Order? Actually, some orders include a \"Prayer\" for the parties. But likely not.\n\nCheck Docket: Docket may contain \"Requests\" (e.g., \"The parties request that the Court...\" as part of docket entry). That might be remedy sought. We might have missed such entries.\n\nThus we need to search in Docket for patterns to find any remedy sought. We have partially visited 5% of docket. We haven't read most of it. We need to search for \"remedy\", \"injunctive relief\", \"enjoin\", \"stay\", \"cease and desist\", \"declaratory relief\", \"prayer\", \"damages\", \"monetary damages\", \"injunction\", \"temporary restraining\". Also \"request\" maybe.\n\nWe need to search the Docket for these patterns. The search_document_regex can search across all documents. We might want to search Docket specifically.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Docket with pattern that covers remedy sought. We already did some earlier searches but didn't find many. But we may need to search for \"prayer\" or \"request\" or \"remedy\" etc. But we should use a pattern that captures possible remedy statements. Maybe \"prayer\", \"request\", \"enjoin\", \"stay\", \"cease and desist\", \"injunctive relief\", \"injunction\", \"temporary restraining\", \"monetary damages\", \"declaratory relief\". We may combine them.\n\nWe can use regex with OR. E.g., pattern: \"(prayer|request|enjoin|stay|cease and desist|injunctive relief|injunction|temporary restraining|monetary damages|declaratory relief)\".\n\nWe should search Docket only. So doc_name=\"Docket\". That will return matches with context. Then we can read relevant windows.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Docket\", pattern as above, flags maybe IGNORECASE, context_tokens maybe 200. Then we can read the matches.\n\nThus our next action: call search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"pattern\":\"(prayer|request|enjoin|stay|cease and desist|injunctive relief|injunction|temporary restraining|monetary damages|declaratory relief)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "(prayer|request|enjoin|stay|cease and desist|injunctive relief|injunction|temporary restraining|monetary damages|declaratory relief)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5774, "completion_tokens": 894, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Then earlier appended 3, 3, 1, etc. The current state says 12 values extracted. But is that all? Possibly missing some? We must ensure completeness. We should search for additional remedy sought that might be in other documents that haven't been fully visited: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief partially visited 15% coverage; Order 28%; Order Re Preliminary 15%; Docket 8%; Ex Parte fully visited. So there might be additional remedies not yet found in the unvisited parts. We should search for \"remedy\" or \"injunctive relief\" etc in the remaining unvisited tokens.\n\nWe have not fully scanned the Complaint and orders beyond the visited ranges. The largest unvisited portions are likely in Complaint (lots of tokens).
