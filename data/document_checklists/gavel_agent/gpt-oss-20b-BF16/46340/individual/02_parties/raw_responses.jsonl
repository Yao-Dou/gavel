We already have some matches but not the entire list. We need to read from 1009-1209 maybe already captured defendants list details. But we need more. Let's search regex for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" but we already did. But maybe we need to read more tokens to get full list of plaintiffs. The match 2 for plaintiffs was incomplete. We need to locate the section where plaintiffs are listed. Likely earlier in the Complaint after \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs\". The match 18-24 shows \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs\" and then the names of AFL-CIO groups. That might be the list. We need to read those tokens. Need to read from tokens 18-30? Actually match 2 tokens 287-487 contains the list of plaintiffs. Let's read that region fully.\n\nWe can read tokens 250-500 maybe. Let's request read_document for tokens 250-500.

So we can extract that as plaintiffs.\n\nDefendants: we saw matches: \"Defendant United States Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”); Defendant Charles Ezell; Defendant United States State Department (“State”); Defendant United States Agency for International Development (“USAID”); Defendant Marco Rubio; etc. Also earlier we saw \"Defendant United States Office of Personnel Management\" etc. We should read more to capture all defendants. We might need to search for \"Defendant\" pattern again but we already have matches 1-5. We should probably read the document around those matches to capture the text fully. We have read tokens for 5563-5807 which includes many defendants. But maybe there are more around earlier tokens 1009-1209. We have seen that section includes \"Environmental Protection Agency; U.S. National Science Foundation; Dr. Sethuraman Panchanathan; Director of the U.S. National Science Foundation; U.S. International Trade Commission; Amy A. Karpel; Chair of the U.S. International Trade Commission; U.S. General Services Administration; Stephen Ehikian; U.S. Social Security Administration; Leland Dudeck; Acting Commissioner of the Social Security Administration; U.S.\" That seems to be defendants as well. So we need to extract each defendant with description.\n\nAlso \"Defendant United States Office of Personnel Management\" etc with description. So we need to parse all defendants.\n\nThus we need more reading: read the Complaint around tokens 900-1300 to capture the list of defendants. Also maybe from other documents but likely only Complaint lists parties. But we may need to parse others for defendants too. But let's focus on Complaint.\n\nWe have already read tokens 0-500, 1009-1209, 1498-1969, 2504-2704, 2830-3030, 5563-5807. We need to read 1009-1209 maybe partially. But we have that snippet. But to capture full text of defendant list, we need to read more tokens around 1009-1209. Let's read 900-1300. That will include the list of defendants and their titles.\n\nAlso maybe we need to read 1200-1600 for more defendants.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 900-1300. That will be a new window.\n\nBut we need to ensure we don't re-read overlapping tokens: we have 1009-1209 already. So we could read 900-1009 and 1209-1300 separately. But reading 900-1300 will overlap with 1009-1209 (which is already read). We can still read but we need to avoid re-reading visited tokens? The instruction says \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\" and \"NEVER reread token ranges already viewed\". But we have partially visited: 0-500, 1009-1209, etc. We haven't visited 900-1009 or 1209-1300. So we can read 900-1300. But that will overlap 1009-1209 which is already visited. That would be redundant. So better to read 900-1009 and 1209-1300 separately. But we can read 900-1209? That overlaps 1009-1209 partially. We should avoid overlapping. So we will read 900-1009, and then read 1209-1300.

For example for Environmental Protection Agency: snippet \"Environmental Protection Agency\" from tokens 1009-1209.\n\nFor U.S. National Science Foundation: snippet \"U.S. National Science Foundation\" from tokens 1009-1209.\n\nFor U.S. International Trade Commission: snippet \"U.S. International Trade Commission\".\n\nFor U.S. General Services Administration: snippet \"U.S. General Services Administration\".\n\nFor U.S. Social Security Administration: snippet \"U.S. Social Security Administration\".\n\nFor U.S. Department of Energy: snippet \"U.S. Department of Energy\".\n\nFor U.S. Department of Agriculture: snippet \"U.S. Department of Agriculture\".\n\nFor United States Office of Personnel Management: snippet \"United States Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”)\".\n\nFor Charles Ezell: snippet \"Charles Ezell, Acting Director of OPM\".\n\nFor United States State Department: snippet \"United States State Department\".\n\nFor United States Agency for International Development: snippet \"United States Agency for International Development (“USAID”)\".\n\nFor Marco Rubio: snippet \"Defendant Marco Rubio is\".\n\nFor Donald J. Trump: snippet \"Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States. He is sued solely in his official capacity.\"\n\nFor Stephen Ehikian: snippet \"Stephen Ehikian, in his official capacity as Acting Administrator of the General Services Administration\".\n\nFor Leland Duderk: snippet \"LELAND DUDEK, in his official capacity as Acting Commissioner of the Social Security Administration\".\n\nNow for plaintiffs, we need evidence snippet containing each name. The snippet from tokens 22-27 includes all names separated by semicolons. We can use that snippet for each, but better to provide specific snippet containing name. We can extract portions:\n\n- \"AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO\"\n- \"AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE, COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES\"\n- \"NATIONAL NURSES\"\n- \"NATIONAL NURSES ORGANIZING COMMITTEE\"\n- \"NATIONAL NURSES UNITED\"\n- \"SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, AFL-CIO\"\n- \"NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, INC.\"\n- \"NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FEDERAL\" (incomplete)\n\nBut we may need to capture exact text. The snippet is:\n\n```\nAMERICAN FEDERATION OF  Case No.: \nGOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO;   \nAMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE,   \nCOUNTY\n```\n\nBut we can approximate.\n\nWe'll use snippet that includes the name.\n\nFor each plaintiff, we can use same snippet but maybe identify the part.\n\nWe can provide evidence snippet that includes the name and show it's part of plaintiff list.\n\nNow we will create append_checklist patch.\n\nWe need to produce JSON with patch array.\n\nWe must include evidence arrays.\n\nLet's construct patch.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary

Need to ensure all parties are captured. Are there any other parties in other documents? We have Docket, Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Ex Parte Motion. Likely no parties there. But might be in Order or Motion. To be thorough, we should search those documents for \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\" or party names. But we didn't see \"Plaintiff:\" in text. But parties might be listed differently. We should search for pattern like \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" or \"Party\" or \"plaintiff\" etc. We already did some regex searches. Step 3 search for \"plaintiff\" found 5 matches in Complaint. But maybe other parties are in other docs? Usually the docket lists parties. Orders may list parties but not necessarily with labels. But we should check docket. Let's search docket for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\". Also search for \"United States\" etc. But we already have many defendants. There might be more defendants like \"United States Department of Labor\" etc. But the complaint lists the defendants. It's likely complete.\n\nBut we need to ensure we captured all parties. Check docket: maybe includes parties list. Let's search docket for \"Plaintiff:\"? The docket may list parties in a table. Use search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"Plaintiff:\" and \"Defendant:\" and maybe \"Party\". Let's do search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"(Plaintiff|Defendant):\". Also search for \"United States\" etc. But better: search for \"United States\" maybe many. But we already have many defendants. Might be missing \"United States Department of Labor\" etc. But the complaint listed \"United States General Services Administration\", \"United States Social Security Administration\", \"United States Department of Energy\", \"United States Department of Agriculture\", \"United States Office of Personnel Management\", \"United States State Department\", \"United States Agency for International Development\" etc. Also \"Environmental Protection Agency\", \"U.S. National Science Foundation\", \"U.S. International Trade Commission\". That seems exhaustive. There might be \"United States Department of Labor\" not in complaint. But maybe in order. Let's search docket for \"United States Department\". Also \"United States Department of Labor\" etc. But to be safe, we should search docket for \"United States\" and parse. However, the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to check all documents. So we should search all documents for party names. We can search for \"Plaintiff:\" and \"Defendant:\" patterns. But the complaint had parties but maybe others. Let's search docket. Also maybe the Order includes parties. Let's search Order and Order Re Preliminary Injunction for \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\" or \"United States\". But better to search for \"United States\" pattern. But might yield many irrelevant results. But we can search for \"United States\" with context. But we might miss. But we can search for \"United States\" to see if there are other defendants not captured. Let's search docket for \"United States\". Also search Order for \"United States\". But to be efficient, we can search all documents for \"United States\". That will return many matches, but we can examine. But we might use regex to search for \"United States\" but that's broad. However we can use context tokens to see if it's a party. But maybe easier to search docket for \"United States\" and read near matches.\n\nWe need to decide next action: likely search_document_regex on Docket and Order for \"United States\" or \"Plaintiff:\" / \"Defendant:\". But we already have some parties. But let's confirm if docket lists parties. Let's do search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"United States\". We'll set context 200 tokens. Use top_k maybe 5. That will give us matches. Then we can decide if there are new parties.\n\nAlso maybe search Order for \"United States\" to see if any parties. Let's do search_document_regex on Order for pattern \"United States\". But we'll only get top_k 5 per doc. That may miss some. But we could increase top_k to maybe 10. But we can also search all documents for \"United States\" and then read each match. But we might get many. But I suspect docket may list parties. But we can search docket for \"Plaintiff:\" pattern. But maybe docket uses \"Plaintiff:\"? Let's search docket for \"Plaintiff:\" and \"Defendant:\".\n\nLet's decide to search docket for pattern \"(Plaintiff|Defendant):\". That will return matches. If none, we might search docket for \"United States\". But let's start with \"Plaintiff:\" and \"Defendant:\".\n\nAlso do search_document_regex on Order for pattern same. But we can combine doc_names array. Let's do search_document_regex with doc_names: [\"Docket\", \"Order\", \"Order Re Preliminary Injunction\"] and pattern \"(Plaintiff|Defendant):\". That might capture any labeled parties. We'll set context_tokens 200. top_k maybe 5. That seems good.\n\nWe also might need to search for \"United States\" to capture any additional defendants not labeled. But we can later decide.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex on those documents.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Docket\",\"Order\",\"Order Re Preliminary Injunction\"],\"pattern\":\"(Plaintiff|Defendant):\",\"flags\":[],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Docket", "Order", "Order Re Preliminary Injunction"], "pattern": "(Plaintiff|Defendant):", "flags": [], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6513, "completion_tokens": 1171, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

However, maybe other documents might have additional parties. The task: extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So we need to check other documents for parties. The current extraction includes many defendants and plaintiffs from that complaint. There may be additional parties in other documents like Docket, Order, etc. We need to search for \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\" patterns or party names. We already searched \"Plaintiff|Defendant:\" across all documents earlier and found none. But that maybe because the format didn't include colon. The parties in complaint were not labeled with \"Plaintiff:\" but just names. So further parties might be present in other documents but not captured. We should search for \"United States\" or \"Donald J. Trump\" etc. But we probably already captured all parties from complaint. However, maybe the Docket or Order documents include additional parties like \"United States of America\" or \"President of the United States\" but those are already included. But maybe there are other parties like \"United States Department of Justice\" etc. Need to search for patterns: \"United States\" or \"President\" etc. But the requirement: extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So we must ensure we captured all parties present across all documents. There may be other parties in Docket or Order or other documents. Let's search for \"United States\" in other docs. But better: search for \"Defendant\" or \"Plaintiff\" in other docs; earlier search on Docket, Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction had no matches. But those might not contain party names. We might need to search for \"United States\" etc. But the parties list could be huge. But we can search for \"United States\" and capture each unique entity. But we should check if any parties are missing. Maybe the complaint has all parties: plaintiffs are AFL-CIO affiliates, defendants are US agencies and officials. There may also be \"United States of America\" or \"U.S. Department\" etc. But those are included.\n\nHowever, there may be other documents like Ex Parte Motion that include parties: maybe \"U.S. Department of Justice\" or \"Department of Transportation\". But we need to check.\n\nThus, next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern that matches party names. We could search for \"U.S.\" or \"United States\" or \"Department\" etc. But that might capture many. But to be systematic, we can search for \"United States\" or \"U.S.\" maybe. But better: search for \"U.S.\" pattern? That might be too generic. Alternatively, search for \"President\" etc. But maybe easier: just search for \"United States\" across all docs, then manually parse distinct parties. But we can't manually parse from snippet? We need to read the matched contexts. We can search for \"United States\" across all documents. That will return contexts. Then we can extract distinct parties from those contexts. But we need to ensure we capture all. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"United States\".\n\nBut we must be careful: the search returns top 5 matches per doc. That might miss some. But we can search for \"United States\" with context 200 tokens. The matches will show several occurrences. We might need to read them to capture parties.\n\nBut there might be many matches. But we can limit to maybe 10 matches? The default top_k=5. But we might get 5 per doc, which might be enough to capture all parties. But we need to ensure we capture all distinct parties. The parties might appear many times, but top 5 might not cover all. But we can also search for \"Department\" or \"Agency\" etc. But it's complex.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"Defendant\" or \"Plaintiff\" again but with broader pattern: maybe \"Defendant\" alone? But earlier search on all docs for \"Plaintiff|Defendant:\" returned 0 matches. But maybe the other docs have \"Defendant\" without colon. We can search for \"Defendant\" alone. Let's do that: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Defendant\" (no colon). That may find matches. Similarly for \"Plaintiff\".\n\nWe need to choose one action per turn. Let's choose to search for \"Defendant\" pattern across all documents. That will return matches. Then we can read them and extract parties if new ones exist. That seems a good next step.\n\nThus, next action: search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"Defendant\". Let's do that.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Defendant\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Defendant", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6065, "completion_tokens": 1020, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to ensure we have all distinct values across corpus. We may have missed parties in other documents. We should search for \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\" patterns in other documents. The earlier search on all documents found 23 matches, but mostly in Complaint. We saw many parties in Docket and Order docs. But maybe they are same as Complaint? The Docket shows many parties: American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO; National Nurses; etc. Also U.S. Department of State, etc. Those might be duplicates of what we already captured? Let's compare: We have defendants: Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. National Science Foundation, U.S. International Trade Commission, U.S. General Services Administration, U.S. Social Security Administration, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Department of Agriculture, OPM, Charles Ezell, United States State Department, USAID, Marco Rubio, Donald J.

No. Did we capture U.S. Department of Education, etc? No. Those appear in Docket and Order. So we need to capture those missing parties.\n\nAlso, plaintiffs: We captured many plaintiff unions but not the individual names of \"American Federation of Government Employees\" etc? We captured those. But maybe we missed individual plaintiffs like \"National Nurses Organizing Committee\"? We captured.

We need to read those sections to extract missing parties.\n\nWe have not read Docket tokens beyond 0-133, 5793-5993, 6212-6518, 7555-7755. The Docket has many parties listed, but we haven't read the specific tokens containing those parties. The docket entries with parties contain a long list of parties in the \"Filed by\" lines. We need to read those tokens to capture all parties.\n\nAlso the Order documents have more parties.\n\nThus the next action should be to read more portions of the Docket and Order documents to capture the missing parties.\n\nSpecifically, we need to read the docket entries at 0-133 maybe contains \"Filed by National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United, American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, National Association of Government Employees, Inc., National Federation of Federal Employees, IAM, AFL-C\". That's partial. We need to read further tokens to capture all 4. So read 0-200 maybe.\n\nAlso read Docket tokens 5793-5993 we already partially captured but maybe missing more parties. We could read 5793-6000.\n\nAlso read Docket tokens 6212-6518 we read partially. We need to read 6212-6400 maybe.\n\nAlso read Docket tokens 7555-7755 we read partial. Read 7555-7800.\n\nAlso read Order tokens 917-1117 we read partially. That includes many parties. We should read a bit more: 917-1200 maybe.\n\nAlso read Order tokens 4332-4585 we partially captured. That's also many parties. We should read 4300-4700.\n\nAlso Order Re Preliminary Injunction tokens 5-205 we read partially. That includes parties. But we might need to read from 5-300 maybe.\n\nAlso Order Re Preliminary Injunction tokens 7682-8132 we read partially. That includes parties. Maybe read 7650-8200.\n\nAlso Order Re Preliminary Injunction tokens 8132-? we haven't read.\n\nThus we need to read many sections.\n\nBut the instruction: choose ONE action per turn. We could read one document range. We should pick the most promising next. Let's read Order tokens 917-1200 to capture parties not yet captured.\n\nBut we already captured many parties from Order 917-1117, but not all. Let's inspect that text snippet: It had many parties: \"Sethuraman Panchanathan... etc.\" The snippet we saw had many names: \"Sethuraman Panchanathan, in his official capacity as Director of the U.S. National Science Foundation; U.S. International Trade Commission; Amy A. Karpel, in her official capacity as Chair of the U.S. International Trade Commission; Leland Dudek, Acting Commissioner of Social Security, in his official capacity as Acting Commissioner of the Social Security Administration; United States Department of Education; Linda McMahon, in her official capacity as Secretary of Education, Defendants - Appellants.\" So we captured some but not all. Let's list missing:\n\n- Sethuraman Panchanathan\n- Amy A. Karpel\n- Leland Dudek (already captured)\n- United States Department of Education\n- Linda McMahon\n\nAlso maybe \"United States Department of Labor\" etc? Not in that snippet.\n\nAlso \"United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\" not present.\n\nThus we need to capture those missing parties.\n\nThus next action: read_document Order tokens 917-1200.\n\nBut we also need to capture parties from Docket. Might be more efficient to read Docket tokens 0-200 to capture parties from docket. But we already captured some from docket. But missing parties like \"United States Department of State\"? That appears in docket perhaps. Let's check: The docket snippet tokens 0-133 had many parties including \"American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, National Association of Government Employees, Inc., National Federation of Federal Employees, IAM, AFL-C\". But not the other agencies. The docket entries 5793-5993 include names of defendants etc. But likely the docket includes parties list but not all agencies. But the docket seems to have \"U.S. Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, Marco Rubio, U.S. Department of Defense, Peter Hegseth, U.S. Department of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins, U.S. Department of Justice, Pamela Bondi, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F Kennedy, Jr, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, U.S. Department of the Interior, Doug Burgum, U.S. Department of Energy, Chris Wright, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,\" etc. So we need to read that section.\n\nThus maybe read Docket tokens 5793-6000. This might capture many of those parties. But we already read 5793-5993 partially. We need to read 5793-6000? Actually we read 5793-5993 which ended at 5993. That snippet had many names but not fully captured. So reading 5793-6100 will capture rest.\n\nThus next action: read_document Docket tokens 5793-6100.\n\nBut we also need to capture from Order tokens 917-1200. We can pick one. We could combine reading two documents? The function only reads one document. We can choose either.\n\nSince we need to capture missing parties from Docket, let's read Docket 5793-6100.\n\nThus: read_document with doc_name \"Docket\" start_token 5793 end_token 6100.\n\nWe should note that the tokens we read might exceed 10k? 5793-6100 is 307 tokens, fine.\n\nThus next action: call read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":5793,\"end_token\":6100}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 5793, "end_token": 6100}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9786, "completion_tokens": 3228, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Need to check if any other parties exist in other documents that were not captured. The goal is to extract all distinct values of Who_are_the_Parties. We need to ensure we have all parties present across all documents. The current extraction includes plaintiffs and defendants from Complaint. However, other documents may list additional parties, especially the docket and motion lists may include parties like U.S. agencies, etc. But many of those are already in the Complaint list. We need to see if any parties are missing.\n\nCheck the docket entries: they list many parties, including U.S. Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, Marco Rubio, U.S. Department of Defense, Peter Hegseth, etc. Many of these are already in the Complaint list? Let's see the Complaint list: it includes many agencies: Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. National Science Foundation, U.S. International Trade Commission, U.S. General Services Administration, U.S. Social Security Administration, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Department of Agriculture, United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Charles Ezell, United States State Department, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Marco Rubio, Donald J. Trump, Stephen Ehikian, Leland Duderk. That covers many. But the docket entries also include other agencies: U.S. Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Marco Rubio (already), U.S. Department of Defense, Peter Hegseth, U.S. Department of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins, U.S. Department of Justice, Pamela Bondi, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, U.S. Department of the Interior, Doug Burgum, U.S. Department of Energy (already), Chris Wright, U.S. Department of Agriculture (already), Brooke Rollins, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (already), Lee Zeldin, U.S. National Science Foundation (already), Sethuraman Panchanathan, U.S. International Trade Commission (already), Amy A. Karpel, U.S. General Services Administration (already), Stephen Ehikian (already), U.S. Social Security Administration (already), Leland Dudek (already), U.S. Department of Labor, Lori Chavez-Deremer, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Scott Turner, U.S. Department of Transportation, Sean Duffy, U.S. Department of Education, Linda McMahon, Donald J ... etc.\n\nThus many new parties not captured: U.S. Department of State, Defense, Treasury, Veterans Affairs, Justice, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Interior, Department of Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, Department of Education, Department of Commerce? etc. Also persons like Peter Hegseth, Scott Bessent, Pamela Bondi, Robert F Kennedy Jr, etc.\n\nAlso the docket entries list \"United States Department of Labor,\" \"Lori Chavez-Deremer\". Also \"Scott Turner\" etc.\n\nAlso the docket entry includes \"Robert F Kennedy, Jr\" which is not in Complaint. Also \"Kristi Noem\". Also \"Doug Burgum\" (already). \"Chris Wright\" (already). \"Brooke Rollins\" (already). \"Lee Zeldin\" (already). \"Sethuraman Panchanathan\" (already). \"Amy A. Karpel\" (already). \"Stephen Ehikian\" (already). \"Leland Dudek\" (already). \"Scott Turner\" (not in Complaint). \"Sean Duffy\" (not). \"Linda McMahon\" (not). \"Donald J\" (already). \"Robert F Kennedy, Jr\" (not). \"Lori Chavez-Deremer\" (not). \"Peter Hegseth\" (not). \"Scott Bessent\" (not). \"Pamela Bondi\" (not). \"Kristi Noem\" (not). \"U.S. Department of Labor\" (not). \"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\" (not). \"U.S. Department of Transportation\" (not). \"U.S. Department of Education\" (not). \"U.S. Department of Commerce\" (not). \"U.S. Department of Agriculture\" (already). \"U.S. Department of Energy\" (already). \"U.S. Department of the Interior\" (not). \"U.S. Department of Defense\" (not). \"U.S. Department of Treasury\" (not). \"U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\" (not). \"U.S. Department of Justice\" (not). \"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\" (not). \"U.S. Department of Homeland Security\" (not). \"U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\" (already). \"U.S. Office of Personnel Management\" (already). \"U.S. General Services Administration\" (already). \"U.S. Social Security Administration\" (already). \"U.S. National Science Foundation\" (already). \"U.S. International Trade Commission\" (already). \"U.S. Agency for International Development\" (already). \"United States State Department\" (already). \"United States Office of Personnel Management\" (already). \"United States Agency for International Development\" (already). \"United States Department of State\" (already as State). \"United States Department of State\" maybe same.\n\nAlso persons: Peter Hegseth, Scott Bessent, Pamela Bondi, Robert F Kennedy Jr, etc. Also \"Kristi Noem\" (not). \"Lori Chavez-Deremer\" (not). \"Scott Turner\" (not). \"Sean Duffy\" (not). \"Linda McMahon\" (not). \"Robert F Kennedy Jr\" (not). \"Donald J Trump\" (already). \"Charles Ezell\" (already). \"Stephen Ehikian\" (already). \"Leland Dudek\" (already). \"Sethuraman Panchanathan\" (already). \"Amy A. Karpel\" (already). \"Lee Zeldin\" (already). So many missing.\n\nThus we need to extract more parties. Likely the docket includes all parties. So we should search docket for \"On behalf of\" or \"on behalf of\" or the docket entries themselves list parties. We need to parse.\n\nBetter approach: search for \"On behalf of\" or \"on behalf of U.S.\" etc. But the docket entries are long and contain lists.\n\nMaybe easier: search for pattern \"U.S. Department of\" within Docket. But we might already have many.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"Defendant:\" pattern in all documents, but we already did. That captured defendants in Complaint but not docket. The docket entries may not include \"Defendant:\" but they list parties in \"filing by\" etc. But we need to capture all parties. The requirement: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" So we need to capture plaintiffs and defendants. The docket entries list parties as \"filing by\" but not necessarily plaintiff/defendant. We could treat them as parties.\n\nThus we must extract all distinct parties from all documents. We have 23 from Complaint. We need to find additional parties. Let's search docket for \"U.S. Department of\" and \"United States\" etc.\n\nWe need to ensure we capture parties as \"Plaintiff: [description]\" or \"Defendant: [description]\". For docket entries, likely they are not labeled with \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\" but we can still produce entries with those labels? The requirement says \"identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" For docket entries, we can still label them as \"Plaintiff:\" if they are plaintiffs or \"Defendant:\" if defendants. But we need to know which side. The docket entries show \"filing by\" parties. For example, \"Filed by National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United, American Federation Of Government Employees...\" These are plaintiffs. So we can label them as Plaintiff. For others like \"U.S. Department of State\" etc. They are defendants. So we should label accordingly.\n\nThus we need to parse docket entries to include all parties.\n\nAlso the Order and Order Re Preliminary Injunction may have more parties. The Order Re Preliminary includes \"United States Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of the Treasury, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Justice, Office of Personnel Management, USAID, National Science Foundation, etc.\" Some may be duplicates. But we need to ensure all unique.\n\nThus we need to search docket for \"United States Department of\".\n\nAlternatively, we can search docket for pattern \"U.S. Department of\" or \"United States Department of\" across all documents.\n\nWe should also search Order Re Preliminary for \"United States Department of\" or \"U.S. Department of\".\n\nWe need to read relevant sections to extract parties.\n\nWe also need to ensure we don't duplicate parties already extracted. We have 23 from Complaint; some may appear in docket and others. We need to keep unique.\n\nThus we should search docket and Order Re Preliminary for \"United States Department\". Also maybe search for \"U.S. Department\" pattern.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on Docket with pattern \"U.S. Department of [A-Za-z ]+\" or \"United States Department of [A-Za-z ]+\".\n\nAlso search Order Re Preliminary. Also Order.\n\nAlso maybe search Ex Parte Motion for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" patterns.\n\nBut we already have some from Complaint. Let's search docket.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"U.S. Department of .+\" with flags? Use MULTILINE DOTALL.\n\nAlso include \"United States Department of\" to catch both.\n\nLet's do a search.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"pattern\":\"(U\\\\.S\\\\.

We have extracted 23 parties from Complaint. But there may be more parties in other documents. The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have only extracted from Complaint. But many parties appear in Docket etc. We need to ensure we capture all distinct parties across all documents. We have seen many parties in Docket, Order, etc. We need to extract all unique parties. We have 23 from Complaint. Additional parties include many government agencies and individuals in Docket and other documents. We need to identify all distinct parties: plaintiffs and defendants. We have many plaintiffs: American Federation of Government Employees, etc. Defendants: EPA, NSF, ITC, etc. Also individual defendants: Charles Ezell, Donald J. Trump, Stephen Ehikian, Leland Dudek, etc. Also many agencies listed in Docket: Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of the Treasury, etc. Also individuals like Peter Hegseth, Amy A. Karpel, Robert F Kennedy Jr, etc. Also parties in the docket list: various attorneys on behalf of plaintiffs and defendants. We need to include all distinct parties. Also there may be \"National Nurses Organizing Committee\" etc.\n\nWe need to ensure no duplicates.\n\nThus we need to read more of the Docket, Order, etc. The doc catalog lists 5 docs. We might need to read more sections. We have partially visited many sections, but many portions still unviewed. There's a huge number of parties in Docket. The search results gave many matches; we could summarize them. But to be systematic, we could search for patterns \"United States Department of [A-Z ]+\" and \"U\\.S\\. Department of [A-Z ]+\" and also individual names. But we already have a large regex search that returned many matches with context. We could parse those matches to extract parties. But the instruction requires evidence: the snippet with text. We can use those matches as evidence.\n\nWe need to list all distinct parties. How many? The Docket lists many. We need to compile list. But we should be careful: duplicates across documents e.g., same agency appears in Complaint and Docket. We should avoid duplicates. We have 23 from Complaint. Additional from Docket: many more. Let's identify unique ones not in Complaint.\n\nFrom Complaint, we have plaintiffs:\n\n- American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO\n- American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees\n- National Nurses\n- National Nurses Organizing Committee\n- National Nurses United\n- Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO\n- National Association of Government Employees, Inc.\n- National Federation of Federal (likely incomplete)\nWait \"National Federation of Federal\" seems truncated; maybe \"National Federation of Federal Employees\" or similar. In the text snippet, it's truncated.\n\nDefendants from Complaint:\n\n- Environmental Protection Agency\n- U.S. National Science Foundation\n- U.S. International Trade Commission\n- U.S. General Services Administration\n- U.S. Social Security Administration\n- U.S. Department of Energy\n- U.S. Department of Agriculture\n- United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\n- Charles Ezell, Acting Director of OPM\n- United States State Department\n- United States Agency for International Development (USAID)\n- Marco Rubio\n- Donald J. Trump, President of the United States (in his official capacity)\n- Stephen Ehikian, Acting Administrator of the GSA\n- Leland Dudek, Acting Commissioner of the SSA\n\nNow from Docket matches, we have many parties list. The docket shows many names of plaintiffs/defendants attorneys and parties. Let's parse.\n\nFrom match 1 tokens 3044-3244: The snippet lists \"Scott Bessent, Pamela Bondi, Doug Burgum, Lori Chavez-Deremer, Doug Collins, Leland Dudek, Sean Duffy, Stephen Ehikian, Charles Ezell, Peter Hegseth, Amy A. Karpel, Robert F Kennedy, Jr, Linda McMahon, Kristi Noem, Sethuraman Panchanathan, Brooke Rollins, Marco Rubio, Donald J. Trump, Scott Turner, U.S. Agency for International Development, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Education, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S.\"\n\nThis includes many individuals and agencies.\n\nAlso match 2 and 3 etc show similar list but with some duplicates.\n\nThus we need to extract all distinct parties: individuals (including attorneys? Probably parties: the named individuals like Scott Bessent, Pamela Bondi, etc. They are likely attorneys, so maybe not parties? The instruction: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" Typically parties are organizations and individuals named as plaintiffs or defendants. Attorneys may not be parties. But the docket lists attorneys on behalf of parties. The parties would be the organizations represented by those attorneys. In docket, the parties list various organizations, e.g., National Nurses, etc. The attorneys represent them. But the docket includes names of attorneys, but the parties themselves are the represented organizations.\n\nThus the parties list should include those organizations and individuals. For example, the plaintiff parties: American Federation of Government Employees, etc. The defendant parties: agencies and individuals like Trump, etc. The docket also lists many individuals as parties? e.g., \"Scott Bessent\" maybe an attorney representing a plaintiff or defendant. They may not be parties. The docket's \"NOTICE of Appearance\" shows attorneys on behalf of parties; the parties are the organizations like \"U.S. Department of State\" etc. So the parties in docket may be the same as in Complaint. But we also have \"United States Agency for International Development\" etc.\n\nThus maybe the parties list is already captured in Complaint. But the docket may include additional parties like \"United States Department of Health and Human Services\" etc. Some of those are already in Complaint (e.g., Department of Health and Human Services maybe not). Actually Complaint did not list HHS, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, Interior, etc. So we need to add those.\n\nAlso individuals like \"Peter Hegseth\", \"Amy A. Karpel\", \"Robert F Kennedy Jr\", \"Linda McMahon\", \"Kristi Noem\", \"Sethuraman Panchanathan\", \"Brooke Rollins\", \"Scott Turner\". These individuals may be plaintiffs/defendants? They are likely attorneys representing parties; but maybe they are also parties if they are named as such in the complaint? The complaint didn't list them. But the docket shows them as attorneys, not parties. So maybe they are not parties.\n\nBut the docket also shows \"Donald J. Trump\" and \"Marco Rubio\" as parties. Those are already included.\n\nThus we need to extract all unique parties from all documents. That includes entities listed in Complaint and those from Docket that are not in Complaint. We need to capture evidence for each.\n\nGiven the volume, we could use a search_document_regex on Docket for pattern matching \"United States Department of [A-Za-z ]+\" and \"U\\.S\\. Department of [A-Za-z ]+\" and \"U\\.S\\. National Science Foundation\" etc. But we already have many matches. Perhaps we can perform a search that returns all matches and then parse them. But we need to provide evidence for each extracted value. The matches we already have contain the names and context. We can use those as evidence.\n\nGiven we need to append many new values: from Docket, we need to list all distinct agencies not already in our list: Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Justice, Department of Labor, Department of State, Department of Transportation, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of the Interior.\n\nAlso we might need to list \"United States Agency for International Development\" (already present), \"United States Office of Personnel Management\" (present), \"United States General Services Administration\" (present), \"United States Social Security Administration\" (present), \"United States Department of Energy\" (present), \"United States Department of Agriculture\" (present). So new ones: Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Justice, Department of Labor, Department of Transportation, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of the Interior. Also maybe \"U.S. National Science Foundation\" is in Complaint. Yes present.\n\nAlso any individuals like \"Peter Hegseth\" might not be parties; skip.\n\nThus need to add 8 new values.\n\nAlso note that \"National Federation of Federal\" incomplete; maybe \"National Federation of Federal Employees\". There may be more parties listed in Complaint that are incomplete. But we cannot fix incomplete. But maybe we need to extract as is. The list from Complaint includes that truncated one. That might be an artifact. But we include as is.\n\nThus we need to append 8 new entries.\n\nBut check if there are other parties in Docket not captured: \"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\" etc. Also \"U.S. Department of Homeland Security\" etc. Also \"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\". Yes.\n\nAlso \"U.S. Department of Justice\" etc.\n\nAlso \"U.S. Department of Labor\". \"U.S. Department of Transportation\". \"U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\". \"U.S. Department of the Interior\".\n\nAlso maybe \"U.S. Department of Education\" is already present? Yes Complaint has \"U.S. Department of Education\"? Wait Complaint list includes \"U.S. Department of Education\"? The list from Complaint only had 7 agencies: Environmental Protection Agency, NSF, ITC, GSA, SSA, DOE, USDA. It did not include Education, HHS, DHS, HUD, DOJ, Labor, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, Interior. So we need to add those.\n\nAlso \"United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\" already present. \"United States State Department\" present. \"United States Agency for International Development (USAID)\" present. \"United States General Services Administration\" present. \"United States Social Security Administration\" present. \"United States Department of Energy\" present. \"United States Department of Agriculture\" present.\n\nThus add the remaining 8.\n\nBut also \"U.S. National Science Foundation\" present.\n\nCheck \"United States Department of Education\" not present. So add.\n\nThus 8 new values.\n\nAlso we might consider adding \"National Nurses\" etc? Already present.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist for Who_are_the_Parties with 8 new entries.\n\nBut we must provide evidence for each: use the Docket match snippets as evidence. For each new party, we can reference the snippet from Docket match 1 tokens 3044-3244. That snippet contains all 8. We can include that snippet as evidence for each. But we need to include evidence for each extracted value, including snippet, source_document, location. The location could be \"Docket (tokens 3044-3244)\". That is fine.\n\nThus produce append_checklist with 8 entries.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't duplicate existing ones. We should check duplicates: \"U.S. Department of Education\" appears in Complaint? No. So include. \"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\" appears? Not in Complaint. Include. \"U.S. Department of Homeland Security\" include. \"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\" include. \"U.S. Department of Justice\" include. \"U.S. Department of Labor\" include. \"U.S. Department of Transportation\" include. \"U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\" include. \"U.S. Department of the Interior\" include. Wait that's 9. Let's count: Education, HHS, DHS, HUD, DOJ, Labor, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, Interior. That's 9. Did we double count? Yes 9.\n\nBut also \"United States Department of State\" present. \"United States Department of Agriculture\" present. So 9 new.\n\nThus we need to append 9 new entries.\n\nBut earlier I counted 8. Let's recount: The snippet includes: \"U.S. Department of Agriculture\" (already present). \"U.S. Department of Defense\" (present). \"U.S. Department of Education\" (new). \"U.S. Department of Energy\" (present). \"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\" (new). \"U.S. Department of Homeland Security\" (new). \"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\" (new). \"U.S. Department of Justice\" (new). \"U.S. Department of Labor\" (new). \"U.S. Department of State\" (present). \"U.S. Department of Transportation\" (new). \"U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\" (new). \"U.S. Department of the Interior\" (new).\n\nSo new: Education, HHS, DHS, HUD, DOJ, Labor, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, Interior. That's 9.\n\nThus need to add 9.\n\nAlso maybe \"U.S. Department of Agriculture\" present. Yes.\n\nThus we append 9 new entries.\n\nNow we should ensure evidence snippet includes all names. We can use the same snippet. But we might want separate snippet for each to show the name appears. But we can just use the snippet with all names as evidence for each. It's acceptable to provide same snippet for each.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.\n\nLet's craft JSON.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist

We need to read more token ranges to capture all parties. So next action: read_document on Docket for a new range, e.g., 3363-5000 (which is 1637 tokens). Or maybe 3363-6000.\n\nWe also might need to read more of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief beyond 3030. The complaint still has many parties. So we need to read more tokens.\n\nBut we should aim to capture all parties from all documents. The current partial coverage is insufficient. Let's plan to read more of the complaint: tokens 3030-5000. Also read more docket: tokens 3363-6000. Also maybe read order documents to capture parties.\n\nWe need to check which documents have parties: Complaint, Docket, Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Ex Parte Motion. The Ex Parte Motion likely lists parties too. We have read some, but not all. We need to read more.\n\nHowever, we might risk missing parties in Order and Order Re Preliminary Injunction. We need to read more of those.\n\nGiven the time, maybe we can search for \"United States\" and \"Department\" patterns across all documents to capture parties. But safe to read more sections.\n\nWe should pick one action now: read_document on Docket tokens 3363-5000. That will give more parties. Then after reading, we can append new parties. So next action: read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":3363,\"end_token\":5000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 3363, "end_token": 5000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14449, "completion_tokens": 1004, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The task is \"Extract the parties involved\". Checklist Items to Extract: Who_are_the_Parties. We have 32 values. But are all parties captured? We only have from Complaint and Docket. Is there any other document with parties? The order, motion, etc may include parties too. We need to ensure we captured all distinct parties. We might have missed some from Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Ex Parte Motion. Also from other documents. We should search for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" across all documents. Currently we have 32 values: 23 from Complaint, 9 from Docket. But maybe there are more in other docs. We need to ensure completeness. We should search across all documents for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" patterns.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(Plaintiff|Defendant):\". But earlier search didn't find matches in Complaint? Wait earlier search on all docs for \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\" found none. But we have many matches in Complaint for \"Plaintiff\" but not \"Plaintiff:\"? The text shows \"Plaintiff Unions\" not \"Plaintiff:\". So pattern should be just \"Plaintiff\" could capture. But we need to capture all parties. Maybe we can search for \"U.S. Department\" etc. But we have many from Docket.\n\nBetter to search for \"U.S. Department of\" across all documents? But parties include other entities like \"American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO\" etc. Already captured via Docket. But maybe other documents mention parties like \"John Beed\", \"Michael S Kwun\" etc. Those are attorneys representing parties. But parties are represented by attorneys. But maybe the parties are the attorneys? Actually the parties are the organizations. The attorneys are not parties. So we probably need to capture all parties: unions and agencies.\n\nFrom Docket we captured many agencies. We captured 9 parties: 8 agencies? Actually 9 values: 8 agencies? Wait Docket captured: U.S. Department of Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, the Interior. That's 9. But there may be more agencies like \"U.S. Agency for International Development\" etc that appear in other docket entries. But maybe not captured because we didn't see them earlier. In search results from Docket, we saw many matches including \"U.S. Agency for International Development\" etc. We didn't capture those. So we need to capture them.\n\nThus we need to search Docket again for \"U.S. Agency for International Development\" etc. We should search Docket for \"U\\.S\\. Agency for International Development\" pattern. Or search for \"U\\.S\\. Agency for International Development\" across all docs.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"U\\.S\\. Department of\" which will capture all. But we already captured many. Let's search Docket for \"U\\.S\\. Department of\" pattern to get all agencies. Then capture all distinct agencies. Also capture \"U\\.S\\. Agency for International Development\". Also \"U.S. International Trade Commission\", \"U.S. National Science Foundation\", etc that appear.\n\nAlso check other documents: Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Ex Parte Motion. Might contain parties. But likely the same parties. But maybe the orders include names of all parties as well. But we can search them too.\n\nThus action: search_document_regex on Docket and other docs for pattern \"U\\.S\\. Department of [A-Za-z ]+\" and \"U\\.S\\. Agency for International Development\" etc. But we can use a more general pattern: \"U\\.S\\. (Department|Agency) for [A-Za-z ]+\"? That might capture many.\n\nBut we also need to capture \"American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO\" etc. That appears in docket. We captured those? Actually not yet. We only captured agencies. Wait we appended 9 values. But from Docket we saw many other parties like \"American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO\" etc. But we didn't capture them. So we need to capture them too.\n\nThus we need to search Docket for \"American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO\" pattern. But maybe easier to search for \"American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO\" exactly. But there may be many variations. But we can capture all lines starting with \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by\" which list attorneys and parties. We can parse them.\n\nSimpler: search Docket for \"NOTICE of Appearance\" lines and capture the parties.\n\nBut we already captured 9 agencies. But need to capture other parties in Docket: \"American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO\", \"National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United\", \"Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO\", \"National Association of Government Employees, Inc.\", \"National Federation of Federal Employees, IAM, AFL-CIO\", \"American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO\", \"National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United\" etc.\n\nThus we need to extract those. We can search for \"American Federation Of Government Employees\" across Docket. But we need to capture multiple parties.\n\nWe might also need to capture parties from Complaint: \"Plaintiff Unions\" list: AFGE, AFSCME, NFFE. Those may already be captured? We extracted 23 values from Complaint but we didn't see them in the snippet. We need to check that we have captured them. We appended 23 values from Complaint. Probably those include AFGE etc. But let's verify if all parties from Complaint: \"Plaintiff AFGE, AFSCME, and NFFE\" etc. We captured 23 values maybe include those. But maybe missing some.\n\nSo next step: search Docket for parties not captured yet. But we need to ensure we capture all distinct parties across all documents. We have 32 values now. Likely missing many. Let's find all party names across all documents.\n\nWe should search all documents for \"NOTICE of Appearance\", \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by\", and capture parties. Also search all documents for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" lists.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all docs for pattern \"NOTICE of Appearance\" and also \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\". But we need to extract parties. But maybe easier: just search for \"NOTICE of Appearance\" across all docs, then parse lines.\n\nBut we need to produce evidence. So we will need to read the context to extract.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all docs for pattern \"NOTICE of Appearance\" and maybe \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by\". Let's do that. We'll get matches. Then we can extract parties.\n\nAlso we might search for \"Plaintiff\" in other docs. But we already captured many from Complaint. But maybe other docs have \"Plaintiff\" entries as well.\n\nOk.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern=\"NOTICE of Appearance\", flags=[\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k maybe 20, context_tokens 200. That will return matches across all docs. Then we can examine each match. That will give us tokens for each. Then we can extract parties.\n\nThus next action.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"NOTICE of Appearance\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "NOTICE of Appearance", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11393, "completion_tokens": 1578, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The task says extract all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. We have 32 values extracted. Need to ensure completeness: Did we miss any parties? We have extracted from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: 23 values. From Docket: 9 values. Let's verify what parties were extracted.\n\nFrom Docket matches we saw many names and departments. The 9 values likely: \"Plaintiff: U.S. Department of Education\", \"Plaintiff: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\", etc? Wait the appended values earlier were of type Plaintiff: U.S. Department... Actually those were from Docket? Let's review: Step 13 appended 1 key: Who_are_the_Parties with 9 values: those are Plaintiff: U.S. Department of Education, Health & Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, Interior. Those came from Docket? The evidence shows from Docket tokens 3044-3244. Indeed those are within Docket. So 9 values from Docket.\n\nAnd 23 values from Complaint. Let's check the earlier step 8 appended 23 values, presumably from Complaint. So total 32.\n\nNow question: Are there any other parties in other documents not yet captured? The search for \"Plaintiff:\" and \"Defendant:\" earlier found none. But the Docket contains many names of parties: individuals, agencies, etc. We captured those 9. But there may be more parties like \"Defendant: U.S. Agency for International Development\"? Wait those could be defendants. We might need to capture all parties including defendants. The checklist says \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\"\n\nThus we need to capture both plaintiffs and defendants. Did we capture defendants? The Docket shows many parties but not labeled as defendant. The complaint likely lists defendants. In earlier searches, the complaint may include \"Defendants\" names. Did step 8 include defendants? Let's examine earlier step 8: appended 23 values. That step likely included both plaintiffs and defendants? The appended values listed 23 values but we don't know which ones. The text likely had \"Plaintiff: [description]\" or \"Defendant: [description]\". But we only have evidence for the 9 plaintiff values from Docket. The 23 from Complaint may include both. We need to ensure all distinct parties from all documents. We might have missed some parties that appear only in the Order or Order Re Preliminary Injunction or Ex Parte Motion etc. But likely those are motions and not parties. The parties are listed in complaint and docket. But there might be additional parties in the docket that are not in the complaint (like the defendants). However, we captured 9 plaintiff parties from Docket. But there might be defendants in the docket too. Did step 13 only capture plaintiff parties? The evidence shows \"Plaintiff: U.S. Department of Education\" etc. So we captured plaintiffs. But defendants could be agencies like \"U.S. Department of the Treasury\" etc. We might have missed those. Let's check the docket matches for other agencies: In the docket, many agencies appear, e.g., U.S. Department of the Treasury, Environmental Protection Agency, General Services Administration, International Trade Commission, National Science Foundation, Office of Personnel Management, Social Security Administration, etc. Those are likely defendants listed in the complaint. They may have been included in the 23 values from Complaint. Let's confirm: The 23 values from Complaint likely include all parties: plaintiffs (maybe unions) and defendants (government agencies). But we need to check if the 23 values contain both. The step 8 didn't list them, only said 23 values. But we don't have evidence. We need to ensure we have captured all parties. But the current extracted list might be incomplete. The instruction says \"extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have 32 values. But the docket contains many more parties: e.g., U.S. Department of the Treasury, Environmental Protection Agency, etc. Those may be part of 23 values from Complaint. Let's verify by reading the complaint for more parties. We read tokens 0-500, 900-1209, 1498-3030, 5563-5807. That covers some sections. But maybe we didn't capture some parties because we didn't read the part where parties are listed. The earlier step 8 appended 23 values but we didn't see them. Let's check the complaint where parties are listed. Usually a complaint lists \"Plaintiffs: [list]\" and \"Defendants: [list]\". Might be near the beginning. The earlier read 0-500 tokens includes early part. But we didn't see the parties list because we didn't scroll to the very top. We read tokens 0-500 but maybe the parties list is after that. We need to read near the top of the complaint where parties are enumerated. Let's read from 0 to maybe 2000 tokens. But we already read 0-500. The parties list may be after that. Let's read from 500-1000 tokens. But we read 900-1209 etc. Let's read from 500-900 tokens. That will cover the missing portion. So we should read tokens 500-900 from Complaint. That may capture the parties section. Let's do read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":500,\"end_token\":900}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 500, "end_token": 900}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 15066, "completion_tokens": 1206, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Currently we have extracted 32 values for Who_are_the_Parties. The snapshot says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\". There is 1 key, which appears to be filled. There are 0 empty keys. So all keys are filled. But we need to ensure we have all distinct parties. The extraction says 32 values: 23 from Complaint, 9 from Docket. But is that all parties? We might need to verify if there are any other parties not captured. Let's check the list: In complaint, the plaintiff is a group of unions: \"American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO etc.\" The defendant list includes many US Dept. Also there are individual defendants. We need to ensure all parties listed. Let's analyze the complaint snippet for parties. The complaint appears to list plaintiffs and defendants. But we might not have captured all plaintiff parties. We might have captured 23 from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (maybe those are the plaintiffs). Let's confirm the list:\n\nFrom complaint tokens 500-900, we saw plaintiffs: \"EMPLOYEES, IAM, AFL-CIO;\" etc. The list continues with many names. Let's capture all plaintiffs: starting from \"EMPLOYEES, IAM, AFL-CIO;\" then \"Plaintiffs,\" then \"v.\" then defendants list. The plaintiffs list might include: \"EMPLOYEES, IAM, AFL-CIO;\" but maybe also \"American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO\" etc. But the snippet may not list all. We may need to go further to capture all plaintiffs. The current read only reached tokens 500-900. But we have also read earlier tokens 0-1209, 1498-3030, 5563-5807. These likely include the entire parties list. The snapshot says we have 23 plaintiff values from complaint. That likely covers all plaintiff parties. The docket shows 9 defendant values. Did we capture all defendants? The docket lists many defendants across many appearances. The docket tokens we've read include many \"Notice of Appearance\" with many defendants, but maybe not all. The docket may list all defendants (the 9 U.S. Departments). We have them captured. But there may be other defendants such as individual names or other agencies. The docket includes many attorneys names and associated defendants; but the parties are likely the government departments. So likely we have all parties.\n\nHowever we must verify if any parties appear in other documents: Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Ex Parte Motion. Possibly there are additional parties: e.g., \"American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO\" etc. Those might appear as plaintiffs again. But those are already captured. The docket's other documents may list parties too. But we might have them.\n\nWe need to ensure that the list of parties is complete. But the snapshot says \"Keys with Extracted Values: 32\". The key count is 1; total values extracted 32. There are no empty keys. So we might be done.\n\nBut we need to check if there is any requirement to update the checklist? The snapshot shows the extraction is complete. But we must ensure we haven't missed any parties. For safety, we might run a search for \"Plaintiff:\" or \"Defendant:\" patterns to confirm. But we previously did search for \"Plaintiff:\" and \"Defendant:\" and found no matches. That might be because the document uses different formatting. The parties are listed as names, not preceded by \"Plaintiff:\" text. So our extraction might be correct.\n\nBut maybe the checklist expects each party as separate value. We have 32 values. That seems plausible. Let's double-check the list of parties: 23 plaintiff parties: likely include many union names and individual names. 9 defendant parties: US Department names. That matches 32.\n\nThus we are done. But we need to consider if any keys remain empty: \"Empty Keys: 0/1\" means there is only one key. So we have it filled. So we can stop.\n\nBut we must check if we need to update the list for final consolidation. The snapshot says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\". That implies we have the key filled. But we might need to ensure that the extracted list is finalized. But we have appended values earlier. Did we do any update? The last action was append_checklist? Actually the last action was read_document. There's no subsequent append_checklist. Wait: The last action in the list is Step 17. `read_document` on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (tokens 500-900). After that there is no further action. So we have read more text, but we didn't append the new values from that reading. But the snapshot says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\". That indicates that we had appended values earlier. But after reading new tokens, we might have found new parties. But the snapshot doesn't reflect that. The snapshot indicates the extraction progress: 32 values. That may include the new values from the new read. However we didn't have an append action after Step 17. But the snapshot may have aggregated them already. But it's possible that we still need to append new values from the read. But the snapshot shows 32 values. So maybe the new values were appended automatically? Not possible. So maybe the snapshot is already updated. So we may have all values.\n\nIn any case, the next action could be `stop`. But we need to double-check if any parties remain missing. Let's search in the docket for \"United States Department of\" patterns. We have 9. Are there any more? Possibly \"U.S. Department of Energy\" etc. But the docket may include \"U.S. Department of Energy\" as part of defendants. But we didn't capture that. Let's check the docket snippet lines 8310-8510. There are many names. We saw \"U.S. Department of Energy\" etc. That matches the 9? Actually the docket snippet includes many names: U.S. Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, Marco Rubio, U.S. Department of Defense, Peter Hegseth, U.S. Department of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, etc. That seems more than 9. Wait: The docket snippet shows many names: \"U.S. Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, Marco Rubio, U.S. Department of Defense, Peter Hegseth, U.S. Department of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins, U.S. Department of Justice, Pamela Bondi, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, U.S. Department of the Interior, Doug Burgum, U.S. Department of Energy, Chris Wright, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, U.S. National Science Foundation, Sethuraman Panchanathan, U.S. International Trade Commission, Amy A. Karpel, U.S. General Services Administration, Stephen Ehikian, U.S. Social Security Administration, Leland Dudek, U.S. Department of Labor, Lori Chavez-Deremer, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Scott Turner, U.S. Department of Transportation, Sean Duffy, U.S. Department of Education\". That's many names. But the snapshot says 9 values from docket. So maybe they extracted only 9 department names, ignoring individuals. So those individuals may not be considered parties? But they could be defendants. The docket may list many attorneys and parties. The parties list may include many individuals. So we may have missed some. But the snapshot shows 32 values: 23 from complaint, 9 from docket. That implies they only captured the 9 department names as defendants. But did the complaint include individual defendants? The complaint includes many individual defendants. But they might be captured in the 23 plaintiff list? Wait, the complaint is the one where plaintiffs are unions and defendants are individuals and departments. But the complaint's parties list includes many union names as plaintiffs and many individuals and departments as defendants. But the list of 23 from complaint might be the union names? Actually the complaint's plaintiff list includes 23 union names. The defendant list includes many individuals and departments. But the docket's 9 values might correspond to the 9 Department names. So the total 32 includes 23 plaintiffs and 9 defendants. But there are also individual defendants that are not captured. But those may be considered 'defendants' as well. But maybe the extraction only captured the 9 department defendants because those are the main parties. But the requirement says \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices.\" So we should include all parties: all plaintiffs (union names) and all defendants (individuals and departments). So the 32 might not include all defendants. But the extraction may have omitted individual defendants. But maybe they were not in the docket or complaint? Let's inspect complaint snippet again. It lists plaintiffs: \"EMPLOYEES, IAM, AFL-CIO; ; Plaintiffs,\" etc. Then the defendants list includes many names. The snippet shows \"DONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity as President of the United States; U.S. OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT; CHARLES EZELL, in his official capacity as Acting Director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE; U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT; MARCO RUBIO, in his official capacities as U.S. Secretary of State and Acting Administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE; PETER HEGSETH, in his official capacity as U.S. Secretary of Defense; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY; SCOTT BESSENT, in his official capacity as U.S. Secretary of the Treasury; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS; DOUG COLLINS, in his official capacity as U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE; PAMELA BONDI, in her official capacity as U.S. Attorney General; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., in his official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human Services; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY; KRISTI NOEM, in her official capacity as Secretary of Homeland Security; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTER\". It stops mid-word. So the defendants list includes many individuals and departments. That is a lot more than 9. But the docket only had 9 department names. But there are also individuals. The docket might include many individuals as defendants but they might not be captured. But the extraction may have omitted them. But the snapshot says 32 values. We need to check if we have all parties. Possibly we are missing individuals like \"DONALD J. TRUMP\", \"CHARLES EZELL\", \"PETER HEGSETH\", \"SCOTT BESSENT\", \"DOUG COLLINS\", \"PAMELA BONDI\", \"ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.\" etc. That would add many more values. But the snapshot says 32, which is 23 + 9. That seems correct if we counted only union plaintiffs and 9 departments. But the individuals are missing. So maybe the extraction didn't include them because they are not considered parties? But they are defendants. The requirement says \"Describing each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices\". So we must include individuals as defendants. So we might need to continue extraction to capture them. But the snapshot indicates that we've extracted 32 values. But maybe those 32 include 23 plaintiffs (union names) and 9 defendants (individual names). Let's check the docket list: 9 values from docket: likely those individuals? Wait the docket list earlier gave 9: \"U.S. Department of Education\", \"Department of Health and Human Services\", etc. Actually the docket list snippet shows 9 values: \"U.S. Department of Education\", \"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\", \"U.S. Department of Homeland Security\", \"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\", \"U.S. Department of the Interior\", \"U.S. Department of Justice\", \"U.S. Department of Labor\", \"U.S. Department of Transportation\", \"U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\". Those are the 9 department names. So those are the defendants. So the individuals are missing. So we need to capture them.\n\nBut maybe the individuals are also captured in the complaint, but we didn't count them. Let's count: In complaint snippet, there are 7 individuals: Donald J. Trump, Charles Ezell, Peter Hegseth, Scott Bessent, Doug Collins, Pamela Bondi, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Kristi Noem. Actually that's 8 individuals. And we also have the US departments. The complaint snippet stops mid-word. So the defendants list includes those individuals plus departments. So we need to capture them. But the current extracted list likely didn't include them. So we need to continue extraction.\n\nThus we should search for \"Donald J. Trump\" etc. But we need to identify all defendants. We can search the complaint for \"President of the United States\" etc. But maybe easier: Search for \"in his official capacity as\" pattern. But we can just read the complaint from tokens 500-900, but we already did. We need to find the entire defendants list. The complaint likely continues beyond token 900. We need to read more tokens to capture the rest of the defendants list. We need to read further tokens until the end of defendants list. The list might end around token 2000. We can read from 900-1500. Let's read from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 900-1500. That should capture the rest of the defendants list until maybe token 1500. That covers the rest of the snippet we saw earlier. So we can read that range. Then we will extract the parties. We need to append new values.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 900-1500. Then we will parse for parties. But we must ensure we don't duplicate values. We need to compare to existing ones. The existing list includes 23 plaintiff values (likely union names) and 9 department values. We need to add individuals. Let's read.\n\nAlso, we might need to capture union plaintiffs list: we have 23? Let's confirm if we captured all union names. The complaint snippet from tokens 500-900 included union names like \"EMPLOYEES, IAM, AFL-CIO;\". But there may be more union names later. But we might have captured them all earlier. But we can read 0-200 to capture the union names at the start. But we already read 0-1209 earlier, which includes that. So we probably have all union names. So we just need to capture defendants individuals.\n\nThus next action: read_document Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 900-1500.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":900,\"end_token\":1500}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 900, "end_token": 1500}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11175, "completion_tokens": 3229, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The current status says Keys with Values: 1/1. So all keys have values? Checklist only has one key: Who_are_the_Parties. It says 32 values extracted. Any missing? We should verify completeness. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have 32 values: 23 from Complaint, 9 from Docket. Are we confident we captured all parties? There might be other documents with parties: Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Ex Parte Motion etc. Could include parties. But maybe parties appear only in Complaint and Docket. The Docket lists parties as defendants and plaintiffs in notices. Those 9 likely captured. But maybe there are also parties in Order documents. Let's consider if any parties appear in Order or Order Re Preliminary Injunction or Ex Parte Motion. Quick glance: order documents maybe mention parties. But we haven't read them fully. Might need to search for \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" in those documents. But the earlier search for \"Plaintiff:\" and \"Defendant:\" didn't find matches. We searched for \"Plaintiff:\" pattern earlier and found none. But the Docket might contain party lists. The Complaint's parties are all listed. The Docket shows many parties. The Opposing parties might be the US government, but likely listed as defendants. The Order documents may mention parties like \"United States\" or \"Department of X\". But those are part of petitioners/demands. However, the checklist expects each party description. We already have many.\n\nWe need to ensure we have all distinct parties. Did we capture \"United States\" as a party? In Complaint, the defendants include many US departments and officials. Those are listed. They appear under defendants. We captured them in 23 from Complaint.\n\nBut we might have missed \"U.S. Department of Labor\" etc. The 23 values probably include all. But we need to verify. Let's examine the 23 values from Complaint: They include a list of plaintiffs: \"Employees, IAM, AFL-CIO\", \"Plaintiffs\" maybe. The 23 values may include all plaintiffs and defendants. But let's double-check the 23 count: The appended 23 likely includes each unique party: Plaintiffs: Employees, IAM, AFL-CIO; the union groups? Actually the Complaint lists \"Employees, IAM, AFL-CIO\" as plaintiffs. Then defendants: Donald J. Trump; Office of Personnel Management; Charles Ezell; Department of State; Foreign agencies; etc. Likely all 23 parties.\n\nBut the question: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Might need to capture all parties across all documents, but we have a comprehensive list from Complaint and Docket. However, there may be parties in Order documents not captured. But those orders might refer to same parties. Potentially order documents mention \"United States\" as subject. But not sure.\n\nGiven we have 32 values (23+9). That seems plausible.\n\nWe should verify no party duplicates across documents: duplicates are allowed? The requirement: \"Create separate entries for each unique value\". So duplicates across documents should be only one entry. But we appended 23 and 9 separately. But maybe duplicates exist, e.g., \"U.S. Department of State\" appears in both Complaint and Docket. But we need unique entries. Should we remove duplicates? The extraction process probably expects duplicates not repeated. But the appended values may include duplicates. We need to confirm.\n\nLet's check duplicates: In Complaint, we have U.S. Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, U.S. Department of Defense, etc. In Docket, we have many parties including \"U.S. Department of State\", \"U.S. Department of Transportation\", etc. So duplicates exist. We need to deduplicate.\n\nThus we need to consolidate unique values. The current extracted list may contain duplicates. We need to update the checklist to contain unique entries only.\n\nThus next action: Use update_checklist to replace the entire list with unique values. We need to provide evidence for each unique value. So we need to compile a list of unique parties with evidence. We have evidence from Complaint and Docket. We need to provide for each unique value.\n\nWe need to produce evidence: For each value, include text snippet and source and location. We need to gather evidence for each unique party. We have many. We need to compile all distinct parties.\n\nLet's list distinct parties from Complaint:\n\nFrom snippet tokens 500-1500, we saw:\n\n- Employees, IAM, AFL-CIO (plaintiff)\n- Donald J. Trump (defendant)\n- Office of Personnel Management (defendant)\n- Charles Ezell (defendant)\n- Department of State (defendant)\n- U.S. Agency for International Development (defendant)\n- Marco Rubio (defendant)\n- Peter Hegseth (defendant)\n- The Treasury (defendant) maybe \"U.S. Treasury\"\n- Scott Bessent (defendant)\n- Veterans Affairs (defendant) - \"U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\"\n- Doug Collins (defendant)\n- Department of Justice (defendant)\n- Pamela Bondi (defendant)\n- Health and Human Services (defendant)\n- Kenneth Jr. (defendant)\n- Homeland Security (defendant)\n- Kristi Noem (defendant)\n- Interior (defendant)\n- Energy (defendant)\n- Chris Wright (defendant)\n- Agriculture (defendant)\n- Brooke Rollins (defendant)\n- Environmental Protection Agency (defendant)\n- National Science Foundation (defendant)\n- Sethuraman Panchanathan (defendant)\n- International Trade Commission (defendant)\n- Amy A. Karpel (defendant)\n- General Services Administration (defendant)\n- Stephen Ehikian (defendant)\n- Social Security Administration (defendant)\n- Leland Duder (defendant) maybe \"Leland Dudek\"\n- Labor (defendant)\n- Housing and Urban Development (defendant)\n- Scott Turner (defendant)\n- Transportation (defendant)\n- Education (defendant)\n- Linda McMahon (defendant)\n\nAlso maybe \"U.S. Office of Personnel Management\" already included.\n\nWe should also include \"United States\" as a party? But not necessary.\n\nFrom Docket, we have many parties; some duplicates. Let's review the Docket snippet: Many parties appear in Notices of Appearance. They include:\n\n- National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United\n- American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO\n- American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO\n- Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO\n- National Association of Government Employees, Inc.\n- National Federation of Federal Employees, IAM\n- American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (duplicate)\n- etc.\n\nAlso many individual names: John Beed, Charles Blanchard, Mary DeRosa, Gordon Gray, J. Michael Luttig, Mara Rudman, Suzanne Spaulding, Bar Association of the District of Columbia.\n\nAlso many US Department names again.\n\nThus unique parties include many union organizations and individuals, plus US departments.\n\nThus unique list will be larger than 32. But the current extracted list is 32 values; that seems too low if many union orgs and individuals. Likely the 32 values were only parties captured from Complaint and Docket but not all duplicates removed. But maybe we only extracted 23 from Complaint and 9 from Docket, but that may not cover all union orgs. Wait, the 9 from Docket include many union orgs? Let's check the Docket snippet of tokens 3363-5000: It shows many union organizations listed. That snippet had 9 values? But the snippet includes many union orgs. But the append_checklist added 9 values; maybe they captured union orgs: \"American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO\", \"National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United\", \"National Association of Government Employees, Inc.\", \"National Federation of Federal Employees, IAM\", etc. But the snippet also had multiple others. But we only got 9 values. So maybe many parties were missing.\n\nThus we need to revisit and ensure all distinct parties are extracted. We need to search again for party names in all documents. We should search for \"United States\" or \"U.S.\" maybe. But we want parties. Could search for patterns like \"Department of\" or \"Agency\". But that could be many.\n\nSimpler: Search for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" maybe not sufficient. Instead search for \"United States\" etc. But the best approach: use search_document_regex for pattern \"United States\" or \"U\\.S\\.\"? But we need to capture all parties. Might be easier to search for \"Department of\" pattern to capture all departments.\n\nBut we have many documents; we can search across all.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Department of [A-Za-z ]+\" or \"Agency\". But might capture many tokens but we need to extract distinct parties. But the search will give matches with context. We can then read them.\n\nBut the instruction says we should only issue one action. Next action should be to search for parties. So I'd choose search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Department of [A-Za-z ]+\" or maybe \"Agency\". But we need distinct values. We might also search for \"Agency\" or \"Office of\". But many.\n\nAlternatively, search for \"United States\" pattern might capture \"United States\" mentions, but we likely already have those.\n\nBut the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to list all parties. There are many. This will be a large list.\n\nGiven we have 32 values currently, but likely missing many.\n\nThus we need to expand extraction. We should search for pattern \"United States\" maybe includes \"United States\" as party? But not necessary.\n\nBetter: search for \"Department of\" pattern: \"Department of [A-Za-z ]+\".\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Department of [A-Za-z ]+\" and also \"Agency\".\n\nBut we can only make one call. We can include multiple doc_names? We can search all docs by doc_name=\"all\". Provide pattern. Provide flags? Use IGNORECASE. Provide top_k maybe 20. But we need all matches across docs; we might need multiple calls. But we can first search for \"Department of\" to capture many.\n\nBut we need to extract distinct parties; duplicates ok but we can later deduplicate.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Department of [A-Za-z ]+\".\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n  \"pattern\": \"Department of [A-Za-z ]+\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 20,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Department of [A-Za-z ]+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11483, "completion_tokens": 2310, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

All values extracted thus far? We have 32 values for Who_are_the_Parties, from Complaint and Docket. Is there any other parties missing? Might be from other documents: Order, Order Re Preliminary Injunction, Ex Parte Motion. We need to extract all distinct party descriptions. So far we have extracted those from Complaint and Docket. But maybe parties also appear in other documents: Order, Order Re Preliminary, Ex Parte. We need to search those. The doc catalog shows 5 docs. We have partially visited all but not fully. We need to check if any new party names appear in those other docs that are not in complaint/docket. For example, Order and Order Re Preliminary might list parties too. But likely same parties. However, we should verify. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to ensure all distinct values. There may be duplicates across docs; we should only include unique ones. We have 32 entries. But maybe some parties not captured in complaint/docket? The Docket includes many defendants and plaintiffs (like federal departments). The Complaint lists many. The Order may include the same. But we should search Order and Order Re Preliminary for any new parties. To be safe, let's search for pattern \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" in Order and Order Re Preliminary. But the system previously used regex to search for \"Plaintiff:\" and \"Defendant:\" but not found. However, that's for the header format. But actual parties are listed as lines like \"Plaintiff: [Name]\"? In the Complaint, parties are listed as a list of plaintiffs and defendants but not in \"Plaintiff:\" format. They appear in a block: \"Plaintiffs:\" then names. So to find parties, we might search for \"Plaintiffs\" and \"Defendants\" headings. But we already extracted from Complaint. But maybe Order also has a \"Plaintiffs\" heading with same list. That would duplicate. But we need to check if any parties appear only in Order docs and not in Complaint. Could be new parties like \"United States Department of the Treasury\" etc. But those are in Complaint. So likely no new distinct parties.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure we have all unique parties. The 32 values may already cover all. But we need to confirm no missing parties.\n\nLet's examine the list of 32 values: 23 from Complaint, 9 from Docket. The Docket may include some parties that are not in Complaint? The Docket includes many defendants like \"United States Department of State\", \"U.S. Department of Labor\", etc. The Complaint lists those as defendants. So duplicates.\n\nBut maybe the Docket includes \"United States Department of Treasury\" etc. The Complaint includes those too. So duplicates.\n\nThus maybe 32 values cover all distinct parties. But we should ensure if any new party appears in Order or Order Re Preliminary. We can search for \"United States Department of\" etc. But that might be duplicates.\n\nBetter approach: search for \"Defendant\" heading in Order docs. But we don't have full content. We can search with regex pattern \"Defendants\" in Order. Let's do search_document_regex on Order for pattern \"Defendants\". Also search for \"Plaintiffs\" in Order. And same for Order Re Preliminary. Also search for \"United States Department\" in Order. But we need to limit context tokens.\n\nGiven we only need to confirm no missing parties, we can search for any party names that are not yet extracted. But easier: just search for pattern \"United States Department\" in Order and Order Re Preliminary to see if any new departments appear. But likely the same.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"Department of\" because many. But we already have many.\n\nBetter: maybe the Order includes \"National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United\" etc. Already in Complaint.\n\nThus maybe nothing new.\n\nBut the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" The system might expect we cover all. So we need to confirm no missing. So we should search Order and Order Re Preliminary for any party names not already extracted. We can search for pattern \"United States Department of\" to see if any appear. But if duplicates, no new.\n\nLet's search for \"United States Department of\" in Order and Order Re Preliminary documents. Use search_document_regex with doc_names list.\n\nWe'll list doc_names: \"Order\", \"Order Re Preliminary Injunction\". Use pattern \"United States Department of [A-Za-z ]+\" maybe.

Let's check if there are parties in those documents not captured. The parties list likely includes plaintiffs (unions) and defendants (Donald J. Trump, etc). The docket might have list of parties. Order Re Preliminary Injunction includes defendants list. The order also? The order may list parties. Ex Parte Motion may have parties.

But the docket may list \"Plaintiff\", \"Defendant\" lines. The 9 from Docket probably include union names, etc. But maybe the docket also lists the defendants (Trump, etc). We need to verify.\n\nAlso the Order Re Preliminary Injunction had match with defendants list. That might have been captured in the 32 values.

That totals 32. The docket might include some of the others. But let's check: The docket coverage includes token ranges 3044-5037, 5255-5455, etc. That includes some parties. But maybe the docket also has a list of defendants (Trump, etc). The 9 from Docket might include union names but not the presidential defendants? Let's examine the docket content.
