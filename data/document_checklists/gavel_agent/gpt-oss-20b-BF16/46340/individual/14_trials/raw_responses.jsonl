We have seen some matches in Order Re Preliminary Injunction. The snippet shows an expedited trial date will be set in a separate order. Also in the second match near tokens 19815-19991, there is a mention of a joint case management statement due by July 10, 2025, and trial date. That snippet seems incomplete due to formatting, but we have a date: June 24, 2025 docket order for trial? Actually it's an order, not a trial date. But we need to extract trial information: scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, rulings. We need to look at other documents for trial info. The Complaint might have trial dates? Let's search for \"trial\" in Complaint. Already searched and found 0 matches. But maybe \"trial date\" pattern didn't show. Let's search again for \"trial\" in Complaint more broadly. Also search in Docket. Already search found 0 matches. Order (the other Order) may have trial info? Search \"trial\" in Order. None. Ex Parte Motion maybe no trial. So likely only Order Re Preliminary Injunction has trial info. We need to extract distinct values: likely \"expedited trial date will be set in a separate order\" (not a date). Also \"joint case management statement is due by July 10, 2025\" - that indicates schedule. Also the order is dated June 24, 2025. The snippet indicates maybe a trial scheduled? Let's read more around the earlier match tokens 1290-1496. That match includes \"until trial. An expedited trial date will be set in a separate order.\" So not a date. But we may need to capture that. But the instruction: \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" So we need to capture scheduling (dates), proceedings (like hearing?), outcomes/rulings. The snippet shows a scheduled trial date will be set separately. Could be considered \"trial date to be set\". Also the case management statement due July 10, 2025 indicates schedule.\n\nWe may need to read more around the second match tokens 19800-19990: we saw the order is dated June 24, 2025; it's an order about the trial date? Let's read more around the earlier part of that order earlier tokens. It said \"at 10:00 a.m., in Courtroom 11, San Francisco. A joint case management statement is due by July 10, 2025. The case management statement should contain an expedited proposed schedule and trial date.\" That indicates trial date to be in the statement. That is scheduling info. So we can extract at least two entries: \"Trial date to be set in a separate order\" (pending) and \"Trial date to be in the case management statement due July 10, 2025\" or \"Joint case management statement due July 10, 2025.\" We might need to extract the actual date? Not present. We may note that trial date is not yet set.\n\nAlso we might consider the order's date of June 24, 2025 as the order date for the trial scheduling. Could be considered part of trial info.\n\nThus we can append two entries.\n\nBut need evidence for each: the text snippet and location.\n\nWe have evidence from match 1 (tokens 1290-1490) and match 3 (tokens 19815-19991). Let's capture those as evidence. For match 3, we saw the snippet with date and details. We'll include that snippet.\n\nLet's craft append_checklist with key \"Trials\" and extracted entries.\n\nWe need to list each value. The value could be a descriptive string like \"Expedited trial date will be set in a separate order.\" and \"Trial date to be included in case management statement due July 10, 2025.\"\n\nWe'll provide evidence for each.\n\nLet's generate the function call.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Trials\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Expedited trial date will be set in a separate order.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"until trial.

Need to check other documents for trials. We have 5 documents. We have partially visited Order Re Preliminary Injunction, but read only tokens 1290-1496 and 19800-19991. There might be trial info elsewhere, like in Complaint, Docket, Order, Ex Parte Motion.\n\nWe should search for \"trial\" in other documents. We used search_document_regex on all docs earlier and found only matches in Order Re Preliminary Injunction. But maybe the search didn't find others because pattern maybe too generic? But earlier step 5 and 6 were search_document_regex on Order and Docket and found none. Step 12 search_document_regex on Complaint found none. So likely no \"trial\" in others. But maybe the word \"trial\" appears in docket or other. But earlier we searched all docs and found only 3 matches in Order Re Preliminary Injunction. That suggests no other trial mentions.\n\nThus Trials key is likely complete. But we should double-check if there could be trial info in other documents. Maybe the docket includes a trial date? Search again with pattern \"trial\" across all docs: earlier got 3 matches only. That likely covers all.\n\nThus we can stop. But we need to ensure that we haven't missed any trial info. Are there other trial related info like \"trial date\" etc. We have two extracted values: expedited trial date set in separate order, and trial date to be included in joint case management statement due July 10, 2025. Those are the only two.\n\nThus we should stop. Let's do get_checklist to confirm? Not necessary if we trust. But to be safe, we can get the checklist for Trials to verify values. But the rule: must issue one function call. We can stop directly. But we need to ensure no missing. The prior step 13 appended both values. So we have 2 values. The key is complete.

We have 5 documents. We found trial info in Order Re Preliminary Injunction. But there might be other documents with trial info, e.g., the Complaint, Docket, Order, or Motion. We need to search across them. The prior steps didn't search for trial in Complaint, Docket, Order, Motion. The last search was only on all documents but maybe only matched Order Re Preliminary Injunction. But the search results might have been limited to those documents that had matches. Probably other documents have no trial statements, but we need to confirm.\n\nWe should do a search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"trial date\" or \"trial\" again, but maybe the earlier search didn't include all doc types? It did search all documents. It found matches only in Order Re Preliminary Injunction. So likely other documents have no trial info. But maybe there is other trial info in the Order (some other order). We should double-check. Let's search again for \"trial\" across all documents. But to avoid redundant reading, we can do search_document_regex again. There's no rule about not repeating search, but we should check if we may get same results. But we can proceed to confirm no other trial info. So next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"trial\" with flags IGNORECASE, MULTILINE maybe. Then we can confirm no matches. But if there are still matches, we need to read them.\n\nThus action: search_document_regex doc_name=\"all\", pattern \"trial\" maybe with IGNORECASE, top_k maybe 5. But we should include context tokens maybe 200. That will give us matches. Then we can decide to read them if any. So next step: search_document_regex.\n\nWe must pick exact action.

We already have 2 values extracted from Order Re Preliminary Injunction. But we need to check all documents for any trial information. Documents: Complaint, Docket, Order, Ex Parte Motion. We need to search across all documents for trial info. The prior searches only targeted 'trial' and found matches only in Order Re Preliminary Injunction. But maybe other documents have trial info not captured? We should search all documents again for 'trial', maybe context like \"trial date\", \"trial will be held\", etc. We can do a search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"trial\" or \"trial date\" again, but we did earlier. But maybe the Complaint or Docket may have \"trial\" but earlier search did not find because maybe the pattern was too generic? But we already did search_document_regex for 'trial' across all documents and it returned only matches in Order Re Preliminary Injunction. So likely no other document contains 'trial' as a word. But there could be \"Trial\" capitalized or \"trial\" in the docket. The search should catch all occurrences. But maybe the docket uses \"trial\" but not found? But we searched all documents for pattern \"trial\" and got 3 matches in Order Re Preliminary Injunction only. So no other trial references.\n\nBut maybe \"Trial\" could appear in the Order or Ex Parte Motion. But search didn't find. So likely no trial info. But we must confirm that the other documents have no trial info. We could do a targeted search for 'trial' in each unvisited document. But the search_document_regex can search all documents; we saw no matches. So it's safe to conclude no other trial info.\n\nThus the Checklist key Trials is fully extracted with 2 values. No Not Applicable needed. So we should stop.\n\nBut before stopping, must ensure no missing values: The rule says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have 2 values found. We should double-check that there aren't other trial info like \"expedited trial date will be set\" etc. The two values we extracted: \"Expedited trial date will be set in a separate order.\" and \"Trial date to be included in the joint case management statement due July 10, 2025.\" Those are distinct. Are there any other trial statements? Maybe the docket or other documents mention \"trial\" as part of \"trial date\" or \"trial will not be held\" etc. But we searched all and found none.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nWe need to output JSON with decision: stop, reason: all trial-related info extracted.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All trial-related information has been extracted from the available documents.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All trial-related information has been extracted from the available documents.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4046, "completion_tokens": 575, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
