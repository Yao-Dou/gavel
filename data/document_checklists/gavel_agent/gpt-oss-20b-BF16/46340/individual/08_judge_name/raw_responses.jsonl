Let's search again for \"Judge\" pattern across remaining unvisited documents: Order (full) and Motion. The search earlier on Order found 0 matches for pattern \"Judge...\" maybe because the order didn't mention judge. But maybe the Order has judge name at bottom or top. So we might need to read.

So only judge name is James Donato.\n\nBut we should confirm if any other judge appears in any other documents not yet visited: Order and Ex Parte Motion. Maybe those documents have no judge name. But we should search them.\n\nWe can search all documents again to confirm. Use search_document_regex on all documents. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8505, "completion_tokens": 453, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Only James Donato appears. But we need to confirm no other judges. The search results show many matches for Judge James Donato. Also maybe Judge James Donato appears in other docs. We saw only James Donato. There's no other judge in the corpus. We might need to verify other documents like Order, Ex Parte Motion, etc. But search regex already covered all docs. It found 12 matches, all James Donato. No other judge names.\n\nThus we should finalize with update_checklist? The key already has 1 value. But we need to ensure completeness: maybe the earlier append added only one value. That is correct. We should not update because we already have value. But we need to check if any duplicates or missing. Since only James Donato, we can stop. Ensure that we didn't miss any other judge names. The search results in all docs did not show any other names. So we can stop.\n\nThus we should output stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All distinct judge names (James Donato) have been extracted with evidence; no other judge names appear in the corpus.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct judge names (James Donato) have been extracted with evidence; no other judge names appear in the corpus.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10951, "completion_tokens": 246, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
