We need to extract all distinct filing dates. The matches:\n\nComplaint: \"Filed 04/03/25\"\nDocket: \"Filed by ... (Filed on 4/3/2025)\" also earlier \"2025-04-03\" entries.\nEx Parte Motion: \"Filed 04/07/25\"\nOrder Re Preliminary: \"Filed 06/24/25\"\nOrder: unclear; the snippet shows something like \"CASE: 25-4014, 08/01/2025\" but that's not a filing date; could be docket entry? The snippet shows \"FILED\" but not explicit filing date. But we should read more context to confirm.\n\nAll filing dates appear to be in 2025: 04/03/25, 04/07/25, 06/24/25, 08/01/2025 maybe? But we need to confirm if 08/01/2025 is filing date or other. Could be date of case. The snippet: \"Case: 25-4014, 08/01/2025, DktEntry: 32.1, Page 1 of 15\". That seems like a docket entry date for the Order; but the Order may have been filed earlier. We might need to scroll to see if there's a \"Filed\" line. The snippet shows \"FILED\" but no date. Might be further in the order. Might be a filing date for the Order. But we need to confirm.\n\nGiven we have matches, we can extract the distinct dates: 04/03/25 (maybe 2025-04-03), 04/07/25, 06/24/25, and maybe 08/01/2025 (if filing date). But we should verify. The \"Case: 25-4014, 08/01/2025\" appears to be the docket entry date for the Order, likely the filing date. So include.\n\nThus we need to append these values to Filing_Date. We must include evidence: the exact text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe need to read the documents to get the full evidence. But we already have snippet context from search. But we need to provide location (page, section). The snippet includes \"Page 1 of 44\" etc. We can use that. Use evidence from snippet. We need to confirm date formats: \"04/03/25\" vs \"2025-04-03\". We should extract the date exactly as text? The requirement: \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So we should standardize? The extracted value is a string. We can use the exact snippet or maybe convert to a standard format. But guidelines didn't specify format. We can use the snippet.\n\nThus we will append 4 entries. Use append_checklist with patch for Filing_Date.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each. Provide text snippet and location. For each, we can use snippet from search results.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. Complaint: \"Filed 04/03/25\" on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, page 1 of 44. We can use tokens 0-109 snippet. Provide location: \"Page 1 of 44\".\n\n2. Docket: \"Filed on 4/3/2025\" on Docket. Location: page 1? The snippet shows \"None | 2025-04-03 | Notice...\" etc. But we can use the snippet.\n\n3. Ex Parte Motion: \"Filed 04/07/25\" page 1 of 7.\n\n4. Order Re Preliminary: \"Filed 06/24/25\" page 1 of 29.\n\n5. Order: \"Case: 25-4014, 08/01/2025\" maybe indicating filing date. Provide evidence.\n\nWe need to confirm if 08/01/2025 is indeed filing date. It may be the docket entry date for the Order. Usually a docket entry includes date the order was filed. So likely yes.\n\nThus we need to append 5 entries.\n\nBut we must avoid duplicates: 04/03/25 appears twice (Complaint and Docket). Only one unique value. Should we include both? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct values, so we should include each unique date: 04/03/25, 04/07/25, 06/24/25, 08/01/2025. So 4 entries.\n\nThus we will append 4 entries: 04/03/25, 04/07/25, 06/24/25, 08/01/2025.\n\nWe need evidence for each. Provide snippet text, source_document, location.\n\nWe will use evidence from search snippet. For 04/03/25: snippet shows \"Filed 04/03/25\" in complaint. For Docket, snippet shows \"Filed on 4/3/2025\" - same date but different format. Should we treat as same date? Yes, same date but different representation. The distinct value is date but representation might be considered distinct? The instruction: \"distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct by calendar date, not representation. So we only need one entry for that date. But we could choose representation from complaint: \"04/03/25\". But we should also provide evidence showing it's the same date. But the value can be \"2025-04-03\" or \"04/03/25\". We should pick one. Let's use \"2025-04-03\" as standard. But evidence shows \"Filed 04/03/25\". But we can provide evidence that includes both.\n\nThus for 04/03/25 we can use snippet from complaint and also from docket. But we can provide two evidence entries for same value.\n\nBetter: Provide evidence from complaint snippet: \"Case 4:25-cv-03070 ... Filed 04/03/25 ...\". And from docket snippet: \"None | 2025-04-03 | Notice of Appearance...\" etc. So include both.\n\nFor 04/07/25: snippet from Ex Parte Motion: \"Filed 04/07/25\".\n\nFor 06/24/25: snippet from Order Re Preliminary: \"Filed 06/24/25\".\n\nFor 08/01/2025: snippet from Order: \"Case: 25-4014, 08/01/2025, DktEntry: 32.1\".\n\nThus we will append.\n\nThus call append_checklist with patch: key Filing_Date, extracted entries for each value with evidence list.\n\nLet's produce that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"patch\":[{\"key\":\"Filing_Date\",\"extracted\":[{\"value\":\"2025-04-03\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"Case 4:25-cv-03070     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 1 of 44\",\"source_document\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"location\":\"Page 1 of 44\"},{\"text\":\"None | 2025-04-03 | Notice of Appearance/Substitution/Change/Withdrawal of Attorney\",\"source_document\":\"Docket\",\"location\":\"Page 1 of 17,139\"}]},{\"value\":\"2025-04-07\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD     Document 15     Filed 04/07/25     Page 1 of 7\",\"source_document\":\"Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause\",\"location\":\"Page 1 of 7\"}]},{\"value\":\"2025-06-24\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD     Document 60     Filed 06/24/25     Page 1 of 29\",\"source_document\":\"Order Re Preliminary Injunction\",\"location\":\"Page 1 of 29\"}]},{\"value\":\"2025-08-01\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"Case: 25-4014, 08/01/2025, DktEntry: 32.1, Page 1 of 15\",\"source_document\":\"Order\",\"location\":\"Page 1 of 15\"}]}]}]}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "2025-04-03", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 4:25-cv-03070     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 1 of 44", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 1 of 44"}, {"text": "None | 2025-04-03 | Notice of Appearance/Substitution/Change/Withdrawal of Attorney", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Page 1 of 17,139"}]}, {"value": "2025-04-07", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD     Document 15     Filed 04/07/25     Page 1 of 7", "source_document": "Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause", "location": "Page 1 of 7"}]}, {"value": "2025-06-24", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD     Document 60     Filed 06/24/25     Page 1 of 29", "source_document": "Order Re Preliminary Injunction", "location": "Page 1 of 29"}]}, {"value": "2025-08-01", "evidence": [{"text": "Case: 25-4014, 08/01/2025, DktEntry: 32.1, Page 1 of 15", "source_document": "Order", "location": "Page 1 of 15"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3634, "completion_tokens": 1763, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Potentially more filing dates in other docket entries, e.g., later docket entries might show other filing dates. We should search again for \"Filed\" pattern across all documents, but we already did that and got 5 matches across 5 documents. But maybe there are more matches beyond those first 5 in each doc? The search returned 5 total matches; maybe each doc had only one match. But there could be more within same doc but not captured by search? The search results show only 5 matches total. So likely no more filing dates. However, we should confirm that we didn't miss any other document types like \"Order\" might have filing date for a different case? But \"Order\" had \"08/01/2025\". That matches.\n\nThus extraction complete. The checklist has only Filing_Date key. It has 4 distinct values extracted. All keys filled. So can stop.

The search found matches in all documents. But we need to ensure there are no other filing dates hidden further in documents beyond the initial 109 tokens etc. Since we have partial coverage of each document, maybe more filing dates exist later. But the filing date is the date the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court. We might have multiple documents that reference filing dates (e.g., docket entry may show filing date; but docket includes multiple entries with same date). The filing date should be the initial complaint date. The complaint shows filed 04/03/25. The docket shows the same date. Ex Parte Motion shows 04/07/25, but that is a subsequent filing. The order re preliminary injunction shows 06/24/25 (later). The order shows 08/01/25 (later). But is the filing date the first filing? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need all distinct filing dates. That includes all filing dates across documents. So we have 5 distinct dates? Actually we have 4 distinct dates; but check if 04/03/25 appears twice (complaint and docket). We have 04/07/25, 06/24/25, 08/01/25. That's 4 unique dates. So extraction is complete.\n\nHowever, we must ensure no other dates exist in the documents beyond those initial windows. The docket may have many entries, but we already captured the filing date from the docket. The docket snippet included \"None | 2025-04-03 | Notice...\" but there may be earlier docket entries? The docket may include the initial filing at the top. So likely no other filing dates.\n\nWe also must ensure we have evidence for each entry. In the prior append_checklist, we included evidence from each document. However, the evidence includes text snippet but not location. It includes token offsets? The evidence from step 3 includes location like \"Page 1 of 44\". The evidence likely includes source_document and location. It may be considered valid. But we need to confirm no missing evidence. The evidence list had 4 entries for 4 dates. That seems fine.\n\nWe should verify that no other filing dates exist in the documents beyond the matches found. We could search again for pattern \"Filed\" with more contexts. But we already searched all docs and found 5 matches. That matches each doc's first line. But maybe there could be other \"Filed\" statements later. But unlikely. But to be safe, we could search again for \"Filed\" across all documents. But the search already found 5 matches. The search results were from each doc's first line. If there were other \"Filed\" statements further, the search would have found them. But we limited top_k=5? The search_document_regex default top_k=5, so if there were more matches beyond 5, it might not capture them. But we only had 5 matches because there were 5 docs. But there could be more matches in same doc. But default top_k per document is 5. In each doc, there might be more \"Filed\" matches. But we didn't see others. But we didn't set top_k high enough, but the search may have found only the first 5 matches across all docs. The docs could have more \"Filed\" statements, but we didn't get them. We should increase top_k to 20 or so to cover all. But the requirement: We need to extract every filing date. So we need to ensure no missed dates.\n\nBetter action: search again with top_k=20, pattern \"Filed\\b.*\\d{1,2}[/-]\\d{1,2}[/-]\\d{2,4}\". Use doc_name=\"all\". That will return up to 20 matches per doc. That will show if any other matches exist. Then we can verify and append any new ones. So we should call search_document_regex with top_k=20.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Filed\\\\b.*\\\\d{1,2}[/-]\\\\d{1,2}[/-]\\\\d{2,4}\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Filed\\b.*\\d{1,2}[/-]\\d{1,2}[/-]\\d{2,4}", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4215, "completion_tokens": 971, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

That's 4 values. The state says Keys with Values: 1/1 (so only Filing_Date). Empty Keys: 0/1. Not Applicable: 0/1. Total values 4. Documents in corpus 5. The search earlier found 67 matches but we only appended 4. Are there possibly more filing dates? Let's consider if other documents have filing dates. The search results gave multiple matches per document, but many are the same date repeated across pages. But could there be other filing dates? The complaint is filed 04/03/25. The docket shows 2025-04-03, also maybe 2025-04-03 appears multiple times. The Ex Parte Motion filed 04/07/25. Order Re Preliminary Injunction filed 06/24/25. Order (court of appeals) filed 08/01/2025. That's 4. Are there any other filing dates in other documents? The docket might have other entries: The search result mention 2025-04-03 and maybe other docket entries. The docket search matches: \"None | 2025-04-03 | Notice...\" and maybe others. But maybe docket also includes other dates for filings of orders, etc. But the filing date is the date lawsuit was first filed. That is typically the complaint date, 04/03/25. The question: \"Extract the filing date from the legal documents. Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need all distinct filing dates across documents. We have 4 distinct dates. Are there any other distinct dates that might be filing dates? Possibly the docket may include other filing dates for other documents (like orders, etc.). But the filing date refers to the lawsuit initiation date. But they might consider each separate filing? The instruction says \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" That suggests only the complaint date. But we already have 04/03/25. But they found 4 unique dates due to multiple documents, but maybe they are not all filing dates for the lawsuit. However, the instruction is to extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So if there are other distinct dates that reflect filing date in any document, we must include them. The docket entries show 2025-04-03. Ex Parte Motion shows 04/07/25 (but that is a filing of a motion, not the lawsuit initiation). But the instruction says first filed/initiated. So maybe only 04/03/25. But the previous step appended all four dates, implying they treat each date as a filing date. But maybe we need to correct? However, the prior step appended 4 dates. The current state shows 4 values. The next action: likely to confirm if any other dates exist. We might search for \"Filed\" pattern again but maybe other documents have other dates. But the search already found many matches. The search result includes 20 matches for Complaint, 20 for Docket, 7 for Ex Parte, 20 for Order Re Preliminary, etc. But each match shows same date repeated. Likely no other distinct dates. But to be safe, we could search for \"Filed\" again for other documents, but we already did. We might search for \"Filed\" pattern again but maybe we should search for \"Filed\" in the Order document. But we already saw 08/01/2025. Maybe other orders have different dates. But the order (court of appeals) filed 08/01/2025. That is a different filing date. That may not be the lawsuit initiation date but still a filing date. The instruction says \"date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So maybe only one date. But the prior step appended 4. That might be wrong. But we must follow the instructions to extract all distinct values. The instruction does not say to restrict to the first filing. It says \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So only the filing date of the complaint. But we have 04/03/25. The other dates are for other filings, not the first filing. But they are still filing dates but not the first. So maybe they shouldn't be included. However, the prior step appended 4 values, which might be considered incorrect. But the system hasn't told us to correct that. But we could revise. But the instruction now: \"Extract the filing date from the legal documents.\" So we should provide the filing date of the lawsuit. So we should set the extracted list to just [\"2025-04-03\"].\n\nThus we need to update the checklist for Filing_Date, replacing the 4 values with just 1 value. We must provide evidence for the date. We have evidence from Complaint: \"Case 4:25-cv-03070     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25\". And from Docket maybe \"2025-04-03\". We should use these. So we will use update_checklist with key Filing_Date, extracted list with one entry value \"2025-04-03\" with evidence from Complaint and Docket. That will replace the 4. But is that allowed? We need to replace entire extracted list. Yes.\n\nThus we should call update_checklist.\n\nBut we need to verify that we haven't missed other distinct dates. Let's search docket for other \"Filed\" patterns. The search shows docket has 1 match. The docket match is the same date.

So we need to find all. We have doc coverage partial. Need to find other dates in other docs.

The evidence snippets are provided in the search results. We need to provide evidence text, source document, location. They gave context tokens with snippet. We can use that.\n\nWe need to append new entries for Filing_Date for 2025-04-07 and 2025-06-24.

Also maybe other documents but we just need one evidence snippet.\n\nFor 06/24/25: from Order Re Preliminary Injunction, tokens show \"Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD     Document 60     Filed 06/24/25\". Good.\n\nWe need to append to existing filing_date list. The current list has one value. We should append new ones.\n\nWe must use append_checklist. Provide patch for key Filing_Date with extracted entries.\n\nWe must include evidence arrays for each entry.\n\nWe need to include text snippet exactly from evidence: e.g., \"Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD     Document 15     Filed 04/07/25\". But the snippet includes extra spaces. We can capture the relevant snippet.\n\nAlso for 06/24/25: \"Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD     Document 60     Filed 06/24/25\".\n\nAnd maybe also we could include evidence from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for 04/03/25, but it's already present.

In Complaint, there were also matches for filed 04/03/25. So we need to capture all distinct filing dates across all documents. We have already extracted: 04/03/25, 04/07/25, 06/24/25. Are there any other filing dates? We saw in Complaint many \"Filed 04/03/25\" occurrences. Docket shows many 04/03/25, 04/04/25. But those are filing dates for docket entries, not the initial filing of lawsuit. The filing date of lawsuit is probably the initial complaint filing date. That is likely 04/03/25. However, the Ex Parte Motion has filing date 04/07/25, Order Re Preliminary Injunction 06/24/25. The docket entries show the same dates for other filings. But we need all distinct filing dates of the lawsuit? The description: \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" That is usually the complaint filing date: 04/03/25. The other dates are later motions and orders, not the initial filing. But the instructions say \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we should capture all dates that appear as \"Filed ...\" for the lawsuit. But maybe the filing date is the date of the complaint. But to be safe, we can capture all distinct dates that indicate the lawsuit was filed. That includes the complaint (04/03/25), the motion (04/07/25), and the preliminary injunction (06/24/25). But the docket entries also show 04/04/25 etc. They are also filings of other documents, but they are still part of the lawsuit. The requirement is the filing date of the lawsuit, not of each docket entry. But \"the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" That is 04/03/25. So we should only include that date. But Step 12 had appended 04/07/25 and 06/24/25. That might be wrong. We need to correct.\n\nThus we should update the checklist: set Filing_Date to only 2025-04-03.

But we need evidence from the text we have read. We have read tokens 0-109 of Complaint showing that snippet. That is evidence. Also we have read Docket tokens 0-170 showing 2025-04-03. So we can use both.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist for Filing_Date with single extracted entry value \"2025-04-03\" and evidence from Complaint and Docket.\n\nWe must not create new entries for 04/07/25 and 06/24/25. So we need to replace. Use update_checklist.\n\nWe need to include evidence: two entries: from Complaint, from Docket. Provide text snippet exactly.\n\nWe have from Complaint snippet: \"Case 4:25-cv-03070 Document 1 Filed 04/03/25 Page 1 of 44\". Provide that.\n\nFrom Docket snippet: \"None | 2025-04-03 | Notice of Appearance/Substitution/Change/Withdrawal of Attorney\". Provide that.\n\nThus call update_checklist.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"2025-04-03\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 4:25-cv-03070     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 1 of 44\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-109\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"text\": \"None | 2025-04-03 | Notice of Appearance/Substitution/Change/Withdrawal of Attorney\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-170\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "2025-04-03", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 4:25-cv-03070     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 1 of 44", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "tokens 0-109"}, {"text": "None | 2025-04-03 | Notice of Appearance/Substitution/Change/Withdrawal of Attorney", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 0-170"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 20289, "completion_tokens": 1029, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Current status: only 1 value extracted? Actually they have 2 added earlier: 2025-04-07 and 2025-06-24 via append_checklist (step 12). Then update_checklist added 2025-04-03. But the status says Total Values Extracted: 1? That seems inconsistent. It shows only 1 value? Actually the status shows 1 value extracted. But earlier they appended 2 values, then updated to 1 value. So maybe the update replaced the list with only 2025-04-03, discarding previous? That likely incorrect; we need all distinct values. We must capture all filing dates from all documents. We have seen:\n\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: Filed 04/03/25 (date 2025-04-03)\n- Ex Parte Motion: Filed 04/07/25 (2025-04-07)\n- Order Re Preliminary Injunction: Filed 06/24/25 (2025-06-24)\n\nAlso Docket entries show many filings on 04/03/25, 04/04/25. But those are docket entries, not the initial filing of the lawsuit. The filing date of the lawsuit is the original complaint filing: 04/03/25. There might be other filings like the order for preliminary injunction filed later. But we need \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" That is the initial filing. So only 2025-04-03. But the earlier steps appended 04/07/25 and 06/24/25 - those are not the initial filing; maybe they are other filings. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the item appears in multiple documents, we should extract each distinct value. But the definition is the filing date of the lawsuit. So if the same date appears multiple times, we extract once. So we should have only one value: 2025-04-03. But we also have 2025-04-07 and 2025-06-24 appearing as \"Filed\" in other documents, but those are not the filing date of the lawsuit. Should we include them? The checklist definition is the filing date of the lawsuit. So we should not include other filing dates of other documents.\n\nThus we need to update the checklist to have only 2025-04-03. So we need to set Filing_Date to a single value with evidence. So we should issue an update_checklist with that value.\n\nHowever, we need to verify that 2025-04-03 is indeed the first filing. The complaint shows \"Case 4:25-cv-03070 Document 1 Filed 04/03/25\". That is the initial complaint. So yes.\n\nWe also need to confirm no other earlier filing in any document. Search for earlier dates? But the complaint is dated 04/03/25. The docket entries are 04/03/25 and 04/04/25. None earlier. So we are good.\n\nThus we need to update the checklist: replace Filing_Date with single extracted entry \"2025-04-03\" with evidence from the complaint. But we must include evidence: text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe already have evidence for that: \"Case 4:25-cv-03070 Document 1 Filed 04/03/25 Page 1 of 44\" from tokens 0-109 of complaint. So we can use that.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist.\n\nBut we also need to ensure that we don't have duplicate entries. We should replace the list with only this value.\n\nWe'll provide patch with key Filing_Date, extracted list with one entry.\n\nLet's produce JSON accordingly.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"2025-04-03\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 4:25-cv-03070     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 1 of 44\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-109\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "2025-04-03", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 4:25-cv-03070     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 1 of 44", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "tokens 0-109"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 15672, "completion_tokens": 940, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Currently only one value extracted: 2025-04-03 from Complaint. We need all distinct filing dates across all documents. We saw earlier from Step 12: values 2025-04-07 (Ex Parte Motion) and 2025-06-24 (Order Re Preliminary). Step 14 added 2025-04-03. But we need to confirm all distinct dates. We might need to read more in Complaint, Docket, Order, Order Re Preliminary, Ex Parte Motion. We have partial coverage. We need to find all filing dates.\n\nFrom the earlier search results, many docket entries show 4/3/2025, 4/4/2025. Also maybe other dates. Also the Complaint's filing date 04/03/25. There may be other filing dates like 04/07/25, 06/24/25. Also maybe other docket entries for other dates such as 04/03/2025. Let's search for \"Filed 0\" pattern like \"Filed 04/07/25\" we saw. Also \"Filed 06/24/25\". There may be other dates like 04/03/25. Use search_document_regex on all documents pattern: \"Filed\\s*\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}\". But we already have many matches. But we need to capture distinct dates.\n\nWe have already captured 04/03/25, 04/07/25, 06/24/25. Are there any other filing dates? Possibly 04/04/25 (multiple docket entries). That is filing date of a docket entry? The docket entry date is the filing date. So we should extract 04/04/25? But the docket entry line shows \"Filed on 4/4/2025\". That is a filing date of a document. So yes. Also 04/03/25 appears many times. 04/04/25 appears many. Also maybe 04/05? Not in results. So distinct dates: 04/03/25, 04/04/25, 04/07/25, 06/24/25.\n\nAlso maybe other docket entries for \"Filed on 4/3/2025\" and \"Filed on 4/4/2025\" we captured. Also maybe 04/03/2025. We should also extract 04/03/25 from earlier. Already done.\n\nThus we need to append missing dates: 04/04/25 and 06/24/25. Also 04/07/25. Also confirm 04/04/25 appears. Yes lines in Docket. Also check if there are any other dates like 04/03/25, 04/04/25, 04/07/25, 06/24/25. Also maybe 04/03/25 from Complaint.\n\nThus we need to append these 3 missing dates. Provide evidence from Docket and Order Re Preliminary. For 04/04/25 evidence: from Docket matches 8,9,10 show \"Filed on 4/4/2025\". Provide snippet. Also maybe other docket entries with 4/4/2025.\n\nFor 06/24/25 evidence: from Order Re Preliminary we have \"Filed 06/24/25\". Provide snippet.\n\nFor 04/07/25 evidence: from Ex Parte Motion we have \"Filed 04/07/25\". Provide snippet.\n\nWe should also verify 04/03/25 is already present. So we add 3 new values.\n\nWe also need to verify no other filing dates. Might be 04/05/25? Not present. 04/06? Not found.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with 3 new entries. Ensure each has evidence.\n\nWe need to provide evidence text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe have snippets from earlier steps: Step 12 for 04/07/25: \"Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD Document 15 Filed 04/07/25 Page 1 of 7\". And 06/24/25: \"Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD Document 60 Filed 06/24/25 Page 1 of 29\". For 04/04/25: from Docket match 8 (tokens 886-1086) snippet: shows \"Filed on 4/4/2025\". Provide that snippet. Also maybe 04/04/25 from match 9. Provide snippet: \"Filed on 4/4/2025\". We can pick one snippet.\n\nWe should also include location: maybe \"Page ...\". For Docket, we have tokens but not page numbers. Provide token range or just \"tokens 886-1086\" etc.\n\nThus create append_checklist patch for Filing_Date with 3 extracted values.\n\nLet's craft JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"2025-04-04\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Filed on 4/4/2025\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 886-1086\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Filed on 4/4/2025\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 1116-1316\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"2025-04-07\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD    Document 15    Filed 04/07/25    Page 1 of 7\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 of 7\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"2025-06-24\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD    Document 60    Filed 06/24/25    Page 1 of 29\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Order Re Preliminary Injunction\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 of 29\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "2025-04-04", "evidence": [{"text": "Filed on 4/4/2025", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 886-1086"}, {"text": "Filed on 4/4/2025", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 1116-1316"}]}, {"value": "2025-04-07", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD    Document 15    Filed 04/07/25    Page 1 of 7", "source_document": "Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause", "location": "Page 1 of 7"}]}, {"value": "2025-06-24", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD    Document 60    Filed 06/24/25    Page 1 of 29", "source_document": "Order Re Preliminary Injunction", "location": "Page 1 of 29"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11044, "completion_tokens": 1377, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But pattern shows 04/03, 04/04, 04/07, 06/24. All distinct. However, check if any other dates appear maybe in other documents: \"Case 3:25-cv-03070     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25\" we captured. Docket had many 04/03 and 04/04. Ex Parte had 04/07. Order Re Preliminary had 06/24. Maybe there is also an earlier date: \"Case 3:25-cv-03070-JD    Document 4    Filed 04/04/25\" but we already counted 04/04. Could there be 04/05 or 04/06? Not likely. Also maybe 04/03 appears multiple times; we only need distinct values. So set of 4 distinct dates.\n\nNow check if we have any missing contexts: we need to ensure that each value has evidence. We have evidence from Complaint (04/03), Docket (04/04, 04/03 also but already covered), Ex Parte (04/07), Order Re Preliminary (06/24). So we have evidence for all.\n\nNow the checklist is complete. Should we do stop? We should verify that we have all distinct filing dates. The prior search had many matches (67). But we may have missed some dates like 04/07 appears multiple times maybe.

But check if any other docs might have filing dates not captured. Ex Parte Motion may have other dates: e.g., \"Filed 04/07/25\" only. Order Re Preliminary has 06/24. Complaint might have also \"Filed 04/03/25\". Docket has many 04/03/25 and 04/04/25.
