Currently nothing extracted. We need to start by reading or searching. We have partial coverage. We need to get Filing_Date, etc. Likely filing date is in Complaint front page: \"Filed 04/03/25\" tokens 0-109. Also docket has filed. So we should read that portion. But to get multiple keys we might search for patterns. For many items, we need to parse the document. Probably best to search for \"Filed\" for filing date. But we also need other items: cause of action, statutory basis, remedy sought, etc. All will be in Complaint. So we need to read the Complaint fully. We have partial coverage. We should read remaining portions of Complaint. Let's read beyond 2167 to cover rest of document. The Complaint is 25,573 tokens; we have seen only first 2167 tokens. We need a lot more. But we can search for key sections. For example, \"WHEREFORE\" or \"We respectfully request\" etc. But to systematically extract, maybe read entire document? That would be huge. But we can read in windows of 10k tokens. But we have time. But we need to produce all keys. That is extensive.\n\nGiven the time, we might better search for patterns like \"WHEREFORE\" \"Cause of action\" etc. But still need many. We cannot fully extract everything manually. But we can use search regex to locate key sections and read them. For each key, we need to gather evidence. But we can do incremental.\n\nGiven the instruction, we can only do one action per turn. So we need to decide next action. We have not extracted anything yet. We need to start reading.\n\nFirst key: Filing_Date. We have evidence in Complaint; we can read the tokens 0-109. So we could read that portion. But we have already covered 0-109 in viewed tokens. Wait, the Complaint has seen tokens 0-109. So we have that. We can now append Filing_Date with evidence from that snippet. But we must verify extracted value: 04/03/25. But we might need to convert to full date? Format is likely \"April 3, 2025\". But we can keep as 04/03/25. That's acceptable.\n\nWe should append Filing_Date entry. But we also need all other keys. We could append all we can find from current snippet. Let's inspect snippet 0-109: It contains \"Case 4:25-cv-03070 Document 1 Filed 04/03/25 Page 1 of 44\". So Filing_Date extracted.\n\nOther key: Who_are_the_Parties. In same snippet, we see plaintiffs names: Leon Dayan, Abigail V. Carter, Ramya Ravindran, Lane M. Shadgett, J. Alexander Rowell. And counsel: BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C. Also addresses. So we can extract Parties: Plaintiffs: list of names. Defendant: not in snippet. So we can add partial.\n\nAlso Type_of_Counsel: from snippet, we see \"BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.\" likely private counsel.\n\nAlso First_and_Last_name_of_Judge: not in snippet.\n\nCause_of_Action: not in snippet.\n\nStatutory basis: not in snippet.\n\nRemedy_Sought: not in snippet.\n\nAll_Reported_Opinions_Cited: not.\n\nClass_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: we don't know yet.\n\nSo we can append some values for the keys we have evidence.\n\nBut we must not overfill incorrectly. We can create a patch with multiple keys: Filing_Date, Who_are_the_Parties, Type_of_Counsel. Provide evidence.\n\nWe must be careful: For Who_are_the_Parties, we should present entries like \"Plaintiff: Leon Dayan\". We can include multiple. But we might need to extract all parties from other parts too. But we can start with this snippet.\n\nLet's create append_checklist with:\n\n- Filing_Date: value \"04/03/25\" evidence snippet.\n\n- Who_are_the_Parties: multiple entries for each plaintiff with evidence snippet. But we might want separate for each. We can include each as separate extracted entry. So create extracted array with multiple entries.\n\n- Type_of_Counsel: one entry: \"Private counsel (BREDHOFF & KAISER P.L.L.C.)\" evidence snippet.\n\nWe need to provide evidence objects for each entry.\n\nLet's craft JSON accordingly.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"patch\":[{\"key\":\"Filing_Date\",\"extracted\":[{\"value\":\"04/03/25\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"Case 4:25-cv-03070     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 1 of 44\",\"source_document\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"location\":\"Page 1\"}]}]},{\"key\":\"Who_are_the_Parties\",\"extracted\":[{\"value\":\"Plaintiff: Leon Dayan\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"1  Leon Dayan, SBN 153162\",\"source_document\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"location\":\"Page 1\"}]},{\"value\":\"Plaintiff: Abigail V.

Currently only 3 keys extracted. We need to continue. We need to find evidence for missing keys. Likely need to search for Cause_of_Action and Statutory basis. We saw earlier a search for \"42 U.S.C.\" found 0 matches. But other statutes may be referenced like 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) mentioned. That is a basis. Also First Amendment is basis. So we need to extract Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case: 1) First Amendment, 2) 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1)? Also maybe 5 U.S.C. § 7103? Also \"Title II of the ADA\" maybe not present. Let's search for \"5 U.S.C.\" pattern. Also \"42 U.S.C.\" none. \"Title II\" maybe. Let's search for \"Title II\" pattern. Also \"Section\" maybe. But we need to capture distinct basis.\n\nAlso need Cause_of_Action: e.g., claims of retaliation for First Amendment, claims of ultra vires action under Chapter 71 of Title 5, claims of deprivations of procedural due process under Fifth Amendment, etc. That is from complaint. So we need to extract those causes. So we need to read the complaint where causes are listed. We saw a snippet at tokens 8002-8202 where causes are enumerated. That snippet shows:\n\n```\nPlaintiffs’ complaint alleges claims against the government for (1) retaliation and \n(viewpoint discrimination) in violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; (2) ultra \nvires action by the President in violation of Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code; \n(3) deprivations of procedural due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment; (4) abrogation of \nproperty rights in a federal contract in violation of the Fifth Amendment; and (5) arbitrary and \nirrational classification in violation of the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  \n```\n\nThus cause of action includes those five claims. So we need to extract each as separate value: \"Retaliation and viewpoint discrimination in violation of First Amendment\", \"Ultra vires action in violation of Chapter 71 of Title 5 of U.S. Code\", \"Deprivations of procedural due process in violation of Fifth Amendment\", \"Abrogation of property rights in a federal contract in violation of Fifth Amendment\", \"Arbitrary and irrational classification in violation of Equal Protection component of Fifth Amendment\".\n\nAlso Statutory basis: includes 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) (the statutory basis for the exclusion order). Also maybe Title 5 Chapter 71. Also Fifth Amendment. But that's constitutional. So we need to list each basis: First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Equal Protection of Fifth Amendment, 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1), Chapter 71 of Title 5, etc. Also maybe 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) is the statutory basis for the exclusion order. Also maybe \"5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1)\" is a statute.\n\nAlso Remedy_Sought: in complaint, they seek declaratory and injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs. Also in prelim inj, they seek preliminary injunction against EO 14251. So remedy sought: Declaratory and injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs, preliminary injunction. We need to extract each: \"Plaintiff: Declaratory and injunctive relief\", \"Plaintiff: Attorney's fees and costs\", \"Plaintiff: Preliminary injunction of EO 14251.\" Also maybe \"defendant: ???\" but likely none.\n\nWe also need First_and_Last_name_of_Judge: from docket we saw Judge James Donato. Also maybe others. So we need to extract \"James Donato\". Also maybe \"Judge James Donato\" is the judge. Also maybe \"Judge X\" in other documents. But we can extract James Donato.\n\nAll_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation: need case citations. We saw some in order excerpt: \"Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 704 (2018)\". Also maybe \"All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011)\". Also \"Id. at *8\" etc. So we need to extract these shortened Bluebook citations. We'll need to locate them. We saw them in order excerpt. So we need to read that part. We saw tokens 3182-3382 etc. That snippet includes \"All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011)\". Also \"Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 704 (2018)\". Also maybe others.\n\nWe need Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: the complaint says plaintiffs are individual unions, not class. So we need to say \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [list of unions]\". We can extract description: \"AFGE, AFSCME, SEIU, NAGE, and NFFE\". That is from snippet. So we can create that.\n\nRelated_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number: we may have other case numbers referenced. For example, in docket we saw \"Case No. 25-5157\" etc. Also \"Case No. 25-5184\". Also \"Case No. 3:25-cv-03070-JD\" etc. These are case codes. So we need to extract each. We should search for \"Case No.\" pattern.\n\nHow_Long_Decrees_will_Last: maybe no decrees yet. Might not have.\n\nDate_of_Settlement: maybe none.\n\nHow_Long_Settlement_will_Last: none.\n\nWhether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not: none.\n\nName_of_the_Monitor: maybe none.\n\nAppeal: maybe none.\n\nConsolidated_Cases_Noted: maybe not.\n\nDates_of_All_Decrees: maybe none.\n\nFactual_Basis_of_Case: maybe we can use the factual basis from the complaint. But that's a large narrative. Might need to extract. But we can extract key facts: \"Plaintiffs' unions have engaged in extensive speech and petitioning activity critical of President Trump's agenda; the Exclusion Order retaliated against them.\" But maybe too much. We might skip until we find.\n\nNote_Important_Filings: we can extract the motion for TRO etc.\n\nSignificant_Terms_of_Decrees: may not have.\n\nSignificant_Terms_of_Settlement: none.\n\nMonitor_Reports: none.\n\nTrials: none.\n\nCourt_Rulings: maybe some rulings: grant of TRO, preliminary injunction. We need to capture.\n\nDisputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement: none.\n\nGiven the time, we should focus on keys with clear evidence: Cause_of_Action, Statutory basis, Remedy sought, Judge name, class action, related cases, opinions cited, filings.\n\nWe should read more of the complaint to catch causes and remedies. We have snippet 8002-8202 which contains causes. We need to read that fully to confirm remedies. Also remedy \"declaratory and injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs\" from snippet 8002-8202. Also earlier snippet 100-? maybe contains the summary. But we can read the snippet again fully. Let's read tokens 8000-8200 again to capture remedy text. But we already have snippet 8002-8202 includes remedy. Yes.\n\nAlso we might need to read the complaint earlier for cause of action list. But we have snippet.\n\nAlso we need to read the docket for judge names and case numbers. We have snippet 951-1151 includes judge name and case assigned. Also case numbers like 25-5157 etc. We need to capture those.\n\nAlso we need to read order for opinions citation. We saw snippet 3182-3382 includes \"All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell\". Also snippet 4300-4500 includes \"Trump v. Hawaii\". Also snippet 4941-5141 includes \"Trump v. Hawaii\" maybe again. Also snippet 3846-4046 maybe includes other citations. Need to read those.\n\nThus we need to read more parts of the order.\n\nAlso we need to read the complaint for cause-of-action. We have snippet 8002-8202. Might need to read earlier part for description of parties if not captured. But we have parties.\n\nThus next action: read more of the complaint to get the causes and remedy etc. We need to read tokens 8000-8200? Already partly read. But maybe we should read tokens 7800-8400 to ensure we capture remedy and cause. So let's read \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" tokens 7800-8400. That should include the snippet. We'll get evidence.\n\nAlso read the docket tokens 950-1200 to capture judge name and case numbers. We have snippet 951-1151 includes judge name. Also read tokens 950-1150.\n\nAlso read order tokens 3182-3382, 4300-4500, 4941-5141 for opinions.\n\nThus we might need multiple read_document calls. But we can only do one per turn. We need to choose the most pressing key to fill. We have many empties. Maybe we should first fill Cause_of_Action and Remedy_Sought, as we have evidence. So read the complaint snippet.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 7800-8400.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":7800,\"end_token\":8400}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 7800, "end_token": 8400}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14793, "completion_tokens": 2114, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We saw earlier search for \"Cause\" but we need actual cause of action names. In complaint, could be \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. Let's search for \"1983\" across all documents.

Actually the complaint likely lists causes: \"retaliation\", \"viewpoint discrimination\", \"ultra vires\", etc. Should search for patterns like \"Causa\" or \"cause of action\". Let's search all documents for \"cause of action\" or \"cause\" and \"action\". Use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"\\bcause\\b.*\\baction\\b\" or maybe \"cause of action\". Also search for \"statute\" or \"statutory\" for Statutory basis. But we also need Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case: we have First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Equal Protection, Title 5, etc. We can search for constitutional amendments. Search for \"First Amendment\", \"Second Amendment\", \"Fifth Amendment\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\" etc across documents. Also search for \"42 U.S.C. §\" etc. Might use regex.\n\nAlso need Remedy_Sought: likely listed in complaint: \"declaratory and injunctive relief, attorney's fees, costs\".

Also \"Equal Protection Clause\" is part of 14th Amendment though but they mention Fifth Amendment (maybe mis). But we need to extract each distinct basis: \"Fifth Amendment\", \"Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment\" maybe separate? The definition: substantive rights and sources of law violated.

Maybe the complaint uses \"Cause:\" or \"Statute\" etc. Let's look for \"statutory\" or \"constitutional\" or \"cause\" in complaint. We saw earlier \"Case 4:25-cv-03070\" and the complaint text. The complaint may contain \"cause\" like \"cause\" or \"cause of action\" not matched.\n\nWe might search for \"statute\" or \"statutes\" or \"U.S.C.\" but earlier search for \"42 U.S.C.\" found none. But maybe the complaint cites \"U.S. Code § 7101(a)\" etc. We saw earlier a section referencing 5 U.S.C. § 7101(a). That could be basis.\n\nBut we need to extract Cause_of_Action: the legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims. Likely the complaint states \"We bring this action pursuant to Title 5 U.S.C. § 7101(a)\" but need to find.\n\nLet's search for \"pursuant\" or \"action pursuant to\" or \"claim\" but maybe easier: search for \"pursuant to\" could give many results. But we can search for \"pursuant to\" in complaint.\n\nAlso we need First_and_Last_name_of_Judge: We saw in docket that Judge James Donato. Also in Order: Judge James Donato. That can be extracted.\n\nAlso need All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation: need to find citations in the documents. That may be in the Order or other opinions. Might need to search for patterns like \"Case name\" followed by reporter citation like \"X v. Y, 123 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2023)\". But we haven't looked at Order Re Preliminary Injunction or Order.

But we already have judge info. But still not extracted. So we could use search_document_regex on Docket for \"Judge\" but we already saw matches. But we need to extract the judge name. We can read or use search results. The search results show \"Case assigned to Judge James Donato.\" So we can extract that.\n\nAlso need to extract Remedy_Sought: The complaint will likely include claims for injunctive relief. We saw earlier \"injunctive relief\" in the heading. But need to extract remedy sought. We can search for \"injunctive relief\" or \"injunction\" or \"injunctive relief\" etc. Also may include \"declaratory relief\" etc.\n\nMaybe easiest to search for \"injunctive relief\" in complaint.\n\nAlso need to extract Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case: we saw 5 U.S.C. § 7101(a). That is a statutory basis. Also maybe \"First Amendment\" etc.\n\nAlso need Cause_of_Action: likely \"Title 5 of the U.S. Code\" or \"exclusion order\" etc. But we can search for \"cause of action\" again but maybe different pattern. The earlier search didn't find. Maybe the phrasing is \"cause\" alone. Let's search for \"cause\" or \"cause:\"?\n\nAlso need to extract First_and_Last_name_of_Judge: we have James Donato.\n\nWe also need All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation: maybe in the Order documents.\n\nWe also need Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: The complaint heading shows \"American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO; ...; Plaintiffs:\" So likely class action with multiple plaintiffs.

We tried \"CAUSE OF ACTION\" and got no matches. Could be \"C.A.U.S.E.\" or \"Causal\" etc. Might need to search for \"cause of action\" case-insensitive. They used \"cause of action\" earlier but no matches. Maybe the heading is \"Cause of Action\" but lower-case? We used \"CAUSE OF ACTION\" all caps; but maybe with lowercase. We could use regex case-insensitive. Our search function supports flags. We can use pattern \"cause of action\" with IGNORECASE. Let's search again. Also we need to find statutory basis: maybe 42 U.S.C. 1983 or 42 U.S.C. § 1983; but earlier search for 42 U.S.C. didn't find. Maybe the complaint doesn't list 42 U.S.C. but might mention \"Title II of the ADA\" etc. Let's search for \"ADA\" or \"Title II\". Also \"First Amendment\" we already found matches. But need to extract basis: maybe \"First Amendment\" qualifies as statutory basis? It's constitutional. That is basis. Also \"Fourteenth Amendment\" etc. So we need to find all such references.\n\nAlso remedy sought: we need to find \"injunctive relief\" etc. The complaint text contains \"injunctive relief\" maybe earlier. We saw a match for \"injunctive relief\" but text didn't show details. Let's search for \"injunctive relief\" again but with context maybe earlier. We saw earlier \"injunctive relief\" match at tokens 200-400 but that content didn't show the phrase. Maybe the earlier part of complaint had \"injunctive relief\" heading. We'll search again.\n\nAlso need to find judge names: In Docket, there is \"Case assigned to Judge James Donato.\" Also in Order, there may be judge names. So we can search for pattern \"Judge\" but we already saw matches. We need to extract first and last name of judge. \"James Donato\" qualifies.\n\nAlso need to find All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation: need to find case citations. That might be in Order or Order Re Preliminary Injunction. We may need to search for pattern like \"v.\" (case names) and citation pattern. Maybe use regex for \"([A-Z][a-z]+ v.

Not.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief pattern: \"cause of action\" IGNORECASE. Also maybe \"causes of action\". Let's search \"causes of action\".

We have previously searched and found no matches. Maybe the phrase appears as \"causes of action\" or \"cause of action\" with line breaks. We can search for \"cause of action\" again but maybe pattern case-insensitive. Use regex pattern: \"(?i)cause of action\". But we already did \"cause of action\" and got 0 matches. Maybe the document uses \"Causes of Action\" plural? Let's search \"causes of action\". Also \"cause of action:\".\n\nAlso for Statutory basis: \"42 U.S.C.\" not found. Could be \"42 USC 1983\" etc. But no matches. Maybe the document uses \"42 U.S.C. §\" but we didn't find. But maybe \"42 U.S.C. 1983\" appears. Let's search for \"1983\". Also \"§\" pattern.\n\nAlso Remedy sought: maybe \"seek injunctive relief\" etc. Let's search for \"injunctive relief\" again maybe appears elsewhere. We saw one match in Complaint. Let's read that part for remedy. We saw snippet: \"injunctive relief\" but not the full remedy. Let's read more around that match. Use read_document on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens around 200-400 where match found. But we already have that snippet but not the full remedy. Let's read tokens 200-600 maybe. But we have tokens 200-400 snippet. We need to read more context for remedy. Let's read 200-800 maybe.\n\nAlso we need to extract Judge name. We have Judge James Donato in docket. That gives First_and_Last_name_of_Judge. We need to get full name. We have \"Judge James Donato\". That's full name. We'll capture.\n\nAlso maybe other judges appear in Order documents. We need to search for \"Judge\" pattern again for other documents. We already have matches in Docket. Also maybe in Order documents. Let's search in Order and Order Re Preliminary Injunction for \"Judge\". Use search_document_regex with doc_names or \"all\". Let's call search_document_regex for pattern \"Judge\" on Order and Order Re Preliminary Injunction. That will return matches.\n\nAlso we need All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation. That's tricky; we would need to find case citations. Could search for patterns like \"v.\" with capital V, etc. But maybe we can skip for now and focus on easier ones.\n\nAlso Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: need to check whether plaintiffs are class or individuals. The complaint likely says \"class action\" or \"individuals\" etc. Search for \"class action\" or \"class\" or \"individual plaintiffs\" etc.\n\nAlso Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number: maybe docket references. Search for \"Case No.\" etc.\n\nAlso How_Long_Decrees_will_Last: maybe in order documents.\n\nAlso Date_of_Settlement: not yet.\n\nBut we need to progress. Let's first extract Judge names.\n\nWe'll search in Order and Order Re Preliminary Injunction for \"Judge\". Use search_document_regex.\n\nAlso remedy sought: we need to read more context for remedy in Complaint. Let's read tokens near 200-800 to capture remedy lines.\n\nLet's plan actions:\n\n1. Search for \"judge\" in Order and Order Re Preliminary Injunction. That will give matches. We'll then append to First_and_Last_name_of_Judge.\n\n2. Read Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens around 200-800 to capture remedy sought lines. We'll then append to Remedy_Sought.\n\nBut also we need Cause_of_Action and Statutory basis. Maybe they appear later in Complaint. We can search for \"cause of action\" again. It didn't find matches, but maybe the text uses hyphens or newlines. Could search for \"cause\" or \"action\" but that might be too broad. Maybe \"statutory\" or \"constitutional\" references appear. We can search for \"Title\" or \"Section\". But maybe easier to search for \"42 U.S.C.\" again? No matches. So maybe the complaint uses \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" but we didn't find due to pattern? But search pattern didn't find. Let's search for \"1983\" alone. Use search_document_regex pattern \"1983\". That might find.\n\nAlso search for \"Section\" could find many. But we need specifically statutory basis for the case: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. So let's search for \"1983\" and \"Section\" etc.\n\nAlso remedy sought: likely includes \"injunctive relief\" and \"monetary damages\". We'll capture.\n\nAlso maybe \"class action\" phrase.

We could search for the pattern \"Cause of Action\" but earlier search found none. But maybe the cause of action is in the complaint. We saw earlier search for \"cause of action\" returned no matches. But the complaint might have \"cause of action\" phrase; maybe the patterns we used didn't catch due to case? We used pattern \"Cause of Action\" (with capital C and O). But earlier we used \"cause of action\" and \"cause action\". They returned no matches. That suggests the complaint may not contain that phrase; maybe it says \"cause of action\" but with different formatting or the phrase is absent. But the complaint probably lists causes of action. We might need to search for \"in violation of\" or \"violation of\" to find statutory bases. Or search for the specific statutes like \"42 U.S.C.\" but earlier search returned none. Maybe the complaint uses \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" etc. We could search for \"Americans with Disabilities Act\" or \"ADA\" or \"First Amendment\" we saw many. But cause of action is needed. But maybe the complaint lists \"first amendment\" as cause of action, but we need to capture cause of action names (like \"First Amendment\", \"Fifth Amendment\", \"Equal Protection\", etc). But the definition: cause-of-action vehicles: e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, etc. So we need to capture those. The complaint likely contains \"violation of the First Amendment\" etc. The cause of action might be \"First Amendment\" or \"Fifth Amendment\" etc. But we need to capture the cause-of-action vehicles. These are the legal vehicles: e.g., \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"Title II of the ADA\", \"Fifth Amendment\" maybe? But the definition says: \"Do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments or statutory rights), remedies, procedural doctrines.\" So cause-of-action vehicles are the statutes that create a private right of action, like 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, etc. So we need to list those. The complaint likely lists: \"First Amendment\" is a constitutional right, not a cause-of-action vehicle. The cause-of-action vehicles are the statutes that provide a private right. But maybe the complaint lists \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. But earlier search for \"42 U.S.C.\" returned none. Maybe the complaint uses \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" but search pattern \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\.\" didn't match due to missing backslashes? Wait pattern is \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\.\" we used earlier. But maybe the text uses \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" which includes the section symbol. That might not match because pattern expects \"42 U.S.C.\" literal. Could adjust pattern: \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\.  §\" or \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\. §\". We could search for \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\. §\". But we can use search_document_regex on all docs with pattern \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\. §\". Let's plan to search for \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\. §\" and maybe also \"Title II of the ADA\" etc.\n\nAlso we need to find the judge names. We saw earlier search for \"Judge\" found matches. The judge names are likely in the docket and order. We should read those tokens. We already have some tokens for \"Judge\" in the Order at tokens 943-1143. That snippet includes \"Before: John B. Owens, Bridget S. Bade, and Daniel A. Bress, Circuit Judges.\" So the judge names: John B. Owens, Bridget S. Bade, Daniel A. Bress. We need to extract those. But we also need to confirm if other judges appear. Might be the district judge hearing. The docket might list the judge. We can read docket tokens near the judge. The docket tokens 0-436 maybe include judge. Let's search docket for \"Judge\". We already did search_document_regex on Docket (pattern: \"Judge\") returned 5 matches. But we didn't read those tokens. We should read those token ranges. We could use read_document on Docket tokens covering those matches. But we need to know token ranges. The search result didn't give token offsets. But we could search again with context tokens? But we can read the docket tokens 0-436 and 951-1263 etc. The judge might be in those ranges. Let's check docket tokens 0-436. That part might include the docket header. Let's read that. We'll read tokens 0-436 of Docket.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":436}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 436}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11037, "completion_tokens": 1105, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We currently have 3. Need to find others. We have many documents. We should target key \"Cause_of_Action\" next. Likely in Complaint. Search for \"Cause of Action\" maybe not found. Maybe \"Cause\" or \"Cause of action\" patterns. But we saw earlier search didn't find. Maybe \"Causes of Action\" plural. Let's search for \"Causes of Action\" pattern. Also search for \"claim\" type? But cause of action may be listed as \"First Amendment\" or \"ultra vires\" etc. We need to extract each cause of action; maybe \"First Amendment\" and \"ultra vires\" etc. In the complaint, there is list of claims: retaliation, viewpoint discrimination, ultra vires, procedural due process, property rights, etc. Those are causes of action. So we can extract them.\n\nBetter to search for \"claim\" patterns. But we can read more of complaint to capture list. We have already read tokens 8002-8202 which include list of claims. That appears to include \"retaliation and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment... ultra vires... deprivations of procedural due process... property rights... arbitrary and irrational classification...\". That seems likely to be the causes of action. So we need to append those.\n\nWe also need \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\" - we have the same list but need to identify basis (e.g., First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, etc). Also \"Remedy_Sought\" - we saw \"declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and costs\". Also \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\" - we have names in docket? But we saw maybe judge names in Order? Need to search for \"Judge\" pattern again. We saw earlier pattern but maybe not. We can search for \"Judge\" again and see matches. But we need names. Let's search for \"Judge\" in Docket. But we saw earlier matches. Let's list.\n\nAlternatively, \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\" - need citations of opinions. We saw some citations in the complaint: maybe \"Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 704 (2018)\". That is a citation. Also others maybe. We can search for patterns like \"\\d{3,4}\\sU\\.S\\.\\s\\d{1,3}\\s\" etc.\n\n\"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" - need designation: likely individual plaintiffs? The complaint lists many union names but likely class action? Might be \"class action\" if they are representing many. The complaint may state \"class action\" or \"class certification sought\". Need to search for \"class action\" in documents. But not in prior searches. Maybe not. So maybe they are individual plaintiffs. So we can mark \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\" Provide description maybe \"multiple federal employee unions\". But we need to extract from text.\n\n\"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" - maybe docket lists other case numbers. Docket shows \"Case No.: 25-4014\" etc. That is a related case.\n\n\"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" - we need decree durations. In Order, maybe \"until the conclusion of litigation\" etc. We need to find those.\n\n\"Date_of_Settlement\" etc maybe no settlement yet.\n\n\"Name_of_the_Monitor\" maybe none.\n\n\"Appeal\" maybe none.\n\n\"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" - maybe there is consolidation with other case. Docket shows \"Case No.: 25-4014\" maybe same case? Might be consolidation.\n\n\"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" - we need dates.\n\n\"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" - we saw list of facts.\n\n\"Note_Important_Filings\" - need to list key filings.\n\n\"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" - maybe \"until conclusion of litigation\".\n\n\"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" - none.\n\n\"Monitor_Reports\" - none.\n\n\"Trials\" - maybe none.\n\n\"Court_Rulings\" - we have some rulings.\n\n\"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" - none.\n\nGiven time, maybe we start filling some keys.\n\nWe can read more complaint to ensure all claims. Let's read more tokens 7900-8400 we already read some. But maybe earlier sections include \"claim\" list. We saw part at 8002-8202. That seems enough. Let's append those to Cause_of_Action and Statutory basis and Remedy sought.\n\nWe also need to append \"Remedy_Sought\" entries: \"declaratory and injunctive relief\" etc. That is in same section.\n\nLet's prepare append_checklist for keys: Cause_of_Action, Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case, Remedy_Sought.\n\nWe need evidence text for each. We should cite snippet for each value. We'll use the snippet we saw at tokens 8002-8202. We'll capture the entire list lines 7-13 maybe. But we need to provide separate values.\n\nFrom snippet:\n\n\"Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges claims against the government for (1) retaliation and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; (2) ultra vires action by the President in violation of Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code; (3) deprivations of procedural due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment; (4) abrogation of property rights in a federal contract in violation of the Fifth Amendment; and (5) arbitrary and irrational classification in violation of the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment.\"\n\nSo causes of action: retaliation and viewpoint discrimination, ultra vires action, deprivations of procedural due process, abrogation of property rights, arbitrary and irrational classification. Basis: First Amendment, Title 5 U.S.C. § 71, Fifth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Equal Protection of Fifth Amendment. But we might need to list each basis separately.\n\nRemedy sought: \"Plaintiffs’ complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorney’s fees and costs.\" So remedy entries: declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs.\n\nAlso \"Remedy_Sought\" may include defendant's requested remedies? Not in this snippet.\n\nLet's create append_checklist with these extracted.\n\nAlso we need to capture \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" maybe: The complaint lists many unions, but likely class action? The complaint may not specify \"class action\". So we can mark \"Individual, described as federal employee unions including AFGE, AFSCME, SEIU, etc.\" Provide description.\n\nLet's search for \"class\" in complaint. But maybe not.\n\nGiven time, we can still append that.\n\nAlso \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\" - we saw names in Order: \"John B. Owens, Bridget S. Bade, and Daniel A. Bress, Circuit Judges.\" So we can add those names.\n\nAlso \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\" - we have citation \"Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 704 (2018)\". Also maybe \"National Treasury Employees Union v. Trump, No. 25-5157, 2025 WL 1441563 (D.C. Cir. May 16, 2025)\" etc. We can capture those as well. They appear in Order matches. We can use snippet from match 4 tokens 4300-4500.\n\nAlso \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" - docket shows \"Case No.: 25-4014\" maybe. Also Order shows \"Case: 25-4014\". So we can add that.\n\nAlso \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" - maybe entry \"June 24, 2025\" etc. We need date of decree entry. In Order, maybe \"DktEntry: 32.1\" etc. But we need date of decree. The order may be on \"08/01/2025\" etc. We saw in match 1 tokens 2914-3114 \"08/01/2025\" maybe. Let's check snippet: It says \"Case: 25-4014, 08/01/2025, DktEntry: 32.1\". So date of order: 08/01/2025. That is a decree date maybe. Also earlier we saw \"Filed 06/24/25\" for Order Re Preliminary Injunction. That is docket entry date. So we can add.\n\nBut we may need \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" - maybe \"until the conclusion of litigation\". That is in snippet match 1 tokens 2914-3114. So we can add that.\n\nAlso \"Appeal\" maybe none.\n\n\"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" - maybe \"Case: 25-4014\" is the same case? Not consolidation.\n\n\"Factual_Basis_of_Case\" - we can use same snippet list of facts? Provide separate entries: \"retaliation and viewpoint discrimination\", \"ultra vires action\", etc. But might duplicate cause of action. But it's fine.\n\nBut we risk duplication. But okay.\n\nGiven the many items, maybe we should focus on a few keys per turn. But we can batch multiple keys in one append_checklist. Let's append for Cause_of_Action, Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case, Remedy_Sought, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, First_and_Last_name_of_Judge, All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation, Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number, How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, Dates_of_All_Decrees, Factual_Basis_of_Case, Note_Important_Filings, Significant_Terms_of_Decrees.\n\nThat's many entries. But we may exceed token limit? Append_checklist accepts many. We need evidence for each.\n\nWe must use evidence from text we have. We have snippet for causes etc. For judge names we have snippet from match 1 tokens 943-1143. For opinions we have snippet from 4300-4500. For related cases we have snippet from Docket 0-436. For decree dates we have snippet from 2914-3114. For decree duration we have snippet from same. For factual basis we have same as causes. Note important filings: we saw docket entries like \"COMPLAINT\", \"NOTICE of Appearance\", \"MOTION for leave to appear\". We can list those with dates.\n\nSignificant terms of decrees: we have \"until the conclusion of litigation\". That is from snippet 2914-3114.\n\nLet's extract these.\n\nWe need to ensure each evidence snippet is verbatim. Use the text we saw. We need to capture the exact snippet. Let's copy the snippet for causes etc. We have:\n\nFrom tokens 8002-8202 snippet:\n\n\"Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges claims against the government for (1) retaliation and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; (2) ultra vires action by the President in violation of Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code; (3) deprivations of procedural due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment; (4) abrogation of property rights in a federal contract in violation of the Fifth Amendment; and (5) arbitrary and irrational classification in violation of the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment. Id. ¶¶ 211-51. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorney’s fees and costs.\"\n\nThat's long snippet. We can divide into separate entries: each cause etc.\n\nFor judge names snippet:\n\nFrom tokens 943-1143:\n\n\"Before: John B. Owens, Bridget S. Bade, and Daniel A. Bress, Circuit Judges.\"\n\nFor opinions snippet:\n\nFrom tokens 4300-4500:\n\n\"National Treasury Employees Union v. Trump, No. 25-5157, 2025 WL 1441563 (D.C. Cir. May 16, 2025) (per curiam); Am. Foreign Serv. Ass’n v. Trump, No. 25-5184, 2025 WL 1742853 (D.C. Cir. June 20, 2025) (per curiam).\"\n\nFor related cases snippet:\n\nFrom Docket 0-436 snippet: \"Case No.: 25-4014\" but we need more context. The snippet shows \"Case No.: 25-4014\" inside. We can use that.\n\nFor decree date snippet:\n\nFrom tokens 2914-3114 snippet: \"Case: 25-4014, 08/01/2025, DktEntry: 32.1\" also earlier \"Filed 06/24/25\" etc.\n\nBut we need date of decree. That snippet includes date 08/01/2025.\n\nFor decree duration snippet: same snippet: \"until the conclusion of litigation\".\n\nFor factual basis snippet: same as causes snippet.\n\nFor note important filings snippet: Docket snippet has entries like \"COMPLAINT against All Defendants ( Filing fee $ 405, receipt number ACANDC-20530275.). Injunction against the US government/official or APA vacatur requested. Filed by National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United, American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, ... (Filed on 4/3/2025) (Entered: 04/03/2025)\". Also \"MOTION for leave to appear in Pro Hac Vice\" etc.\n\nFor significant terms of decrees snippet: same as decree duration snippet.\n\nWe need to carefully craft evidence text with verbatim. Let's copy exactly.\n\nFor causes snippet: we need separate entries. We can use the entire paragraph; but we need each cause separately. We can extract each cause phrase: \"retaliation and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\", \"ultra vires action by the President in violation of Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code\", \"deprivations of procedural due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment\", \"abrogation of property rights in a federal contract in violation of the Fifth Amendment\", \"arbitrary and irrational classification in violation of the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment\".\n\nEach will have evidence pointing to the snippet. Use same snippet for all but specify correct portion? We can use entire snippet but that includes all. But we may want to specify the relevant part. Provide evidence text as the snippet that includes that phrase.\n\nFor remedy sought: \"declaratory and injunctive relief\" and \"attorney’s fees and costs\". Provide evidence snippet containing that phrase.\n\nWe'll craft.\n\nNow we need to format JSON for append_checklist.\n\nLet's prepare patch array with multiple keys.\n\nWe must provide evidence array for each extracted value.\n\nLet's construct.\n\nWe'll need to include source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". For location: maybe \"tokens 8002-8202\" or \"page X\". We'll just put location \"tokens 8002-8202\".\n\nSimilarly for judge snippet: source_document: \"Order\", location \"tokens 943-1143\".\n\nFor opinions: source_document: \"Order\", location \"tokens 4300-4500\".\n\nFor related cases: source_document: \"Docket\", location \"tokens 0-436\".\n\nFor decree date: source_document: \"Order\", location \"tokens 2914-3114\".\n\nFor decree duration: same.\n\nFor factual basis: same as causes snippet.\n\nFor note important filings: source_document: \"Docket\", location \"tokens 0-436\".\n\nFor significant terms of decrees: same as decree duration snippet.\n\nLet's craft the JSON.\n\nBut we may exceed token limit? Append_checklist payload size fine.\n\nBut we must not include more keys than necessary? We can include many.\n\nLet's write.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Cause_of_Action\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"retaliation and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges claims against the government for (1) retaliation and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;
