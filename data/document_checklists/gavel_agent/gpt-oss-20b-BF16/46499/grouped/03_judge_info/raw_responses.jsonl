From search results we saw Judge Susan Illston and Judge Jeffrey White. Need distinct value(s). We should read more coverage maybe in Docket includes both. We saw matches. We need to capture all distinct judge names. Likely only Susan Illston appears in docket. Also Ex Parte Order includes Judge White. Should be two. So we need to read Docket further for other judge names. The Docket partially visited; we saw 5 matches, all with Susan Illston. But maybe other judge appears in docket? Let's search again for \"Judge \" pattern but we already did. But maybe other judge names like \"Judge\" with capital letter after. Could search for \"Judge [A-Z]\" again but we already captured. The search results in Docket were 5 matches, all referencing Susan Illston. There might be other judge names in other documents like Complaint, etc. But the requirement is from legal case documents. So we should search all documents for \"Judge \" pattern. But we have pattern results already. But maybe the Search had limited matches? We set pattern \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)\". That will capture two words. That covers Susan Illston, Jeffrey White. But maybe judge names with middle initial or three words? Might miss. But we can rely on these two. We should confirm in Ex Parte Order we found Jeffrey White. We saw \"Judicial Referral for Purpose of Determining Relationship of Cases re 25-cv-3140-JSW. Signed by Judge Susan Illston\" and earlier \"assigned to Judge Jeffrey White\". So we have two distinct names.\n\nWe need to append these to checklist. Use append_checklist with key First_and_Last_name_of_Judge, extracted entries for each name with evidence.\n\nWe need evidence: text snippet, source_document, location. We have token ranges. For each snippet: we can include snippet from Search result. For Susan Illston: we can use snippet from Docket match 1 or 3 etc. For Jeffrey White: snippet from Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order match 1. Provide location: page or token range? We can use token range.\n\nWe should check if any other judge names appear. Quick search in other documents maybe but not needed if we think only these two. But to be thorough, we could search all documents for \"Judge \" again. Already did. It found only those in docket and ex parte. But maybe other documents have \"Judge\" like \"United States District Judge\" which is a title but not a name. But there might be \"Judge\" used with names.

But we need distinct values. Should we include \"Jeffrey S. White\" as separate? The value is full name. In the doc, \"Jeffrey S. White\" appears. In earlier search we had \"Jeffrey White\". Should we treat as distinct? The definition: first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion provided. So if we have \"Jeffrey White\" and \"Jeffrey S.

Let's scan the matches: In Docket match 9 tokens 2093-2293 we saw \"Signed by Judge Jeffrey S. White\". In previous matches we had \"Judge Jeffrey White\" without S. So we have two distinct strings. Should we include both? The checklist should capture distinct values; yes. So we need to add \"Jeffrey S. White\" as a third value. Check if any other judge names like \"Judge Susan I. Illston\"? Not seen. In Ex Parte, \"SUSAN ILLSTON\" appears. That's same as Susan Illston. So we should include \"Susan Illston\" only.\n\nThus we need to append third value \"Jeffrey S.

Also \"United States District Judge\" lines show \"SUSAN ILLSTON\" etc. But we already captured those two.\n\nBut maybe other documents contain other judge names: maybe \"Judge White\" appears as \"Judge Jeffrey S. White\" with middle initial. Should we capture \"Jeffrey S. White\" as distinct? The requirement: \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge: The name of the presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided).\" So we should capture first and last name only, ignoring middle initial? The extracted value should be formatted as \"[full name]\". For \"Jeffrey S. White\", first and last name are \"Jeffrey White\" ignoring middle. But the text might include middle initial; we can still extract \"Jeffrey White\" by dropping middle. But we need to capture all distinct values. So we have Susan Illston, Jeffrey White. Are there others? Let's search for \"Judge\" but maybe there are other judges like \"Judge White\" and \"Judge Illston\" only. Could be \"Judge Smith\" etc. Let's search all documents again with regex that captures \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+\" but we already did that.

So we might want to capture \"Jeffrey White\" once.\n\nWe might also consider \"Judge Susan Illston\" appears many times. So we have two distinct names.\n\nNow we must ensure that we have appended them correctly. We already appended two values via append_checklist in step 3. But we need to confirm that the extracted values include evidence. The append_checklist step 3 included evidence from Docket and Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order. That seems fine. But we need to ensure that we didn't miss any evidence that would support the values. But it's fine.\n\nNow we need to check if there are any other judge names that might be present in other documents (Unvisited). We should search all documents again to confirm. We could call search_document_regex on \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" across all documents. But we already did that in step 4. It found 13 matches, all with Susan Illston and Jeffrey White. But maybe other documents contain judge names not captured by that regex due to formatting like \"United States District Judge Susan Illston\" or \"Judge Susan Illston\" etc. The regex should match \"Judge Susan Illston\". It matched many. But maybe there are other judge names like \"Judge John Doe\" that appear in other documents not in docket or order? The search already scanned all documents. So maybe no.\n\nThus we have all values. We just need to confirm that the extracted list is complete. We might consider removing duplicates or ensure uniqueness. We already have two distinct values. That is likely complete.\n\nWe need to make sure the checklist key is fully extracted. Should we update the checklist to replace the list? We used append_checklist earlier. But we might want to update to ensure the list contains exactly the two values and nothing else. But we currently have two entries. That is correct. But we could update to ensure no duplicates. But we only have two.\n\nThus we can stop. But we need to double-check that we didn't miss any judge names like \"Judge Jeffrey S. White\" where the extracted value might be \"Jeffrey White\" but we didn't include evidence that \"S.\" is omitted. But we can still capture \"Jeffrey White\" evidence from \"Judge Jeffrey S. White\" snippet. But we have evidence from Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order where it says \"Judge Jeffrey White\". That covers the name. So we are fine.\n\nThus we should stop. However, we might want to double-check if \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\" requires first and last only. We have \"Susan Illston\" and \"Jeffrey White\".

Could there be \"Judge\" in other docs like \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" etc. We need to ensure all unique judge names present in corpus.

That is complex. Alternatively, we can just search for \"Judge Jeffrey\" and \"Judge Susan\" or \"Judge\" without pattern. But we need to capture any new judge names. Let's search again using regex that captures \"Judge\" followed by any capitalized word sequence up to maybe 4 words, including initials with periods.

Let's attempt that.\n\nWe should search across all documents. After that, we will get any matches. We must then collect unique judge names. Already have two. If we find \"Judge Jeffrey S. White\", that is same judge with middle initial. Should we treat as distinct? It's the same judge; we should not duplicate the name. So we should unify. The extracted value should be full name. For \"Judge Jeffrey S. White\", full name is \"Jeffrey S. White\". For \"Judge Jeffrey White\", we might consider that as same judge but missing middle initial. Which is correct? The document may include both forms. We need to extract the most complete name. We should treat duplicates as same judge. So we need to dedupe. The extracted list for this key should contain unique names.\n\nThus we need to read from remaining documents to see if any other judge names appear: e.g., \"Judge John Doe\" etc. Let's search across all documents.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Judge\\\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+|(?:\\\\s+[A-Z]\\\\.))+)\", \"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\",\"MULTILINE\",\"DOTALL\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+|(?:\\s+[A-Z]\\.))+)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE", "MULTILINE", "DOTALL"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6403, "completion_tokens": 810, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences\",\"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\",\"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\",\"Notice of Motion and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order; Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Nationwide Temporary Restraining Order\"],\"pattern\":\"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences", "Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal", "Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction", "Notice of Motion and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order; Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Nationwide Temporary Restraining Order"], "pattern": "Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9720, "completion_tokens": 349, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have already extracted 2 values: Susan Illston and Jeffrey White. The summary shows keys with values: 1/1. So only one key, and it's filled. We need to ensure completeness: Did we capture all distinct judge names? The earlier steps found two names. But we should confirm that there are no other judge names in other documents. The search results earlier didn't find any others. But we might need to search the remaining unvisited documents to confirm no other judge names. The instruction: \"All distinct judge names (Susan Illston, Jeffrey White) have been extracted with evidence; no further judge names found in the corpus.\" That was Step 6. It indicated that after step 6, they concluded all distinct judge names found. But we still have unvisited documents. But step 6 might have been based on search across all documents. Step 6 says \"All distinct judge names (Susan Illston, Jeffrey White) have been extracted with evidence; no further judge names found in the corpus.\" That suggests they searched all documents. But maybe the search didn't capture all. But we have evidence from the matches. However, there might be other judge names like \"Honorable ...\" etc. But search patterns might have missed some. But we should trust the previous step? We need to see the context from step 6: it says \"All distinct judge names (Susan Illston, Jeffrey White) have been extracted with evidence; no further judge names found in the corpus.\" That implies that exhaustive search was done. But the step 6 used? It seems step 6 was a stop step, but we are still at step 10. Step 6 was earlier. Step 10 didn't find matches in 6 documents. Step 8 had many matches. So it seems all judge names are captured. The key has 2 values. The checklist has one key. So we are done. Must we ensure evidence? The append_checklist earlier appended 2 values. But need to confirm those entries have evidence. We must check if evidence was included. Step 3 and 5 were earlier attempts. Step 3 succeeded in appending 2 values with evidence. Step 3: \"Successfully appended 2 values for 1 key: First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\". So those values exist. So we have values and evidence. So the checklist is complete. So we should stop.\n\nBut we must ensure that checklists show the values. Let's check the status: \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Empty Keys: 0/1\". That means the key is filled. So we can stop. There's no Not Applicable. So decision: stop.\n\nThus output JSON with decision stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All required checklist items have been extracted: the two distinct judge names Susan Illston and Jeffrey White have been appended with evidence; no remaining keys or not applicable items remain.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All required checklist items have been extracted: the two distinct judge names Susan Illston and Jeffrey White have been appended with evidence; no remaining keys or not applicable items remain.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9853, "completion_tokens": 611, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
