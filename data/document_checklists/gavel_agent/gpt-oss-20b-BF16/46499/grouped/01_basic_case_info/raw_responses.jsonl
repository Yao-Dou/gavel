We have partial views of documents. The filelist shows 8 docs, partially visited: we have seen the first 110 tokens of many. We have seen some filings dates in the top lines. But we need all items.\n\nWe need Filing_Date: The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court. That likely appears in Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: \"Filed 04/11/25\". But may need date in full standard form? Should be \"04/11/25\" or could be \"April 11, 2025\". We need to capture all distinct values: likely only one filing date. We need evidence snippet.\n\nWho_are_the_Parties: description of each party: plaintiffs and defendants and their roles. We have names in Complaint For Declaratory: \"Andre Y. Bates (SBN 178170) ... Keliang (Clay) Zhu ... Yi Yao ... DEHENG LAW OFFICES PC\". But need to format as \"Plaintiff: [description]\" etc. Might need to parse from Docket which lists \"COMPLAINT against Todd M. Lyons, Krisit Noem\". Also \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" lists US Attorney etc. But we need parties in the case: likely plaintiffs: \"ZHUOER CHEN, et al.\"? Let's analyze.\n\nWe saw \"Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order\" has plaintiffs: \"ZHUOER CHEN, et al.\" and \"Plaintiffs,\". It might list defendants: \"United States\"? Not sure.\n\nLet's search for \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" patterns. But better to get full parties list. Might be in the Complaint or Docket. The Docket shows \"COMPLAINT against Todd M. Lyons, Krisit Noem\". That's defendants? Actually \"against Todd M. Lyons, Krisit Noem\" indicates plaintiffs suing those defendants. But the plaintiffs earlier are \"ZHUOER CHEN, et al.\"? Wait: The Docket shows \"COMPLAINT against Todd M. Lyons, Krisit Noem\". That might be the claim: The plaintiffs (Zhuoer Chen, etc.) are suing Todd M. Lyons and Krisit Noem. So parties: Plaintiffs: ZHUOER CHEN, et al. (maybe some others). Defendants: Todd M. Lyons, Krisit Noem.\n\nBut also the \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" lists U.S. Attorneys: Craig H. Missakian, Pamela T. Johann, Elizabeth D. Kurlan. These are attorneys for the United States, presumably representing the defendants. So the defendants are the United States? Wait, the case number is 3:25-cv-03292-SI. The complaint is \"against Todd M. Lyons, Krisit Noem\" but the defendants might be Todd M. Lyons and Krisit Noem. But the motion for stay pending appeal suggests defendants are the United States? That seems contradictory. Let's look at the docket: In the docket snippet, \"COMPLAINT against Todd M. Lyons, Krisit Noem ( Filing fee $ 405, receipt number ACANDC-20560323.). Injunction against the US government/official or APA vacatur requested.\" That indicates the complaint is against Todd M. Lyons, Krisit Noem, but also seeks injunction against the US government. So the US is also a defendant? This is complex. The parties would include: Plaintiffs: ZHUOER CHEN, et al. Defendants: Todd M. Lyons, Krisit Noem, United States (or US government). But we need to extract parties descriptions. The description includes role, capacity, office. For example, \"United States Attorney\" etc.\n\nWe need to capture all distinct parties.\n\nWe need to search for \"United States\" or \"US\" as defendants. Might need to read more to see.\n\nWe also need Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: designation: whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or individuals. The text likely includes \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual\". Let's search.\n\nType_of_Counsel: category of legal representation for each party. For plaintiffs, counsel: Deheng Law Offices PC, maybe others. For defendants: US Attorney etc.\n\nWe have partial context. We might need to read more of the Complaint to capture all parties and counsel. Let's read more tokens from Complaint For Declaratory. The first 110 tokens only show header and first few names. We should read more.\n\nLet's read from token 110 to 1000 maybe. That will capture more names and parties and counsel. Also read from Docket maybe to get parties list.\n\nSo next action: read_document for Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, from token 110 to maybe 2000? But the doc is 8158 tokens, so we can read from 110 to 110+? We might want to read 2000 tokens to capture names. Let's read 110-2110 (1000 tokens). That should be safe.\n\nAlso read from Docket to get parties list. The Docket is 7889 tokens. We have seen first 162 tokens. We might read from 162 to maybe 2000 tokens to capture parties.\n\nBut we only need one action per turn. We could batch reading both documents? The instruction: choose exactly one action. So we can do one read_document at a time. We need to get more evidence. Let’s first read the Complaint.\n\nWe'll call read_document for Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, start_token 110, end_token 1110 (1000 tokens). That should give more names.\n\nAlso we may need to read Docket for parties. But we can do that in next turn. For now, read Complaint.\n\nWe will produce function call: read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":110,\"end_token\":1110}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 110, "end_token": 1110}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4515, "completion_tokens": 1273, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
{"step": 4, "run_id": "cd97dc25-109c-48f4-9f0d-1cf4d55a272b", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T20:26:02.919956-05:00", "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to extract 4 items: Filing_Date, Who_are_the_Parties, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, Type_of_Counsel.\n\nWe have some data from step 3: Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, tokens 110-1110. It includes Filing date? The file header earlier had \"Case 3:25-cv-03292-SI Document 1 Filed 04/11/25 Page 1 of 14\". That is a filing date: 04/11/25, i.e., April 11, 2025. Also other documents have other dates: 08/08/25, 07/29/25 etc. But filing date refers \"the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So the earliest filing date is 04/11/25 in that complaint. We can extract that.\n\nWe also need Who_are_the_Parties: need descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and roles. In the complaint snippet, we see \"Plaintiffs: ZHUOER CHEN, an individual; MENGCHENG YU, an individual; JIARONG OUYANG, an individual; GEXI GUO, an individual; vs. KRISTI NOEM, in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; and TODD LYONS, in his official capacity as Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\" So we can extract those.\n\nWe also need Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: The snippet says \"Plaintiffs\" but does it indicate class action? Not explicitly. We need to determine if plaintiffs proceed as a class action or individual. The complaint may not be a class action; likely they are individual plaintiffs. But we need evidence. The text shows \"Plaintiffs\" but no mention of class. So we can mark as Individual, described as [list of individuals]. The extracted value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ZHUOER CHEN, MENGCHENG YU, JIARONG OUYANG, GEXI GUO.\" We need evidence snippet.\n\nWe also need Type_of_Counsel: categories of legal representation for each party. The snippet lists attorneys for plaintiffs: \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo\". These are presumably private counsel. For defendants, we need to find their counsel. In the \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" snippet, the attorneys: \"CRAIG H. MISSAKIAN (CABN 125202) United States Attorney; PAMELA T. JOHANN (CABN 145558) Chief, Civil Division; ELIZABETH D. KURLAN (CABN 255869) Assistant United States Attorney\". So those are government counsel. Also maybe other documents have other counsel. But we can extract these.\n\nThus we need to read more of the complaint to capture the attorneys list maybe further. The snippet shows \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo\". That is enough.\n\nAlso capture defendant counsel: \"United States Attorney\" etc.\n\nThus we should read more of the Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal to get defendant counsel. But we already have that snippet in search result. It includes the names and positions. We can use that as evidence.\n\nWe also need to get the Filing Date from the complaint header. The snippet included \"Document 1 Filed 04/11/25\". So evidence: \"Case 3:25-cv-03292-SI Document 1 Filed 04/11/25 Page 1 of 14\". We can use that.\n\nThus we need to extract 4 keys: Filing_Date, Who_are_the_Parties, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, Type_of_Counsel.\n\nWe need to add entries using append_checklist or update_checklist. Since we are building from scratch, we can use append_checklist for each key or a single patch with all keys.\n\nWe need to ensure evidence includes text, source_document, location. For location, we can use page numbers or token ranges if available. We have token ranges from search results.\n\nFor Filing_Date: evidence text: \"Case 3:25-cv-03292-SI Document 1 Filed 04/11/25 Page 1 of 14\". Source_document: \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". Location: \"Page 1\".\n\nFor Who_are_the_Parties: we need evidence for plaintiffs and defendants. For plaintiffs, evidence text: \"ZHUOER CHEN, an individual; MENGCHENG YU, an individual; JIARONG OUYANG, an individual; GEXI GUO, an individual;\" Source_document \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". Location: \"Page 2\". For defendants: evidence text: \"KRISTI NOEM, in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; and TODD LYONS, in his official capacity as Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement;\" Source_document \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". Location: \"Page 2\".\n\nWe can combine both as single entry? The checklist expects separate entries per value. But \"Who_are_the_Parties\" is a list of parties. We can have multiple entries: one for each party? The instruction: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\"\n\nSo we need separate entries: \"Plaintiff: ZHUOER CHEN, an individual\" etc. So many entries: 4 plaintiffs + 2 defendants = 6 entries.\n\nThus we need to append 6 entries under key Who_are_the_Parties. Each with evidence.\n\nClass_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: single entry: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ZHUOER CHEN, MENGCHENG YU, JIARONG OUYANG, GEXI GUO.\" Evidence: the same snippet of plaintiff list. Source: \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". Location: \"Page 2\".\n\nType_of_Counsel: For each party? The description: categories of legal representation for each party. So entries: \"Plaintiff: Private Counsel\" for plaintiffs? But we might need to specify which counsel. The snippet lists attorneys for plaintiffs: \"Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo\" - These are presumably private counsel. So entry: \"Plaintiff: Private Counsel\" evidence: \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo\". Source: \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". Location: \"Page 2\".\n\nFor defendants: counsel: \"Defendant: Government Counsel\" evidence: names of US Attorneys etc. We can create entry: \"Defendant: Government Counsel\" evidence: \"CRAIG H. MISSAKIAN (CABN 125202) United States Attorney; PAMELA T. JOHANN (CABN 145558) Chief, Civil Division; ELIZABETH D. KURLAN (CABN 255869) Assistant United States Attorney\". Source: \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\". Location: \"Page 1\" (assuming).\n\nThus we need to read the Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal document to get the counsel list. We have a snippet from search result, but not the full text. We can read that snippet. We need to use read_document on that doc. The snippet shows tokens 0-110 of that doc. That includes the counsel names. We can use that as evidence.\n\nThus we need to read that doc. There's partial coverage: 0-110 tokens. That includes the names. So we can use that.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, tokens 0-110 already read, but we need to confirm we have evidence of counsel. We already have seen snippet. But we need to read the doc to capture the evidence text fully. We can read again token 0-110. That is within 10,000 tokens. So we can call read_document.\n\nThus the next action: read_document on \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\", start_token 0, end_token 110.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":110}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 110}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5695, "completion_tokens": 1854, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
{"step": 5, "run_id": "cd97dc25-109c-48f4-9f0d-1cf4d55a272b", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T20:26:46.316766-05:00", "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to extract 4 items: Filing_Date, Who_are_the_Parties, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, Type_of_Counsel. We have some documents partially read. We have the Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (tokens 0-1110). That likely contains parties, filing date, etc. We also have Docket (tokens 0-162) which shows filing date 2025-04-11. Also the earlier search results had patterns like \"Filed 04/11/25\". So Filing_Date likely 04/11/25 or 2025-04-11. Need to capture. But we need to provide evidence from a document. The complaint shows \"Filed 04/11/25\" in header. In the read_document we saw \"Case 3:25-cv-03292-SI Document 1 Filed 04/11/25 Page 2 of 14\" near line 28. So that's evidence.\n\nWe also need Who_are_the_Parties: plaintiff and defendant descriptions. In the read_document we saw \"Plaintiffs:\" line 13? Actually lines 11-13 show \"ZHUOER CHEN, an individual; MENGCHENG YU, an individual; JIARONG OUYANG, an individual; and GEXI GUO, an individual; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY Plaintiffs, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\". And defendants: KRISTI NOEM, in her official capacity as Secretary of DHS; and TODD LYONS, in his official capacity as Acting Director of U.S. ICE. So we need to extract formatted values: 'Plaintiff: ...' etc. For each party? The requirement: \"Descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\" So each party should be separate entry. So we need to create entries for each plaintiff (Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, Gexi Guo) and each defendant (Kristi Noem, Todd Lyons). Possibly also include their roles. The description includes role: \"an individual\" for plaintiffs, and \"in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\" for Noem, \"in his official capacity as Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\" for Lyons. Good.\n\nNext, Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: designates whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs (with brief description). From the complaint, it appears individual plaintiffs: the four individuals. The complaint header might say \"Plaintiffs, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\" but not class. Likely individual. The description: 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [list]' or similar. So we need one entry: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, Gexi Guo.\" We should include evidence.\n\nType_of_Counsel: category of legal representation for each party. The complaint lists attorneys for plaintiffs: \"Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo\" but those are names of plaintiffs, not counsel. Wait, under \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs\" earlier: \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo\" seems like maybe the attorneys have same names as plaintiffs? That seems odd. Actually earlier: \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo\" but those names are same as plaintiffs. Maybe they are representing themselves? That would be private counsel or self-representation. The \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs\" section lists names of attorneys, but they might be the plaintiffs themselves listed as counsel. Might need to view more of the complaint to confirm counsel for defendants. That info may be in later pages of complaint. We have read only up to token 1110, which includes header and part of introduction. The attorneys for plaintiffs section appears: \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo\". That may indicate they are their own counsel (self-represented). For defendants, we have no counsel info in the snippet. But we may need to search for \"Counsel\" or \"Attorney\" in the documents. We could search for \"Counsel\" or \"Attorney\" in the complaint. But we may need to read more tokens beyond 1110. The complaint has 8,158 tokens. We only read 1110; we need more to see if there are counsel for defendants.\n\nBut the Type_of_Counsel likely includes categories: \"Private counsel\" for plaintiffs (they self-represent or maybe private counsel). For defendants, maybe \"Government counsel\" as the defendants are government officers; but the defendants' counsel might be the U.S. Attorney's Office. We may need to find that info. It might be in the defendants' motion or in other documents. For example, the Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal lists attorneys: \"CRAIG H. MISSAKIAN (CABN 125202) United States Attorney\" etc. That appears to be the attorneys representing the defendants, so government counsel. So we can extract Type_of_Counsel entries: 'Plaintiff: Private counsel (self-represented)' or something. But we must follow the format: 'Plaintiff: [description]'. Wait, for Type_of_Counsel, we need category of legal representation for each party. Might list: 'Plaintiff: Private counsel' and 'Defendant: Government counsel'. But also could have multiple entries per party. The instructions: \"The category of legal representation for each party (e.g., private counsel, legal services/public defender, public interest organization such as the ACLU, government counsel).\" So we can produce entries like 'Plaintiff: Private counsel' (or 'Plaintiff: Self-represented'). For each party? But we need to output for each party? Probably one entry per party type. But if multiple parties for each side, maybe multiple entries. But we can group: 'Plaintiff: Private counsel (self-represented)' and 'Defendant: Government counsel (U.S. Attorney)'. Let's look for evidence. In the Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, the attorneys are listed: \"CRAIG H. MISSAKIAN (CABN 125202) United States Attorney ...\". That indicates government counsel. So we can create entry for Defendant: Government counsel. For Plaintiff counsel, we need evidence. In the complaint snippet, \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo\". But those are same names as plaintiffs. So we might infer they are representing themselves. But we need to provide evidence. The snippet lines 6-7 show that. So we can create entry: 'Plaintiff: Self-represented' or 'Plaintiff: Private counsel (self-represented)'. Provide evidence snippet.\n\nBut we also might need to read more of the complaint to confirm if there are other counsel. But we can still proceed and maybe later update.\n\nThus next step: read more of the complaint to capture the \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs\" line (already present) and \"Attorneys for Defendants\" if any. We have the snippet. The snippet lines 6-7 show attorneys for plaintiffs. We also have the Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal snippet showing attorneys for defendants. That should give Type_of_Counsel.\n\nThus we can extract all four keys in one go: we can append checklists for each key with multiple entries.\n\nBut we need to ensure we provide evidence for each extracted value. We need to provide text snippet, source document, location. The location can be \"page 2 of 14\" or token offset. We have token offsets? We only have tokens 0-1110 read. We can provide location as \"Page 2 of 14\" for the complaint. For the Defendants' Motion snippet, we have page 1 of 17.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with all four keys. But we need to be careful: we haven't appended any yet. We should ensure we include all values.\n\nWe need to extract:\n\nFiling_Date: \"04/11/25\" with evidence snippet from complaint header. We can also use Docket snippet \"2025-04-11\". But we should use the same format. Use \"04/11/25\" as per complaint. Provide evidence snippet from complaint header: \"Case 3:25-cv-03292-SI     Document 1     Filed 04/11/25     Page 2 of 14\". That is fine.\n\nWho_are_the_Parties: list each plaintiff and defendant.\n\nPlaintiff: Zhuoer Chen, an individual. (from lines 11-12). We need evidence snippet. We can use lines 11-12. Provide location \"Page 2 of 14\" or token 11-13. Similarly for others.\n\nDefendant: Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Provide snippet lines 16-17. Defendant: Todd Lyons, in his official capacity as Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Provide snippet lines 17-18.\n\nClass_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, Gexi Guo.\" Provide evidence from lines 11-13.\n\nType_of_Counsel: For Plaintiff: Self-represented (Private counsel). Provide evidence from lines 6-7: \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo\". For Defendant: Government counsel (United States Attorney). Provide evidence from Defendants' Motion snippet lines 1-3: \"CRAIG H. MISSAKIAN (CABN 125202) United States Attorney\" etc.\n\nWe need to format each extracted entry: for each key, array of extracted entries, each with value and evidence array.\n\nWe can do batch patch with 4 keys. Use append_checklist.\n\nThus next action: call append_checklist with patch containing 4 items.\n\nLet's construct JSON.\n\nNote: For values, we need to include exactly the extracted string. For parties, each entry should be a separate extracted value. So for Who_are_the_Parties, we need separate entries for each party (5 entries). For Type_of_Counsel, two entries.\n\nThus patch for Who_are_the_Parties: key \"Who_are_the_Parties\", extracted array of 5 entries.\n\nFor Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: one entry.\n\nFor Filing_Date: one entry.\n\nFor Type_of_Counsel: two entries.\n\nEvidence: for each value, evidence array with one object containing text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nLet's assemble.\n\nWe need to provide evidence text exactly as snippet. We can use the lines we saw.\n\nFor Filing_Date evidence snippet: \"Case 3:25-cv-03292-SI     Document 1     Filed 04/11/25     Page 2 of 14\"\n\nFor Plaintiff: Zhuoer Chen: evidence snippet: \"ZHUOER CHEN, an individual; MENGCHENG  Case No. 3:25-cv-03292 YU, an individual; JIARONG OUYANG, an individual; and GEXI GUO, an individual;\" Actually this snippet includes all four names. We need separate entries. But that snippet includes all four. We can split or use same snippet for each? For each extracted entry, we can provide the same snippet for all four? But better to use snippet that includes each name. But we need separate evidence for each. We could provide snippet that includes the name. For example for Zhuoer Chen: \"ZHUOER CHEN, an individual;\" for Mengcheng Yu: \"MENGCHENG YU, an individual;\" etc. But the snippet lines 11-12 show combined. We can use the combined snippet but specify location. But the evidence snippet should verbatim snippet. We can include the full snippet and it's okay. But we need to provide evidence for each. Perhaps better to provide the combined snippet for all four entries. But that would duplicate evidence. That may be okay.\n\nAlternatively, we can read more to isolate each line.

But check if any missing values? Filing_Date: could be multiple filings? There were other filings: first amended complaint filed 07/29/25, Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction 07/30/25, etc. The requirement: extract all distinct values of each checklist item that directly matches definition. Filing_Date is the calendar date on which lawsuit was first filed/initiated. That is first filing: 04/11/25. So we have correct. If there are multiple filings for other documents, but they are subsequent amendments, not first filing. So we only need first filing. So that's fine.\n\nWho_are_the_Parties: We extracted all parties from complaint: four plaintiffs and two defendants. Are there any others? Possibly the defendants list includes \"United States Attorney\" etc but that's counsel. The plaintiffs are individuals. The defendants are government officials. Are there any other parties like \"United States Attorney\" but that's counsel. Also maybe the second document might list \"Defendants\" as \"United States Attorney\" etc but that's counsel. So parties extracted seem correct.\n\nClass_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: We recorded Individual. Need to confirm if any class action? The complaint appears to be individual plaintiffs. So okay.\n\nType_of_Counsel: We have plaintiff counsel: \"Self‑represented (Private counsel)\" and defendant counsel: \"Government counsel\" (United States Attorney). Are there any other counsel? Possibly the defendants are represented by \"United States Attorney\" etc. We have three government counsel entries. But we only recorded one entry for defendant: \"Government counsel (United States Attorney)\". But the requirement: list category of legal representation for each party. So we might need separate entries for each defendant's counsel? The plaintiff counsel: \"Self‑represented (Private counsel)\" is one entry. But defendant counsel: there are three attorneys: Craig M. Miskakian, Pamela T. Johann, Elizabeth D. Kurlan. They are all \"Government counsel\". We could treat as one entry? But it says category of legal representation for each party. So each party? For defendants, each party is a government official: \"Kristi Noem\" and \"Todd Lyons\". Their counsel is the government counsel. So we can list \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Attorney)\" once. But maybe we need separate entries for each defendant? The earlier extraction had one entry for defendant counsel. That seems acceptable.\n\nCheck if any other parties: There's also \"Defendants' Motion\" includes attorneys for defendants but not parties.\n\nThus all keys appear complete.\n\nBut we need to ensure that we have evidence for Type_of_Counsel. The earlier extraction only gave one evidence for plaintiff counsel. But plaintiff counsel: \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, and Gexi Guo\". That indicates they have attorneys. So evidence is fine.\n\nFor defendant counsel: we had evidence for each attorney. But we only gave one entry \"Defendant: Government counsel (United States Attorney)\". That evidence includes the three attorneys. That should be fine.\n\nThus all four keys are filled. No Not Applicable.\n\nWe need to confirm that no missing values: Filing_Date: only one. Who_are_the_Parties: six values. Class_Action: one value. Type_of_Counsel: two values. That's all.\n\nWe should use `get_checklist` to confirm. But since we have all keys with values, we can stop. But the instructions: stop only when every key is either complete or Not Applicable. They are complete. So we can stop.\n\nThus answer: stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All four checklist items have been fully extracted with evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All four checklist items have been fully extracted with evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7066, "completion_tokens": 787, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But we need to ensure completeness: do we have all distinct values? Perhaps there are additional parties or counsel in other documents not yet read. The initial extraction may miss some parties or counsel in other documents. Also maybe the filing date appears in other documents like the docket, but we only need one date. But need to check if there are multiple filing dates? The complaint filing date seems 04/11/25. There may be other documents filed later, but the filing date is the first filed lawsuit. That is likely the complaint date. Also class action vs individual: the complaint says individual plaintiffs. That seems correct.\n\nBut we might have missed some parties: maybe there are additional plaintiffs or defendants in other documents (e.g., second amended complaint). Also counsel: maybe there are separate counsel lists in other documents such as the docket or motions. The system extracted plaintiff counsel as self-represented (private counsel) but maybe they have actual counsel names. The complaint lists \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs\" but names are the same as plaintiffs. So maybe it's self-represented. The defendants counsel: government counsel. Good.\n\nBut there may be additional parties: maybe the first amended complaint includes additional parties or additional defendants? We need to verify.\n\nCheck the docket: It might list docket entries with parties, but could include original parties only. But we need to extract \"Who_are_the_Parties\" as each party description. That seems to be the plaintiffs and defendants. Possibly there are more defendants? The complaint lists only Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons. But maybe there are others? The docket might show more. Also the order or motions might include additional parties such as the Department of Homeland Security, etc. But the parties are likely the same.\n\nBut maybe the complaint includes \"United States Department of Homeland Security\" as a defendant? The defendants are \"Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; and Todd Lyons, in his official capacity as Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\". So those are the defendants. There may not be other parties.\n\nBut we should double-check the first amended complaint for any new parties. Let's search in the first amended complaint for \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\". Also check \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs\" maybe lists other counsel. Also check the docket for any additional parties.\n\nAlso, check for \"Class Action\" yes we have Individual. But maybe there's a class action certificate? No.\n\nAlso, need to check if Type_of_Counsel includes defendants' counsel as government counsel. That seems correct. But there might be additional counsel like the Department of Justice? The counsel list might be more detailed.\n\nWe need to ensure we have all distinct values. The current extraction includes 6 values for Who_are_the_Parties: four plaintiffs and two defendants. That seems correct. But maybe the complaint also lists \"U.S. Department of Homeland Security\" as a defendant? Actually the defendant is Kristi Noem in official capacity as Secretary of DHS, but not the agency itself. The attorney list includes \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs\" but no counsel for defendants. So Type_of_Counsel includes plaintiff: Self-represented, and defendants: government counsel. But maybe there's also other counsel like \"United States Attorney\" etc. We have that.\n\nBut we might have missed the \"Defendant: U.S. Department of Homeland Security\" as a party? The complaint might mention that the defendant is the Department of Homeland Security. But the text shows \"Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\". That covers that.\n\nBut maybe we should verify if there are other parties in the docket: e.g., \"Department of Homeland Security\" or \"Department of Justice\". Let's search docket for \"Department of Homeland Security\" or \"Department of Justice\". Also check for \"United States\" maybe.\n\nAlso check for \"Court\" maybe.\n\nAlso, check the First Amended Complaint for any new parties or additional counsel.\n\nLet's perform a regex search for \"Defendant:\" or \"Defendants\" or \"Plaintiff:\" in the First Amended Complaint. Also search for \"Attorneys for\" to see if counsel list changes.\n\nAlso search for \"Filed\" to find filing date in other documents. But we already have filing date.\n\nAlso search for \"Class Action\" maybe.\n\nLet's use search_document_regex on the First Amended Complaint for \"Filed\" to confirm filing date. Also for \"Defendant\" and \"Plaintiff\".\n\nOk.
