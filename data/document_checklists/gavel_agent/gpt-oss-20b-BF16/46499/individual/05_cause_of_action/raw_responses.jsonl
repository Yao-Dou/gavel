We have 8 documents. None of the earlier regex searches found matches. So we need to locate cause of action within complaint or other documents. Usually in a complaint, the cause of action is listed in the \"WHEREFORE\" or \"CLAIMS FOR RELIEF\" section. We need to search for patterns like \"claim\" or \"cause of action\" maybe not present. We can search for \"Claim\" or \"claim for\" or \"claims for relief\" or \"complaint alleges\" but the requirement is to extract the cause of action, e.g., \"Title II of the ADA\", \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", etc. So we need to find statutes or legal vehicles. In the complaint, likely there will be \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" etc. Let's search for specific patterns like \"42 U.S.C.\" or \"ADA\" or \"Title II\" or \"Tennessee\" etc. But we don't know what the case is. Probably a plaintiff sued the city for discrimination. Let's search for \"§\" or \"section\" or \"42 U.S.C.\" We can use regex pattern to find \"42 U.S.C.\" etc.\n\nBetter: Use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern: \"42 U.S.C.\" or \"U.S.C.\" or \"Title II of the ADA\" or \"ADA\" etc. But might be many matches. We can use a broad pattern \"§\" though. But we need to avoid capturing all matches. Maybe use regex: \"§\\s*\\d+(\\.\\d+)?\".\n\nBut simpler: search for \"§\" and see context. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents for pattern: \"§\". That will return many matches but we can then read a few. But we need to find all distinct cause of actions; may appear in the complaint.\n\nAlternatively, we could read the first document, \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" 8,158 tokens. That's likely the main complaint. Let's read token range 0-8000 to capture entire. That's within 10k. So we can read entire complaint. That will allow us to find all causes. Then parse.

We've read a large portion of the Complaint. We need to identify cause of action. In the Complaint, it states \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action)\". So cause of action: Administrative Procedure Act. Also possibly \"Administrative Procedure Act – Contrary to Constitutional Right\". Also \"Fifth Amendment – Procedural Due Process Violation\". Also \"Violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment\". Also \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" maybe. We need distinct values. The complaint also references APA and Declaratory Judgment Act. In the claim for relief, we see 4 claims: APA, APA (contrary to constitutional right), Fifth Amendment procedural due process, Equal Protection Clause. Also possibly \"Administrative Procedure Act\" is the cause. Also maybe \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" as cause. But the cause of action is the legal vehicle used to bring the claims: statutes that create a private right of action. APA creates cause of action. Declaratory Judgment Act also. Fifth Amendment claims are constitutional rights; but cause of action maybe the Declaratory Judgment Act or the APA. Also \"Administrative Procedure Act\" is a statute. So extract: \"Administrative Procedure Act\" and \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" and maybe \"Fifth Amendment\" as cause, but the instruction says do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments). So exclude Fifth Amendment. So we should include \"Administrative Procedure Act\" and \"Declaratory Judgment Act\". Also maybe \"Equal Protection Clause\" is a constitutional right, so exclude. Also \"Title II of ADA\" etc. So only APA and Declaratory Judgment Act. Also \"Administrative Procedure Act\" appears multiple times. So we need unique values: \"Administrative Procedure Act\" and \"Declaratory Judgment Act\". Also maybe \"Section 701–706 of APA\" but that is part of APA. So we should extract those two.\n\nNow we need evidence. We have a snippet from the complaint. We need to find text that mentions APA and Declaratory Judgment Act. In the read_document snippet we saw \"FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action)\" and \"Plaintiffs bring this action under the APA and the Declaratory Judgment Act\". So we should capture that sentence. Let's search for \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" in the document. It appears near line 26: \"Plaintiffs bring this action under the APA and the Declaratory Judgment Act\". We'll need to locate token range. We have read 0-8000 tokens, which covers that. We can use search_document_regex to find \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" and \"Administrative Procedure Act\" patterns. Let's do a regex search for both.

We have seen in the complaint that the claims are under APA. The cause of action is likely the Administrative Procedure Act. Also Declaratory Judgment Act maybe. Also maybe Fifth Amendment and Equal Protection but those are constitutional rights not cause of action. The complaint says \"Plaintiffs challenge ICE’s actions under the APA\". So cause_of_action = \"Administrative Procedure Act\" (APA). Also maybe \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" as a cause of action? The complaint says \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" is referenced when they seek declaratory judgment. But is that a cause of action? It could be. But we need distinct values. We should check other documents: first amended complaint might also include APA, Declaratory Judgment Act. Also motions mention APA. The order for preliminary injunction says \"Administrative Procedure Act\". The motion for preliminary injunction references APA. So we likely have at least APA and Declaratory Judgment Act.\n\nLet's search for \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" in documents. We can use search_document_regex on all documents for that phrase. That will give us matches. Then we can append both causes.\n\nWe also need evidence snippet. We'll provide text snippet from the complaint that indicates APA, e.g., \"challenge ICE’s actions under the APA\". Also snippet for Declaratory Judgment Act: maybe \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" appears. Let's search.\n\nAlso maybe \"Fifth Amendment\" is not cause of action. So we only need APA and Declaratory Judgment Act.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex for \"Administrative Procedure Act\" and \"Declaratory Judgment Act\".

Let's search for \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" in all docs.\n\nAlso maybe \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" appears only in complaint. We'll search.\n\nLet's choose search_document_regex for pattern \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" with flags IGNORECASE.\n\nAlso maybe we need to read the snippet to confirm it's cause of action.

We need to find all distinct causes of action. Likely the pleadings list claims: APA, Declaratory Judgment Act, Fifth Amendment, Equal Protection Clause, etc. But the cause of action refers to legal vehicle used to bring the claims, e.g., Administrative Procedure Act, Declaratory Judgment Act. Also possibly \"Section 1201(i)\" but that's a statutory provision used as cause? But it's part of the claim. The instructions: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens).\" So \"Administrative Procedure Act\" qualifies. \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" qualifies. Also maybe \"Section 1201(i)\"? That is a statutory provision but not necessarily a cause; it's part of the claim to challenge state action. But likely \"Administrative Procedure Act\" is the primary cause. Also \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" is a cause. Also maybe \"Equal Protection Clause\" is a constitutional claim, but the cause is the Fifth Amendment? Actually \"Fifth Amendment\" is a constitutional right but not a cause of action; it's a claim. The cause of action is the legal vehicle: \"Administrative Procedure Act,\" \"Declaratory Judgment Act.\" Also \"Section 1201(i)\" is part of the claim but not a separate cause. The \"Administrative Procedure Act\" appears in many claims. Also \"Section 1201(i)\" is a statutory provision but the claim is \"Violation of Section 1201(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\" That is a cause? It might be considered a cause of action because it's a specific statutory provision that creates a private right of action for violations. So we might include it. Also \"Section 1201(i)\" is a cause. Also \"Section 1201(i)\" appears in the First Amended Complaint. Also \"Section 1201(i)\" is part of the claim: \"Plaintiffs challenge State’s revocations under Section 1201(i).\" So yes.\n\nAlso \"Section 1201(i) of the INA\" is a cause of action.\n\nAlso \"Section 1201(i)\" is a statutory provision that may create a private right of action. The cause of action might be \"Section 1201(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\" or \"Section 1201(i) of the INA.\" Also \"Section 1201(i)\" is clearly a cause. So we should extract that.\n\nAlso \"Section 1201(i)\" could be considered a cause.\n\nAlso \"Section 1201(i)\" is a specific statutory provision. Also \"Section 1201(i)\" is not the same as \"Section 1201(i)\" but \"8 U.S.C. § 1201(i)\" is the proper citation.\n\nAlso \"Section 1201(i)\" might be extracted. Also \"Section 1201(i)\" might appear as \"8 U.S.C. § 1201(i)\". We need to capture unique values. So we will have at least \"Administrative Procedure Act\" and \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" and \"8 U.S.C. § 1201(i)\".\n\nAlso maybe \"Section 1201(i)\" appears as \"Section 1201(i)\" only. But also \"Section 1201(i)\" is part of the complaint. So we will extract that.\n\nAlso \"Administrative Procedure Act\" appears as \"Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\". Also \"Administrative Procedure Act\" sometimes preceded by \"APA\". We will extract \"Administrative Procedure Act\" as the cause of action.\n\nAlso \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" appears as \"Declaratory Judgment Act\". So extract that.\n\nAlso \"Section 1201(i)\" appears as \"Section 1201(i)\". So extract that.\n\nAlso maybe \"Section 1201(i)\" is not explicitly referencing the INA, but the citation may include \"8 U.S.C. § 1201(i)\". So we should capture that.\n\nAlso we might extract \"Section 1201(i)\" as \"8 U.S.C. § 1201(i)\".\n\nAlso other cause of action: \"Section 1201(i)\" is the same. So only those three.\n\nAlso \"Section 1201(i)\" appears in First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. So we need to read that portion to capture evidence.\n\nWe have partial coverage of that document: tokens 4120-4320, 9006-9308, etc. The match 2 of First Amended Complaint had tokens 4120-4320 which included the text referencing Section 1201(i). So we have evidence. Also match 4 included similar. So we have evidence for Section 1201(i). Also the earlier match 1 had \"Administrative Procedure Act\" in the Complaint. Also the earlier match 2 had \"Administrative Procedure Act\" again. So evidence present.\n\nWe need to extract and append. We need to ensure we don't duplicate. We need to use append_checklist. We'll create 3 entries.\n\nWe need to include evidence: text snippet, source_document, location. Use location e.g., \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief - Page X\" or token range.\n\nWe have evidence from the Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: tokens 1325-1525 include \"Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”)\". Also tokens 2714-2914 include \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" but that snippet didn't show. Wait match 1 for Declaratory Judgment Act had tokens 2714-2914 but the snippet didn't show the text \"Declaratory Judgment Act\". It shows the same as earlier. Actually that snippet shows \"entry to the United\". Wait the snippet for Declaratory Judgment Act from Complaint matched 2714-2914 but the snippet in the summary looked like it didn't show the phrase. But the snippet might include that phrase earlier. But we can still use it.\n\nAlso we need evidence for \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" maybe from match 1 of the complaint. Let's search again for \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" in the Complaint. We have match 1 tokens 2714-2914, showing the snippet:\n\n```\nentry to the United \n 14  States; SEVIS status governs presence and eligibility to study while in the U.S. Once admitted in \n 15  F-1 status, students are allowed to remain in the country as long as they maintain compliance \n 16  with 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f), ... \n 17  academic standing.  15.  DHS regulations provide only limited grounds under 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d) for \n 18  ... \n```\n\nActually that snippet didn't show \"Declaratory Judgment Act\". So maybe the snippet is wrong; maybe the match included the phrase but the context didn't show due to truncated snippet. But we might still use other evidence. But we can search again for \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" in the Complaint. The earlier search found 1 match. Let's find the text again. The match 1 tokens 2714-2914. But the snippet might not show the phrase due to truncated. But we can capture the evidence from that match. But maybe we should verify by reading that range to confirm.\n\nBut we can also search in the document for \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" via search_document_regex again. But we should not waste tokens. But we can read the portion to confirm. We can read tokens 2600-2800 of the Complaint.\n\nWe need to decide next action: read_document of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 2600-2800. This will give evidence for Declaratory Judgment Act.\n\nAlso we can read tokens 4000-4200 of First Amended Complaint to capture Section 1201(i). The snippet we already have match 2 (4120-4320) includes Section 1201(i). But we might need to confirm. But we have evidence.\n\nAlso we need evidence for Administrative Procedure Act. We have match 2 tokens 1325-1525. Good.\n\nThus we need to read a few more windows.\n\nWe should also check if any other cause of action appears: \"Section 1201(i)\" we have. There might be \"Section 1201(i)\" plus \"Administrative Procedure Act\" plus \"Declaratory Judgment Act\".\n\nAlso maybe \"Section 1201(i)\" appears in other documents like Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order, but we already have evidence.\n\nSo next action: read more of Complaint to get Declaratory Judgment Act evidence. Then append. We'll need to use append_checklist to add entries.\n\nLet's read tokens 2600-2800 of Complaint. This is within 0-8000 coverage. We'll read that range.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":2600,\"end_token\":2800}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 2600, "end_token": 2800}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 16755, "completion_tokens": 1890, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Since we already have matches from search_document_regex for APA and Declaratory Judgment Act. We need to extract that the cause of action includes APA and Declaratory Judgment Act. We might need to capture the exact text of the cause. For example, the complaint states: \"Plaintiffs bring this action under the APA and the Declaratory Judgment Act to challenge ICE’s illegal termination of their SEVIS records.\" That's a cause of action. We can capture APA and Declaratory Judgment Act as separate causes. Also maybe 5 U.S.C. § 701–706? But those are procedural? 5 U.S.C. § 701–706 are the APA statutory provisions, but the cause is APA. Also \"5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)\" etc. But cause of action is the APA itself. Also \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" is cause. We need to identify all distinct causes. Possibly the \"Administrative Procedure Act\" (APA) and \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" (DJA). Also maybe \"Equal Protection Clause\" is a right, not a cause. So only those.\n\nWe need to produce evidence from the text. We have read tokens 2600-2800 and earlier.

Are there other cause of action values in other documents? Likely the same causes appear in other complaints. Also maybe \"Administrative Procedure Act\" is repeated; we need unique values. Also maybe \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" present. Also maybe \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" is same as \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" - no duplicates. Also maybe \"Administrative Procedure Act\" appears in other documents. But we already have it. Maybe there are other causes like \"Equal Protection Clause\" is not cause of action (constitutional). \"Fifth Amendment\" is not cause. \"Administrative Procedure Act\" and \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" are the main causes. Could there be \"Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\" same. Also maybe \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" is a cause. There might be mention of \"Equal Protection Clause\" but that is not a cause of action. So maybe only those two.\n\nHowever, we need to check if any other document mentions a different cause of action. Eg, maybe \"Administrative Procedure Act\" appears in all complaints. But we already captured. Also maybe \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" appears. But maybe there is \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" only. Also maybe \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" is in the Amended Complaint. We captured. Also maybe \"Administrative Procedure Act\" is repeated. But duplicates are not needed.\n\nNeed to verify if any other cause of action present like \"Bivens\" or \"Administrative Procedure Act\" only. Let's search in other documents quickly. We should search across all docs for patterns like \"Administrative Procedure Act\" and \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" have been found. But maybe \"Administrative Procedure Act\" appears in other documents too. But we don't need duplicates.\n\nBut check if any other cause appears like \"Statutory cause\" e.g., \"Equal Protection Clause\" is not. \"Fifth Amendment\" not. \"Administrative Procedure Act\" is cause. \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" is cause. Also maybe \"Administrative Procedure Act\" is same as \"APA\". But that's same.\n\nCheck for \"Administrative Procedure Act\" in other documents? We could search for \"Administrative Procedure Act\" pattern across all docs. But we already did search and got 17 matches across 8 docs. But those are likely same cause. There might not be other unique.\n\nBut there may be a cause \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" also. Already captured.\n\nAlso maybe \"Administrative Procedure Act\" is the only cause. But also maybe \"Administrative Procedure Act\" and \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" are the only ones.\n\nThus we have all values. But we need to confirm there are no other distinct cause of action values. Let's search for \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" we did. There were only two matches in Complaint and Amended Complaint. So we captured.\n\nBut maybe \"Administrative Procedure Act\" appears in other documents like orders etc. But those are still same cause.\n\nThus checklist is complete: two unique values.\n\nBut we need to double-check if \"Administrative Procedure Act\" and \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" are indeed cause of action, not just mention. In Complaint, they mention \"bring this action under the APA and the Declaratory Judgment Act\". That's cause.\n\nThus we can stop. But we must ensure that we have appended both values and there are no other missing values. Let's search for \"Administrative Procedure Act\" in other documents not yet fully read to ensure no other unique cause. But duplicates don't matter. But maybe there is \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" only used in those. So done.\n\nWe must check if there is any other cause of action like \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" might appear but we already captured. Also maybe \"Administrative Procedure Act\" appears but we captured. So we have all.\n\nThus we can stop. But we must be sure that the checklist summary shows all keys are filled.

Also \"Title II of the ADA\" etc.\n\nLet's search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" across all documents. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" might appear with variations like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"42 USC § 1983\".

Use regex across all docs.\n\nAlso search for \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" pattern: \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" or \"FTCA\". Use regex \"Federal Tort Claims Act|FTCA\".\n\nAlso \"Bivens\" pattern: \"Bivens\". Use regex \"Bivens\".\n\nAlso \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" pattern: \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act|ADA Title II\". Also \"ADA\" maybe.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" might be too specific.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" might appear inside other contexts.\n\nWe also need to check if \"Equal Protection Clause\" is a cause of action?

We already extracted values \"Administrative Procedure Act\" and \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" from Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. The checklist has only one key and it's filled with 2 values. The instructions say: \"Extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We need to ensure we have all distinct values across all documents. We have not yet explored other documents. We might need to find other causes of action like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"Title II of the ADA\" or others. The previous searches for 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Title II of the ADA returned 0 matches. But maybe other causes exist like \"Federal Tort Claims Act\", \"Civil Rights Act\", \"Title VII\" etc. We should search for patterns such as \"§\", \"U.S.C.\", \"Title\", \"Act\", etc. But careful: we only want legal vehicles used to bring the claims. The documents are complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief etc. Likely they only use APA and Declaratory Judgment Act. But we need to confirm by looking at other documents, maybe some motions or orders contain statements of cause of action? But they might not. The only complaint documents contain the claim. The other documents might not include the cause-of-action statements. But we should still search. Since the last search patterns for 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Title II of the ADA returned no matches, maybe there are no other causes. But we should confirm by scanning the remaining documents for patterns like \"Act\" or \"Rule\". But we should not waste time scanning entire documents. We can target the complaint documents which may contain cause of action. The first complaint was partially visited (0-8000, 98% coverage). That likely covers the whole complaint (8,158 tokens). So we likely captured all cause-of-action statements. The second complaint (First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief) has only 7% coverage so far. We should read more of it to see if it contains causes of action. It likely also uses APA and Declaratory Judgment Act. But we might need to confirm and add that second complaint's cause-of-action statements to check for duplicates. But duplicates are not needed; we already have them. We need to dedupe. So we don't need to add duplicates. But we should still confirm no other cause-of-action statements. The second complaint may mention \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" maybe. We should search that doc for \"§ 1983\" or \"42 U.S.C.\" etc. But we did global search for that pattern and found 0 matches. But maybe the second complaint uses \"U.S.C.\" but not in the first complaint. But we should verify. The second complaint's partial coverage includes some sections but not entire. But the global search should have scanned all tokens. So likely no such matches. But maybe the second complaint contains \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" but that pattern would match \"Federal Tort Claims Act\". We didn't search that. But maybe unlikely. Let's search for \"Tort Claims\" or \"Federal Tort Claims Act\". But we can use regex for \"Federal Tort Claims Act\". Also search for \"Civil Rights Act\". But we should use search_document_regex on all documents for patterns like \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" or \"Civil Rights Act\". But we must be cautious about false positives. But let's search for \"Civil Rights Act\" pattern. Also \"Title VII\". Also \"Title II of the ADA\". But we already searched that. But \"Title VII\" maybe. Let's search for \"Title VII\" pattern. That might appear in the first complaint but we didn't have that in the extracted cause-of-action. But we might ignore duplicates. But we should check. Let's search for \"Title VII\" in all docs. Also \"Title II of the\" maybe. But we did \"Title II of the ADA\" pattern. Maybe we should search for \"ADA\" pattern \"American Disabilities Act\" or \"Americans with Disabilities Act\". But the cause-of-action might be \"Americans with Disabilities Act\". That is Title II of the ADA. But we didn't find it. So likely not present. But we can search for \"Americans with Disabilities Act\" or \"ADA\". But we can search for \"Americans with Disabilities Act\". Let's do search_document_regex for that. Also for \"Civil Rights Act\". Let's search for \"Civil Rights Act\".\n\nAlso we might want to search for \"42 U.S.C.\" pattern again but maybe include \"§\". But we did \"42\\s*U\\.S\\.C\\.?\\s*§?\\s*1983\" pattern. That is fine.\n\nWe should also search for \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" pattern. Let's search for \"Federal Tort Claims Act\" all docs.\n\nAlso \"Title II of the ADA\" we did. \"Title VII\" maybe.\n\nAlso \"Bivens\" maybe.\n\nAlso \"Declaratory Judgment\" we already captured.\n\nAlso \"Administrative Procedure Act\" we captured.\n\nAlso \"Administrative Procedure Act\" might appear in second complaint. But duplicates.\n\nAlso \"Section 1983\" maybe \"§1983\".\n\nBut we did pattern for \"42\\s*U\\.S\\.C\\.?\\s*§?\\s*1983\". That covers.\n\nPerhaps the second complaint also has \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" but the pattern may not match due to formatting like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" or \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". The regex we used includes optional periods. It should match.\n\nBut maybe the second complaint uses \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" but no match because we only searched the first complaint? No we searched all docs. So no matches.\n\nThus likely only APA and Declaratory Judgment Act.\n\nBut we need to ensure we didn't miss any other cause-of-action from other documents. For instance, the \"Notice of Motion\" or \"Motion\" may mention \"Bivens\" or \"Civil Rights Act\" as cause-of-action. But such documents might not contain the cause-of-action statement. But they might include \"The plaintiffs claim... under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\" But still we need to capture those. But we already searched for 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and found 0. So likely none.\n\nSo we have all causes of action. However we need to verify that the second complaint also uses the same causes-of-action. But duplicates are fine. We don't need to add duplicates.\n\nBut we need to check if the second complaint maybe uses \"Declaratory Judgment Act\" with a different wording. But duplicates.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we must ensure we didn't miss any other cause-of-action that might appear in other documents. Let's search for \"United States Code\" maybe. But we didn't search for \"U.S.C.\" without \"§1983\". But other statutes may be present. But not likely.\n\nBut the instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to guarantee we have all distinct values. We have two: APA and Declaratory Judgment Act. Are there any others? Let's search for \"Administrative Procedure Act\" again but we already extracted.\n\nBut what about \"Administrative Procedure Act\" appears as \"APA\"? We have \"Administrative Procedure Act\" as a value. Good.\n\nBut maybe the first complaint uses \"Administrative Procedure Act\" and \"Declaratory Judgment Act\". The second complaint might also use them. But duplicates.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nWe need to output JSON with decision: \"stop\" and a reason.\n\nBut we need to confirm that the checklist indeed only has that key and it's filled. The check says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\". So we can stop.\n\nThus we output:\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct Cause_of_Action values extracted with evidence.\"\n}\n\nBut we must ensure we didn't miss any duplicates or missing values. But we must confirm that the second complaint may mention \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" but we didn't see. But we have search results. Ok.\n\nThus final answer: stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct Cause_of_Action values extracted with evidence.\"\n}\n```", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct Cause_of_Action values extracted with evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3725, "completion_tokens": 1743, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
