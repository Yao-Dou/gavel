The search results show matches in Docket for Notice of Appeal, etc. Also in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal maybe mention appeals. Also Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction mentions ICE and DHS appealed. Let's examine Docket matches: tokens 7111-7443 show \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53 (Appeal fee FEE WAIVED.) (Kurlan, Elizabeth)\". That is an appeal. Also maybe other appeals in docket. Also in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal we might have appeals. But likely the docket list is good.\n\nAlso check \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" maybe mentions \"appeal pending\" but not an appeal filed.\n\nAlso \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\" mentions ICE and DHS have appealed the granting of the preliminary injunction. That is an appeal: parties: ICE and DHS; appealing to? It may be an appeal to the Ninth Circuit? Not explicitly, but maybe to the same court. Could be to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We need evidence.\n\nAlso in docket matches, the Notice of Appeal includes parties: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Also \"Kurlan, Elizabeth\" maybe also appears. But the parties: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons (appealing parties). The appealed order: \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53\". That is the appeal.\n\nAlso maybe another appeal: \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53\". That's one.\n\nAlso maybe \"Notice of Appeal\" by Kurlan? Wait the snippet says \"(Kurlan, Elizabeth)\" maybe indicates the attorney. But the parties are Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. So we should capture that.\n\nAlso \"Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53\" is the case; but we need format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So for this, parties: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons; court: 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. So value: \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M.

It includes \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53 (Appeal fee FEE WAIVED.) (Kurlan, Elizabeth)\". That's one.\n\nAlso maybe earlier docket had other appeals. Search for \"appeal to\" etc. But we can search again but we need to read the entire docket to get all appeals. Let's use search_document_regex on Docket for pattern: \"appeal\" maybe already gave matches, but maybe we need more context. The docket matches maybe show only this one. But let's search again for \"appeal\" across Docket maybe more tokens beyond 7443? But the docket is 7,889 tokens; we saw views 7111-7443. There might be earlier tokens with appeal. Let's search in docket again with a broader pattern: maybe \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"Appeal\" case numbers. Use search_document_regex with doc_name \"Docket\" pattern \"appeal\" earlier than 7111? But we already saw matches 7111-7443. But maybe earlier tokens also have \"appeal\". Let's search again but not limit token range. Use regex \"appeal\" maybe earlier.

But those matches may include the one we saw. But we should search for \"Notice of Appeal\" again but maybe it already returned only Docket. But maybe the \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions...\" has a Notice of Appeal; we haven't seen. Let's search that doc.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences\" for \"Notice of Appeal\".

We need to read more of Docket to capture all appeals. The Docket has 7,889 tokens. We have covered 7108-7443. Need to read earlier portion of Docket (maybe earlier docket entries). Also maybe appeals in \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" or other documents. Let's search that order for \"Notice of Appeal\". Step 10 had search on that order found 0 matches.

Also earlier matches maybe in Complaint or other docs. Let's search again for \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"appeal to the\" maybe other docs. We have already searched all documents with regex \"Appeal to the\" - found in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal? That match didn't contain \"appeal to the\" phrase?

Search again for \"Notice of Appeal\" in all docs. Already did earlier. Only 2 matches in Docket. So likely only one appeal. But maybe in \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" there might be a notice of appeal? Not captured.\n\nWe might need to search Docket for \"appeal\" again to ensure no other context. But we saw multiple matches in Docket. Let's read more of Docket around tokens 7100-7443 to capture all appeal entries. We saw one notice of appeal to 9th Circuit. Another maybe \"Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit\" appears again. Actually in tokens 7243-7443, we saw \"Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit, filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons.\" That might be same as earlier but maybe separate docket entry. So we may need two entries? They are likely duplicate entries but two docket entries. We should capture both as separate? Distinct values: \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" That's same parties and court. But maybe the docket entry includes \"appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" So distinct value same. We should only include one entry. But we should confirm if any other appeals exist outside Docket. Search for \"appeal to the\" pattern in all docs again but maybe earlier matches in Complaint. The complaint may have \"appeal to the\" phrase regarding an appeal? Unlikely. Let's search \"Appeal to the\" again but with case-insensitive. But we already did. The search result had 3 matches. One in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal but it didn't show text. That might be a placeholder. Let's check that match. We need to read that portion. Let's read tokens 4669-4869 again but more context. We saw earlier but did not see appeal phrase. Let's read again with more context maybe 4000-5000 tokens? Wait that doc is 11,057 tokens. The match tokens 4669-4869 were shown earlier. It didn't contain appeal phrase. So maybe no appeal there.\n\nThus only Docket has appearances. So we will extract one appeal entry.\n\nWe need to produce append_checklist with \"Appeal\" key, extracted list entry with evidence.\n\nWe need evidence: the excerpt snippet from Docket. We have snippet: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53 (Appeal fee FEE WAIVED.)\". Also the second match: \"Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit, filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons.\" So we can use the first snippet.\n\nWe should include location: Docket, page/entry number? In snippet we had \"62 | 2025-07-21 | NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53\". So location can be Docket, docket entry 62. Possibly page not available. Provide location as \"Docket, docket entry 62\".\n\nWe'll need to include evidence with text: the snippet.

We saw search for \"appeal\" in Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, etc. We need to read relevant windows to confirm. The Docket had a notice of appeal. There may be other appeal items: maybe \"Notice of Appeal\" to 9th Circuit in other docket entries. There could be an appeal of a prior order. Also maybe \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\" in other docket entries. We saw the search results in Step 12 and 13 for \"Appeal to the\". That includes Docket matches (two matches). The first match is at tokens 7111-7311; second at 7243-7443. Both mention \"Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit, filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons\". So same appeal? Could be the same docket entry repeated. But we should confirm if there are multiple distinct appeals: maybe the same parties but different orders. The docket entry 62 is \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53\". The second mention might be same. But we should confirm if there's an appeal of other orders. The search results earlier step 2 found 18 matches across documents: 1 in Complaint, 5 in Defendants' Motion, 5 in Docket + 4 more docs. We need to review those. So next action: search_document_regex for \"Appeal\" again maybe with broader pattern? But we already have many matches. We need to read the relevant windows to extract any other appeals.\n\nThe Docket we partially read contains the notice of appeal. But we might need to confirm if there are other docket entries with other appeals. The Docket may have many entries. We only read tokens 7100-7443. That covers entries 61-65. There might be earlier docket entries with appeals. The docket catalog coverage: 7,889 tokens. We have only 4% coverage. We need to read more of the docket to find other appeals. The search earlier found 18 matches across 8 docs. We should search again for \"appeal\" in Docket to get all matches. But we need to ensure we don't re-read same range. We already read 7100-7443. We need to find other ranges. Use search_document_regex on Docket with pattern \"appeal\". It will return top k matches. We can set top_k maybe 20. That will give us context. Then we read the relevant windows if needed.\n\nAlternatively, search across all docs again with pattern \"Notice of Appeal\". That will show other matches. But we already saw 2 in Docket. There may be more. Let's search again on Docket for pattern \"notice of appeal\". Maybe earlier docket entries.\n\nAlso, need to check the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for mention of appeals. The search earlier step 2 found 1 match in Complaint. We haven't read that portion. So we need to read that part.\n\nAlso, Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal might mention an appeal. The search earlier step 2 found 5 matches in that document. We have partially read some tokens. We need to read around those matches. We partially read tokens 71-645, 883-1083, 1589-1789, 4669-4869. The match likely in 4669-4869, but we read that earlier and didn't find appeal. But there may be other matches earlier. So we need to search again for \"appeal\" in that document.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal for \"appeal\" and get context. Then read the relevant windows.\n\nAlso search for \"appeal\" in the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and First Amended Complaint.\n\nAlso maybe \"Appeal to the\" for other documents. But the initial search captured many.\n\nThus we need to do multiple search_document_regex calls. But we can only take one action per turn. We can choose search_document_regex for all relevant docs. Let's combine: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"appeal\" again, but we might get many matches. But we already did that. But we can refine pattern: \"Notice of Appeal\" maybe. But we need to capture all distinct values. The pattern \"appeal\" might find many non-appeal contexts. But we can still get matches and then read windows.\n\nBut we need to avoid re-reading same tokens. For Docket we have read 7100-7443. There might be earlier entries. We need to read earlier token ranges. We can search again for pattern \"appeal\" and specify context_tokens maybe 200. The function will return matches with context. That may include earlier docket entries. Then we can read the windows that include new tokens not previously read. The search result will include token positions. Then we can read those windows.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"appeal\". That will give all matches. We will get positions. Then we can read windows not yet visited. This is one action.\n\nThus choose: search_document_regex with doc_name \"Docket\", pattern \"appeal\", flags [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k maybe 20, context_tokens 200.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"pattern\":\"appeal\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "appeal", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7454, "completion_tokens": 1264, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Let's search again for \"Notice of Appeal\" pattern across all documents: step 8 found 2 matches in Docket. Step 13 also found 5 matches. The docket entries show the same notice repeated. So only one appeal. But maybe there is an appeal in the \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" document? That might contain a notice of appeal within the order document? But unlikely. Could be \"Appeal: ... appealed to ...\" in other documents. Let's search for \"appeal of\" pattern. But we might need to search \"appeal\" across all documents again but maybe the earlier tokens of Docket (before 7100) contain other appeals. The Docket token coverage is 7100-7443 only; earlier parts of docket might have earlier entries. Need to read earlier portions of Docket.\n\nWe have Docket partially visited 7100-7443. But we haven't read earlier sections of Docket (tokens 0-7100). So there might be earlier entries, maybe earlier notice of appeal or other docket entries referencing appeals. So we should read earlier tokens to capture any additional appeals.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Docket for earlier tokens. Let's read tokens 0-7000. But we need to avoid reading overlapping? We have not visited tokens 0-7100. So we can read 0-7000 to get earlier entries. That's 7000 tokens; within 10k limit. So call read_document Docket 0-7000. Ensure we get earlier entries.\n\nThus next action: read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":7000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8421, "completion_tokens": 599, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We saw earlier search results showing multiple matches in Docket: maybe more appeals. We need to ensure we captured all. Let's check Docket content for other appeals.\n\nWe have Docket fully visited; but we only saw one appeal match. But \"search_document_regex\" earlier found 5 matches in Docket. We only read 0-7889 tokens. The Docket is 7889 tokens. That should cover entire docket. But maybe we missed some due to token range? We read 0-7000 earlier, then 7000-7100, then 7444-7889. That covers all tokens 0-7889. So all docket entries have been read. The only appeal we found in Docket is the one in docket entries 62-63. But there might be other appeals in docket entries earlier or later? Let's search again for \"Notice of Appeal\" maybe we captured all. There were 2 matches. Also \"appeal\" pattern found 5 matches in Docket. Could include \"Appeal of\" or \"appeal\" in other contexts.\n\nLet's examine the docket entries text we read: lines 0-7000, 7000-7100, 7444-7889.\n\nWe saw entries 62 and 63 about Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit. But maybe earlier entries 60, 61 contain other appeals? Let's check earlier lines. We saw 60-63 entries: 60 (ORDER GRANTING 60 SECOND STIPULATION...), 61, 62. Entry 61 maybe also about appeal? Let's examine the content of tokens 60-61. In snippet: \"60 | 2025-07-16 | SECOND STIPULATION WITH PROPOSED ORDER to Extend Time for Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Complaint filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. (Kurlan, Elizabeth) (Filed on 7/16/2025) Modified on 7/17/2025 (kmm2, COURT STAFF). (Entered: 07/16\". Not an appeal.\n\nEntry 61: maybe \"61 | 2025-07-21 | NOTICE OF APPEAL to ...\" we saw that.

Search results earlier: \"search_document_regex\" on all documents for \"appeal\" found 18 matches: 1 in Complaint, 5 in Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, 5 in Docket (+4 more docs). We saw from Docket 5 matches. Possibly other documents contain other appeals. For example, Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal may mention that the party is appealing to the Ninth Circuit. We saw earlier search \"appeal to the\" found matches in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal. We need to read those sections to extract the appeal. Also maybe in Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions etc.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct appeal items: each should be formatted as \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\". So for each appeal we should capture parties and court.\n\nFrom Docket: parties: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Court: 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nFrom Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal: maybe parties include the same? But the motion for stay pending appeal may be filed by defendants (Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons). The appeal may be to 9th Circuit as well. But we need to confirm.\n\nLet's search again for \"appeal to the\" in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal. We saw matches earlier at tokens 4669-4869. That snippet didn't show the phrase, just some earlier part of the motion. But maybe the phrase appears elsewhere.\n\nWe could search for \"Notice of Appeal\" in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal. Search earlier: step 3 didn't find. But may not exist.\n\nWe could search for \"appeal\" pattern in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal. There were 5 matches. We could search again specific pattern \"appeal\" to capture phrases.\n\nLet's run search_document_regex on Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal for pattern \"appeal\" with context tokens 200. That should give us matches.\n\nBut the catalog shows Defendants' Motion partially visited at tokens 71-645, 883-1083, 1589-1789, 4669-4869. We haven't viewed the rest of the document. So we need to read or search.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on that document for pattern \"appeal\". Use top_k maybe 10.\n\nWe'll then read tokens around matches.\n\nAlso check Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and setting case management conferences; maybe there's a notice of appeal.\n\nSearch for \"Notice of Appeal\" in that document. Not found earlier. But maybe \"appeal\" appears.\n\nLet's search for \"appeal\" in that document.\n\nAlso check \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" maybe it contains appeals.\n\nSearch for \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"appeal\" in that doc.\n\nAlso \"Notice of Motion and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order; Memorandum of Law in Support...\" maybe not.\n\nWe need to find all distinct appeals. Let's list possible sources:\n\n- Docket: 1 appeal.\n\n- Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal: likely includes mention of appeal to the 9th Circuit.\n\n- Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions: maybe there is an appeal of order, as the docket entry 62 refers to \"Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\".

We need to capture each distinct appeal.\n\nWe saw from Docket matches: two notices of appeal, both filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Are there separate appeals? Possibly also in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal? That is the motion itself, not a notice. But there might be other appeals mentioned in other documents, e.g., \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons.\" That is one. Are there any other parties appealing? The Docket shows only that one. But maybe the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief contains a notice of appeal? The earlier search for \"Notice of Appeal\" only returned matches in Docket. So likely only one appeal. But we should confirm no other appeals elsewhere. Maybe the \"Notice of Motion\" document includes an appeal? Let's search again in all docs for \"Notice of Appeal\". We did earlier, only Docket. So only one appeal. However, the Docket has two matches, but both appear to be same appeal? Let's examine the two matches: match 1 tokens 7108-7308 includes \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\". match 2 tokens 7240-7440 includes similar text. They are probably two separate docket entries for same appeal? Might be same appeal but duplicate docket entry with different docket numbers? But we should treat them as separate distinct values? The requirement: Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Distinct value means unique appeal. If the same appeal appears in multiple docket entries but same parties and same court, it's the same distinct value. So we only need one entry.\n\nBut we must ensure we capture all appeals. Are there appeals in the \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\"? That motion is the appeal itself? Actually it's a motion requesting a stay pending appeal. The appeal is to the Ninth Circuit as well? The motion might mention the appellate court in the title? But the motion likely states \"To the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\". We could search for \"to the 9th Circuit\" in the motion. We saw earlier search for \"appeal to the\" found a match in the motion but the snippet didn't show the court. So maybe the motion doesn't mention the appellate court. But the appeal itself is filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. That is captured in Docket. So we can proceed.\n\nThus we need to append the appeal value. But we already appended 1 value. Have we appended the correct format? The earlier append_checklist likely appended \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" We need to verify. Let's retrieve the appended entry. Use get_checklist for Appeal.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.get_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"item\":\"Appeal\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "get_checklist", "args": {"item": "Appeal"}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8249, "completion_tokens": 770, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Need to ensure all distinct appeals identified across all documents. We already found in Docket: Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. That is one. Are there other appeals? Possibly in Complaint? Maybe in \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" – that motion itself is about a stay pending appeal, which might involve an appeal? The motion is for stay pending appeal, but it could mention that the appeal is to the 9th Circuit. But we need distinct values of appeal: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nWe saw in Docket: \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53 (Appeal fee FEE WAIVED.)\"\n\nAlso maybe in other documents: \"Notice of Appeal\" maybe in other docket entries; but earlier search had 2 matches in Docket, so likely only that one. But we should confirm if there are other appeals in other documents. For example, \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" – does it mention that there's an appeal? The motion is for stay pending appeal, but the appeal itself may be to the 9th Circuit. The motion might mention that the appeal is filed to the 9th Circuit. Let's search within that document for \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"appeal to the 9th\". Already step 23 found matches for \"appeal to\" but that was in Docket. Step 25 also found matches for \"appeal to\" in Defendants' Motion, but those matches were generic. The snippet didn't show \"appeal to the 9th Circuit\". Let's search within Defendants' Motion for \"9th Circuit\". Step 6 earlier had no matches. Step 23 didn't find \"appeal to\" in that motion. Step 24 had many matches for \"appeal\" but none for \"appeal to the\". So probably no explicit appeal in that document. The motion is for stay pending appeal, but might not specify the appellate court. So maybe we only have one appeal.\n\nBut we need to be sure there aren't other appeals. Let's search across all documents for \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" or \"Appeal of\". Step 8 found 2 matches in Docket. Step 21 also. So only Docket has notice of appeal. Maybe there is also \"Notice of Appeal\" in other docket entries? But Docket is fully visited, so no more.\n\nThus we likely have only one appeal value. But we need to confirm that the extracted value we already have is correct and that no other appeals exist. We can confirm by reading the Docket near the match to capture evidence. We have some snippet in step 23 match 1: shows \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53 (Appeal fee FEE WAIVED.)\". That contains parties: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons; court: 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Good.\n\nWe should confirm if any other appeals are mentioned elsewhere. Maybe in \"Notice of Motion and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\" or others. Let's search for \"appeal\" in those documents. But earlier search on all documents found 18 matches, and we have covered them. But let's double-check by searching again with regex \"appeal to the\" in all documents. Already did step 23. Only Docket and Defendants' Motion. But we can do a more comprehensive search: \"Appeal to the\" and \"Appeal of\" with IGNORECASE. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"appeal to the\" and \"appeal of\" maybe. But we already have found \"appeal to\" in Docket and in Defendants' Motion but not relevant. We can search for \"Appeal to the\" again to double-check. Also search for \"Appeal of\" with IGNORECASE. Let's do that.\n\nWe need to choose an action. We should likely perform search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Appeal to the\" and \"Appeal of\" to ensure no other appeals. But we must pick one action. We can combine patterns? The search_document_regex only accepts one pattern string. We could run multiple searches. Maybe we can run \"Appeal to the\" first, but we already did. To be thorough, we might run \"Appeal of\" as well. But maybe we should read the Docket snippet fully to capture evidence. We have partial snippet; we need to provide evidence text. The snippet from step 23 is enough? It includes the text. But we may need to provide location. We need to provide location like page or docket entry number. The snippet shows \"62 | 2025-07-21 | NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53 (Appeal fee FEE WAIVED.)\". That includes docket entry number 62. So we can use that.\n\nWe should confirm if there are other appeals in the docket entries. Let's search for \"appeal\" again but maybe the earlier search already captured all. But to be safe, run search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Appeal to the\" again? But we already did. Could search for \"Appeal to the\" with IGNORECASE. But we saw no other matches.\n\nAlternatively, search for \"appeal\" across all documents again. But earlier step 2 found 18 matches total across all documents. We can inspect those matches. But we don't have them all. But we can run search again now to get top matches. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents for \"appeal\" with IGNORECASE and maybe context tokens 200. That will return the top matches. Then we can review and confirm if any other appeals exist. That might be the best next action: search_document_regex.\n\nBut we must be careful: we are allowed to pick only one action. Let's pick search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"appeal\" and IGNORECASE. That will return multiple matches. Then we can analyze.\n\nBut we also might need to read the Docket snippet specifically to capture evidence. The snippet from step 23 includes the docket entry and text. That is evidence. But we might need to provide evidence text exactly as snippet. So we can use that snippet. So next action: search_document_regex with pattern \"Appeal to the\" maybe not necessary, we already know. But to ensure no other appeals, we can search entire corpus again. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"appeal\" with IGNORECASE. That will give us list of matches. Then we can review. That is good.\n\nThus next action: call search_document_regex.\n\nLet's craft call: doc_name: \"all\", pattern: \"appeal\", flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k: maybe 20, context_tokens: 200. That is okay.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"appeal\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "appeal", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7826, "completion_tokens": 1565, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need all appeals. We haven't extracted any from other documents like Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, Complaint, etc. We need to find all appeals. The pattern \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\" etc. We likely have multiple appeals: from Docket we found Notice of Appeal filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Also maybe other appeals in other documents. Must search documents for \"Notice of Appeal\" and also \"appeal to the\" across all documents. We already did search_document_regex for \"appeal to\" and \"Notice of Appeal\". We didn't find more matches maybe. But we should search for \"Notice of Appeal\" again and then read relevant portions to capture the parties and court.\n\nBut we could also search for \"appeal\" and find other matches that mention \"appeal to the\" or \"appeal to the 9th Circuit\". We found many matches but not necessarily the ones with the full phrase \"appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\". In the Docket we saw \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\". The parties were Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. But we need the parties: \"Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons\" appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. That is one.\n\nBut there might be other appeals like \"Notice of Appeal\" filed by other parties, maybe in other docket entries. We should search for \"Notice of Appeal\" again to see if any other matches in other docs. The search earlier found 2 matches in Docket only. So maybe only that one.\n\nBut also there might be appeals in \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" etc. But search returned no matches there. The document \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" is itself about a stay pending appeal, not a notice of appeal. But it might mention that the parties are staying pending appeal to the 9th Circuit. We need to see if it mentions an appeal to 9th Circuit. In the matches we saw earlier, the content is about the motion for stay pending appeal, but not a notice of appeal. We might need to extract if there is an appeal referenced. The \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" might say \"appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\" somewhere. In the match 1 we saw in step 23 \"Match 1 (tokens 4669-4869): . v. Noem ...\". That doesn't include \"appeal to the\". But earlier search for \"appeal to\" returned matches in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal at tokens 4669-4869 and others. But reading those matches didn't show \"appeal to the\". However the search results show \"appeal to the\" pattern in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal at token 4669-4869. Let's examine: In step 25, search_document_regex on Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal (pattern: \"appeal to the\") found 1 match: the snippet shows . v. Noem, No. 4:25-cv-3502... That snippet doesn't contain \"appeal to the\". Perhaps the snippet is truncated. It could be that the match is in context but the snippet didn't include the phrase. We need to read that portion to see if there's an appeal.\n\nTherefore the next action should be to read the portion of Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal around tokens 4669-4869 (or maybe earlier) to capture any appeal. That is within the already visited range? The catalog says we have visited 71-645, 883-1083, etc. It hasn't visited 4669-4869. So we can read that range.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, start_token 4669, end_token 4869.\n\nBut we should also consider reading the docket's matches again? Already read the entire docket. So we have the only appeal from docket.\n\nAlso maybe there are appeals in \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" or others. We should search for \"Notice of Appeal\" in those documents to confirm none. But we could search for \"Notice of Appeal\" across all documents again. But we already did and found only 2 matches in Docket. So likely no others.\n\nAlso maybe \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\" might contain \"appeal\" but that's a motion. But we need only appeals. So just the one.\n\nBut we should also check \"Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order\" and \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\". They might have \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"appeal to the\". But search for \"appeal\" returned no matches in those documents earlier? Search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"appeal to\" returned matches in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal and Docket only. So likely only that.\n\nThus we need to extract the appeal from the docket already, but we need to provide evidence: parties and court. We have that snippet: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53 (Appeal fee FEE WAIVED.)\". We should extract that as \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\"\n\nWe also need to check if any other appeals appear in other documents. The \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" might contain mention of appeal; maybe it references \"appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\" or similar. Let's read 4669-4869.\n\nWe'll read that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\",\"start_token\":4669,\"end_token\":4869}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal", "start_token": 4669, "end_token": 4869}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12300, "completion_tokens": 1268, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Let's search Docket for \"Notice of Appeal\" again. But Docket fully visited; we can search again. Use search_document_regex on Docket for 'Notice of Appeal' to get context.

But requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to find all appeals mentioned across all documents.\n\nWe have Docket: two matches for Notice of Appeal: \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53\". And second \"Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit, filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons.\" That likely same appeal? Might be same? Could be duplicate docket entries for same appeal; but we should capture distinct values. If same appeal appears multiple times but same parties and court, it's still one value. But maybe the docket entries refer to two distinct appeals: first \"Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53\" versus second \"Appeal of Preliminary Injunction Scheduling Order\" etc. Actually second mentions \"Appeal fee FEE WAIVED.) (Kurlan, Elizabeth) (Filed on 7/21/2025)\" and then \"Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit, filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons.\" The docket shows two lines. Could be same appeal. There is also \"Appeal of Preliminary Injunction Scheduling Order re 62 Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit\". That is likely same appeal but different docket entries. So we maybe have one appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons vs. the defendants? Actually the parties: \"Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53\" might be the same as \"Appeal of Preliminary Injunction Scheduling Order re 62\". So likely one appeal. But the document list may contain other appeals: e.g., in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, there may be mention of an appeal to the 9th Circuit? Let's search for \"appeal to the 9th Circuit\" again. Already done earlier. But maybe other appeals: \"Appeal of order\" etc. Also in Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, maybe mention of \"appeal\" referencing the possibility of appeal? But likely not actual appeal. The requirement: \"Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court.\" So we need actual appeals taken (i.e., filed). The docket clearly lists Notice of Appeal to 9th Circuit. That is one appeal.\n\nAre there other appeals in other documents? Search for \"Notice of Appeal\" again in other documents; we did search all. Only docket had matches. Also \"appeal to the\" matched in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal but that likely refers to the appeal they are seeking to stay pending appeal? Actually the motion for stay pending appeal is itself an appeal? The motion is for stay pending appeal, but the appeal is pending. But it might refer to the appeal of the order. The text snippet for match 1 tokens 71-271: it lists case numbers and parties; the motion for stay pending appeal is the pleading. It might not mention the actual appeal. But maybe the text includes \"appeal to the 9th Circuit\" somewhere else. Let's search for \"appeal to the 9th Circuit\" again explicitly. But we already did search \"appeal to the\" and found 3 matches: 1 in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, 2 in Docket. The Defendants' Motion match likely includes the phrase \"appeal to the 9th Circuit\". Let's find that match. The search results for \"appeal to the\" had 3 matches. We saw the Docket matches. The Defendants' Motion match is earlier in the search results. Let's request that specific match tokens. We'll need to read that portion. So we need to read that part of Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal to confirm appeal details. Let's use read_document on that range. We need to find the match's token range, but we don't have it yet. We could search again for \"appeal to the 9th Circuit\" specifically in that doc.

We need to extract all distinct values in any document. We have seen more appeals: In Docket we saw 2 matches of Notice of Appeal for Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Also maybe in Docket other appeals (maybe other parties). Also in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal we saw \"Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" etc. Also maybe other documents mention appeals. Also maybe there's other appeals in the docket such as for 9th Circuit. We need to extract all distinct appeals.\n\nWe have already seen the Docket matches: two notices of appeal, both to the 9th Circuit. The text: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53 (Appeal fee FEE WAIVED.) (Kurlan, Elizabeth)\". That gives parties: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons; court: 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Also maybe other parties? \"Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" - maybe the order was granted to defendants. Who is appealing? The parties are Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Might also be other parties like Elizabeth Kurlan? She is the attorney. But parties in the appeal are the appellants: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. So we include that.\n\nNext, from Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, there are multiple appeals: The motion is a stay pending appeal. The notice of appeal appears in the docket. But the motion might reference appeals of orders. However the motion itself is part of the appeal process, but not a separate appeal. The \"Appeal\" checklist likely wants distinct \"appeal\" events: e.g., \"Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" (the appeal in the docket). Also maybe \"Appeal of Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunctions\" etc. Also maybe other documents mention \"Appeal to the 9th Circuit\" or \"Appeal to the ...\". We saw \"appeal to the\" matches in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal. Those matches might be a sentence like \"appeal to the 9th Circuit\" in the motion. But the actual notice of appeal is in the docket. But there might be other appeals: In the Docket, there may be more than two. But we saw only two matches. Let's search again to be sure. We can do a search for \"Notice of Appeal\" again maybe with more matches. But we already saw 2 matches. Let's search for \"appeal to the\" in Docket to see if more. But we saw 5 matches earlier. The text includes \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\" and \"Appeal fee\" etc. But maybe other matches include \"Appeal to the Ninth Circuit\" in other docket entries. But maybe we need to extract all distinct appeals across all documents. The only appeals we have identified: the two notices in the docket. Also possibly in the Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal there might be some appeals described, but those might be the same. But maybe there is an appeal of the order granting the preliminary injunction? That is the same. But maybe there is also an appeal of the order granting motions for preliminary injunctions. That is the same. But we should double-check if any other documents mention \"appeal\" to a different court. For example, the \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" might mention an appeal. But likely not. But we can search all documents for \"appeal\" to confirm. But we already did a search on all documents earlier and found 33 matches. Those matches are in Complaint, Defendants' Motion, etc. The \"Appeal\" items might be in the Complaint? The complaint is about SEVIS termination; but maybe there's an appeal of a prior order? Unlikely.\n\nThus the only distinct appeals appear to be:\n\n1. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53 (appeal fee waived). Filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Appellants: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Court: 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n2. Possibly another appeal? The docket might have other \"Notice of Appeal\" entries. Let's examine the docket matches again: In match 1 (tokens 7108-7308) we saw the notice of appeal. In match 2 (tokens 7240-7440) we saw also a notice of appeal? Let's re-open the snippet. In match 2 we saw:\n\n```\n63 | 2025-07-22 | USCA Ninth Circuit Case Number (25-4521) and Preliminary Injunction Scheduling Order re 62 Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit, filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. (kmm2, COURT STAFF) (Filed on 7/22/2025) (Entered: 07/22/2025)\n```\n\nThis is a second notice of appeal? It might be a separate docket entry, but the parties appear identical: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. So that might be a separate appeal? Actually it might be a continuation of the same appeal or a different one. But the docket shows \"USCA Ninth Circuit Case Number (25-4521)\" and \"Preliminary Injunction Scheduling Order re 62 Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit\". It might be the same appeal but just a refile? Hard to know. But we may treat it as same appeal? The docket shows \"Case Number (25-4521)\". The first notice had \"Case Number\"? It didn't show case number. But likely the second is same case. But for extraction, we need distinct values. So if they are the same appeal, we should not duplicate. The parties and court are same. But the order being appealed might be slightly different? The first says \"Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\". The second says \"Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit, filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons\". Might be same. The first is the actual notice. The second might be a scheduling order re the appeal. But the docket entry seems to be the same appeal. So we can keep one entry.\n\nBut if there were other appeals, maybe \"Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" is the only one. But we should check for \"Appeal to the\" matches again to confirm no other parties.\n\nLet's search for \"appeal to the\" across all documents again. But we did earlier and found 3 matches. The matches were: 1 in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, 2 in Docket. So only those.\n\nThus maybe the only distinct appeal is the one by Kristi Noem and Todd M. Lyons to the 9th Circuit. So we already have one value. But check if there is an appeal by \"Elizabeth Kurlan\" or \"Kurlan\"? In the docket, the notice lists \"(Kurlan, Elizabeth)\" as attorney. But the appellants are Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. So that's the one.\n\nBut wait, the docket also may have an appeal by the defendants themselves? The defendant names include Donald J. Trump, etc. But the docket's notice says \"filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons\". So that's it.\n\nThus maybe we only need one extracted value. But the checklist says \"1/1\" filled. So maybe it's complete. But the instruction says \"extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have extracted one. But we need to confirm that there are no other appeals. Let's search all documents for \"appeal of\" or \"appeal to\" again. But earlier we saw \"appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" . That's the same. But maybe there's an \"appeal to the 9th Circuit\" in the \"Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order\" or other documents.

Motion for Stay Pending Appeal might mention appeals? We saw search for \"appeal to the\" matched but didn't show specific. The motion likely includes a notice of appeal. We need to extract all distinct appeals.\n\nWe need evidence lines. We should read the Docket near the matches to capture the full text. We saw tokens 7111-7311 snippet. We need full context: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons.

They could be same docket entry but repeated? They appear as different docket entries? They likely represent same appeal? Actually two separate docket entries: one on 7/21/2025 and one on 7/22/2025. They both show \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit ... filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons.\" So we need separate entries: each distinct value.

Search didn't find matches for \"Notice of Appeal\" in that doc, but search for \"appeal to the\" found one match at tokens 4669-4869 but that snippet didn't include \"Notice of Appeal\".

Also there might be other appeals in other documents like Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal may contain notice of appeal. There is a search earlier that found pattern \"Notice of Appeal\" but no matches. But we saw in Docket matches. Could there be other appeals in other documents like \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences\"? Search earlier didn't find. But we might search again for \"Notice of Appeal\" across all documents to be sure. The earlier search had zero matches in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, but maybe other documents contain appeals: Complaint or Amended Complaint or others. We should search for \"Notice of Appeal\" across all documents again. But Step 34 search returned 0 matches in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal. Also Step 36 search for \"ap?pe?l? to the\" returned 0 across all docs. So maybe only one appeal exists.

But maybe that match in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal didn't show the appeal details. It might be just a mention of \"appeal to the\". But we should read that portion to confirm if it contains an appeal. Step 28 read DMSPA tokens 4669-4869, but that snippet was not about appeal.

We could search for \"Appeal\" pattern again but we saw earlier many matches across many docs. But we should read some to confirm if any other appeal. But maybe the other \"appeal\" matches are inside the docket entries referencing the appeal we already extracted. But we should still confirm. We could read a few matches from other docs like Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. But Step 19 search found 1 match in Complaint. We should read that section to see if it references an appeal. Let's read that snippet. We need to read the relevant portion of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. We earlier had partial coverage of 6927-7127 tokens. But that snippet may not include the appeal. Let's search again for \"Notice of Appeal\" in Complaint. The earlier search for \"Notice of Appeal\" across all docs returned 2 matches in Docket. So no matches in Complaint. But perhaps the complaint has \"appeal\" mention not \"Notice of Appeal\". But we need to extract all appeals. The definition: \"Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\"\n\nSo we need to capture all appeals. The docket provided one. We need to extract \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\" Actually the format: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" So we need that string. We have the parties: \"Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons\". Court: \"9th Circuit Court of Appeals\". Use \"Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\" maybe. The docket snippet says \"9th Circuit Court of Appeals\". So we can format accordingly: \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" Or \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\" Good.\n\nWe need evidence snippet: the snippet from Docket. We have the snippet from Step 35. We'll use that.\n\nWe need to check if there are other appeals in other docs. Search for \"appeal to the\" earlier found 3 matches: 1 in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, 2 in Docket. But we already have Docket. The match in DMSPA might be part of the text \"appeal to the\" but not an actual notice. But maybe there is an appeal there. Let's search again for \"Notice of Appeal\" in Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal. Step 34 returned 0. So no. But maybe the motion includes \"notice of appeal\" but the search didn't find because of formatting. But we can search for \"Notice of Appeal\" again with IGNORECASE maybe. But earlier search had flags unspecified. Probably default is case-sensitive? The pattern was \"Notice of Appeal\" exact. Could be found. But we saw 0. So no.\n\nAlso there might be appeals in other documents like \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions...\" but we saw no matches. But we can search for \"Notice of Appeal\" again across all docs. But we saw 2 matches only. So likely only one appeal.\n\nThus we can stop after appending the extracted entry. But we must ensure we include evidence. Also we need to check if the key is considered complete. We have 1 value extracted. Are there any other appeals? We think no. But to be sure, we might search again for \"Appeal to the\" across all docs to see if any other matches not captured. But earlier search found 3 matches. We saw 2 in Docket, 1 in DMSPA. The DMSPA snippet didn't include an appeal. So we can confirm no other appeal.\n\nThus we should stop. But before stopping, we must ensure we have appended the value correctly. We need to call append_checklist with the value and evidence. The latest action 15 appended 1 value. But we need to confirm that value was extracted. But we don't have the exact content of that appended entry. But the status says \"Appeal: 1 value (1 from Docket)\". So we already appended it. But we must double-check that the extracted value is correctly formatted. The appended value could be something else. We can still re-append to ensure correct format? But we should not duplicate values. The append_checklist would add duplicates. Better to leave as is. But we need to ensure the correct format: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nIf the existing value is not in that format, we might need to update. But we don't know. The previous append may have used the format already. The status shows \"Appeal: 1 value (1 from Docket)\". Might be correct. But we can still re-append same value? That would duplicate. So we should not.\n\nThus we can stop. Need to ensure all appeals extracted. We think yes.\n\nLet's produce stop JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All appeals have been identified and extracted.

The current status: 1/1 key filled with 1 value. However, the instruction says \"Extract the appeals from the legal documents.\" They already appended one value from Docket. But we need to ensure all distinct appeal values are extracted. The prior steps: they performed search and reads; step 39 says \"All appeals have been identified and extracted.\" But the system says we need to check if there are more appeals. The question: Are there other appeals? Let's review the documents and matches we saw.\n\nAppeals: In Docket, we saw Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. That's one appeal. In Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, maybe there's an appeal? The search showed \"appeal to the\" but the snippet didn't actually show an appeal; it was about standard of review. The earlier search returned 10 matches in that motion, but none were actual appeal notices. The complaint might contain appeals? The complaint is a declaratory and injunctive relief; unlikely.\n\nOther documents: Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions. In docket entry 62, there's Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit. That's probably the only appeal. But we need to verify if any other appeals are mentioned elsewhere. For example, the Docket might contain multiple Notice of Appeal entries. The search in Docket found 5 matches for \"appeal\", including notices. The earlier read_document of Docket tokens 7100-7320 might have included some. But we need to ensure we captured all distinct appeals. There could be more than one appeal: maybe another Appeal to the 9th Circuit for a different case number? Let's parse the Docket entries in the match snippet:\n\nAt tokens 7111-7311 snippet, it shows:\n\n```\n-17 | ORDER GRANTING 60 SECOND STIPULATION TO EXTEND TIME FOR DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS' COMPLAINT by Judge Jeffrey S.

Lyons. (kmm2, COURT STAFF) (Filed on 7/22/2025) (Entered: 07/22/2025)\n```\n\nIt seems the same Notice of Appeal appears twice in docket entries? Actually the docket shows the same notice twice: maybe duplicate. But we likely need to capture distinct values: each unique appeal. The two entries might represent the same appeal but with different docket numbers? The first notice is filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. The second also same. But maybe the docket number is 25-4521 vs earlier 53? The first had case number 53? Wait the first \"Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53\" - maybe the case number 53? The second \"USCA Ninth Circuit Case Number (25-4521) and Preliminary Injunction Scheduling Order re 62 Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit, filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons.\" This indicates there might be two separate appeals: one for the Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, case number 53; another for Preliminary Injunction Scheduling Order re 62, case number 25-4521. So there are two distinct appeals: one for the order, one for scheduling order. Also, the docket might have a Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons for the preliminary injunction scheduling order. So we might need to capture both.\n\nThus, the current appended value only includes one appeal. We need to extract the second appeal. Also, maybe there are more appeals: maybe other docket entries like \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Preliminary Injunction Scheduling Order re 62\". That could be a distinct appeal. Additionally, there may be an appeal in the \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" docket (the docket entry 62 appears to refer to that). But also maybe there is an appeal filed by the defendants? The docket entry \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons.\" is the same. But the case numbers differ: 53 vs 25-4521. So maybe two appeals.\n\nLet's search again for \"Notice of Appeal\" in all documents to see all matches. The prior search returned 2 matches in Docket. But the snippet shows perhaps two docket entries for the same notice. But we might need to parse the docket to identify both.\n\nWe should read the Docket fully to confirm all Notice of Appeal entries. The Docket is fully visited (0-7889). So we have the entire docket. But we haven't read all tokens? Wait the Docket coverage says fully visited, but we only read tokens 0-7889? The docket token count is 7889, so yes we have the full docket. But we haven't parsed all docket entries. The read_document earlier gave us tokens 0-7889, but we didn't capture all entries. We need to parse the docket to extract all appeal entries. The docket is fully visited, but we need to identify all lines starting with \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\". The search earlier found 5 matches for \"appeal\" in docket. Let's view all 5 matches. We could do search_document_regex for \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" again but we already saw 2 matches. But maybe the docket has 5 matches for \"appeal\" but only 2 for \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\". The other matches might be \"Appeal to the\" or \"Appeal of\". Let's search again for \"Appeal of\" pattern. Or search for \"Appeal to the\" pattern again. But we already had that. Let's just search for \"Appeal to the\" again, but we saw matches earlier. But maybe we need to capture all.\n\nWe'll need to read the docket again but maybe we can search for \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" again to ensure we capture all. The search earlier gave 2 matches. But maybe there are more entries not flagged due to case sensitivity? The search earlier used pattern \"Notice of Appeal\" with case sensitivity? The search function supports flags; earlier used default flags (none). So it was case-sensitive. The docket has \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" all caps, so we found 2. That might be all. But we saw that the docket had two docket entries for the same appeal but maybe the same case number? But the snippet shows two entries: one with case number 53, another with case number 25-4521. So maybe there are indeed two distinct appeals. Let's examine the docket tokens 7111-7311 snippet shows \"Notice of Appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53 (Appeal fee FEE WAIVED.)\". The snippet after that at tokens 7243-7443 shows \"USCA Ninth Circuit Case Number (25-4521) and Preliminary Injunction Scheduling Order re 62 Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit, filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons.\" That indicates a second appeal. So we need to extract two distinct values: one for the first appeal, one for the second appeal.\n\nThus we need to append two entries. The current checklist has 1 value. We need to add another. So we need to do append_checklist with the second appeal.\n\nWe need to provide evidence: snippet text that shows the appeal. We have the snippet from tokens 7111-7311 and 7243-7443. We need to confirm we have the exact text.\n\nLet's capture the snippet for the first appeal: from tokens 7111-7311 snippet earlier. It contains:\n\n```\n-17 | ORDER GRANTING 60 SECOND STIPULATION TO EXTEND TIME FOR DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS' COMPLAINT by Judge Jeffrey S. White on 7/17/2025.

Lyons. (kmm2, COURT STAFF) (Filed on 7/22/2025) (Entered: 07/22/2025)\n```\n\nWe need to extract the value: \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" But the format requested: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" So we need to produce that for each appeal. However, the second appeal also appears to be filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. So the parties are same. But maybe there is a difference: the first appeal is of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, case number 53. The second appeal is of Preliminary Injunction Scheduling Order re 62, case number 25-4521. They are both filed by same parties. But we need distinct values. The value string might include the same parties. But we need separate entries.\n\nThus we need to append two values: one for each case. But the sentence format doesn't include case number. But we need to capture distinct values. We might need to include \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" for both, but they would be duplicate. It might not be considered distinct. But we need to differentiate them by case number. However the extraction format doesn't require case number; but to be distinct, we could include the case numbers in some way, such as \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (case 53)\" or include the case number for clarity. But the format specified: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' It doesn't allow case number. But we can still include case number in the text snippet but maybe not in the extracted value. But we need to provide distinct values. But if both are same, they'd duplicate. The system might consider them duplicates and not accept two identical entries. But maybe we need to include the case number in the value to make them distinct.\n\nBut the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if there are two distinct appeals, we need two entries. But if the only difference is case number, we need to differentiate. The extracted value format might be \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" for both, but they'd be duplicates. So maybe the second appeal is not considered distinct because the parties and court are same. But still the appeal is distinct because it's a different case. But extraction might consider them distinct because of the case number. Yet the format doesn't include case number. Maybe we need to include the case number as part of the parties? But that wouldn't be correct. We might need to include the case number as part of the value string: e.g., \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (case 53).\" That would make distinct values.\n\nBut the format specification says: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" It doesn't mention case numbers. But we could include the case number in the parties part? That would be inaccurate. But we could include it in the text snippet evidence but not in the extracted value. But then we would have duplicate extracted values, which might be considered duplicate. But the system might still accept duplicates? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct value means distinct extracted text. So we need distinct extracted values. If the extracted values are identical, they'd not be distinct. So we need to differentiate. So we must adjust the extracted value to reflect the difference. Maybe we can include the case number in the extracted value as part of the parties or court string. For instance: \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (case 53).\" That would satisfy distinctness. The format isn't strictly enforced, but we can add parentheses. The instructions didn't forbid adding extra info. But to be safe, we can produce extracted value as \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (case 53).\" Similarly for case 25-4521: \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (case 25-4521).\"\n\nLet's confirm the case number: For the first appeal, the docket shows \"Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53\". So case number 53. For second appeal, docket shows \"USCA Ninth Circuit Case Number (25-4521)\" and \"Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit, filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons.\" So case number 25-4521.\n\nThus we can produce two extracted values accordingly.\n\nNow we need to prepare evidence. We should include snippet text that shows the appeal. The snippet from tokens 7111-7311 includes the text for the first appeal. The snippet from tokens 7243-7443 includes the text for the second appeal. We'll include those as evidence.\n\nThus we need to call `append_checklist` with patch containing key \"Appeal\" and two entries.\n\nBut we must also ensure we don't duplicate the existing value. The current checklist has 1 value. Our new append will add 2 values. But we might end up with 3 values. But we need to ensure we don't duplicate. The existing value likely is \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" For the first appeal. So if we add the same again, we'd have duplicate. But we need to add second distinct appeal. So we need to check what the existing value is. We don't know exactly; but likely it's the first appeal. So we should append the second appeal only. But the instruction says \"Append newly extracted values\". So we should only add the second one. But we need to ensure we don't add duplicate. But we might not know the exact value. But to be safe, we can append both values, but then duplicate may occur. But the system might allow duplicates? It's unclear. But we might want to update the existing value: replace the list with both values. But we should use `update_checklist` to replace entire extracted list. That ensures we have the correct set: both values. That is allowed. We can use `update_checklist` to set the extracted list to two values. That will overwrite the old single value. That is safe. The instruction says use update_checklist when you have the complete authoritative set. So yes, we should use update_checklist. That will replace the existing value for Appeal with the two new values.\n\nThus we will call update_checklist with patch for key \"Appeal\", providing two extracted entries with evidence.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each. Provide evidence array with text snippet, source_document: \"Docket\", location: maybe \"tokens 7111-7311\" or \"Line 62\". Provide the snippet.\n\nLet's gather snippet texts. For first appeal, we have:\n\n```\n62 | 2025-07-21 | NOTICE OF APPEAL to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. Appeal of Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, 53 (Appeal fee FEE WAIVED.) (Kurlan, Elizabeth) (Filed on 7/21/2025) Modified on 7/22/2025 (kmm2, COURT STAFF). (Entered: 07/21/2025)\n```\n\nSecond appeal snippet:\n\n```\n63 | 2025-07-22 | USCA Ninth Circuit Case Number (25-4521) and Preliminary Injunction Scheduling Order re 62 Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit, filed by Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons. (kmm2, COURT STAFF) (Filed on 7/22/2025) (Entered: 07/22/2025)\n```\n\nWe will use these as evidence text.\n\nNow we need to produce the extracted values in required format. \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\" for each case, maybe with case number. Let's include case numbers to differentiate. So:\n\n- Value 1: \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (case 53).\"\n- Value 2: \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M. Lyons appealed to 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (case 25-4521).\"\n\nWe need to ensure that the format includes [parties] and [court]. The case numbers are extra, but not disallowed. The instruction didn't forbid extra info. But to be safe, we might omit case numbers. However, then we would have duplicate values. The system might consider duplicates and not count them as distinct. But the requirement is to extract every distinct value. So we need to keep them distinct. So we should include case numbers. The format is somewhat flexible. We'll include case numbers in parentheses.\n\nNow we produce the update_checklist call.\n\nLet's produce JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Appeal\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Appeal: Kristi Noem, Todd M.
