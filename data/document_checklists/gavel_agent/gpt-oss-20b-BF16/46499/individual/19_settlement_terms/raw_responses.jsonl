Settlement terms may be in a settlement agreement file, but not listed. Maybe the settlement agreement is a separate doc not in list? But there is no settlement agreement doc listed. The settlement mention refers to previous case settlement agreement that bars government. But terms might be in that agreement. But we need to extract terms from documents.

But requirement: extract all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. If none, could be not applicable. But must provide evidence of Not Applicable. We need to find evidence that no settlement terms are present. That can be done by searching for \"agreement\" and seeing no terms; but that's weak. Alternatively, we could search for \"settlement terms\" or \"payment\" but might be false.\n\nBetter approach: search for \"settlement agreement\" again but examine context for terms. The earlier matches show \"settlement agreement\" but not terms. Could be longer. Need to read more around those matches. For each of the 4 matches, we could read more tokens around to see if terms present. Let's read more tokens around these matches.\n\nWe have matches: in Complaint, tokens 4285-4485; in Ex Parte, tokens 1438-1638; in First Amended Complaint, tokens 6143-6343; in Notice of Motion, tokens 9405-9605.\n\nWe need to read broader context maybe 2000 tokens around each. But each doc we can read up to 10k tokens. Let's pick one doc with settlement agreement mention and read more around that area to see if terms. Let's start with Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order, we already read 1400-2000, which includes the settlement agreement mention but no terms. Could read earlier tokens 1200-1400 or later tokens 2000-2200. Let's search around again.\n\nAlso the Complaint may have settlement terms? Let's read more around 4285-4475 but maybe more tokens. Let's request read_document for Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 4200-4600. That might capture more context. Also for First Amended Complaint tokens 6100-6500.\n\nAlso for Notice of Motion tokens 9300-9700.\n\nThus our action: search_document_regex maybe to find \"agreement\" or \"terms\" but we already have. Better read.\n\nGiven we need evidence for each term, we may find none. Then we need to mark Not Applicable with evidence. Evidence: we can quote that no settlement agreement text found, but that might not be sufficient. But we can search for \"settlement\" and see no terms. However, maybe settlement terms are in the Docket documents. We haven't visited Docket. Could be included there.\n\nWe might need to check Docket for settlement terms. Search in Docket for \"settlement\" maybe. Let's use search_document_regex on Docket for \"settlement\". That will return any matches. That could help decide.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Docket for \"settlement\". Or maybe \"settlement agreement\". Let's search Docket for \"settlement agreement\". Use doc_name Docket. That might produce matches. If no matches, indicates no settlement terms. But we still need evidence that no settlement terms exist. But we could also search for \"terms\" but might show other contexts.\n\nBetter: search for \"agreement\" or \"settlement\" across all docs. But we already did. But maybe the settlement terms are in a separate doc not in list. But list shows 8 docs. So settlement terms might be in these 8. Let's search Docket for \"settlement\". Use search_document_regex.

So we have two distinct values: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits.\" and \"bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\" But note the difference: one is for Yu, the other is for UNNJ settlement. They are similar but distinct contexts. We should extract both.\n\nWe must provide evidence. We need to read the relevant text to capture the exact phrase. The search returns context. For the first, the search in Ex Parte had context 1454-1654. We need to read that range to capture the exact sentence. Could read that part. For the second, the search in Complaint had context 4293-4493. We should read that.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 4293-4493. Also read Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order tokens 1454-1654. But we can only do one action per turn. We need to choose one. Perhaps read the Ex Parte first since we already partially read 1400-2000; we saw the phrase. But we need to capture evidence snippet. We can read more precisely the range 1450-1650. So we do read_document on Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order tokens 1450-1650.\n\nThen we will parse the text for the term and then append. But we need to do exactly one action. So next action: read_document on Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order tokens 1450-1650.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order\",\"start_token\":1450,\"end_token\":1650}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 1450, "end_token": 1650}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6066, "completion_tokens": 697, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have seen some settlement agreement terms in Ex Parte TRO: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits.\" That is a settlement term. Also other documents mention settlement agreements: UNNJ settlement agreement bars government from using enrollment. Also earlier \"settlement agreement in that case where the government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason...\" It's the same concept. So we need to extract each distinct term. Terms are substantive obligations agreed to in settlement that are not court orders. Here we have \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits.\" That appears in multiple docs. Need to extract distinct value: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits.\" Also maybe \"government barred from using enrollment as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\" That's slightly different wording but same meaning? Could be considered distinct values? They are distinct textual expressions. But we need distinct values; each unique phrase. So we should extract each unique phrase. We see in Ex Parte TRO: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits.\" In complaint: same phrase appears. In First Amended Complaint: \"UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\" That's slightly different. So we have two distinct phrases. Also maybe elsewhere? Let's search again for \"agreed not to use\" across all docs. Step 10 search covered that. Also step 7 search for settlement agreement. But we might need to read more context to capture the exact phrase. Let's read more of Ex Parte TRO around token 1450-1650 already read. That covers phrase. Good. Also read Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief around tokens 4285-4493 already read; that contains same phrase. Let's read that part fully to capture text. It includes tokens 4285-4493; we saw partial lines earlier but maybe need more context. We can search again for \"agreed not to use\" in that doc. Use search_document_regex specifying doc_name or doc_names? We can search in Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for pattern \"agreed not to use\". We'll get context. Then read the snippet. Also search for \"bars the government from using\" in that doc. That phrase appears. So we need two entries.\n\nAlso there might be a settlement agreement in other docs: e.g., \"UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\" That appears in First Amended Complaint. Also could appear in Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction etc. But we can search across all docs for pattern \"bars the government from using\". That's step 10 already found matches. But we should read each match to capture exact phrase. Let's search again for \"bars the government from using\" across all 8 documents. That will give context. Then we can read the snippet to capture the phrase.\n\nAlso maybe \"settlement agreement\" phrase on other docs. But that may be same phrase. But we need distinct values. We should capture each unique textual phrase. So far we have:\n\n1. \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits.\"\n2. \"UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\"\n\nAlso maybe \"UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\" is same as above but includes \"UNNJ settlement agreement\" phrase. That is distinct phrase.\n\nAlso \"settlement agreement in that case where the government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits.\" That phrase includes \"settlement agreement in that case\". Might be distinct. But we can choose to capture the phrase exactly.\n\nThus we need to read the relevant sections for each phrase.\n\nAction: search_document_regex for pattern \"agreed not to use\" and \"bars the government from using\" in all documents.

But the tool expects one pattern. We could combine with OR. But guidelines: Use precise pattern anchored. But we can search separately for each.\n\nBetter: perform two searches: one for \"agreed not to use\" across all docs. Then one for \"bars the government from using\". That will give us all matches. Let's do first search.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex with pattern \"agreed not to use\" across all docs. That should return matches.

We have seen settlement agreements in multiple documents, but need to extract substantive obligations that are contractual, not court orders. We saw lines in Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits.\" That's a contractual term. Also in First Amended Complaint: \"UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\" That's similar.\n\nWe need to read more of the documents to see other settlement terms, e.g., maybe there is a settlement agreement that includes other obligations. We haven't seen any other terms. Let's search for \"agreement\" or \"settlement\" more thoroughly. Perhaps the settlement agreement has multiple obligations. We should search for \"agreement\" with \"not to use\" etc. But might have other terms like \"the government shall pay X dollars\", \"the plaintiff shall receive X\". Let's search for \"settlement agreement\" again but maybe in other docs. Already searched all docs, found 4 matches. Those were in Complaint, Ex Parte, First Amended, Notice of Motion. The Complaint and First Amended match but those are complaints referencing the settlement agreement. They likely don't contain the terms themselves. The Ex Parte contains the settlement terms. The Notice of Motion might also include terms. Let's search within Notice of Motion for \"settlement agreement\" again but we saw part. Perhaps the Notice of Motion text includes \"bars the government from using her enrollment...\" that's a term. Also might include other obligations.\n\nThus only term we have so far: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits\" (in Ex Parte). Also similar phrase in First Amended.\n\nWe should check if there are additional terms like \"the government shall not deny...\". Let's search for \"denial of immigration benefits\" to see if other context. Let's do a regex search across all docs for \"deny any immigration benefits\" or \"deny immigration benefits\". Also \"denial of immigration benefits\". And \"agree not to\" etc.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex for pattern \"not to use\" we already did and found one match. But maybe there are other terms. Let's search for \"agree to\" maybe. But we should focus on settlement terms.\n\nLet's search for \"agreement\" maybe \"settlement agreement\" again but with context around. But we saw the matches. We need to verify if the settlement agreement includes other terms. Let's request reading more of the Ex Parte section beyond tokens 1400-2000. We already read that part. But maybe there is a later part of the order? But the order is 6,844 tokens; we read 1400-2000 window. The settlement agreement clause appears near 1450-1650. That is within. There might be other clauses later in the order, but we don't need to read entire order. But to be safe, maybe search again for \"settlement agreement\" within Ex Parte doc to get all matches. But we already have that. But we might need to read the portion around that to capture the exact text of the settlement terms. We need to capture the exact phrase.\n\nAlso, the First Amended Complaint references the settlement agreement but not the terms. So we can ignore. The Notice of Motion references the settlement agreement but just has the same phrase. So we have two sources with same term.\n\nThus we have one distinct term: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits\".\n\nWe might consider if the settlement includes other obligations, like \"the government shall pay X\" but not in these docs. Let's search for \"pay\" with settlement. But likely not.\n\nLet's search for \"settlement agreement\" again in Ex Parte doc but with context. We can read the surrounding context maybe tokens 1400-1700 include the term. We already have that snippet. The term appears exactly: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits.\" Let's capture that.\n\nAlso in First Amended Complaint, it says \"UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\". That's also a term. It's similar but phrasing slightly different: \"bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\". That is essentially the same obligation. Should we treat it as the same distinct value? The requirement says \"extract every distinct value\". So if phrasing differs, it might be considered distinct. But they refer to the same obligation, but the text is different. We need to consider if we treat them as distinct. Probably we should treat each unique textual instance as a distinct value. But maybe the same term expressed differently counts as separate. The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct value based on textual content. So these two are slightly different. So we should list both.\n\nThus we need to capture the two distinct textual snippets: one from Ex Parte, one from First Amended Complaint. Also maybe from Notice of Motion: \"bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\" appears there too. That wording is identical to First Amended? In Notice of Motion snippet, it says \"bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\" Yes same phrase. So that's duplicate. So we have two distinct values: one with \"agreed not to use...\" and another with \"bars the government from using...\". We need to extract each unique text.\n\nThus we need to read the Ex Parte doc to capture that phrase. We already have snippet. But we need to verify location and extract. We also need the First Amended Complaint snippet. We have snippet. But we might want to capture the exact token range. But we already have snippet from tokens 6143-6343. That includes phrase. Let's capture exactly. The snippet shows lines 18-19: \"UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\". That's the phrase. We need to include the entire phrase. Let's capture that phrase exactly. It might include trailing punctuation. The snippet shows no period. We can include as is.\n\nNow we need to create append_checklist entries for each value, with evidence referencing the source document and location. We need evidence list with text snippet, source_document, location. For location, we can provide token range or page. We have token ranges. For Ex Parte: tokens 1450-1650 snippet. Let's use token range 1450-1650. For First Amended Complaint: tokens 6143-6343 snippet. We can use that token range.\n\nWe also should confirm if there are other settlement terms. Maybe in the Order Granting Motions? But probably no. But to be safe, we could search for \"settlement agreement\" in Order Granting Motions. But given the pattern, likely no. But we can still search. Let's run search_document_regex for \"settlement agreement\" in Order Granting Motions? The earlier search had pattern \"settlement agreement\" on all documents, found 4 matches. That includes all four docs. The Order Granting Motions was not mentioned. So no match.\n\nThus only two distinct terms.\n\nWe should now append these two entries. We'll call append_checklist with patch: key \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\" with extracted array containing two entries.\n\nWe need to include evidence arrays.\n\nFor Ex Parte: evidence text: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits.\" Source_document: \"Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order\". Location: tokens 1450-1650 (or page?). We'll use \"tokens 1450-1650\".\n\nFor First Amended: evidence text: \"UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\". Source_document: \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". Location: tokens 6143-6343.\n\nWe might also include the snippet from Notice of Motion but it's duplicate. We don't need duplicate.\n\nThus we will call append_checklist.\n\nLet's do that.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 1450-1650\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\",\n              \"source_document\": \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 6143-6343\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Significant_Terms_of_Settlement", "extracted": [{"value": "government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits", "evidence": [{"text": "government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits", "source_document": "Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order", "location": "tokens 1450-1650"}]}, {"value": "UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits", "evidence": [{"text": "UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits", "source_document": "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "tokens 6143-6343"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5832, "completion_tokens": 1956, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have 8 documents. We searched for \"settlement agreement\" and \"agreed not to use\". There might be other settlement agreements in other docs not yet visited: Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences, Notice of Motion, Docket, Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction. Likely settlement agreements are in Complaint documents, not in orders. But could be in other pleadings. We should search for \"settlement agreement\" again across all docs to ensure we didn't miss. But we already did search across all docs earlier, but we might need to read more tokens for those matches. Let's examine search results: step 17 found matches in Complaint, Ex Parte, First Amended Complaint, Notice of Motion. No matches in other docs. So likely only those two terms.\n\nBut there might be other settlement terms not captured by the phrase \"settlement agreement\". For example, \"settlement\" might appear but not full phrase. Yet we captured earlier search for \"settlement\" which found 5 matches across 8 docs. Let's recall those matches: Step 2 found 5 matches: 1 in Complaint, 1 in Ex Parte, 1 in First Amended Complaint (+2 more docs). Step 3 found 4 matches: 1 in Complaint, 1 in Ex Parte, 1 in First Amended Complaint (+1 more docs). Step 7 found 4 matches: same. Step 13 also 4 matches. So there were two other docs with \"settlement\" not necessarily \"settlement agreement\". They might be the docket? or other docs. We didn't read them. Let's search again for \"settlement\" but more context maybe \"agreed to settle\", \"settlement terms\". But the instruction: \"extract the settlement terms from the legal documents.\" Settlement terms are substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement. We need all distinct terms. So the two extracted terms are likely correct. However, we need to confirm if any other settlement terms exist. Let's search for \"settle\" or \"settled\" maybe. But given the limited context, likely only those two.\n\nBut we have to be systematic: check if any other documents have settlement agreements. Use search_document_regex on all docs for \"settlement agreement\" again, maybe with flags IGNORECASE. Already did. But we might need to read the matches to ensure we didn't miss other terms. The matches returned token ranges; we saw for each doc. But we didn't read the content fully. For each match, we need to read the token range to see if there are additional settlement terms beyond those two. For example, in Ex Parte, maybe the settlement agreement contains other obligations like \"the government will not use her enrollment\" and maybe also \"the government will pay a sum\" etc. We only captured the \"not to use\" clause. There might be other terms. We need to read the full settlement agreement section.\n\nThus, we should read the Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order around the settlement agreement section beyond the snippet we have. The snippet we read includes the clause. The settlement agreement might include multiple clauses. We need to read more tokens around that area to capture all settlement terms.\n\nSimilarly, the First Amended Complaint may have a settlement agreement section with multiple clauses. We captured one clause about \"bars the government from using her enrollment\". There might be other clauses like \"the government will pay damages\" etc. We need to read more tokens around that match to capture all terms.\n\nThus, next action: use read_document to read more context around the settlement agreement sections in each of the two documents.\n\nWe need to decide token ranges. For Ex Parte, we have tokens 1438-1638 read. That likely includes the settlement clause. But maybe there are other settlement terms earlier or later. We could read tokens 1400-2000 (already read). We have read 1400-2000 earlier, covering 1400-2000. That includes 1400-1700 and 1400-2000. So we have read 1400-2000, which includes the settlement clause. There may be other settlement terms before 1400? Let's check earlier token ranges: maybe 1200-1400. We haven't read that. But the settlement agreement likely appears near the match found (tokens 1438-1638). So maybe no other settlement terms earlier. But to be safe, we should read tokens 1200-1400 to see if any other settlement terms. Also read tokens 2000-2200 to see if any further settlement terms.\n\nSimilarly, for First Amended Complaint, we have read tokens 6143-6350 (the match). That probably covers the settlement clause. But there may be more terms earlier or later. Let's read tokens 6000-6200 and 6350-6500.\n\nThus, next action: read_document for Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order tokens 1200-1400. Also read_document for Ex Parte tokens 2000-2200. Also read_document for First Amended Complaint tokens 6000-6200 and 6350-6500. That's four read_document actions, but we can only do one per turn. We need to choose one action. We might consolidate: read_document for Ex Parte tokens 1200-1400 first, then later read others.\n\nBut we need to be efficient: we have already read 1400-2000. The next step is to read 1200-1400 for Ex Parte. That will give earlier context. Let's do that.\n\nSo next action: read_document on Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order tokens 1200-1400.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order\",\"start_token\":1200,\"end_token\":1400}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 1200, "end_token": 1400}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5796, "completion_tokens": 1282, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Are there any other settlement terms? We need to scan other documents for settlement terms. Also check for other documents that might contain settlement terms. The other documents: Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences (maybe settlement terms?), Notice of Motion and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order; Memorandum of Law, Docket, Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction. Settlement terms likely in pleadings: Complaint, Amended Complaint, maybe the motion for temporary restraining order. Might be in the \"Notice of Motion and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order; Memorandum of Law\" maybe contains settlement terms? But we saw a match for settlement agreement in the Notice of Motion area: \"bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\" included in that document (but we captured that as part of First Amended Complaint? Actually the Notice of Motion also contains that phrase; but we already extracted from First Amended Complaint. But the phrase appears in both documents. We might need to treat each distinct value separately; identical values across different docs maybe counted once. The requirement: Extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So duplicates should be considered one value. So we have two distinct values. But we need to ensure we have captured all settlement terms. There may be other settlement terms in other docs. For example, in the Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions ... maybe the order includes settlement terms? But orders typically don't include settlement terms. The Order may be an order that is part of the settlement. However, the prompt says \"The substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order.\" So if the settlement is in an order, we should not include those terms. So we should exclude terms that are incorporated into an order. The orders listed are not the settlement; so if they contain settlement terms, that might be in the settlement but then incorporated into the order. The extraction rule says: \"If some terms are incorporated into an order, extract only the non-incorporated (purely contractual) terms.\" So if the order includes settlement terms, we don't include them. So we should not look at orders. But we might still consider the settlement terms that appear in the order? But those might be part of the settlement but incorporated into the order. So we should exclude them. The two terms we extracted come from a pleading (Ex Parte TRO) and from First Amended Complaint. Both are pleadings, not orders. So they are purely contractual terms. So we should keep them.\n\nBut we need to check if there are more terms in other documents. Let's search in the other documents for \"agreement\" or \"settlement\" maybe. We already did regex search for settlement agreement and found matches in Complaint, Ex Parte TRO, First Amended Complaint, Notice of Motion. But the Notice of Motion also had the phrase \"bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\". That phrase is same as the one captured from First Amended Complaint. So no new distinct value.\n\nBut there might be other settlement terms not captured by \"settlement agreement\" phrase. For example, \"settlement terms\" or \"agree to\" or \"the parties agree\" etc. We might need to search for \"agree to\" or \"agreed to\" but that might be too broad. But we can search for \"agreed\" pattern. But we already have \"agreed not to use\". That was captured. There might be other settlement terms like \"payments\" or \"compensation\" etc. But maybe none.\n\nLet's search the \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" maybe has settlement terms like \"the parties have agreed to pay...\". Let's search for \"agreed to\" or \"agreement\" across all documents. We can do a search. But maybe it's not necessary if we already found all. But to be safe, we should search for \"agreement\" pattern in all documents. But the search function can do regex. Let's run search_document_regex on all documents for \"agreement\" or \"agreed to\" pattern. But we must pick one action each turn. We could call search_document_regex. Let's do that: pattern: \"agreement\" maybe too broad. But we can refine: \"agreement[^\\n]{0,50}\" but not necessary. Let's just search \"agreement\" to see if any other settlement terms appear. But we need to avoid reading the entire doc. The search_document_regex will give context. But we may get many matches. But we can set top_k small maybe 5. But the function has default top_k 5. That might show 5 matches per doc. That might be enough. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"agreement\" and flags IGNORECASE. Or maybe \"settlement agreement\" we already used. But \"agreement\" might show other settlement terms. But the phrase \"agreement\" could refer to other types of agreements unrelated to settlement. But we just need distinct settlement terms. But maybe the phrase \"settlement agreement\" is the best indicator. But we might still miss terms that don't use that phrase. For example, \"the parties agree to not use her enrollment\" is captured by \"agreed not to use\". Already captured. But there might be \"the parties agree to pay\" etc. Let's search \"agree to\" pattern.\n\nBetter: Search for \"agree to\" pattern with word boundaries: \"\\bagree to\\b\". That might capture \"the parties agree to pay\" etc. But we must confirm that it's a settlement term. But we might find non-settlement contexts. But we can check the evidence. Let's search.\n\nWe should decide next action: use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"agree to\". That will return matches. Then we can read to confirm if they are settlement terms. We'll read them.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex doc_name=\"all\", pattern=\"\\bagree to\\b\", flags=IGNORECASE, top_k=5, context_tokens=200.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"\\\\bagree to\\\\b\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "\\bagree to\\b", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5831, "completion_tokens": 1355, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We'll see if any other settlement terms.\n\nOk next action: search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"settlement\". Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"settlement\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "settlement", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5686, "completion_tokens": 769, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Are there any other settlement terms in documents that are not captured? Need to verify if any other settlement terms exist in other documents. The key is to extract every distinct value found in any document. So far we have two: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits\" and \"UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\". Might be additional terms like \"government agreed not to use enrollment ... as reason to deny any benefits\" appears in other docs? The search results show only those two. But we need to ensure there's no other settlement terms in other documents like Order Granting Motions, Docket, Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction, etc. We should search for \"settlement agreement\" again? Already searched but only found those. But maybe other settlement terms expressed differently, like \"settlement\" but not \"agreement\". Could be \"settlement terms\" as \"not to use her enrollment\" appears multiple times. But maybe there is a \"settlement\" clause about \"non-disclosure\" or \"non-competition\" etc. Let's search for \"not to use\" phrase again across all. But we did earlier and found only the same. But we might need to search for \"agreement\" or \"settle\" etc. Actually the definition: \"Significant_Terms_of_Settlement: substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order.\" So any such terms could be in any document. The settlement agreement may include other obligations like \"The parties agree to release each other from claims\" etc. But we didn't find those. Could be in other documents like \"Notice of Motion\" etc. But we didn't search for \"release\" or \"compensation\". Let's search for \"release\" maybe. But the key is to find explicit settlement terms. But the examples given: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits\" seems relevant. The other \"UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment ... as grounds\". So maybe only those two. But we must ensure we didn't miss any other terms like \"the parties agree to pay $X\". Let's search across all documents for \"settlement\" again, but we already did. Could search for \"settlement agreement\" again. But we may need to confirm that all relevant terms are captured.\n\nMaybe there are terms in the \"Order Granting Motions...\" or \"Notice of Motion...\" that mention settlement agreements? The search results didn't show. But maybe the documents contain \"settlement\" but not \"agreement\". But the search pattern used earlier was \"settlement\". That should catch \"settlement\" words. But maybe the token range didn't cover entire doc. But we saw in search results, there were 5 total matches in 8 docs. Those 5 are the ones we saw. So no other \"settlement\" occurrences. So likely only those two settlement terms are present.\n\nBut we need to ensure we didn't miss any other settlement terms that are not labeled as \"settlement\". According to definition, they are obligations agreed in a settlement. Could be a \"defense\" or \"release\" clause. But those would also mention \"settlement\" likely. So likely we have captured all.\n\nThus we have two values. The checklist currently has 1 key with 2 values. No other keys. The \"Empty Keys\" count shows 0/1. That means there is 1 key total and we have values. So all keys are filled. We can stop. However we need to ensure that each extracted value includes evidence. The append_checklist step earlier appended 2 values with evidence. But we need to confirm that the evidence is correct. The evidence for Value 1: Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order tokens 1450-1650. The evidence snippet is \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits\". That is correct. Value 2: First Amended Complaint tokens 6143-6343. The snippet is \"UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\". That is correct.\n\nThus the checklist has 2 values with evidence. We need to confirm that no more values exist. The search results show only these two. So we can stop.\n\nBut we need to check if any other settlement terms are in the documents but not captured by the search. For safety, maybe we should search for \"settlement\" with ignore case and multiline across all documents. But we already did search 24. But maybe we need to search for \"settling\" or \"settles\" etc. But likely not. The key is that settlement terms are usually within settlement agreements. So we can stop.\n\nThus we should call stop.\n\nWe should provide JSON with decision: \"stop\" and a reason.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All checklist keys have been fully extracted with evidence; no additional significant settlement terms found in the corpus.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist keys have been fully extracted with evidence; no additional significant settlement terms found in the corpus.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6759, "completion_tokens": 1061, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The status: keys: Significant_Terms_of_Settlement has 2 values extracted. The snapshot says 1/1 filled, 0 empty. But the system says \"current status: Keys with Values 1/1, Empty 0/1\" seems contradictory. Actually maybe there is only one key: Significant_Terms_of_Settlement. So empty 0/1? That seems wrong. But we need to confirm if all significant settlement terms are extracted. The earlier steps extracted two values: from Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order (government agreed not to use her enrollment) and from First Amended Complaint (bars government from using enrollment). Are there other settlement terms in other documents? Possibly in \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" maybe earlier part contains settlement terms? But earlier search for settlement agreement found matches in Complaint but they didn't include settlement terms maybe. The earlier step 20 appended 2 values. That likely was the two terms. But maybe there are more settlement terms in other documents such as \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" or \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\". We haven't searched those. Also the \"Notice of Motion\" may contain settlement terms, but it seems to mention settlement agreement. But maybe the settlement terms are the same. Are there other settlement agreements? The \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" may have a settlement agreement earlier, but we didn't capture terms. Let's check.\n\nWe should search for \"agreed not to use\" or \"bars the government from using\" in other documents. We did earlier search across all documents pattern \"agreed not to use|bars the government from using\" and found 3 matches: 1 in Complaint, 1 in Ex Parte, 1 in First Amended. So there is a match in Complaint as well. So we need to extract that term from Complaint too. That would be third value. Let's examine that match.\n\nWe need to open the relevant token range in Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief where that phrase appears. We didn't read it. Let's locate the token range. The earlier search results show match 1 for \"agreed not to use|bars the government from using\" pattern. But we haven't seen the snippet. We need to read that portion.\n\nSo we need to find the token range for the match in Complaint. We might search again. Use search_document_regex on Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for pattern \"agreed not to use|bars the government from using\" with maybe context. Let's call search_document_regex.\n\nWe then need to read that snippet. The snippet likely includes \"government agreed not to use her enrollment\" etc.\n\nThus we need to extract that term: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits.\" That is a settlement term. It's not a court order. So it's a significant settlement term.\n\nAlso maybe there is a settlement agreement in \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" or \"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\". But likely not. Let's search all documents for pattern \"settlement\" but we already found many matches. But those may not contain settlement terms. The settlement agreement may appear in many. But the specific term \"agreed not to use\" is likely the only settlement term in the Complaint.\n\nThus we need to add that third value.\n\nAdditionally, there may be other settlement terms like \"bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\" which appears in First Amended Complaint and Notice of Motion. That term is captured as second value? Wait earlier we had two values: from Ex Parte (government agreed not to use her enrollment) and from First Amended (bars the government from using her enrollment). But the phrase \"bars the government from using her enrollment\" appears also in Notice of Motion. But that's the same settlement term? The settlement agreement in the First Amended Complaint says \"bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\" That is similar but maybe a distinct term? It may be same but referencing UNNJ. But the settlement term is \"bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\" That is distinct from \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits.\" They are similar but different wording. So we already have that second value. But there might be other settlement terms in other documents like \"bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\" appears also in Notice of Motion. But it's same term; we don't need duplicate.\n\nAre there other settlement terms? The \"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" may mention settlement terms? Not likely. But we should search all docs for \"agreed not to use\" again. The earlier search found 3 matches, one in Complaint. So likely only 3 matches: Ex Parte, First Amended, Complaint. So we need third.\n\nAlso maybe \"settlement agreement\" pattern might be used differently but those do not contain settlement terms. However we could search for \"not to use\" pattern again. But we did earlier search for \"not to use|bars the government\" and got 3 matches. Let's confirm. Use search_document_regex on all docs pattern \"not to use|bars the government\". That we did earlier. It found 3 matches. Only one was Complaint we didn't capture. So we need to read that.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief pattern \"agreed not to use|bars the government from using\" maybe. Let's call.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex with doc_name = \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" pattern \"agreed not to use|bars the government\".\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n  \"pattern\": \"agreed not to use|bars the government\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 5,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "pattern": "agreed not to use|bars the government", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6553, "completion_tokens": 1279, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have 2 values already. But maybe other docs contain terms. We need to search for settlement agreements in other documents that might include terms.\n\nWe have not visited Docket, Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction. Also First Amended Complaint (we have a match that mentions settlement agreement). Maybe there are terms like \"government agreed not to use her enrollment\" etc. But those were extracted? The two values are likely \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny immigration benefits\" from Ex Parte and \"government bars the government from using her enrollment\" from First Amended. But maybe there are other terms like \"government will not use enrollment for denial\" etc. We need to check other docs for settlement terms.\n\nAlso maybe in order granting motions there is a settlement? Probably not.\n\nWe should search all documents for \"settlement agreement\" again maybe find other occurrences. Already did search; found 4 matches. We saw matches in Complaint, Ex Parte, First Amended, Notice of Motion. Those we covered? We extracted from Ex Parte and First Amended. Complaint and Notice of Motion likely did not have settlement terms? They mention settlement agreement but may not detail terms. But perhaps they mention \"government agreed not to use her enrollment\" in Complaint? Let's examine the Complaint snippet: lines 8-9 show \"She was a member of a settlement agreement in that case where the government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits.\" That is a term. Did we extract that? The two values list: from Ex Parte and First Amended. But the Complaint snippet also contains similar term. Maybe we need to include it. The two values maybe from Ex Parte and First Amended only; but Complaint also has same term. Maybe we should extract from Complaint too. But maybe the two values are the same? They might be identical text. But still we need distinct values. The same phrase appears in multiple docs but same text, but we can list only once? The requirement: Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. If same text appears multiple times, it's same distinct value. So we only need unique ones. So only one value \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny any immigration benefits\" appears across docs. That is captured? Possibly the value from Ex Parte is that sentence. The First Amended also includes \"bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\". Slightly different wording but similar meaning. Are they considered distinct? They are slightly different phrasing. So we have two distinct values: one about not using enrollment as reason; second about bars government from using enrollment as grounds. Both are terms.\n\nBut there might be other terms: maybe \"government will not use enrollment for denial\" etc. Search for \"agreed to\" maybe. The search for \"agreed to\" had no matches. But \"agree to\" had no matches. So likely only those.\n\nHowever, maybe the Order Granting Motions has settlement terms? Let's search \"settlement\" in that order. We saw a match but it didn't show terms. It mentions \"settlement agreement\" but no details. So likely only the two.\n\nBut we should confirm by reading Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief around the settlement agreement section to verify if a term exists. We already have snippet but we need to read the full section to capture any other distinct term. Let's read around tokens 4200-4600 maybe. Let's call read_document for Complaint.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":4200,\"end_token\":4600}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 4200, "end_token": 4600}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6732, "completion_tokens": 788, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The user has previously appended 2 values for Significant_Terms_of_Settlement, presumably from Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order and First Amended Complaint. The status shows 1/1 keys filled, 0 empty. That means the only key is filled with 2 values. Are there any other settlement terms? The goal is to extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. They have added 2 values from the two documents. But perhaps there could be other settlement terms in other documents, like the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, maybe also the \"Complaint\" itself might contain settlement terms? But earlier we saw \"bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits\" which is a settlement term. That might be from that Complaint. But we need to check if that is already captured. Step 20, they appended 2 values. Those likely were from Ex Parte and First Amended Complaint. But the Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief also contains a settlement agreement line: \"She is a class member under the UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\" That is a settlement term. Did they capture that? The status shows 2 values: one from Ex Parte, one from First Amended Complaint. Perhaps the Complaint also has a settlement term but maybe they didn't treat it as distinct? Let's examine the text. The search results show the Complaint text around 4285-4493 had the settlement agreement mention. But maybe that was from the Complaint itself, not the Amended Complaint. Wait: The Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is the original complaint. The First Amended Complaint also includes similar text. So maybe 2 values are indeed from the Complaint and the First Amended Complaint? But the status shows that values were from Ex Parte and First Amended Complaint. Actually Step 20 appended 2 values; maybe those are from Ex Parte and First Amended Complaint. The Complaint might not have a settlement term. Let's search the Complaint for \"settlement agreement\" pattern. Step 9 did search and found 1 match. Step 9 indicates matched in Complaint. That match likely is the same as Step 4 where they found match in Complaint. But Step 20 appended 2 values: maybe one from Ex Parte and one from Complaint? I'm not certain.\n\nWe need to confirm if there are any additional settlement terms in the other documents that have not been captured. The status shows 2 values. The user says \"All checklist keys have been fully extracted with evidence; no additional significant settlement terms found in the corpus.\" That was step 25. But now step 26 shows one key filled with 2 values. So the last user message says \"Your Next Action\" with the current status. It seems the assistant should decide whether to stop or continue. The status indicates all keys filled (1/1). So we should stop. However, we must ensure that \"every distinct value\" has been extracted. But maybe we missed some. We should double-check other documents: Docket, Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction, etc. They may have settlement terms. But given the search earlier, only 5 matches for settlement. Those matched in Complaint, Ex Parte, First Amended Complaint, Notice of Motion, Order Granting Motions. The Notice of Motion also might contain settlement terms. But the status shows 2 values only. Did they capture terms from Notice of Motion? The search results for \"settlement\" show match in Notice of Motion (tokens 9405-9605). That snippet did not show term, but the snippet shows \"government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\" That is a settlement term. That might be same as in First Amended Complaint or Complaint. It's likely repeated. But we need unique values. The unique terms: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny immigration benefits\" and \"bars the government from using her enrollment as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\" These are semantically same but wording may differ. They should be considered distinct? The instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct value means distinct in text? Probably yes. So we need to capture each distinct phrase. The two values appended may be those two. But we might also have a term from the Complaint or Notice that is slightly different. Let's examine the Complaint snippet again: Step 28 read shows lines 9-10: \"She is a class member under the UNNJ settlement agreement, which bars the government from using her enrollment in UNNJ as grounds for denial of immigration benefits.\" That's the same as Notice of Motion. But they might be considered same. But the second value could be from Ex Parte: \"government agreed not to use her enrollment as a reason to deny immigration benefits.\" That's a distinct phrase. So the two values are the two distinct phrases.\n\nThus all distinct values captured. Looks like no other settlement terms appear. So we can stop.\n\nThus we will output JSON decision stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items have been extracted with evidence; no further distinct settlement terms remain.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items have been extracted with evidence; no further distinct settlement terms remain.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6232, "completion_tokens": 1105, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
