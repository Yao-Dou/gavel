The Docket had \"Notice of Questions RE Motions for Temporary Restraining Orders (10 in 4:25-cv-03244-JSW), (7 in 4:25-cv-03292-JSW), and (9 in 4:25-cv-03140-JSW). Signed by Judge Jeffrey S.

Consolidation might be indicated by \"See related case\" or \"see also\" etc.\n\nMaybe \"MDL\" indicates consolidation. But we should search for \"MDL\" again. Already did but found matches but no mention of consolidation. The MDL Master Case maybe indicates consolidation.\n\nBut the question: \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted: Any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s), including identifying information.\" So if we find \"MDL Master Case\" likely indicates consolidation. The docket had \"Notice of Motion/Stipulation Filed in MDL Master Case by Zhuoer Chen, ... re 7 Emergency MOTION...\" That indicates MDL Master Case, but we need identifying info. The MDL Master Case may be a docket number? Not given. But we could include the phrase \"MDL Master Case\" as evidence.\n\nBut better to search the other documents for \"MDL Master Case\" or \"MDL\" maybe.\n\nWe should scan the Complaint documents. The docket shows many docket numbers referencing 4:25-cv-03244-JSW etc. Those are the docket numbers for the related cases. The consolidation might be indicated by \"Re: 25-cv-03244-JSW\" etc. But maybe the other documents contain info.\n\nWe should search for \"4:25-cv-03244-JSW\" etc. We can search for \"32-JSW\" pattern. But we can just search for \"4:25-cv-03244-JSW\" etc. But easier: search for \"4:25-cv-03244-JSW\" pattern. But maybe the case numbers are in the docket but not in other docs.\n\nBetter approach: search all documents for \"4:25-cv-\" pattern. But maybe not needed. The key is consolidated cases. The docket has \"NOTICE OF QUESTIONS RE Motions for Temporary Restraining Orders (10 in 4:25-cv-03244-JSW), (7 in 4:25-cv-03292-JSW), and (9 in 4:25-cv-03140-JSW).\" That indicates the case is part of multiple docket numbers. That is consolidation.\n\nTherefore we can extract that as a consolidated case: the case is consolidated with 4:25-cv-03244-JSW, 4:25-cv-03292-JSW, 4:25-cv-03140-JSW. Provide evidence. Also maybe the \"Notice of Motion/Stipulation Filed in MDL Master Case\" indicates MDL Master Case. That might be considered consolidation. So we could add that too.\n\nWe need to read the relevant portion of the docket to capture evidence. We already have the docket snippet: tokens 2956-3156 etc. We need to provide evidence snippet containing the consolidated case info. The snippet includes the docket numbers. But we need to provide the full text? At least the snippet. The snippet in the search result shows the line with \"NOTICE OF QUESTIONS RE Motions for Temporary Restraining Orders (10 in 4:25-cv-03244-JSW), (7 in 4:25-cv-03292-JSW), and (9 in 4:25-cv-03140-JSW).\"\n\nWe also saw \"Notice of Motion/Stipulation Filed in MDL Master Case\" at line 28. That includes no docket number but indicates MDL Master Case. That might be considered consolidated.\n\nThus we can append two entries.\n\nBut we must check if the Docket is fully visited. It is fully visited. So we have evidence from Docket. We need to provide evidence entries with text, source_document (\"Docket\") and location (maybe token range? But we can provide page or just content snippet. The location can be \"line 29\" or \"token 3156\" etc.\n\nLet's provide evidence for each entry.\n\nEntry 1: Consolidated with 4:25-cv-03244-JSW, 4:25-cv-03292-JSW, 4:25-cv-03140-JSW.\n\nEvidence: the text snippet: \"NOTICE OF QUESTIONS RE Motions for Temporary Restraining Orders (10 in 4:25-cv-03244-JSW), (7 in 4:25-cv-03292-JSW), and (9 in 4:25-cv-03140-JSW).

That might be acceptable.\n\nEntry 2: Consolidated with MDL Master Case. Evidence: The text snippet: \"Notice of Motion/Stipulation Filed in MDL Master Case by Zhuoer Chen, ...\".\n\nBut we need more identifying info. The MDL Master Case likely has a docket number, but not present. But we can still note \"MDL Master Case\". Provide evidence snippet: \"Notice of Motion/Stipulation Filed in MDL Master Case by Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, Gexi Guo re 7 Emergency MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order (amended pursuant to ECF No. 27)\". That indicates consolidation.\n\nThus we have two entries.\n\nWe must call append_checklist with patch for Consolidated_Cases_Noted with two extracted entries.\n\nWe must ensure evidence format. Let's craft the JSON.\n\nWe need to provide evidence array inside each extracted value.\n\nLet's produce evidence for each:\n\nEntry 1 evidence:\n- text: \"NOTICE OF QUESTIONS RE Motions for Temporary Restraining Orders (10 in 4:25-cv-03244-JSW), (7 in 4:25-cv-03292-JSW), and (9 in 4:25-cv-03140-JSW).

We need to ensure that all documents are searched for any other consolidated cases. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" We extracted from Docket. But there might be other documents containing \"consolidated\" or \"MDL\" or other references. We did searches for \"consolidated\" and \"MDL Master Case\" and found matches only in Docket. However we might need to search other documents for \"consolidated\" again, maybe within other documents. We have not searched other documents for \"consolidated\" after reading Docket. But we did search across all documents for \"consolidated\" and got 0 matches. That includes all documents. So there are no other matches. Are there any other connotations like \"MDL\" not found in others? We did search for \"MDL\" and found matches in Docket. So likely no other consolidated references.\n\nBut we should consider that the extracted values might not be complete: maybe there are more MDL references within other documents, but search didn't find due to pattern maybe missing? But we used regex pattern \"consolidated\" and \"MDL Master Case\" and \"MDL\". But maybe \"MDL\" appears in other documents but search didn't find because maybe the pattern didn't match due to case. We used default flags? The search_document_regex didn't specify flags, so default is no ignorecase. The pattern \"MDL\" is uppercase, but maybe the text uses \"mdl\" or \"Mdl\". Could be lowercase. We didn't add IGNORECASE. So we might miss. Similarly \"consolidated\" might have uppercase or capital \"Consolidated\". We used pattern \"consolidated\". That could miss \"Consolidated\" with capital C. So we might need to re-run with IGNORECASE.\n\nThus we should run search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"(?i)consolidated\" or \"Consolidated\" to catch case variations. Also maybe \"MDL\" pattern should be case-insensitive. So we run search_document_regex with pattern \"(?i)MDL\" or \"MDL\" with IGNORECASE.\n\nWe also might need to search for \"consolidated\" in other documents but maybe not catch due to token range? But search all documents.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"(?i)consolidated\" or maybe two separate calls: one for consolidated, one for MDL with IGNORECASE. But we can combine? The function signature allows only one pattern per call. We could do second call.\n\nWe should also consider the possibility that we might have missed other consolidated cases in other documents because we only searched for \"consolidated\" and \"MDL Master Case\" but not \"MDL\" alone. But we did earlier search for \"MDL\" and found 3 matches all in Docket. But again, maybe case mismatch.\n\nThus we should perform search_document_regex with IGNORECASE for \"consolidated\". That will detect any \"Consolidated\" or \"consolidated\" or \"Consolidated\" etc.\n\nAlso we need to confirm if we need to extract any values from other documents. The requirement is to extract every distinct value in any document. So we need to confirm no other references. So we should search all documents again for \"consolidated\" with IGNORECASE. Then maybe also for \"MDL\" with IGNORECASE.\n\nWe'll perform search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"(?i)consolidated\" with flags [\"IGNORECASE\", \"DOTALL\"] maybe to catch across line boundaries. We can use context_tokens 200. Then if we find matches, we need to read those windows and extract values.\n\nBut we might get matches in Docket again. But we already extracted from Docket. But we may need to verify that we have captured all distinct values. The Docket had two consolidated values: one referencing 3 separate case numbers 4:25-cv-03244-JSW, etc. The other referencing \"Consolidated in MDL Master Case\". That might be another distinct value; we have that.\n\nBut maybe there are other consolidated references like \"consolidated with 4:25-cv-03244-JSW\" etc. But we might have captured all from Docket. But we need to ensure we didn't miss any other references in other documents.\n\nThus next step: search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"(?i)consolidated\" with flags IGNORECASE. That will catch all matches.\n\nThen read any matches not in Docket? Or maybe re-read Docket to confirm. But we already extracted. For completeness, maybe update or re-append if duplicates? But we should not duplicate same value. We need to ensure that we don't re-add duplicates.\n\nWe should check get_checklist for Consolidated_Cases_Noted to see current extracted values. But we know we have two. But we need to confirm duplicates.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for consolidated with IGNORECASE.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)consolidated\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\",\"DOTALL\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)consolidated", "flags": ["IGNORECASE", "DOTALL"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4451, "completion_tokens": 1124, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to check if other documents contain consolidated case indications. We have not searched other documents yet. We should search remaining unvisited documents for \"consolidated\" and MDL etc. Since we didn't find any in Docket beyond those two, but maybe others include \"consolidated\" or \"MDL\" references. The requirement: extract all distinct values of Consolidated_Cases_Noted across any document. So need to search all remaining documents for \"consolidated\" or \"MDL\". We did earlier search for pattern \"consolidated\" across all documents and found 0 after Step 10. But maybe the pattern not capturing variations like \"Consolidated\" with capital C or \"Consolidated with\"? We used regex \"consolidated\" case-insensitive in step 10 and got 0. That suggests no \"consolidated\" occurrences in the remaining 7 documents. But maybe the phrase \"consolidated with\" is part of docket entry? Already found. But others might mention \"consolidated\" but we didn't search all documents? Step 10 used pattern \"(?i)consolidated\" on all documents. That should find case-insensitive matches. It returned 0. So likely no other consolidated references. But we must be certain: maybe the phrase \"MDL Master Case\" indicates consolidation. We searched for \"MDL\" earlier and found 3 matches all in Docket. We searched for \"MDL Master Case\" and got 2 matches all in Docket. So other documents likely don't have MDL references. Could there be \"consolidated\" with different capitalization or with line breaks? Our regex should find any instance of \"consolidated\" regardless of case. So no matches.\n\nThus we have captured all consolidated case values. We must confirm if any other documents mention \"consolidated\" or \"MDL\" that might have been missed due to token range boundaries? We read Docket entire. For other documents, we didn't read any tokens. But search_document_regex searched all documents. That should scan entire text. So no further matches.\n\nThus all keys are complete. We have one key with two values. We need to ensure no duplicate values. We have \"Consolidated with 4:25-cv-03244-JSW, 4:25-cv-03292-JSW, 4:25-cv-03140-JSW\" and \"Consolidated in MDL Master Case\". These are distinct. Are there any other values? Might be \"Consolidated with 4:25-cv-03244-JSW\" separate? But the first value is a single combined string listing all three. That matches the requirement: distinct values found. So we are done.\n\nWe should decide to stop. But before stopping, we might want to confirm that the checklist key is fully extracted. We could call get_checklist to confirm. But it's optional. The instructions say we can stop when all keys are either complete or Not Applicable. We have one key with two values. We have no Not Applicable.\n\nThus we should return stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All Consolidated_Cases_Noted values have been extracted from the corpus, and no further documents contain additional consolidation references.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All Consolidated_Cases_Noted values have been extracted from the corpus, and no further documents contain additional consolidation references.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4480, "completion_tokens": 694, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The checklist says 1/1 filled. But we need to verify that no other documents contain consolidations. We did search regex for \"consolidated\" and \"MDL\" etc. But maybe other documents mention consolidation like \"consolidated with\" or \"consolidated case\" etc. We need to be sure no other documents have such references. We have 7 unvisited documents. We should search for \"consolidated\" again across all documents. Step 10 did that and found 0. But maybe the regex didn't catch due to different wording like \"Consolidated in MDL\" or \"consolidated case\". The pattern \"(?i)consolidated\" was used, which should catch any \"consolidated\". But maybe the text uses \"consolidated with\" or \"consolidated\". That would still match. The search didn't find any. So likely no other consolidation references. But to be safe, maybe we should search for \"MDL\" again? Step 7 found 3 matches in Docket. But maybe other documents have MDL references. Let's search for \"MDL\" again across all documents. But step 8 found matches only in Docket. Step 7 also. So likely none.\n\nAdditionally, we need to confirm that the Consolidated_Cases_Noted values we extracted are complete. We have two values: \"Consolidated with 4:25-cv-03244-JSW, 4:25-cv-03292-JSW, 4:25-cv-03140-JSW\" and \"Consolidated in MDL Master Case\". Are there any other consolidation references? The first value is from a NOTICE OF QUESTIONS for motions; the second is from a notice of motion referencing MDL. There might also be a \"consolidated with\" elsewhere in the docket. But step 10 search for consolidated didn't find any. So maybe these two are the only ones.\n\nLet's double-check that the first value is correct: It says \"NOTICE OF QUESTIONS RE Motions for Temporary Restraining Orders (10 in 4:25-cv-03244-JSW), (7 in 4:25-cv-03292-JSW), and (9 in 4:25-cv-03140-JSW).\" That indicates consolidation. The second value: \"Notice of Motion/Stipulation Filed in MDL Master Case by Zhuoer Chen, Mengcheng Yu, Jiarong Ouyang, Gexi Guo re 7 Emergency MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order (amended pursuant to ECF No. 27).\" That indicates MDL.\n\nWe might want to mark that this is not a consolidation with other cases per se, but \"MDL Master Case\" indicates a master case with multiple parties; but still qualifies as consolidation.\n\nWe need to ensure that we have the full list of distinct values. Possibly there is a third value referencing \"Consolidated Master Case\" but maybe not.\n\nDo we need to update? We already appended the two values. But the checklist status says 1/1 filled. However, maybe we need to double-check that the values are correct, and no other consolidation references exist. If none, we can stop. But the system says we attempted stop previously and it auto-retrieved get_checklist. That shows 1/1 filled. But we might need to confirm that the two values are indeed the ones extracted. The step 9 shows two values appended. So we have 2 values. The checklist status shows 1/1 filled, 0 empty. So perhaps the system counts that we have at least one value, and it's considered filled. But we should ensure the values are final.\n\nThus we can safely stop.\n\nBut the system says \"stop attempt 1/2\". Maybe we need to do a final check. But step 11 said we stopped. Step 12 got status. Then step 13 says we are at \"stop attempt 1/2\". We need to determine if we should stop or do more. The rule says we can stop if all keys are complete or Not Applicable. We have only one key. It is filled. So we can stop. There's no need to update or append. So we should call stop.\n\nWe need to output JSON {decision: \"stop\", reason: \"...\"}.\n\nLet's provide a brief justification: All Consolidated_Cases_Noted values extracted, no further matches. So stop.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All Consolidated_Cases_Noted values extracted and no further consolidation references found in any document.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All Consolidated_Cases_Noted values extracted and no further consolidation references found in any document.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3989, "completion_tokens": 964, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
