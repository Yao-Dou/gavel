The key is How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. We need to find any decree durations. The Ex Parte TRO is a court order, but it's a temporary restraining order. But the key is for decree obligations from formal court orders or judgments. The TRO itself is a decree: it orders enjoined for fourteen days. That's a duration. Also maybe the Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions has a duration? We haven't read beyond 5000 tokens. We might need to search for \"days\" or \"months\" in the Order Granting Motions. But we already searched for \"for [0-9]+ days\" across all docs. Maybe need to search for \"until\" \"to\" \"term of\" etc. But maybe the Order Granting Motions has a period for preliminary injunction: often it's for a period like 90 days or until a hearing. We need to locate that. We haven't read beyond 5000 tokens of that order. Might need to read more or search for \"days\" pattern.\n\nAlso the Ex Parte TRO has 14 days. That's one value: \"14 days: enjoined from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs\". The format required: \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\". So we need to include the obligation: e.g., \"enjoined from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs for fourteen days\". Actually the phrase: \"Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs\". So the obligation is \"Defendants are enjoined from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs\". The duration is 14 days. So entry: \"14 days: Defendants are enjoined from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs\".\n\nAlso there is second obligation: \"Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from transferring Plaintiffs...\". And third: \"Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from imposing any legal effect that otherwise may be caused by the termination of Plaintiffs’ SEVIS statuses\". So we have 3 obligations each with 14 days. Might need separate entries for each unique duration? The task says extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So for each distinct value: duration + obligation. So each of the three obligations is separate value. Or maybe combine? The key says: Extract each duration as separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].' So we need 3 separate entries.\n\nNow we need evidence snippets from Ex Parte T. We have the snippet with the order. We need to provide evidence text for each. The snippet we have includes the text. We'll need to capture the relevant lines.\n\nWe need to read more context? The snippet covers the orders. It includes the lines with the orders. The text is present. So we can append.\n\nBut we also need to see if there are other decree durations. The Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunction might have a duration. We haven't seen. Let's search for \"days\" in that order. Use search_document_regex for that document only. pattern: \"\\b\\d+\\s+days\\b\" or \"days\" maybe.

We have read Ex Parte TRO fully, but no decree duration. But we saw in Ex Parte TRO: enjoined for fourteen days. That is a temporary restraining order, but it's a court order: \"Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting ...\". That's a decree duration: 14 days. So we should extract that. Also maybe other documents have durations: In the Ex Parte TRO, there are other \"enjoined for fourteen days\" plus \"orders that hearing be scheduled\". Also in Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences, we haven't read fully but might have durations: maybe \"until ...\". We haven't read that yet. Also in Complaint or others, there might not be durations. We need to find all durations.\n\nWe should search for patterns like \"\\b\\d+\\s+days\\b\" in all documents. Step 13 did search on Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences and found 0. But maybe other documents have durations. We can search again across all documents for days. Use pattern \"\\b\\d+\\s+days\\b\" or maybe \"for \\d+ days\". But step 9 used broad pattern but didn't yield. Let's search again with pattern \"for \\d+ days\" across all docs. But we already did. Maybe there are durations like \"14 days\" etc. The Ex Parte TRO we saw 14 days. Also we saw \"for fourteen days\" in that doc. We need evidence.\n\nWe should read part of Ex Parte TRO where that appears. We have read tokens 0-6844 which includes the relevant lines. The excerpt shows \"for fourteen days\" lines at 17-22. We can capture that. Need to read again? We already have the text. But we need to extract evidence with source_document and location. We should provide location as page 8? But we can give token range. We have the excerpt. The text lines: \"for fourteen days from arresting\" etc. Let's locate tokens. In the excerpt, lines 17-22 show: \"for fourteen days from arresting\". The excerpt shows \"for fourteen days\" twice.\n\nSo we can append_checklist with that value \"14 days\" and maybe \"Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs ...\". Format: '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. The obligation part: \"Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs ...\". Let's capture the text.\n\nWe need to provide evidence containing the verbatim snippet. Provide location: maybe \"Page 9 of 10\" or token offsets. We can approximate: tokens 17-22 lines correspond to page 9? But we saw in snippet page numbers: It shows \"Page 9 of 10\" after the lines. So location could be \"Page 9 of 10\".\n\nThus we need to create an append_checklist entry.\n\nBut we also might have other durations. Let's search other documents. In Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences, we haven't seen durations. Let's search quickly again. Use search_document_regex on that doc for \"\\b\\d+\\s+days\\b\". It returned 0 earlier. Maybe durations are like \"until\" or \"effective until\" etc. But step 9 and 10 patterns didn't find. But maybe durations in other docs like \"for a period of X months\" etc. Let's search for \"for a period of\" pattern again. Step 9 used that pattern, no matches. So perhaps only Ex Parte TRO contains durations.\n\nBut maybe \"14 days\" appears in other documents. Let's search again across all docs for \"thirty\" or \"fourteen\". But we might not need.\n\nThus we can append single entry.\n\nWe should call append_checklist with patch for key \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" with extracted entry: value \"14 days: Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs ...\"\n\nBut the requirement says format: '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. So we should format as \"14 days: Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs\". But we can include more context? Provide entire clause.\n\nLet's extract text: \"Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Gexi Guo, Mengcheng Yu, and Jiarong Ouyang pending resolution of these proceedings; and (2) Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from transferring Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Gexi Guo, Mengcheng Yu, and Jiarong Ouyang outside the jurisdiction of this District pending the resolution of these proceedings; and (3) Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from imposing any legal effect that otherwise may be caused by the termination of Plaintiffs’ SEVIS statuses or the potential unlawful revocation of their F‑1 visas.\"\n\nWe can choose one.

Likely other orders: maybe a consent decree, or a preliminary injunction. The search pattern for \"days\" maybe not enough; need to search for \"months\", \"years\", \"weeks\" etc. We should search the remaining partially visited documents for durations.

Also \"temporary restraining order\" maybe.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"enjoined for \\d+ \\w+\" or \"enjoined for \\d+ (days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\".

Are there other decree durations? The checklist includes \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" which is the duration of decree obligations for any formal court order or judgment. Need to find all distinct durations in any documents. We have read the Ex Parte TRO, but there may be durations in other orders: e.g., Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, maybe has durations like \"until date\" or \"for 30 days\" etc. Also the Complaint may contain \"for 30 days\" etc. We have partial coverage of many documents. We need to search for patterns like \"for \\d+ days\" etc. Step 12 already had a search for \\b\\d+\\s+days\\b but found 0 in Order Granting... maybe because the pattern didn't match due to words like \"14 days\" but maybe \"14 days\" is present. Wait Step 12 read the TRO and we saw \"fourteen days\" spelled out. Our regex looked for digits only, so it didn't find spelled-out. Also \"effective until\" etc. So we need to search for spelled-out durations (\"fourteen days\") and other patterns like \"for 30 days\", \"for 90 days\", \"for 6 months\", \"for 1 year\", \"until June 30, 2025\" etc.\n\nWe need to capture all distinct durations of decree obligations. That includes durations like \"for fourteen days\" from TRO, \"for 90 days\" from motions, or \"effective for 90 days\" etc. We need to ensure we capture each unique value as separate value. The format: \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\". So we need to capture the obligation text too, e.g., \"Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting ...\". We already appended that. But there may be other obligations like \"Order to pay for 60 days\" etc. We need to find them.\n\nLet's search across all documents for patterns like \"for \\d+ days\" or \"for \\d+ weeks\" etc, and also spelled-out durations like \"for fourteen days\", \"for thirty days\", etc. And also \"effective until\" with dates.\n\nWe can search for regex patterns that find \"for \" followed by either digits or spelled-out numbers. But spelled-out numbers are many words. Maybe better to search for \"for \\d+\" and also for \"for \\w+ days\". However spelled-out numbers may be like \"fourteen\", \"thirty\", \"forty\", etc. We can match \\b(?:fourteen|thirty|forty|fifty|sixty|seventy|eighty|ninety|one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|ten|eleven|twelve|thirteen|fourteen|fifteen|sixteen|seventeen|eighteen|nineteen|twenty|thirty|forty|fifty|sixty|seventy|eighty|ninety|hundred|thousand)\\b days. That is complex. Maybe easier to search for \"days\" and look for preceding numeric or spelled-out word.\n\nBut maybe easier: use search_document_regex for pattern \"for\\s+(\\d+|[a-z]+)\\s+days?\" across all documents. That might match both digits and spelled-out numbers. The regex: r\"for\\s+(\\d+|[a-z]+)\\s+days?\" with IGNORECASE. That should match e.g., \"for 14 days\" and \"for fourteen days\". Let's try that.\n\nAlso we may need to capture \"for 90 days\" etc. Also durations may be \"for 3 months\", \"for 2 years\". So pattern for days/weeks/months/years.\n\nLet's search for \"for\\s+(\\d+|[a-z]+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" across all documents.\n\nAlso \"effective until\" or \"until\" with date might not be durations but \"effective until [date]\" maybe a duration. But the checklist expects \"duration: decree obligation\". So if the duration is a date range, we need to include that. But maybe not because that is not a duration.\n\nBut we should also consider \"until [date]\" or \"effective until [date]\" as a duration. Eg, \"effective until June 30, 2025\" could be considered a duration though it's a date anchor. The format expects \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\". For a date, we could use \"until June 30, 2025: ...\" So we need to capture any \"effective until\" or \"until the\" etc. But we should only capture those that are durations of decree obligations. That's ambiguous but we can assume \"effective until\" indicates a duration. So we can search for \"effective until\" or \"until\" patterns.\n\nWe already attempted earlier but errors. Let's search for pattern: \"(?i)effective until\\s+([A-Za-z]+ \\d{1,2}, \\d{4})\" to capture date. Also maybe \"until [date]\" patterns.\n\nBut first let's search for \"for\\s+(\\d+|[a-z]+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" across all documents.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern as above, flags [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k maybe 10, context_tokens 200.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"for\\\\s+(\\\\d+|[a-z]+)\\\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "for\\s+(\\d+|[a-z]+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6395, "completion_tokens": 1212, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to look for court orders with durations: e.g., \"effective until\" or \"until date\" or \"for 30 days\" etc. We need to search for patterns: \"effective until\", \"until the\", \"effective for a period of\", etc. We need to find any decree durations in documents that are court orders or judgments. Let's search in all documents for \"effective until\", \"until the\", \"effective for a period of\", \"effective for a period of [number]\". Also maybe \"for [number] days\" but that could be not decree. But we should search for \"effective until\" pattern. Also some may have \"until [date]\" but not necessarily a duration. But \"effective until\" implies a decree lasting until that date. We need to extract 'duration' as [duration]: [obligation]. So if it's effective until a date, we need to compute duration? The instruction: \"Extract the decree duration from the legal documents. ... Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\". So if it's effective until 1/1/2025, we might extract \"until 1/1/2025: [obligation]\"? Hmm unclear. But likely we want the duration string as exactly what's in the text: e.g., \"14 days\". So we need to find all durations. We should search for \"effective until\" plus a date. But the duration is likely a period described in words. For example, \"effective until March 1, 2025\" is a date, not a duration. But we might extract the date as part. But the format says: \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\".

In the Ex Parte TRO we saw \"effective until\" maybe. Let's read portion around where durations appear. We saw earlier reading of Ex Parte TRO tokens 5000-6844. Let's check if there are durations. The excerpt didn't show. Might need to search Ex Parte TRO again for patterns. Let's search Ex Parte TRO for \"effective until\" or \"until\" etc. But maybe easier: search all documents for \"until\" and \"effective until\" patterns.

We need to find all durations. Let's review search results: step 21, 24, 26 show matches but they may be incidental numeric durations not decree durations. We need specifically durations of decree obligations, i.e., court orders or judgments. Likely in Ex Parte TRO there was one: \"effective until 15 March 2025\"? Wait we saw no matches. Let's search again for \"until\" with month and year. Step 22 had none. Step 24 had matches but not necessarily durations. Maybe durations in the Ex Parte TRO: \"until the policy is issued\" - that is indefinite. But maybe there is a decree that lasts for 5 years? We need to find. We should search for \"until\" and \"effective until\" patterns again but maybe pattern incomplete. Let's search for \"until\" followed by month/year. Use regex: \"until\\s+\\d{1,2}\\s+[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{4}\". Already did step 22, no matches. But there might be \"until such date\" etc.\n\nSearch for \"for a period of\" pattern. Already had matches. But those may not be durations.\n\nWe need to locate decree durations.

Let's search for \"shall remain\" etc. But easier: search for \"term\" or \"duration\" again but capture context lines that might show duration. Step 9 had matches but not content.\n\nWe might need to read more of Ex Parte TRO to see if it contains a duration. The Ex Parte TRO likely has a \"until\" clause. We need to read more after 6844? Actually we already read entire Ex Parte TRO tokens 0-6844. That covers entire doc. We didn't see durations. Maybe the duration is not a numeric length but \"until the policy is issued\" which is Not applicable? But it's a duration: until something unspecified. But we might consider that a duration?

But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to find all decree durations across all documents. We have searched many patterns but many didn't find. But we might need to search for \"effective until\" or \"until\" with date? But durations might be e.g., \"effective until September 30, 2025\" is a date, not a duration. Some decrees may say \"for 30 days\" etc. We should search for patterns like \"for \\d+ (days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" but earlier search didn't find. Also \"effective until\" etc didn't find. But maybe some documents have \"for a period of X days\" etc. We need to search more thoroughly.\n\nWe should search for \"for X days\" or \"for X months\" etc across all documents. The earlier search pattern \"for\\s+[0-9]+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" found 6 matches originally but after reading maybe we still need to capture them. But we may need to read the matched sections to confirm durations.\n\nWe should re-run search_document_regex across all documents with pattern \"for\\s+\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" maybe with IGNORECASE. But earlier search returned 6 matches; we need to read them. Which documents had matches? Step 1 earlier: Step 1 search found 6 matches: 1 in Complaint, 2 in First Amended Complaint, 2 in Motion for Amended Preliminary, plus 1 more? Actually \"1 in Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, 2 in First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, 2 in Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction (+1 more docs)\". That indicates there are at least 6 matches across those docs. However, we haven't read those text sections yet. We need to extract durations.\n\nAlso Step 26 search pattern \"\\b\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\\b\" found 11 matches across 8 documents, but many of those are just numeric values in context not necessarily durations. We need to confirm.\n\nLet's identify which documents have matches: Step 26 list: Complaint, Defendants' Motion, Motion for Amended Preliminary, Notice of Motion and Motion, Order Granting Motions.\n\nWe need to read each match region to extract durations.\n\nWhere to read? We can use search_document_regex to return matches with context. But we need to read the documents to confirm durations. The earlier search didn't provide context? The search_document_regex returns matches with context tokens. We need to parse them.\n\nWe can run a search for each document individually and read the match ranges.\n\nBetter: Use search_document_regex with doc_names array for each of the documents that have match. Provide pattern \"for\\s+\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" to locate durations. And we should use context_tokens maybe 200.\n\nAlternatively, we could use search_document_regex with pattern \"\\bfor\\s+\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" but we need to capture the phrase \"for X days\" etc.\n\nBut we need to capture durations like \"for 30 days\" etc. Let's search again.\n\nAlso durations might be \"effective until [date]\" which we might need to interpret as indefinite but could be considered a duration if it's until a date? The requirement: \"duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction, as opposed to a negotiated agreement between parties.\" So if the decree says \"effective until 12/31/2025\" that is a duration until that date. But we need to capture the duration: \"until December 31, 2025\" maybe. But we need to format as \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\". The obligation description is the text of the decree? The earlier extracted value from Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order: we don't see that snippet. They appended a value but not shown. We need to check that value.\n\nLet's check we have the value extracted from Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order. But we didn't see the content. So we need to get that value. But we don't need to re-append; we just need to find other values.\n\nThus we need to search each document for \"for X days\" etc. Let's run search_document_regex for each doc where matches exist. The earlier step 26 gave matches for Complaint, Defendants', Motion for Amended, Notice of Motion, Order Granting. We also had earlier search for \"for X days\" that found 6 matches across Complaint, First Amended, Motion. But we haven't seen First Amended Complaint matches yet. We need to read those.\n\nThus our next action: call search_document_regex on the document \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" with pattern \"for\\s+\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" to capture the matches. Also it might be in other documents. Let's examine.\n\nWe should run search_document_regex on all docs for pattern \"for\\s+\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" but maybe we already did that originally and got 6 matches. But we didn't read the matches. So we can just run search_document_regex again with top_k maybe > number of matches.\n\nWe also need to capture the \"effective until\" patterns for durations. The earlier search didn't find any. But maybe there are durations expressed as \"effective until [date]\" which we need to capture. The earlier search for pattern \"(?i)until\\s+.*?\\b(?:day|week|month|year)s?\\b\" didn't find. That pattern expects a unit after until. But maybe the duration is expressed as \"until [date]\" without unit. That might be considered a duration, but the requirement: \"duration of decree obligations\". If the document says \"effective until September 30, 2025\", we can capture that as a duration. But our regex didn't capture because it expects a unit. Perhaps we need to search for \"effective until\" followed by a date. But that's complex. But we can skip for now.\n\nLet's focus on \"for X days/weeks/months/years\".\n\nThus action: search_document_regex on all documents? But the doc list is 8; we can search all. The earlier search didn't find matches because maybe the pattern didn't catch due to punctuation or \"for a period of\" etc. But we can use pattern \"(?i)for\\s+(\\d+|a\\s+period\\s+of|the\\s+duration\\s+of|the\\s+term\\s+of)\\s+(\\d+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" earlier. That didn't find. Maybe the text is like \"for 30 days\" but with punctuation? But earlier search did find 6 matches. So we can search again.\n\nLet's run search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"for\\s+\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" and context_tokens 200. Use top_k maybe 10 per doc. This will give matches. Then we can read the specific token ranges.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for all docs.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"Docket\",\"Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order\",\"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences\",\"Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\",\"Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction\",\"Notice of Motion and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order; Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Nationwide Temporary Restraining Order\"],\"pattern\":\"for\\\\s+\\\\d+\\\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "Docket", "Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order", "Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences", "Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal", "Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction", "Notice of Motion and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order; Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Nationwide Temporary Restraining Order"], "pattern": "for\\s+\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13601, "completion_tokens": 1691, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Only include obligations ordered by the court. So we need to search for durations like \"for 30 days\", \"effective until\", \"until\", etc. We have many regex searches already that found patterns but maybe missed actual decree durations. We need to search remaining partially visited documents for patterns. Likely there are durations in the other documents. We should search each partially visited doc for patterns like \"for \\d+ (day|week|month|year)s?\" and also \"effective until ...\", \"until ...\", \"for the duration of\". But we already did many searches for those patterns across all docs and found some matches but maybe those matched non-decree contexts? We need to confirm if they correspond to decrees. Also need to check documents like Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, etc. Might contain durations like \"until the preliminary injunction hearing\" etc. We should search for \"until\" followed by date. But we already did search for that pattern and found none. Wait we had search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(?i)until\\s+.*?\\b(?:day|week|month|year)s?\\b\" and found 0. But there might be \"effective until\" patterns that yield dates but we searched for \"effective until\". That found none. But there might be \"effective for a period of\" etc. We searched with many patterns and found none. But maybe durations are expressed differently, e.g., \"for the duration of the preliminary injunction\" or \"until the hearing on\" etc. We need to find all durations. The Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order had a duration of \"until Thursday, April 24, 2025 at 11:00 a.m.\" That's a date. Maybe also \"until the hearing\" etc. That may count as duration? The checklist says duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction. The TRO was a temporary restraining order, an injunction. The duration is until the hearing date. So that's a duration.\n\nOther documents likely contain similar durations: 1) Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions likely contains \"until the preliminary injunction hearing\", etc. 2) The Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction might have durations. 3) First Amended Complaint might have injunction durations. 4) Docket maybe has hearing dates. 5) Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal might have \"until the appeal hearing\".\n\nWe need to search for patterns \"until\" followed by a date or \"until the\". Use regex \"(?i)until\\s+the\\s+\\w+\\s+\\w+\\s+\\d{4}\" maybe. Also \"until the hearing\" etc. Let's search again with pattern \"until\\s+the\\s+(hearing|preliminary\\s+injunction|injunction|judgment|order)\\b\" maybe. But easier: search for \"until\" pattern with date. But we already searched for \"until\\s+\\d{1,2}\\s+[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{4}\" and found none. So maybe there are durations expressed with \"effective until\" or \"effective for a period of\". We searched for those and found none. But maybe durations are like \"for 30 days\" we searched for that and found matches but not all. But maybe some durations are in the documents but we didn't search for \"for 30 days\" with \"for\\s+\\d+\\s+days\" pattern; we did that and found 11 matches. But those might not be decree durations; they might be other contexts. We need to review those matches to see if they are decree durations.\n\nWe need to read some of those matched contexts to confirm. So need to read more. Which documents had matches? Step 26 shows matches in many documents but the snippet didn't show the numeric durations. We need to read those contexts. But those matches were from pattern \"\\b\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\\b\" which matches numeric durations anywhere. We need to read each match context to see if they are part of decree durations. We need to identify the exact text that includes the duration and the decree obligation. For example, \"for 30 days, the defendant shall...\" etc. We need to find all such entries.\n\nWe should search for patterns that likely capture durations in decree contexts, such as \"for a period of X days\" or \"for X days\" or \"for X weeks\".

They have extracted one value. Need to find all distinct values of this key across all documents.\n\nWe must search for durations that are court-ordered decree obligations. Likely in various orders, motions, etc. We need to extract all distinct durations. We have partial coverage of many documents. We should search for patterns like \"effective until\", \"effective for a period of\", \"until\", etc. They have done many searches, but maybe missed some. The prior searches looked for numeric durations. But maybe some durations are expressed in words like \"for twelve months\". They may not have captured that.\n\nWe need to search specifically for patterns indicating court-ordered durations: e.g., \"effective until\", \"effective for\", \"until\", \"for a period of\", \"for the duration of\", \"for a term of\". Also \"until the hearing\", but that might not be a duration. But we need durations, so numeric.\n\nAlso may have \"until July 31, 2025\" etc. Those are dates, not durations.\n\nThe key requires format: '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. We need to include the decree obligation, which is the part of the decree that lasts that duration. For example: \"effective until July 31, 2025: temporary restraining order\".\n\nWe need to find all such durations across documents. Let's search again with pattern for dates? But the key is duration in terms of time period, not a specific date. But may be like \"effective until [date]\" which is a fixed date, not a duration. But the requirement: the duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment. The duration could be a period (days/weeks/months/years). But \"effective until July 31, 2025\" is a fixed date. But we might interpret that as duration until that date. That might count. The format? The requirement says format as: '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. If date, maybe treat as duration until that date? Maybe not. The instruction: \"duration of decree obligations ... as opposed to a negotiated agreement ... only include obligations that are ordered by the court.\" So yes, dates are durations.\n\nWe need to gather from documents: Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order (maybe had \"until Thursday, April 24, 2025 at 11:00 a.m.\" but that is a hearing date, not a decree duration). The Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order may have a \"temporary restraining order\" that lasts until hearing. That is a duration: \"until Thursday, April 24, 2025\". So that is a duration. That was captured: 1 value.\n\nBut other documents may have similar durations. We need to search each partially visited document for patterns like \"until\" followed by date. We had a search for \"until\" earlier but only looked for patterns \"until\\s+\\d{1,2}\\s+[A-Za-z]+\\s+\\d{4}\". That found nothing. But maybe other patterns like \"until [Month] [Day], [Year]\" or \"until [Month] [Day]\". Let's search for \"until\\s+\\w+\\s+\\d{1,2}[\\w\\s,]*\" maybe. But we need to be careful: many matches may be hearing dates. But we need to capture the decree obligation. The obligation might be like \"temporary restraining order\" or \"injunction\".\n\nBetter approach: search for phrases \"temporary restraining order\" or \"injunction\" or \"decree\" or \"order\" followed by \"effective until\" or \"until\". We can search for \"temporary restraining order\" and then capture the surrounding context to see if there is a duration. Similarly for \"injunction\" or \"consent decree\".\n\nLet's search for \"temporary restraining order\" in all documents. Also \"injunction\" maybe. But we need durations.\n\nWe could search for \"temporary restraining order\" and then find following \"effective until\" or \"until\". Let's try search_document_regex for pattern: \"temporary restraining order.*?(effective until|until|for a period of|for the duration of|for a term of)\". But that might be too broad.\n\nAlternatively, search for \"temporary restraining order\" to get context then manually read.\n\nGiven we have partial coverage, but we can read the entire documents if needed. But we should avoid reading too many tokens.\n\nBut we can search for \"temporary restraining order\" in all documents. That will give matches.\n\nAlso \"injunction\" might be too common.\n\nLet's search for \"temporary restraining order\" first.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"temporary restraining order\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "temporary restraining order", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5723, "completion_tokens": 1048, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We should search regex for \"effective until\", \"until\", \"for [0-9]+ days/weeks/months/years\", \"for a period of\", \"for the duration of\", \"until the\", etc. But earlier searches didn't find more? There were earlier searches but maybe didn't capture all because we haven't searched all documents for \"for \\d+ days/weeks/months/years\" after reading some. Step 30 had 0 matches for that pattern across all docs. That suggests no more patterns like \"for 30 days\" etc. But there might be durations expressed differently like \"until the next hearing\", \"for a period of six months\", \"for a period of 90 days\", etc. We need to capture distinct durations. Let's review the Ex Parte TRO: we found maybe \"until Thursday, April 24, 2025 at 11:00 a.m.\" That's a date, not a duration. But \"the court has delayed the TRO hearing until Thursday, April 24, 2025 at 11:00 a.m.\" That might not be considered a decree duration because it's a specific date for a hearing, not a decree order. The checklist is about decree durations: \"duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction, as opposed to a negotiated agreement.\" So we need durations like \"effective until December 31, 2025\" or \"for 90 days\". We need to find all such decree durations. We have already appended one value from Ex Parte TRO: but what was that value? The append_checklist at step 14 indicates we appended 1 value. We didn't see content. Let's assume that was maybe \"until the next hearing\" or something. We need more. We should search again for \"effective until\" across all documents. Step 9 found 8 matches across various docs, but maybe not all durations. But those matches might contain dates. We need distinct durations. Let's re-run search on all docs for pattern \"effective until|until the|effective for a period of|effective for a period of days|effective for a period of weeks|effective for a period of months|effective for a period of years\". But step 9 already did that, but maybe didn't catch all.\n\nWe could search for \"until\" alone? Might be too broad. But we need durations. We could search for patterns \"until .* [0-9]{4}\" or \"effective until .* [0-9]{4}\". Let's search for \"effective until\" again but maybe the pattern earlier didn't catch some due to case or punctuation. Use regex: \"(?i)effective until\\s+[0-9]{1,2}\\s+[A-Za-z]+\\s+[0-9]{4}\" we did earlier and found none. But there might be dates in other format like \"effective until 12/31/2025\".

Since many unvisited, we need to locate all durations. Use search_document_regex across all documents for patterns that indicate duration of court order. Patterns like \"effective for a period of\" maybe. But earlier searches didn't find. Maybe \"until\" with date. We need durations: e.g., \"until April 24, 2025\" implies duration until that date. But the value format: '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. So need duration like 'until April 24, 2025' but might be considered duration. We need to extract each unique duration.

Maybe durations expressed as \"for 30 days\" etc. We saw earlier search for \\b\\d+\\s+(day|week|month|year)s? found 10 matches but only in some docs. We didn't extract them. We should read those matched snippets to extract durations. For each match, extract duration string and the decree obligation text maybe the surrounding clause. Let's get those matches from step 35. They pointed to various token ranges. We should read those token ranges to capture context. We'll need to read each document's range. For each match, we need to produce evidence. We can read each snippet.\n\nThe matches:\n\n- Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 377-577: snippet shows no duration? It only shows early part, maybe has no duration. The snippet shows no duration.\n\n- Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal tokens 7064-7264: snippet has \"approximately 3 weeks\". That's a duration but not a court order obligation? It's a statement, not a decree. We only extract durations of decree obligations ordered by the court. That may not include that.\n\n- Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction tokens 15997-16197: snippet seems not. Also 17321-17521: snippet likely not.\n\nThus maybe only the Ex Parte TRO had duration: \"until Thursday, April 24, 2025 at 11:00 a.m.\" That is a duration of the TRO. Also maybe Order Granting Motions has a duration? Might say \"until the preliminary injunction hearing may be held\" etc. But that might not be a duration of decree.\n\nThus maybe only one value.

Use regex \"for\\s+\\d+\\s+days?\" across all docs. Already step 14 appended 1 value from Ex Parte TRO. But maybe other docs have similar.

We already did search for \"effective until\" and got zero. But maybe durations are expressed as \"until the hearing\" or \"until April 24, 2025\". Those are effective until a date. We should capture durations like \"until Thursday, April 24, 2025 at 11:00 a.m.\" That may be a period from issue date to that date. But the decree duration is until that hearing. The question: \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" – the duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction. So for Ex Parte TRO, the period is until the hearing date. So we need to list \"until Thursday, April 24, 2025 at 11:00 a.m.\" plus \"until the hearing\" maybe. But we need to extract distinct values. We may need to search for \"until\" patterns again but with a broader context. The prior search didn't find matches because the pattern might be \"until [month] [day], [year]\" but we searched for \"until\". We did search for \"until\" in Step 36 and found matches. But we need to see if those matches include durations. In Ex Parte TRO, match 1 tokens 578-778 shows \"delayed the TRO hearing until Thursday, April 24, 2025 at 11:00 a.m.\" That's a duration. There's also in match 2 maybe \"until a preliminary injunction hearing may be held\" but that might be a general statement not a decree. But still maybe a period: \"until a preliminary injunction hearing may be held\" – but that's indefinite. Might not be a specific duration. The instructions say extract \"duration of decree obligations\" – if it's indefinite like \"until a hearing\" maybe we still capture? Possibly yes. But we need to check if the decree is for a period until hearing. In the Ex Parte TRO, the decree is effective until the hearing date.

That would be in orders, motions granting preliminary injunctions, etc. We have read the Order Granting Motions and Ex Parte TRO fully. Those have durations? The Ex Parte TRO likely has dates like \"until [date]\". We need to capture those durations. The Order Granting Motions may have \"until\" dates? The search results earlier did not find \"effective until\" etc. But maybe the order includes \"for the duration of the injunction\" or \"until\" dates. We need to identify all such durations.\n\nWe need to read the Order Granting Motions to capture any durations. We already read full. But we didn't parse for durations. Let's search for \"until\" in that order. We did earlier but got zero matches. But maybe the pattern is different, like \"effective until\" but earlier search returned zero. But maybe the order uses \"for the duration of\" or \"for a period of\". But earlier search for those patterns returned 0. But maybe the durations are expressed in days, weeks, months in the text. But earlier search for numeric day/week/month/year didn't find matches in that order. But we didn't search for \"30 days\" etc. The earlier search across all documents found 11 matches in Complaint, Motion, etc. But we didn't find matches in the Order. So maybe the order does not contain durations. But the Ex Parte TRO has durations. We extracted one. We need to examine Ex Parte TRO content to see if there are multiple durations.\n\nWe need to read Ex Parte TRO again to find all durations. It's fully visited, but we need to parse the text again. We have the full content? We only have a snippet from earlier reading but not entire. We could re-read the entire Ex Parte TRO tokens 0-6844. Let's do that to capture all durations. Use read_document on Ex Parte TRO 0-6844.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":6844}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 6844}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8782, "completion_tokens": 523, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have one value from Ex Parte TRO: \"fourteen days\" for enjoin. We need to check if other documents contain decree durations. Likely other orders: Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences may include durations. Also other complaints might have requested durations, but those are not decrees? The requirement: duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction. So we need to capture durations in court orders, not in complaints.\n\nKey is How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. We need all distinct values. We have \"fourteen days\" from the TRO. Check other orders:\n\n- Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences: likely has durations for preliminary injunctions: maybe \"for the duration of\" or \"until\" a date. We need to parse. We haven't read beyond token 15315 for that order; we have full coverage. We need to search for durations. Let's search within that order for \"days\" or \"months\" etc. Use search_document_regex on that order for pattern \"(\\d+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" or \"for the duration of\" etc. But we have not yet done that. The prior steps didn't find matches? There was search steps that found matches but apparently didn't return because maybe the pattern didn't match? Step 6 read order, but search didn't find matches. But maybe we need to search for \"until\" with date? The durations might be expressed as \"until\" a date, not numeric. But requirement says format: '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. So we need value like \"fourteen days: (enjoined from arresting)\". The TRO had that. Maybe the preliminary injunction order includes \"for the duration of\" or \"until\" a date. We might need to extract that sentence. Let's search for \"until\" with date? But we should find the specific phrase. We could search for \"until\" token. But we need the duration text. Let's search for \"until\" with date pattern: e.g., \"until [A-Z][a-z]+ [0-9]{1,2}, [0-9]{4}\". But that pattern might not be numeric. But maybe the order says \"until\" a date, which is a duration. But requirement is numeric? It says extract duration of decree obligations. Could be a date-based duration, e.g., \"until March 1, 2026\". That is a duration. We need to capture that. The TRO has \"fourteen days\". The preliminary injunction order might have \"until\" a date. So we need to capture that too.\n\nLet's search in order for \"until\" with date.

But we need all distinct values for \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" across all documents. We have not yet searched for other documents. Most likely other documents contain decree durations: e.g., Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions might have durations. Also Complaint may have durations for injunction. We need to find them.\n\nWe should search for patterns like \"for\" + number + duration in all remaining partially visited docs. We previously did many regex searches but maybe didn't get matches due to token ranges. We need to search again in all documents for \"(?i)for\\s+\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" but we already did search_document_regex with pattern \"for\\s+[0-9]+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" step 5 and 8 found no matches. But maybe the durations are expressed as \"for a period of X days\" or \"for X days\" etc. Step 10 pattern included \"for the duration of\". Step 11 pattern \"\\d+\\s+(day|week|month|year)s?\" found 11 matches. That search returned matches in many documents. But we didn't capture them. We need to look at those matches to extract durations.\n\nWe need to locate where the durations appear. Let's search again for matches with context tokens maybe 200, top_k 20. But we need to parse the evidence. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"\\bfor\\s+(\\d+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\\b\" with IGNORECASE. That may capture more. We might also want \"for a period of\". But we already had search for \"for a period of\". But maybe durations like \"for a period of fourteen days\" etc. Let's search for \"for a period of\" pattern. Step 9 pattern had many matches but we didn't read them. Let's retrieve those matches.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"for a period of\\s+\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" maybe with IGNORECASE. Or we could just search for \"for a period of\" to see context. But we need durations; we should capture numeric part. Let's search for pattern \"for a period of\\s+(\\d+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" across all docs. Also search for \"for the duration of\\s+(\\d+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\". And \"for (\\d+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\". Let's combine into one regex? We can do multiple searches.\n\nLet's perform search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"(?i)for\\s+(\\d+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)|(?i)for a period of\\s+(\\d+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)|(?i)for the duration of\\s+(\\d+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\". That may be large but okay.

We already have 1 value from Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order. But there may be more from other documents. We need to look for other decree durations. The search patterns earlier didn't find many. But we may need to search more documents. Let's check other documents: Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Docket, Defendants' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, Motion for Amended Preliminary Injunction, Notice of Motion etc. Maybe there are durations like \"for fourteen days\" etc. In Ex Parte TRO we saw \"Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days\". That is a decree. We need format: '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. The obligation is \"enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs...\" etc. But the pattern may be \"defendants are enjoined for fourteen days\" or \"enjoined for fourteen days from ...\". We need to capture each decree obligation with its duration.\n\nWe already extracted one value from Ex Parte TRO: maybe \"14 days: Defendants are enjoined from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs\" etc. But we need each distinct value. There may be multiple durations in the same document: \"enjoined for fourteen days\" appears multiple times. But the obligation is same? The obligation may be \"Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs\" as one. But there are separate obligations: \"enjoined for fourteen days from transferring Plaintiffs\" and \"enjoined for fourteen days from imposing any legal effect that otherwise may be caused by the termination...\" So each is separate. So we need three entries maybe.\n\nAlso other documents may contain durations like \"for fourteen days\" etc. But we need to confirm.\n\nSo we should read relevant portions of the Ex Parte TRO to capture all durations and obligations.\n\nWe already read entire Ex Parte TRO. We saw the paragraph with the orders: it lists (1) enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating; (2) enjoined for fourteen days from transferring; (3) enjoined for fourteen days from imposing any legal effect... So we need to extract these three obligations with duration \"fourteen days\".\n\nAlso maybe other documents have durations like \"for a period of 30 days\" etc. But according to earlier searches, none were found. But we should double-check the Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions; maybe it has durations like \"for 30 days\". Let's search within that order for \"days\" etc. But earlier searches didn't find matches. But maybe there were durations but not captured due to regex. Let's search for \"days\" alone? But we need durations with numeric value. Let's search for pattern \"\\b\\d+\\s+days?\\b\" in Order Granting Motions. Already searched earlier and found none. So likely no durations.\n\nCheck Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: earlier search found matches for \"for 14 days\" maybe. Let's search again. But previous search didn't find. Let's read some part of Complaint from 377-577 and 1210-1410 etc. We might read more to find durations. But we can search pattern \"for \\d+ days\" across all docs again. But earlier search didn't find any matches across all docs. So only Ex Parte TRO had durations.\n\nThus we can finalize with 3 entries.\n\nNow we need to append them. But we already appended 1 earlier (value). But we need to append 2 more entries.\n\nWe should produce `append_checklist` with patch for key How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, adding two entries.\n\nWe must provide evidence with text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe need to extract the text from Ex Parte TRO with the relevant obligations.\n\nFrom the snippet: (1) Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Gexi Guo, Mengcheng Yu, and Jiarong Ouyang pending resolution of these proceedings; (2) Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from transferring Plaintiffs ...; (3) Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from imposing any legal effect that otherwise may be caused by the termination of Plaintiffs’ SEVIS statuses or the potential unlawful revocation of their F-1 visas.\n\nWe need to capture each obligation and duration. Format: \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\".\n\nFor example: \"fourteen days: Defendants are enjoined from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Gexi Guo, Mengcheng Yu, and Jiarong Ouyang pending resolution of these proceedings\".\n\nBut the snippet is slightly different: \"Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs\". So we need to include \"from arresting and incarcerating\" maybe. Let's craft: \"fourteen days: Defendants are enjoined from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Gexi Guo, Mengcheng Yu, and Jiarong Ouyang pending resolution of these proceedings\".\n\nSimilarly for transferring: \"fourteen days: Defendants are enjoined from transferring Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Gexi Guo, Mengcheng Yu, and Jiarong Ouyang outside the jurisdiction of this District pending the resolution of these proceedings\".\n\nSimilarly for imposing legal effect: \"fourteen days: Defendants are enjoined from imposing any legal effect that otherwise may be caused by the termination of Plaintiffs’ SEVIS statuses or the potential unlawful revocation of their F-1 visas\".\n\nWe need evidence for each: text snippet from the order, location: page 10? Actually the order page numbers: the snippet is near the end, maybe page 10? In the snippet, the order is at page 10. We need to specify location: e.g., page 10. We'll note source_document: \"Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order\". Location: page 10.\n\nWe need to include evidence text: let's copy snippet lines: The snippet shows lines 17-23: \n\"(1) Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Gexi Guo, Mengcheng Yu, and Jiarong Ouyang pending resolution of these proceedings; and (2) Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from transferring Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Gexi Guo, Mengcheng Yu, and Jiarong Ouyang outside the jurisdiction of this District pending the resolution of these proceedings; and (3) Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from imposing any legal effect that otherwise may be caused by the termination of Plaintiffs’ SEVIS statuses or the potential unlawful revocation of their F-1 visas.\"\n\nWe can use that snippet as evidence.\n\nThus we will call `append_checklist`.\n\nBut we must ensure no duplicates: we already have one entry maybe the same? The earlier appended value might have been one of these? Unsure. Step 14 appended 1 value. Might have been the first obligation. But we need to confirm. We don't know which one was appended. But we should still append the other two. But we risk duplicate. To be safe, we can update instead? If earlier appended value already matched one of these, we might duplicate. But we can't guarantee. The earlier appended value might have been \"fourteen days: Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs\" or maybe the entire order? Let's check step 14: \"append_checklist (How_Long_Decrees_will_Last) → Successfully appended 1 value for 1 key: How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\". The value appended might have been \"fourteen days: Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating...\" Likely. So we need to append the other two obligations. So we will append two new entries.\n\nThus we will call `append_checklist` with patch key How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, extracted: two entries with evidence.\n\nWe need to include evidence array each with text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nLet's craft snippet: we can take the lines 17-23. We need to include the snippet exactly. Let's extract the snippet from the document text. In the shown snippet, lines 17-23:\n\n```\n(1) Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Gexi Guo, Mengcheng Yu, and Jiarong Ouyang pending resolution of these proceedings; and (2) Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from transferring Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Gexi Guo, Mengcheng Yu, and Jiarong Ouyang outside the jurisdiction of this District pending the resolution of these proceedings; and (3) Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days from imposing any legal effect that otherwise may be caused by the termination of Plaintiffs’ SEVIS statuses or the potential unlawful revocation of their F-1 visas.\n```\n\nWe'll split into separate text for each obligation.\n\nEntry 1: \"fourteen days: Defendants are enjoined from arresting and incarcerating Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Gexi Guo, Mengcheng Yu, and Jiarong Ouyang pending resolution of these proceedings.\"\n\nEvidence text: the full sentence as above.\n\nEntry 2: \"fourteen days: Defendants are enjoined from transferring Plaintiffs Zhuoer Chen, Gexi Guo, Mengcheng Yu, and Jiarong Ouyang outside the jurisdiction of this District pending the resolution of these proceedings.\"\n\nEntry 3: \"fourteen days: Defendants are enjoined from imposing any legal effect that otherwise may be caused by the termination of Plaintiffs’ SEVIS statuses or the potential unlawful revocation of their F-1 visas.\"\n\nBut we only need to append two entries. But we might as well append all three? But we need to avoid duplicate. We don't know which one is already appended. To be safe, we can append all three and let the system dedupe? But the spec: we should not duplicate. But we can't guarantee. We could update the key with all three entries, replacing earlier one. That would guarantee completeness. But update may override earlier entries. But we don't know if we had any earlier. It's safer to use update to replace entire list with all three. Because we have authoritative set: three obligations. That ensures no duplicates.\n\nThus we should call `update_checklist` with patch key How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, extracted: three entries.\n\nBut the spec: update can replace entire list. That is fine.\n\nThus we will do update with 3 entries.\n\nOk.\n\nLet's prepare evidence for each.\n\nWe need location: page 10 of order. We'll use \"page 10\".\n\nsource_document: \"Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order\".\n\ntext: include snippet.\n\nLet's construct snippets:\n\nSnippet1: \"(1) Defendants are enjoined for fourteen days

But the task: extract the decree duration from the legal documents. The item is How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. We have 3 values. Are there any other decree durations in other documents? We need to check other documents for decree durations. The Ex Parte TRO contains 3 injunctions; we captured them. But could there be other decree durations in other documents? The documents are various pleadings; perhaps there are other decrees or orders. We need to search for \"days\" etc. But earlier searches didn't find matches; but maybe there are durations like \"for 30 days\" etc. We should search for patterns that indicate durations in decrees. But the earlier search for \"for 30 days\" etc didn't find matches. However, maybe there are durations expressed as \"for a period of 30 days\" or \"for 30 days\" in other documents. But the earlier searches found 11 matches across documents for date numeric patterns. We saw they didn't match durations? Actually earlier search with pattern \"\\d+\\s+(day|week|month|year)s?\" found 11 matches, but we didn't parse them. Those might include durations, but maybe in contexts like \"30 days\" but not necessarily decree durations. We need to identify all decree durations. These are durations of court orders or judgments (injunctions, consent decrees). It could be other documents like \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" may have durations. Let's search that document for \"days\" etc. But we already read full 0-15315 tokens; we might need to search for durations again. We can use search_document_regex on that document with pattern \"effective until\" or \"for \\d+ days\" etc.\n\nBut earlier step 25: read_document on Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences (tokens 5000-10000). We read partially. Later step 41: read_document 10000-15000. Step 44: read 15000-15500. So we have full coverage. But we haven't searched for durations. Let's search again for patterns \"for \\d+ days\" etc. But earlier searches on all documents returned no matches; maybe those patterns didn't catch due to punctuation. But we could search for \"for [0-9]+ day\" etc. But earlier step 3 etc found no matches after reading some docs. But maybe the durations are written with words like \"for thirty days\" or \"for 30 days\". We need to capture those.\n\nGiven the Ex Parte TRO had 14 days. There might be durations in other documents, e.g., \"for 30 days\" in the Order Granting Motions. Let's search that document specifically for \"days\" preceded by \"for\". Let's do search_document_regex on that document:\n\npattern: \"for\\s+\\d+\\s+days?\" \nAlso pattern: \"for\\s+[0-9]+\\s+(week|month|year)s?\" \nAlso pattern: \"effective until\\s+\\w+\\s+\\d{1,2},\\s+\\d{4}\" etc.\n\nBut earlier step 13 search for \"\\b\\d+\\s+days\\b\" on that document found no matches. Maybe durations expressed as \"for 30 days\" but not just \"30 days\". So we need to search for \"for 30 days\" pattern. Let's do search_document_regex on that document for \"for\\s+\\d+\\s+days\". Also maybe \"for 30 days\" but also \"for 30 days\" which matches pattern. We can also search for \"for a period of \\d+ days\" etc. Let's perform search.\n\nAlso could be \"for 30 days\" but not \"for 30 days\" maybe \"for 30 days\" appears. Let's search.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex on that document with pattern \"for\\s+\\d+\\s+days\" and \"for\\s+\\d+\\s+weeks\" etc. Also search for \"effective until\" plus date.\n\nBut we also want to capture durations like \"for 30 days\" etc.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on that document with pattern: \"(?i)for\\s+\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\".

But we can search for \"for\\s+\\w+\\s+days\" but that's ambiguous. Might be too broad.\n\nBut maybe the only durations to capture are the 14 days from the TRO. But we should verify no other durations exist. Let's search again.\n\nWe'll use search_document_regex on Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences. Also maybe on other documents like Complaint.\n\nBut earlier search for pattern \"\\b\\d+\\s+(day|week|month|year)s?\" on all documents found 11 matches. Those might include durations. But we didn't view them. We need to see those matches. Let's request the matches for the Order Granting Motions document again.

The only checklist item is How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. We have 3 values extracted from Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order. However, the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have only found 3 from that order. But maybe other documents also contain decree durations, e.g., the order granting motions for preliminary injunctions might contain durations of injunction. Did we miss? The search steps found no durations in those documents. But maybe the \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences\" contains durations like \"One-year injunction\" etc. The search steps didn't find numeric durations, but maybe durations expressed in words like \"for one year\" or \"for 12 months\" etc. We should search for patterns like \"for a period of\" etc. But we did many searches. However, we might look for \"for a period of\" etc. Already searched. But maybe the durations are expressed as \"for 30 days\" etc. But we searched numeric patterns. We might need to search for \"for\" \"month\" etc. But we didn't search for \"for a period of\" with numbers. We did earlier. But maybe the durations are expressed as \"for ninety days\" spelled out words. That would not match numeric patterns. We should search for spelled-out numbers? That's complex.\n\nAlternatively, the decree durations may be in the \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences\". Let's quickly scan that document for \"days\" etc. The read_document steps covered everything; maybe we should re-read or search for \"days\" again. But the searches found 0 in that doc. But maybe the order includes \"for a period of 30 days\" etc. But the regex didn't find. Could be \"for a period of thirty days\" spelled out. That would not match numeric regex.\n\nWe could use a broader search: pattern: \"(?i)for\\s+\\w+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\". That would match word numbers. But we didn't try. Let's try search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(?i)for\\s+\\w+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\". That might capture \"for a period of thirty days\"? Actually pattern \"for\\s+\\w+\\s+(days?|...)\" would match \"for a days\" etc. But \"for a period of thirty days\" would not match because \"a period of\" is not directly before number. We could use \"for\\s+(\\w+)\\s+(days?|...)\" but that's too generic.\n\nBetter approach: Search for \"days?\" alone? That might capture many but we need durations in the context of decree. But maybe we can search for \"days\" and then manually find context. But we can just read the entire document for \"days\" but that's large. But we can search for \"days\" with context tokens and then manually locate durations. But we already did numeric search and didn't find. But maybe the durations are in words. Let's try search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(?i)for\\s+(\\w+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\". That would match \"for a days\" (not correct). But we can search for \"for\\s+(\\w+)\\s+days?\" but not.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"for a period of\" etc. But we did. But maybe \"for a period of thirty days\" would match pattern \"for a period of\\s+(\\w+)\\s+days?\" but we didn't include that. We used pattern \"for\\s+(\\d+)\\s+(days?|...)\" earlier. So we didn't catch spelled-out numbers.\n\nThus we might need to search for spelled-out numbers: \"for a period of thirty days\", \"for thirty days\", \"for thirty days\", etc. We could search for \"for\\s+\\w+\\s+days?\" but that matches \"for a days\" etc. We need to include \"for\\s+(\\w+)\\s+days?\" but we need to capture any word before \"days\". But we need to match preceding words possibly \"for a period of\". So maybe pattern \"(?i)for\\s+(a\\s+period\\s+of\\s+)?(\\w+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\". That might match \"for a period of thirty days\". Let's try that. But we only have one action allowed: either read_document, search_document_regex, etc. We should do a search_document_regex on all documents for that pattern.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"(?i)for\\s+(?:a\\s+period\\s+of\\s+)?(\\w+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\".

We have 3 values. Is there any other duration in other documents? Search for \"effective until\" etc didn't find. Maybe \"until\" with date. In Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions, there might be \"until the parties are...\" but that's a date not duration. The definition wants duration like \"fourteen days\". We have 3. There might be \"until\" with date but not duration. So likely complete. But check if any other documents mention \"for fourteen days\" etc. Search again across all docs for \"for fourteen days\" maybe. But earlier search didn't find. But maybe other durations like \"for six months\" etc. Let's search again: search_document_regex pattern: \"for\\s+\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" across all docs. Step 52 had 0.

The checklist item: How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. We have extracted 3 values from Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order. Do we have any other decrees in other documents? The earlier search didn't find other durations. But we might have missed durations in other documents like other orders. Let's examine other documents for any durations. For example, \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions and Setting Case Management Conferences\" might have durations like \"until [date]\" or \"for [duration]\". Step 3, 6, 7, 8 etc search didn't find matches. But maybe there are durations like \"effective until\" or \"until [date]\" but pattern didn't catch because not numeric? Could be \"effective until [date]\" but we need durations expressed in time units. Might have \"for a period of X months\" etc. But earlier searches didn't find matches.\n\nBut we need to confirm that we have all distinct durations. The list of documents shows many partially visited. Maybe there are durations in other documents not yet read. We should search again for patterns like \"for [0-9]+ [days|weeks|months|years]\" across all documents. Step 4, 5, 8, but didn't find. But those searches may have missed because durations like \"for a period of 90 days\" with \"a period of\" phrase. Step 5 looked for \"(?i)for\\s+(a\\s+period\\s+of|the\\s+duration\\s+of|the\\s+term\\s+of)\\s+[0-9]+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" - no matches. Step 10 similar. Step 54 used \"(?i)for\\s+(?:a\\s+period\\s+of\\s+)?(\\w+)\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" which found matches in Ex Parte TRO. That pattern may have matched \"for fourteen days\". But maybe other documents have durations like \"for fifteen days\" or \"for a period of 30 days\" etc. Search again with pattern that matches \"for\" followed by number and unit. Step 4, 8, 21, 35, 43 all \"for \\d+ unit\" - no matches. So likely no other durations.\n\nAlso check for \"effective until\" or explicit dates but we need duration, not date. So only durations like numeric.\n\nThus we likely have all 3 durations: \"fourteen days\" maybe multiple times but we need distinct values. The Ex Parte TRO had \"for fourteen days\" repeated. But we count distinct values: \"fourteen days\". However the checklist says \"Extract each duration as a separate value\". But if same duration occurs multiple times, still distinct value? They say \"EVERY distinct value\". So \"fourteen days\" is one distinct value. But earlier step 51 updated 3 values. Means they had 3 distinct durations? Let's examine step 51: update_checklist (How_Long_Decrees_will_Last) successfully updated 3 values. That implies they had 3 distinct durations. Which ones? Possibly \"fourteen days\", \"ten days\", \"five days\"? Not sure. But from Ex Parte TRO only fourteen days appears. Maybe other durations found elsewhere earlier, but not in the final step? But step 51 happened earlier after reading and searching. Might have extracted 3 values earlier: maybe from other documents like \"Order Granting Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\" might have \"effective until\" but not numeric.\n\nLet's examine step 51: \"Successfully updated 3 values for 1 key: How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\". So they previously had 3 durations. Which? Let's try to deduce: Step 14 appended 1 value. Step 51 updated 3 values. So maybe earlier they found 3 durations: could be from different documents. But step 56 \"stop\" says all distinct decree duration values have been extracted and appended from the Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order; no additional durations were found in remaining documents. That might mean the 3 durations were all from Ex Parte TRO. But Ex Parte TRO only had 14 days repeated. So something inconsistent. Maybe there were durations like \"for fourteen days\" appears thrice in the TRO but they counted each occurrence as separate value? But the instruction says distinct values. But maybe they didn't filter duplicates. In step 51 they updated 3 values, maybe they had 3 occurrences: all \"fourteen days\". But they wrote \"3 values\". So maybe they appended duplicates. So we must follow system's state.\n\nNow we need to decide whether to stop. The checklist status: 1/1 filled, 0 empty. So from system perspective, key filled. However we need to ensure that the key is complete: all distinct durations found. Are there any other durations not yet found? Let's search again for pattern \"for\\s+\\d+\\s+(days?|weeks?|months?|years?)\" across all documents. That was step 21, 35, 43, etc. All returned no matches. So likely none.\n\nAlso check for \"effective until\" but not numeric. But we only care durations. So I think extraction is complete.\n\nBut ensure that we have evidence for each value. The step 51 update probably had evidence. We don't need to append more.\n\nThus we can stop. The decision: stop. Provide JSON.\n\nBut ensure we include \"reason\" field.
