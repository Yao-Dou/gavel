The regex search already captured many matches, all showing the same case number: 0:22-cv-61029-RAR or 22-CV-61029-RAR. It seems all documents refer to the same case. But the task is to extract every distinct value: maybe there is only one. But we need to confirm if any other case numbers appear in other documents. The search only looked for pattern \"Case\\s*(No\\.|#|Number)\\s*[:\\s]*[A-Z0-9\\-]+\" which matched all documents. However maybe other documents contain other case numbers like in docket entries. We might need to search for any case numbers. But maybe the only case is 22-CV-61029-RAR. But there could be other related cases: maybe there are docket entries referencing other case numbers (like \"Case No. 23-CV-12345\" etc). The task: \"Extract the related cases from the legal documents. ... Any related matters identified by their case numbers/codes.\" So we need to find all distinct case codes in the documents.\n\nWe already have matches: all show 0:22-cv-61029-RAR, case 22-CV-61029-RAR. That's the same case but with different formatting. So we have one unique case number: 22-CV-61029-RAR. But we should confirm that no other case numbers appear. We could search again across all documents for pattern capturing case numbers. The regex used found matches in all documents. But maybe some documents contain other case numbers not captured due to pattern. But likely it's just this one case.\n\nThus we can append the extracted item: Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number: value \"22-CV-61029-RAR\" (or possibly \"0:22-cv-61029-RAR\"? But we need consistent code. The official case number is 22-CV-61029-RAR. The \"0:\" prefix may be docket ID. So the code is 22-CV-61029-RAR.\n\nWe need evidence: Each match snippet includes the case number. We can provide evidence from any of those matches. Use one snippet: from Complaint: \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" or \"Case No. 22-CV-61029-RAR\". So we need at least one evidence snippet. Provide doc name and location: e.g., \"Complaint\", location page 1. So we can append.\n\nWe have no other keys. So after appending, get_checklist will show 1 value. Then stop.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.\n\nWe need to construct JSON patch. Use key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". Extracted list: one entry value \"22-CV-61029-RAR\" with evidence: text snippet \"Case No. 22-CV-61029-RAR\" from Complaint page 1.\n\nWe might want to include multiple evidence from multiple documents?

The regex search already found matches for case numbers in many documents. But we need to extract distinct values of this checklist item. The regex pattern was used but we need actual extraction. We should read the documents to capture the specific case numbers. The matches show the case numbers: \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\". There's also \"Case No. 22-CV-61029-RAR\". It's the same case code. But maybe there are other related case numbers? The search only matched that pattern. But maybe there are other documents referencing other case numbers, e.g., \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\". That appears many times. Are there any other case numbers? We should search for \"Case 0:\" pattern. The regex used might catch many. But we need distinct values. The only one appears to be 0:22-cv-61029-RAR (with variations). Let's confirm by searching all documents for \"Case No.\" or \"Case 0:\" etc. But we already have matches. However, we need to extract all distinct values. There could be other case numbers like \"Case 0:23-cv-XXXXX\" maybe. Let's search again but we may need to read more of the documents beyond the first 143 tokens to capture any other case numbers. For each document, the first 143 tokens already contain the case number. Should scan further? Perhaps some documents may reference other case numbers in cross references. But given the pattern, likely only one.\n\nLet's proceed to read a bit more from a document to confirm. Maybe we can read the first 200 tokens of Complaint to capture the case number. But it's already captured. We need to produce evidence. Let's use read_document for Complaint doc, tokens 0-200. Then append_checklist with extracted value \"0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" with evidence snippet. But ensure we use the exact value as appears: It appears as \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" and \"Case No. 22-CV-61029-RAR\". We need to decide which format to use. The checklist likely expects the case code number. Probably the canonical form: \"0:22-cv-61029-RAR\". But we can include both? But distinct values: only one.

Need to have evidence. We already saw in Complaint tokens 0-200 snippet: \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\". Also other docs have \"Case No. 22-CV-61029-RAR\". We should extract \"0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" (maybe canonical). We'll include both forms? Distinct values: maybe two forms but same underlying; but should treat as distinct?

We already extracted two values: 0:22-cv-61029-RAR and 22-CV-61029-RAR. The task is to extract ALL distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. So we need to scan all documents for case numbers/codes. The search regex pattern used earlier matched \"Case\\s*(No\\.|#|Number)\\s*[:\\s]*[A-Z0-9\\-]+\". It found matches in all documents, but only captured the case number in the headings. However there might be other related case numbers listed within documents, e.g., other docket numbers, or cross references to other cases. We need to find all distinct values. The documents include 9 documents: Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, Third Amended Complaint, Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants, Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss, Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment, Mediation Report, Docket.\n\nWe should search all documents for patterns that might indicate case numbers. The regex pattern used earlier might capture some but maybe there are others like \"Case No. 22-CV-61029-RAR\" etc. Also there could be other case numbers like \"Case No. 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" or \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" etc. The earlier search found 8 matches, one in each doc. However the second amended complaint might contain the same case number. But we need to ensure we capture all distinct values. It seems all documents share the same case number. But maybe the docket document includes other case numbers or references. Let's think: The docket might have multiple docket entries for different case numbers if there's a docket for a different case. But likely it's the same case. But to be thorough, we need to search the Docket document for any case numbers.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on \"Docket\" with pattern for case numbers. Additionally, maybe the documents contain other case numbers referencing related matters (e.g., \"Case No. 1:23-cv-12345-XYZ\" etc). We can search across all documents for pattern \"Case\\s*(No\\.|#|Number)\\s*[:\\s]*[A-Z0-9\\-]+\".\n\nWe already did that search and found 8 matches. But maybe there are other patterns like \"Case No. 22-CV-61029-RA\" (missing R). But we might need to adjust regex to capture hyphenated numbers. The earlier pattern might capture all, but we should confirm.\n\nLet's search again with a broader pattern: \"Case\\s*(No\\.|#|Number)\\s*[:\\s]*[0-9A-Z\\-:\\.]+\". That should capture numeric and letters. Also, we might find \"Case No. 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" etc. We also need to capture \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" etc.\n\nBetter to search across all documents for pattern \"Case\\s*(No\\.|#|Number)?\\s*[:\\s]*[0-9A-Z\\-:]+\". Let's use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" and top_k maybe 10, context_tokens 200. Then examine results.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the Docket to see if it contains other case numbers. But Docket might be large; but we can search.\n\nAlso, we need to capture distinct values. Likely only case number is the same across all docs. But we need to confirm if there are any other numbers like \"Case No. 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" and \"22-CV-61029-RAR\" appear multiple times. We already captured both variants. We need to check if there are other forms, like \"Case No. 22-CV-61029-RAR\" in other docs. But we saw that only Final Judgment had \"22-CV-61029-RAR\". Others had \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" or similar. But we need to capture distinct values: \"0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" and \"22-CV-61029-RAR\". Are there any other distinct values? Maybe the docket contains \"Case No. 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" again. But it's same. So likely only two distinct values. But need to verify if there are any other case numbers like \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" and \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" are same. Also \"22-CV-61029-RAR\" is same but different format. But distinct values are these two.\n\nWe also need to consider evidence: each value must include evidence. For each distinct value, we need at least one evidence snippet. We already have evidence for both from Complaint and Final Judgment. But we need to ensure we include evidence from each doc? The instruction says each extracted value should be self-contained with evidence. We already appended two entries with evidence from Complaint (for first value) and Final Judgment (for second). That seems fine.\n\nBut we need to check if any other documents have other case numbers that differ. Let's search in Docket. If no other case numbers, then we are done. But we need to confirm. Let's run search_document_regex on Docket with pattern.\n\nWe also might need to read specific parts of the Docket to confirm. Let's do that.\n\nAlso, we might search across all documents again with improved regex to capture all. But we already got 8 matches. That probably covers all documents. But maybe there are other case numbers that were not caught by the regex due to missing colon or number format. But it's likely only that. So we can stop.\n\nHowever, we need to verify that we have captured all distinct values. The two values are distinct. But we need to ensure we didn't miss any other case numbers that might appear in docket entries or other documents.

But maybe \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" appears in many documents and \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" is only one. But the final judgement had \"22-CV-61029-RAR\". So two distinct values. So we should append these.\n\nBut we need to confirm that the final judgement had that value. We saw earlier step 5: extracted value 2: \"22-CV-61029-RAR\" from Final Judgment. So we already appended both values.\n\nThus all values extracted: 0:22-cv-61029-RAR and 22-CV-61029-RAR. Check if any other case numbers exist e.g., \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" maybe in other docs but same. No new distinct case numbers.\n\nThus we can stop. But need to verify if any other case numbers like \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" is repeated but we already have. So we can stop.\n\nBut we need to ensure all values extracted. It's possible docket has another case number like \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" only. But maybe docket might include \"Case 22-CV-61029-RAR\" too. But we already have that.\n\nCheck step 6: docket search pattern \"Case\\s*(No\\.|#|Number)?\\s*[:\\s]*[0-9A-Z\\-:\\.]+\". In matches, we saw tokens with \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" many times. Also maybe \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" appears. There might also be \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" only.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut double-check if there could be other case numbers like \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" maybe case code \"0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" repeated. Are there any other codes like \"22-CV-61029-RAR\" maybe also appears in other documents. We have that.\n\nThus stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number values have been extracted: 0:22-cv-61029-RAR and 22-CV-61029-RAR, with evidence from Complaint and Final Judgment.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number values have been extracted: 0:22-cv-61029-RAR and 22-CV-61029-RAR, with evidence from Complaint and Final Judgment.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11110, "completion_tokens": 1192, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The step 8 claimed all distinct values extracted. But maybe other documents contain other case numbers. We saw search regex found many matches with \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" repeated. Also in other documents maybe similar. We need to check if any other case codes appear. Search results in complaint only show that case number. The docket search shows many matches but not necessarily case numbers. But docket entries might include other case numbers like \"Case 1:23-cv-...\" etc. We need to search across all documents for other case codes. The earlier search pattern \"Case\\s*(No\\.|#|Number)?\\s*[:\\s]*[0-9A-Z\\-.:]+\" might have matched many. But we need to extract only distinct case codes. We have already extracted two: \"0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" and \"22-CV-61029-RAR\". Are there others? In the docket matches, there are lines like \"case. If agreed, parties...\" but not case numbers. But maybe docket entries include \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" as well. But we should check if any other case codes appear in other documents: First Amended Complaint, etc. They likely reference same case number \"0:22-cv-61029-RAR\". But maybe also some other case numbers for related cases like \"0:22-cv-61029-ABC\" etc. We need to search for \"Case \" followed by pattern. Let's search in all documents.

The task is to extract all related cases. Does the case list include any others? In the search results, only these two appear. We should confirm if any other case numbers appear elsewhere. Search pattern \"Case\" with numbers. Probably only these two. But need to double-check other documents like First Amended Complaint, etc. They likely reference same case. The pattern shows same case code. So maybe no other distinct values. But ensure we haven't missed something like \"Case No. 22-CV-61029-RAR\" vs \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\". Those are two distinct strings. Are there any others like \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RA\" etc? Let's search again. But maybe there are also \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" in other documents. But we already captured that. So likely complete.\n\nWe need to verify no other case numbers appear in any document. We could run search_document_regex for pattern \"Case\\s*(No\\.|#|Number)?\\s*[:\\s]*[A-Z0-9\\-:\\.]+\" across all docs again to ensure. But we have seen 41 matches, many duplicates. But check if any match includes a different code. Let's quickly scan the matches list for any different pattern. The matches show \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" and \"Case No. 22-CV-61029-RAR\" etc. Also \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" appears. No other pattern like \"Case 1:23-cv-...\" etc. So likely only those two.\n\nThus we can produce final stop. But before stopping, we need to ensure the checklist is fully extracted: 1 key with 2 values. It is correct. No Not Applicable. So we can stop.\n\nReturn JSON decision stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number values have been extracted and documented.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number values have been extracted and documented.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14904, "completion_tokens": 469, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
