But we need to capture distinct values. We'll search for any matches. Use search_document_regex over all docs. Then we will read relevant windows to confirm. We'll proceed with a search. We'll use pattern: \"(?i)(Fourteenth Amendment|First Amendment|Eighth Amendment|42 U.S.C. § 1983|ADA|Americans with Disabilities Act|Rehab Act § 504|Title II|Civil Rights Act|Section 1983|Section 1981|Section 1985|Section 1985.1|Section 1987|Section 1988|Section 1989|Section 1991|Section 1992|Section 1993|Section 1994|Section 1995|Section 1996|Section 2000|Title VII|Title IX|Title X|Title XI|Title XII|Title XIII|Title XIV|Title XV|Title XVI|Title XVII|Title XVIII|Title XIX|Title XX|Title XXI|Title XXII|Title XXIII|Title XXIV|Title XXV|Title XXVI|Title XXVII|Title XXVIII|Title XXIX|Title XXX|Title XXXI|Title XXXII|Title XXXIII|Title XXXIV|Title XXXV|Title XXXVI|Title XXXVII|Title XXXVIII|Title XXXIX|Title XL|Title XLI|Title XLII|Title XLIII|Title XLIV|Title XLV|Title XLVI|Title XLVII|Title XLVIII|Title XLIX|Title L|Title LI|Title LII|Title LIII|Title LIV|Title LV|Title LVI|Title LVII|Title LVIII|Title LIX|Title LX|Title LXI|Title LXII|Title LXIII|Title LXIV|Title LXV|Title LXVI|Title LXVII|Title LXVIII|Title LXIX|Title LXX|Title LXXI|Title LXXII|Title LXXIII|Title LXXIV|Title LXXV|Title LXXVI|Title LXXVII|Title LXXVIII|Title LXXIX|Title LXXX|Title LXXXI|Title LXXXII|Title LXXXIII|Title LXXXIV|Title LXXXV|Title LXXXVI|Title LXXXVII|Title LXXXVIII|Title LXXXIX|Title XC|Title XCI|Title XCII|Title XCIII|Title XCIV|Title XCV|Title XCVI|Title XCVII|Title XCVIII|Title XCIX|Title XCVL|Title XCVI|Title XCVI|Title XCVI|Title XCVI|Title XCVI)\".

The search already found many matches and the matches contain constitutional amendments references and 42 U.S.C. §§ etc. However the note says we need distinct values: each distinct basis. We should extract unique items: First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alone? Also mention \"states\" but not needed. Also maybe \"Americans with Disabilities Act\" or \"Rehab Act § 504\" not present yet. The search pattern captured them but we saw no matches for ADA etc. Let's search in documents for \"Americans with Disabilities Act\" etc. But our search pattern already included them. But maybe they didn't appear in matches? Might be present but not in those matched ranges. We need to search again for those patterns across all documents, but maybe we need to read sections where they appear. However we might already have all basis from matches.\n\nLet's list distinct bases found in matches:\n\nFrom Complaint and First Amended Complaint:\n\n- 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\n- First Amendment\n- Fourth Amendment\n- Fourteenth Amendment\n- Also mention \"State of Florida\" but not needed? It's a source of law but basis could be state constitution? But not specifically.\n\nFrom Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss:\n\n- First Amendment\n- Fourteenth Amendment (substantive due process)\n- Fourth Amendment\n- procedural due process (but that's procedural doctrine; we should not include procedural doctrines per instructions)\nBut \"procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\" is still the Fourteenth Amendment. So we should list Fourteenth Amendment again but duplicate? No, distinct value: just Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nAlso maybe mention \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\" but it's same.\n\nAlso the order possibly cites \"U.S. Constitution amend. I\" again.\n\nAlso \"U.S. CONST. amend. I\" is same.\n\nSo distinct values: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\", \"First Amendment\", \"Fourth Amendment\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\".\n\nShould we include \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" separately? The match shows \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\". So we should capture that phrase as basis: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" maybe include both. There might also be separate mention of \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" alone? Search pattern includes it. But we might have seen it. In the matches, we saw \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" but not separate.\n\nAlso contract may mention \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" singular in other sections. We should search again for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" alone.\n\nBut we can do search_document_regex for pattern \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1983\" or \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1988\". But the pattern already captured \"42 U\\.S\\.C. § 1983\" but maybe there were matches. The matches include \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\". So maybe there is no separate \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" alone. But we can search again for \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1983\" to confirm. But we might not need separate if not present.\n\nAlso check for \"Rehab Act § 504\" etc. but likely not present.\n\nThus we have 4 distinct bases. Provide evidence for each from the matched contexts.\n\nWe must read the documents to capture evidence. We have partial views. For each basis we need a snippet from a document.\n\nFrom Complaint: the snippet includes \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment\". We can use that snippet for all four. For the 42 U.S.C. reference, we can use the snippet that includes it.\n\nAlso \"First Amendment\" appears in other documents; but we can use the same snippet.\n\nWe need to provide location: document name and page? The snippet shows Page 2 of 36. So location: \"Complaint, Page 2\". Similarly for First Amended Complaint: page 2 of 43. Also Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss: page 5? Actually snippet shows page 5? It shows \"Page 2 of 43\"? Let's check. The order snippet shows \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR Document 49 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/27/2022 Page 2 of 43\". So location: \"First Amended Complaint, Page 2\".\n\nOrder Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss: snippet shows \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR Document 49 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/27/2022 Page 2 of 43\". Wait that's same as earlier. Actually the order snippet in Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss might be different. The snippet shows \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR Document 49 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/27/2022 Page 2 of 43\". That seems like a different document? Wait \"Document 49\" refers to First Amended Complaint, not the order. Actually the order is separate. The snippet for Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss has \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR Document 49 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/27/2022 Page 2 of 43\". That might be a confusion. But the order snippet might be part of the order. But it shows \"Document 49\" which is First Amended Complaint. But maybe the order excerpt inadvertently references the complaint. But anyway.\n\nWe can also use the snippet from Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss that shows \"First Amendment\" etc. The snippet includes \"First Amendment\" and \"Fourteenth Amendment\" etc. So we can use that.\n\nThus, we need to produce an append_checklist call with four entries for \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\".\n\nBut we need to ensure each entry has evidence with text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe have potential evidence:\n\n1. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988: from Complaint snippet at page 2. Provide text: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment\". We'll extract the phrase \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" as value.\n\n2. First Amendment: same snippet. Provide text: \"First Amendment\". Use snippet.\n\n3. Fourth Amendment: snippet.\n\n4. Fourteenth Amendment: snippet.\n\nAlternatively, we might want to also mention \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" separately if found. But not necessary.\n\nWe should verify if the snippet includes \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" exactly. Yes.\n\nWe also might need to extract \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" from other documents if present. But not required.\n\nThus we will append entries.\n\nWe must be careful to use the correct key: \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\". Provide patch.\n\nWe must include evidence as array of objects. Each evidence must contain text, source_document, location. For each value, we can include one evidence.\n\nWe need to provide evidence with context. Provide text snippet of maybe 30-50 characters.\n\nWe will use the snippet from Complaint (Document 1) page 2. That snippet includes all four. But we can split into separate evidence for each entry, but we can reuse same snippet. But we might provide separate evidence for each entry referencing same snippet but location same.\n\nAlso we can provide separate snippet for each basis for clarity.\n\nLet's capture the snippet:\n\nFrom the snippet in complaint:\n\n```\n42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988,  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  Fourth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,\n```\n\nWe can extract separate parts.\n\nWe'll provide evidence text: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" etc.\n\nBut we may also want to include \"First Amendment to the United States Constitution\" etc.\n\nThus, for each entry:\n\n- value: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\"\n- evidence: text: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\" location: Complaint, Page 2.\n\nBut that's verbose. The text should be snippet. But we can include the full snippet for context.\n\nAlternatively, we can provide evidence text just \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\". But we might need the full snippet to show it's from that doc.\n\nBetter to include the snippet as shown in search results.\n\nThus, for each entry we will use same evidence snippet.\n\nAlso we can add evidence from Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss for First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Fourth Amendment. But we can just use one evidence per value.\n\nThus, we need to create patch with four entries.\n\nLet's craft JSON.\n\nWe'll call append_checklist with patch array containing one object: key \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\" and extracted array of four entries.\n\nEach entry: value and evidence array.\n\nWe need to provide evidence objects with text, source_document, location.\n\nWe'll use source_document: \"Complaint\" for snippet. location: \"Page 2\".\n\nAlso can add source_document: \"First Amended Complaint\" for snippet as well, but we can just include one.\n\nBetter to include evidence from both documents to strengthen. But we can include two evidence objects per value: one from Complaint, one from First Amended Complaint. That is allowed. But we need to include distinct evidence for each entry. It's okay.\n\nThus, for each entry, we will include two evidence objects: from Complaint and from First Amended Complaint.\n\nFrom Complaint snippet tokens 425-691: location \"Page 2\".\n\nFrom First Amended Complaint snippet tokens 419-619: location \"Page 2\".\n\nThus we will include evidence for each.\n\nThus patch:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        { \"text\": \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988,  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 2\" },\n        { \"text\": \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\", \"source_document\": \"First Amended Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 2\" }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": \"First Amendment\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        { \"text\": \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988,  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 2\" },\n        { \"text\": \"First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\", \"source_document\": \"First Amended Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 2\" }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": \"Fourth Amendment\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        { \"text\": \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988,  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  Fourth  Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 2\" },\n        { \"text\": \"First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\", \"source_document\": \"First Amended Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 2\" }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": \"Fourteenth Amendment\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        { \"text\": \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988,  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  Fourth  Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 2\" },\n        { \"text\": \"First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\", \"source_document\": \"First Amended Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 2\" }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWe must ensure each evidence snippet is verbatim from document. The snippet from Complaint might be \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988,  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\". That is exactly from snippet.\n\nFrom First Amended Complaint snippet: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\". That is also accurate.\n\nThus we can provide that.\n\nNow we should call append_checklist.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"patch\":[{\"key\":\"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\",\"extracted\":[{\"value\":\"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988,  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  Fourth  Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\",\"source_document\":\"Complaint\",\"location\":\"Page 2\"},{\"text\":\"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\",\"source_document\":\"First Amended Complaint\",\"location\":\"Page 2\"}]},{\"value\":\"First Amendment\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988,  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  Fourth  Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\",\"source_document\":\"Complaint\",\"location\":\"Page 2\"},{\"text\":\"First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\",\"source_document\":\"First Amended Complaint\",\"location\":\"Page 2\"}]},{\"value\":\"Fourth Amendment\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988,  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  Fourth  Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\",\"source_document\":\"Complaint\",\"location\":\"Page 2\"},{\"text\":\"First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\",\"source_document\":\"First Amended Complaint\",\"location\":\"Page 2\"}]},{\"value\":\"Fourteenth Amendment\",\"evidence\":[{\"text\":\"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988,  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  Fourth  Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\",\"source_document\":\"Complaint\",\"location\":\"Page 2\"},{\"text\":\"First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\",\"source_document\":\"First Amended Complaint\",\"location\":\"Page 2\"}]}]}]", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7831, "completion_tokens": 3480, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have seen regex matches indicating various amendments and statutes. We need distinct values. We should read more to confirm all bases. We saw in Complaint and First Amended Complaint: 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Florida Constitution, etc. Also other documents include possibly other bases: maybe Civil Rights Act, Title VII, etc. We should search for other patterns. The regex already used includes those. But we need all distinct bases. We should search across all documents for the pattern of constitutional amendments and statutes. Then list unique values. We should include each distinct basis with evidence.\n\nWe might need to read the matches to capture each basis. The search results have tokens but not full context. But we could use search_document_regex again to get more matches. We can request top_k maybe 20 per doc. We should re-run search_document_regex but we already did; but maybe we need to get matches for all docs. We saw 30 total matches across 9 docs. We might need to read additional matches to capture other bases. But we also need to include Florida Constitution? The search pattern didn't include \"Florida Constitution\". But we might want to include it if present. The requirement: extract statutory or constitutional basis. Florida Constitution qualifies. The regex didn't include \"Florida Constitution\", but we can search again including that. Also \"Civil Rights Act\" etc. Let's search for \"Civil Rights Act\" \"Title VII\" etc. But we can broaden.\n\nGiven we already have many matches, we could read the \"Complaint\" and \"First Amended Complaint\" sections that contain multiple bases. We need distinct values: likely: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\", \"First Amendment\", \"Fourth Amendment\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\", \"Florida Constitution\", maybe \"Constitution and laws of the State of Florida\" but that's same. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears. In the Order Granting, we saw \"First Amendment rights\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\", \"Fourth Amendment\". Also \"procedural due process rights\" under Fourteenth Amendment. Should we include \"Due Process\"? It's a constitutional provision. So we need to capture \"Due Process\" as part of Fourteenth Amendment? The basis is \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\". So basis: \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\". That is distinct. Also \"Fourth Amendment rights\" (search). Also \"First Amendment rights\". Also \"Florida Constitution\" maybe. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\". Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" repeated. Also \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\". Also \"Civil Rights Act\" maybe. Not sure if present. Let's search for \"Civil Rights Act\" across docs. We'll call search_document_regex with that pattern.\n\nAlso \"Americans with Disabilities Act\" maybe. But not sure. We'll search.\n\nWe need to parse the search results; but we need to extract evidence. We'll need to read the specific text around each match to capture the exact phrase. We can use search_document_regex to get context, then we can use evidence from that.\n\nThus next action: call search_document_regex for pattern that includes all possible bases: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983|42 U.S.C. § 1988|42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988|First Amendment|Fourth Amendment|Fourteenth Amendment|Florida Constitution|Civil Rights Act|Title VII|Title IX|Americans with Disabilities Act|Rehab Act § 504|Title II\" etc. But we need to include \"Due Process\" maybe. Let's include \"due process\" as well. We can use pattern that covers.\n\nWe should ensure include \"substantive due process\" maybe. But pattern \"due process\" can capture. Let's do a comprehensive regex: \"(?i)(42 U\\.S\\.C\\. §§? 1983|42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1988|42 U\\.S\\.C\\. §§? 1983 and 1988|First Amendment|Fourth Amendment|Fourteenth Amendment|Florida Constitution|Civil Rights Act|Title VII|Title IX|Americans with Disabilities Act|Rehab Act § 504|Title II|due process|substantive due process|procedural due process|equal protection|freedom of speech|freedom of association|eighth amendment|equal protection clause|equal protection)\".

Also \"constitutional rights\" but we need specific. Also \"substantive due process of law\", \"procedural due process\"? The complaint mentions substantive due process. We need distinct values.\n\nWe should read sections that contain bases: Complaint partial view includes claims: 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Constitution and laws of the State of Florida.\n\nAlso in order to dismiss, mention substantive due process rights. Also maybe \"constitutional rights\" but those are generic. We want distinct values like \"First Amendment\", \"Fourth Amendment\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\", \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\", \"Florida Constitution\", \"substantive due process of law\", \"procedural due process of law\"? The order mention procedural due process rights. Also mention \"substantive due process\" in complaint.\n\nAlso \"substantive due process of law\" is a basis.\n\nAlso \"First Amendment rights\" and \"Fourth Amendment rights\" are distinct. \"Fourteenth Amendment rights\" is also. Also \"Florida Constitution\" is separate.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" is a statutory basis.\n\nAlso \"substantive due process\" is a constitutional basis.\n\nAlso \"procedural due process\" is constitutional.\n\nAlso maybe \"equal protection\" but not sure matches.\n\nSearch for \"equal protection\" maybe not. But we can search.\n\nWe may need to read some documents to confirm. Let's search the remaining documents: Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss for procedural due process; also maybe other bases like 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 appear only in complaint and first amended complaint; also \"Florida Constitution\" appears.\n\nWe should search for \"substantive due process\" and \"procedural due process\" in all docs.

Must include each distinct value. So we need to process text from various docs. We can use search_document_regex to get matches, but we already saw many. We need to ensure we capture all distinct ones. Might need to read more tokens to ensure we capture e.g., \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appear. Also \"Florida Constitution\" appears. Also \"Substantive due process\" and \"Procedural due process\" appear. Also \"First Amendment\" as clause. Also \"Fourth Amendment\" as clause. Also \"Fourteenth Amendment\" clause. Also \"Florida Constitution\" is a state constitution. Also \"substantive due process\" and \"procedural due process\" are clauses within the Fourteenth Amendment. In some places they mention \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\" and \"procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\". Also maybe \"Equal Protection\" or \"Due Process\" but not sure. Let's review the matches again to ensure all distinct bases. The search regex used earlier matches many. Might need to read further into other documents like Second/Third Amended Complaint for any additional bases like \"Eighth Amendment\" or \"Americans with Disabilities Act\" etc. But likely not present. But to be safe, we should search again for pattern that includes \"Eighth Amendment\", \"Americans with Disabilities Act\", \"Rehab Act §504\", \"Title II\", \"Title VII\", \"Title IX\". Use search_document_regex across all documents. We can do that, but we might already have all from earlier. But let's do a targeted search for those to confirm. Also \"equal protection\" and \"due process\" appear. Let's search for \"due process\" too. Use search_document_regex. We'll include pattern for clause-level \"substantive due process\", \"procedural due process\", \"equal protection\". Also \"Eighth Amendment\". Also \"Americans with Disabilities Act\". Also \"Rehab Act § 504\". Also \"Title II\". Also \"Title VII\". Also \"Title IX\". Also \"Civil Rights Act\".

We have seen many matches already via search. We need to extract distinct values: likely First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Florida Constitution, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, substantive due process, procedural due process, etc. We should gather each distinct basis. The evidence must be from documents. We should use search to get matches for each basis. We already have many matches. We can use search_document_regex to get all matches. We should then append. But we need to ensure we not duplicate. We might just search for the pattern again. But we already have a large set of matches. We could search for each basis individually, but easier: use search_document_regex with pattern that covers all relevant clauses: maybe list of patterns. But we might risk too many duplicates. But we can append each unique basis. Let's compile list of distinct bases seen:\n\nFrom matches: \n- 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983\n- 42 U.S.C. § 1988\n- First Amendment\n- Fourth Amendment\n- Fourteenth Amendment\n- Florida Constitution\n- substantive due process (the phrase \"substantive due process\" appears)\n- procedural due process (maybe)\n- \"constitutional rights to free speech\" etc but that's just phrase.\n\nAlso \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\" might be considered distinct but same clause.\n\nAlso \"substantive due process rights\" is a basis. Also \"procedural due process rights\" is a basis.\n\nAlso \"Florida Constitution\" is a basis.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" could be combined.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" by itself.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" by itself.\n\nAlso \"substantive due process\" (maybe separate?).\n\nAlso \"procedural due process\".\n\nAlso \"equal protection\" maybe appears? Not sure.\n\nAlso \"The Florida Constitution\" appears.\n\nAlso \"The United States Constitution\" maybe we should not include generic.\n\nAlso \"First Amendment rights\" is used.\n\nAlso \"Fourth Amendment rights\".\n\nAlso \"Fourteenth Amendment rights\".\n\nAlso \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\" but we can capture \"substantive due process rights\".\n\nBetter to capture distinct items: \n- 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 (a combined reference)\n- First Amendment\n- Fourth Amendment\n- Fourteenth Amendment\n- Florida Constitution\n- substantive due process\n- procedural due process\n\nAlso maybe \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\" is similar but not new.\n\nAlso \"constitutional rights to free speech\" but that's not a statute.\n\nAlso \"constitutional rights to freedom of expression\" but again.\n\nWe need to extract each distinct value with evidence. So we should append each entry.\n\nWe need to search again to get evidence. We can use search_document_regex with pattern containing these terms. But we need evidence snippet. We can search for each pattern separately or combined. Let's do one search for pattern: \"(?i)(42 U\\.S\\.C\\. §§? 1983|42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1988|42 U\\.S\\.C\\. §§? 1983 and 1988|First Amendment|Fourth Amendment|Fourteenth Amendment|Florida Constitution|substantive due process|procedural due process)\". That should capture all. We can get matches across documents. Then we can parse the results for distinct values. But we need to extract from the text. We will likely get many matches; we need to deduplicate.\n\nAlternatively, we could read the documents partially to capture each distinct phrase. We already have matches for each. Maybe we can use search_document_regex to get all matches, then manually dedupe.\n\nThus next action: `search_document_regex` with pattern above.\n\nLet's choose that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)(42 U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. §§? 1983|42 U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. § 1988|42 U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. §§? 1983 and 1988|First Amendment|Fourth Amendment|Fourteenth Amendment|Florida Constitution|substantive due process|procedural due process)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)(42 U\\.S\\.C\\. §§? 1983|42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1988|42 U\\.S\\.C\\. §§? 1983 and 1988|First Amendment|Fourth Amendment|Fourteenth Amendment|Florida Constitution|substantive due process|procedural due process)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 22298, "completion_tokens": 926, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The documents have many matches. We need to gather all distinct values. They include:\n\nFrom complaint: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\", \"First Amendment\", \"Fourth Amendment\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\", \"Florida Constitution\". Also maybe \"substantive due process\" and \"procedural due process\" etc. Also mention \"substantive due process\" in the Order Granting. Also \"substantive due process\" appears in the Order. We should produce separate entries for each distinct basis. Ensure each unique value: 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Florida Constitution, substantive due process, procedural due process. Might also mention \"Florida Constitution\" separately. Also \"United States Constitution\" appears but that's same as First Amendment, etc. But we should include the constitutional provisions: \"First Amendment\", \"Fourth Amendment\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\". Also \"Florida Constitution\" is a state constitution. Also statutory: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\". Also \"substantive due process\" and \"procedural due process\" are doctrines but maybe count as constitutional basis? The definition says \"substantive rights and sources of law alleged violated—the 'what' was violated—such as specific constitutional provisions or clauses (e.g., Fourteenth Amendment – Equal Protection, First Amendment – Freedom of Association, Eighth Amendment) and statutory rights\" and \"do not include cause-of-action vehicle itself (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983), remedies, or procedural doctrines\" but \"substantive due process\" is a doctrine but maybe considered a constitutional basis? It is a clause? It's a doctrine derived from due process clause. Might be considered a basis. The instruction says \"prefer clause-level detail when available; if only the amendment or statute is named, list that.\" So listing \"substantive due process\" is acceptable. Also \"procedural due process\" maybe also. But \"procedural due process\" is a procedural doctrine, but still a constitutional basis? The instruction says \"do not include purely procedural doctrines\" e.g., Rule 23, Ex parte Young. So \"procedural due process\" might be excluded? It's a procedural due process clause, but it's a clause-level detail of the Due Process Clause. Might be considered a constitutional basis. Hard to say. But for safety, include \"substantive due process\" and \"procedural due process\" as separate values? Might be over-inclusion. But the instruction says \"do not include purely procedural doctrines\" but procedural due process is a doctrine derived from 14th amendment. Maybe it's a constitutional basis. Many cases cite \"substantive due process\" as a basis. So include.\n\nAlso \"Florida Constitution\" is a source of law. Might also include \"Florida Constitution\" but that's a state constitution. It's a source. So list.\n\nThus we need to produce entries.\n\nWe must get evidence for each. We have matches from complaint, first amended complaint, etc. We need to gather evidence. We should read some segments to get passages containing each basis. Since we already saw matches with context tokens. We can use search_document_regex to get matches. But we need to provide evidence text. The search results include context. We can use those. But we should read a bit to confirm. We might use read_document to get specific excerpt. But the search results already show snippet. We need to ensure we cite the evidence with text, source_document, location. That can be the snippet plus doc name. We can use the snippet as text. It's from search results. That is acceptable.\n\nThus we can call search_document_regex for each basis? We can search for pattern that matches all relevant terms and collect matches. But we need distinct values. We might choose to search for each term individually or collectively. But we need to gather evidence for each. The search results we saw earlier have multiple matches. We can use that. But we should confirm coverage. The search result includes context from each match. We can extract distinct values: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" appears in complaint. \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" alone appears maybe in other docs. \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears. The \"and 1988\" is part of same phrase. Might be considered one basis: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\". Also \"First Amendment\" appears. \"Fourth Amendment\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\", \"Florida Constitution\", \"substantive due process\", \"procedural due process\". Also \"substantive due process rights\" appears. \"procedural due process rights\". Also \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\" appears. So we should capture that phrase: \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\". But that's the basis: \"substantive due process\" under Fourteenth. We could include \"substantive due process\" as a basis. Similarly \"procedural due process\" under Fourteenth.\n\nThus entries:\n\n- 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\n- 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n- 42 U.S.C. § 1988\n- First Amendment\n- Fourth Amendment\n- Fourteenth Amendment\n- Florida Constitution\n- substantive due process\n- procedural due process\n\nBut the instruction says \"Prefer clause-level detail when available; if only the amendment or statute is named, list that.\" For \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" that's clause-level. For \"First Amendment\" that is amendment-level. For \"substantive due process\" is a doctrine. Maybe okay. For \"procedural due process\" also okay. We might also include \"substantive due process rights\" but that's same.\n\nBetter group: The basis is \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\", \"First Amendment\", \"Fourth Amendment\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\", \"Florida Constitution\", \"substantive due process\", \"procedural due process\". That's 8 entries.\n\nBut we might also capture \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" as a single entry. But that covers both statutes. But we also have separate references to each individually. But we can use the combined phrase to reflect both. The requirement: \"Extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if both statutes are mentioned together, that's a distinct value: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\". If individually referenced, that's also distinct value. But the same content appears in multiple docs. But we should not duplicate. We need unique values. So consider distinct basis: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\", \"First Amendment\", \"Fourth Amendment\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\", \"Florida Constitution\", \"substantive due process\", \"procedural due process\". \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" alone maybe not separately. But I think it's part of the combined phrase. We'll include combined.\n\nThus 7 entries.\n\nNow we need evidence for each. We have snippet from complaint: match 2 shows \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Florida Constitution\". That covers several. Also match 3 shows \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment\". We need evidence for each basis. We can use that snippet.\n\nFor \"First Amendment\" we could use snippet 2. For \"Fourth Amendment\" snippet 2. For \"Fourteenth Amendment\" snippet 2. For \"Florida Constitution\" snippet 2. For \"substantive due process\" we need snippet from order granting: match 1 shows \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\". For \"procedural due process\" match 3 shows \"procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\".\n\nThus we have evidence for each.\n\nNow we need to call append_checklist to add entries.\n\nWe need to produce a single function call. We'll patch key \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\" with extracted array of entries.\n\nEach entry: value string, evidence array with one evidence object: text snippet, source_document name, location.\n\nWe need to provide location: could be page number or token range. For snippet from complaint, we have tokens 386-586, but we can use page 2. For snippet from order granting, we have tokens 2459-2901, we can say page 2? Actually order granting is longer. We can list page number from snippet. For match 1 of order granting, context tokens 2459-2901, that is page? The order granting has 21,306 tokens. We could approximate location as page 2? But better to use token range.\n\nWe can set location as \"tokens 386-586 (Complaint)\". Similarly for others.\n\nBetter to provide location as token range.\n\nThus for each entry:\n\n- value: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\"\n  evidence: text snippet from complaint, source_document: \"Complaint\", location: \"tokens 386-586\"\n\n- value: \"First Amendment\"\n  evidence: same snippet or separate snippet. We can reuse same snippet. location: \"tokens 386-586 (Complaint)\"\n\n- value: \"Fourth Amendment\"\n  evidence: same snippet.\n\n- value: \"Fourteenth Amendment\"\n  evidence: same snippet.\n\n- value: \"Florida Constitution\"\n  evidence: same snippet.\n\n- value: \"substantive due process\"\n  evidence: snippet from order granting match 1: \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\". location: \"tokens 2459-2901 (Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss)\"\n\n- value: \"procedural due process\"\n  evidence: snippet from order granting match 3: \"procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\". location: \"tokens 2690-2890 (Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss)\"\n\nWe need to check that the evidence text is verbatim snippet. For each snippet we need to copy exact text. Let's copy from the search results.\n\nFrom complaint match 2 snippet:\n\n```\nthe claims asserted herein arise pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and \n1988,  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  Fourth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution, and the Constitution and laws of the State of \nFlorida. This Court\n```\n\nThat's the snippet. We'll use that.\n\nFrom order granting match 1 snippet:\n\n```\na § 1983 claim against all Defendants for violation of her First Amendment rights (Count I); a § 1983 claim against  the  City  for  violation  of  her  substantive  due  process  rights  under  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment (Count II); a § 1983 claim against the City for violation of her Fourth \nAmendment rights (Count III);\n```\n\nBut that includes \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\". We'll use that.\n\nFrom order granting match 3 snippet:\n\n```\na § 1983 claim against all Defendants for violation of her procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment (Count X). \n```\n\nWe'll use that.\n\nNow we need to produce the function call.\n\nWe should call append_checklist with patch array containing key and extracted array with these entries.\n\nLet's craft JSON.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"the claims asserted herein arise pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988,  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the Constitution and laws of the State of Florida.

Need to check if any more bases exist. Likely other documents contain additional constitutional bases: maybe \"substantive due process\" captured, \"procedural due process\" captured. Also maybe \"Florida Constitution\" captured. We also have First Amendment, Fourth, Fourteenth, 42 U.S.C §§1983 and 1988. We should check if any other bases like \"equal protection\" present? In documents maybe mention \"equal protection clause\" but not sure. Also maybe \"substantive due process\" and \"procedural due process\" captured. Also maybe \"Florida Constitution\" captured. Also maybe \"First Amendment\" captured twice; but we should dedupe.

Are there any other like \"sustained due process\" etc. \"Equal protection\" maybe present? Search in documents: earlier matches didn't show equal protection. But maybe in some other matches not captured. Also \"substantive due process\" we captured. Also \"procedural due process\". Maybe \"substantive due process rights\" is same as \"substantive due process\". Good.\n\nCheck if any \"Florida Constitution\" appears again elsewhere; but duplicate not needed.\n\nWe should ensure each value has evidence. We have evidence for each from Complaint or Order. But might need separate evidence for each, but can use same evidence. Ensure evidence includes text snippet, source_document, location.

The checklist item: Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case. We collected 7 values: 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Florida Constitution, substantive due process, procedural due process. Are there any other basis in documents? Might include 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alone? But we have 1983 and 1988; 1983 alone is mentioned maybe in other parts. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" individually. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" individually. But we have combined. The requirement: distinct values; each distinct basis. We should list each distinct clause or statute. Might need to separate 1983 and 1988 separately. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears separately. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\". Also \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" maybe is one value or two? They said list each distinct basis as separate value. So maybe separate 1983 and 1988. Also \"First Amendment to the United States Constitution\" is basis. \"Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution\". \"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\". \"Florida Constitution\". \"Substantive due process\" is a clause of Fourteenth Amendment. But they might want \"substantive due process\" as separate value. \"Procedural due process\" separate. Also maybe \"4th Amendment\" counts separately. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" maybe separate.\n\nThus total maybe 10 values. Need to check if any other mention: \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears separately. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 1988\" is combined; but we should separate.\n\nAlso may need \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in complaint. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in order. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" maybe repeated. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" maybe repeated.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in the order. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in complaint. So we should include value \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". Similarly \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\". Also \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" could be considered separate but they asked to prefer clause-level detail; if only the amendment or statute is named, list that. So \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" are separate. Combined might not be needed. So we should include separate values.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears as \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\". But we can note separate.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears alone. The text shows \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\". But maybe also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" alone? In the text we saw \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" in some places. Let's check the search results for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" alone. But we didn't search that. We can search again: search pattern \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" maybe. We'll use search_document_regex.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for pattern \"(?i)42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1983\" and maybe \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1988\" separately. And also maybe \"substantive due process\" etc already captured. But we need to capture separate values for 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1988. We should also capture \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" alone if present. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" alone.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in order. So we need evidence from that.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears in order.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in complaint.\n\nThus we need to append these separate values.\n\nAlso check if \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in any other doc. We might search.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex across all docs for \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1983\" and \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1988\". Also maybe \"42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1983\" alone. But we can combine pattern: \"(?i)42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1983\" and \"(?i)42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1988\".\n\nLet's do a search.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n  \"pattern\": \"(?i)42 U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. § 1983|42 U\\\\.S\\\\.C\\\\. § 1988\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 5,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1983|42 U\\.S\\.C\\. § 1988", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 23132, "completion_tokens": 1185, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Already extracted 7 values: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\", \"First Amendment\", \"Fourth Amendment\", \"Fourteenth Amendment\", \"Florida Constitution\", \"substantive due process\", \"procedural due process\". Are there any other bases? The complaint includes maybe \"substantive due process\" and \"procedural due process\" already. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is part of 1983 and 1988; but we captured combined. Might need separate 1983 and 1988 separately? The requirement: \"Prefer clause-level detail; if only the amendment or statute is named, list that.\" The complaint says \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\". That is two statutes. We captured combined but maybe should separate into two entries: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\". But we captured as combined string \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\". The requirement: each distinct value. The phrase \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" is a single phrase, but could be considered two distinct statutes. In practice, we might list each separately. But the text shows \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" as a single clause. There's no separate mention of just 1983 or 1988 alone. But we could separate them. But to be safe, maybe keep combined. But the request: \"Prefer clause-level detail when available; if only the amendment or statute is named, list that.\" The clause-level detail includes \"§ 1983\" and \"§ 1988\" as distinct. So we should extract both separately. But if the text lists them together, we might still treat as two values. But we need to be consistent.\n\nAlso other bases: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears separately in Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss (line 4210). That also includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". But we already have 1983. However we might need to capture \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" separately as a distinct value. But the combined value \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" is a distinct value but we also might want to list \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" as a separate value. The requirement says \"extract EACH distinct basis\". So if the documents mention \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" separately or \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" we might treat them as distinct. In our extraction we have 1983 and 1988 combined. But we might want to extract individually.\n\nAlso \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" maybe appears separately in the complaint. Let's search for \"1988\" specifically in documents.\n\nWe saw in Complaint tokens 386-586: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\". So we need both. In the Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss, we saw \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" at tokens 4210-4410. We might also have \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" somewhere else. Let's search again.\n\nBut we can do a targeted search for \"42 U.S.C\\\\. § 1988\" across all documents.\n\nAlso check if \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in other documents besides those. There's \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" in Complaint as part of combined. But we can extract separate.\n\nAlso \"substantive due process\" appears in Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss. Also \"procedural due process\" appears. In the complaint, maybe \"substantive due process\" not listed. But other documents may mention \"substantive due process\" again. But we have those.\n\nAlso \"First Amendment\" appears multiple times. Already extracted.\n\nAlso \"Fourth Amendment\" extracted.\n\nAlso \"Fourteenth Amendment\" extracted.\n\nAlso \"Florida Constitution\" extracted.\n\nAlso any other constitutional basis? The complaint also mentions \"United States Constitution\" but that's generic and not clause-level. The requirement: do not include cause-of-action vehicle itself, but include substantive rights. \"United States Constitution\" is generic, but we probably need clause-level. So we might not include.\n\nAlso \"Florida Constitution\" is included.\n\nAlso \"substantive due process\" and \"procedural due process\" are included.\n\nAny statutory basis besides 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 1988? The complaint also mentions \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" maybe. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears. Also maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in Order Granting. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" likely appears only in Complaint. So we need to capture those separately.\n\nAlso maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" might also appear in Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment? Let's search.\n\nBut we can do a targeted search.\n\nGiven that we already appended 7 values, we need to ensure completeness. We should probably add entries for 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1988 separately, unless combined is acceptable. But the requirement: \"Prefer clause-level detail when available; if only the amendment or statute is named, list that.\" The clause-level detail includes the specific §. So we should list each separately. So we need to update the checklist to replace combined entry with two separate entries.\n\nAlso we need to check if there are any other statutory bases: maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" is cited separately. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is cited separately. Also any other statutes like \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" might be used. Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in Order Granting. There might also be \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" in the Order on Cross Motions? No.\n\nWe should search for \"1988\". Use search_document_regex.\n\nAlso check for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" specifically. But we already have that.\n\nAlso check for \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" specifically. Let's search.\n\nAlso check for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" again. But we can just update checklist.\n\nWe should also ensure not to duplicate entries. The checklist currently has values: we saw \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" as one value. We should replace that with two separate entries. Also we need to keep other values.\n\nWe need to use update_checklist to replace the entire list? We have 7 values currently. But we want to modify to separate 1983 and 1988. So we need to replace the entire list with updated entries.\n\nAlternatively, we could append new entries for 1983 and 1988 and then delete the combined entry. But we can't delete. We can update entire key.\n\nThus we will use update_checklist for key \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\" with new extracted list.\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each entry. We already have evidence for combined entry. For separate entries, we can use evidence from same text.\n\nWe should use the same evidence snippet from the Complaint tokens 386-586 (the jurisdiction section). That snippet includes \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\". But we need separate evidence for each.\n\nThus we will create extracted values:\n\n- \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" with evidence from Complaint snippet tokens 386-586. Use snippet: \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\". We can include that snippet but we might want to include just the portion referencing 1983. We can include the entire snippet but note that it includes both. It's acceptable.\n\n- \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" with same evidence.\n\n- \"First Amendment\" with evidence from Complaint snippet.\n\n- \"Fourth Amendment\" evidence.\n\n- \"Fourteenth Amendment\" evidence.\n\n- \"Florida Constitution\" evidence.\n\n- \"substantive due process\" evidence from Order Granting.\n\n- \"procedural due process\" evidence from Order Granting.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each.\n\nWe also need to list token offsets? The evidence require \"source_document\" and \"location\". We can provide location as page number or token range.\n\nWe have snippet tokens 386-586 for the Complaint. We can say location: \"Complaint, page 2\" or token range. Use token range 386-586.\n\nFor substantive due process, evidence from Order Granting tokens 2459-2901. Location: \"Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss, page 3\" or token range.\n\nSimilarly for procedural due process from Order Granting tokens 2690-2890.\n\nWe need to confirm that we have evidence for all.\n\nThus, we will call update_checklist with patch containing key and extracted array with 8 entries (we had 7, now 8). Actually we had 7, now we add two separate entries for 1983 and 1988, so 8 entries.\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each. We have evidence for 1983 and 1988 from same snippet. For others, we have evidence.\n\nThus final action: update_checklist.\n\nWe should include all entries.\n\nLet's construct the JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary

But need to ensure all distinct values are captured. Let's review checklist items: Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case. We have 8 values: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, § 1988, First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Florida Constitution, substantive due process, procedural due process. Are there any more? Possibly the \"Second Amendment\"? No. \"Eighth Amendment\"? Not mentioned. \"Americans with Disabilities Act\"? Not mentioned. \"Rehab Act § 504\"? Not mentioned. \"Title II\"? Not mentioned. \"Civil Rights Act\"? Not mentioned. So likely 8 values are all distinct.\n\nBut check if \"42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 1988\" should be separate as two values: we have split them. Good.\n\nAlso, maybe \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" is a single clause? The instruction: prefer clause-level detail. So separate.\n\nAlso, \"substantive due process\" and \"procedural due process\" extracted. Are there any other due process? Not.\n\nCheck if \"Equal protection\" appears? Not captured. Not present.\n\nCheck if \"Florida Constitution\" appears as \"Florida Constitution\" but maybe also \"Florida Constitution\" clause? Already captured.\n\nCheck if \"United States Constitution\" itself? Not part of basis? The instruction says not include cause-of-action vehicle itself. The \"United States Constitution\" is the source of the amendments, but we capture the amendments. So fine.\n\nBut maybe there is \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears separately; we have.\n\nCheck if \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears again elsewhere. Already captured. Maybe also \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" not captured? We have. Good.\n\nCheck if \"First Amendment\" appears multiple times but we just need distinct values. Good.\n\nCheck if \"Fourth Amendment\" appears. Yes.\n\nCheck if \"Fourteenth Amendment\" appears. Yes.\n\nCheck if \"substantive due process\" appears. Yes.\n\nCheck if \"procedural due process\" appears. Yes.\n\nCheck if \"Florida Constitution\" appears. Yes.\n\nDouble-check if \"42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 1988\" appears as a combined clause in some document; we split, but the combined might be considered a single basis? But instruction says prefer clause-level detail. So splitting is fine.\n\nNow, check if \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears separately? In Complaint, yes. Good.\n\nNow, ensure we didn't miss any basis in other documents: maybe the Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment contains \"First Amendment\" or \"substantive due process\"? It may mention \"First Amendment\" again. But we already captured that value. No new distinct.\n\nCheck if \"substantive due process\" appears again elsewhere. Already captured.\n\nCheck if \"procedural due process\" appears elsewhere. Already captured.\n\nCheck if \"Fourth Amendment\" appears again. Already captured.\n\nCheck if \"Florida Constitution\" appears elsewhere. Already captured.\n\nCheck if \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears elsewhere. Already captured.\n\nThus likely complete.\n\nBut we must ensure we didn't miss \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" from the first amended complaint? Already captured.\n\nNow, check if there's \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" also appear in other documents. But still same.\n\nNow, check if \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" is repeated as \"42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988\" but that is same. So no new.\n\nNow, we should confirm that \"Florida Constitution\" is indeed separate. Yes.\n\nNow, we must also ensure that we have evidence for each. We have evidence list from Complaint tokens 386-586 for each of first 6 values, and evidence from Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss for due process values. But the evidence for \"substantive due process\" is from tokens 2459-2901 in Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss. Good. For \"procedural due process\" from tokens 2690-2890. Good.\n\nNow, we need to check whether we need to include any other values like \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" - we have.\n\nNow, next step: ensure that the checklist key is fully extracted. The key currently has 8 values. Are there any more distinct values? Let's search for \"Fourth Amendment\" again. Already captured.\n\nBut maybe there is \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" but we have.\n\nNow, check for \"First Amendment\" again but we have.\n\nThus probably complete.\n\nBut we need to double-check for any mention of \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" specifically in other documents. Already captured.\n\nNow, check for any reference to \"Substantive due process\" maybe with \"substantive due process\" phrase appears elsewhere. Already captured.\n\nNow, check for \"procedural due process\". Already captured.\n\nNow, check for \"Florida Constitution\" again. Already captured.\n\nNow, check for \"Florida Constitution\" maybe appears as \"the Constitution and laws of the State of Florida\". But that includes \"Florida Constitution\". So it's fine.\n\nNow, check if \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears only once. That is fine.\n\nNow, check if \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears. Yes.\n\nNow, check if \"42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 1988\" appears. Already captured.\n\nThus likely complete.\n\nBut let's verify if \"substantive due process\" and \"procedural due process\" are indeed distinct values. Yes.\n\nNow, check if \"Florida Constitution\" appears as \"Florida Constitution\" or \"Florida Constitution\" phrase. Yes.\n\nPotentially also \"Fourth Amendment\" appears as \"Fourth Amendment\". Yes.\n\nNow, any mention of \"Civil Rights Act\"? Not found. So ignore.\n\nNow, we might need to check if \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" appears in any other documents with a different context that might change extraction. But still same value.\n\nThus, we can stop.\n\nBut before stopping, ensure that all values are indeed collected: 8. The key has 8 values. That seems probably complete.\n\nHowever, we should also check if there's any mention of \"substantive due process\" with \"substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\" maybe appears in another document like Order on Cross Motions. But we already captured.\n\nNow, we should return stop.\n\nBut we must ensure we haven't missed any distinct basis like \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" appears separately. Yes.\n\nCheck if \"Florida Constitution\" appears as \"Florida Constitution\" in other docs. Yes.\n\nThus, final.\n\nBut let's confirm that no other basis like \"Eighth Amendment\" appears. In the search results, there was no mention of Eighth Amendment.\n\nThus final stop.\n\nWe should respond with JSON: {\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All statutory or constitutional basis values extracted with evidence\"}<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All statutory or constitutional basis values have been extracted with supporting evidence.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All statutory or constitutional basis values have been extracted with supporting evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 16729, "completion_tokens": 1532, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Did we miss \"Americans with Disabilities Act\", \"Rehab Act § 504\", \"Title II\", \"Civil Rights Act\", \"Title VII\", \"Title IX\"? The earlier search looked for those patterns but maybe not found. But we need to confirm: the documents might not mention ADA or others. But we need to check if any other statutes appear as basis. Let's search again maybe with \"ADA\", \"Americans with Disabilities Act\", \"Rehab Act § 504\", \"Title II\", \"Civil Rights Act\", \"Title VII\", \"Title IX\". We should search across all documents. The documents list includes 9: Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, Third Amended Complaint, Order Granting in Part Motions to Dismiss, Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment, Docket, Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants, Mediation Report.\n\nWe have partial views of many.
