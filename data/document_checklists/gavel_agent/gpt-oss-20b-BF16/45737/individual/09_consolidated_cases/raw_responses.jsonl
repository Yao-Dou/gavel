Let's inspect them: Docket had a match at tokens 15506-15706 with \"NOTICE of Filing in Support of Defendants Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement\". That's a consolidated motion. The order had \"Non-Ramos Defendants' Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment\". There might be other documents that mention consolidated cases.

We have seen some consolidated motion mentions. Need \"Any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s), including identifying information.\" So we need to list each distinct consolidated case.

Also \"Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgment by LaToya Ratlieff\". Also \"Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, Maglione, Greenlaw, MacDoughall, by City of Fort Lauderdale, etc.\" Also \"Non-Ramos Defendants' Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment\". So need to extract case numbers? The docket shows case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR. Might be the consolidated case? Also see ECF numbers: 160, 159, 146, 160. But we need distinct values of consolidated cases. The documents might mention case numbers like \"0:22-cv-61029-RAR\". That is a case number. Might also have \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" repeated. So we need to extract these. Possibly also \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" appears in order docs. That is likely the consolidated case. So we need to provide entries:\n\n- \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\" - evidence from Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment page header.\n\nAlso \"Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgment by City of Fort Lauderdale...\" indicates consolidated motion but not case number. But we can extract the phrase \"Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgment\" as a consolidated case. But the requirement: \"Any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s), including identifying information.\" So we should capture each consolidated case mention. We have multiple consolidated motions with \"Consolidated 160\" etc. But they all refer to same case? Possibly each is a part of the consolidated. But we should list distinct consolidated cases: maybe only one case number, but multiple motions. But the requirement is \"any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s), including identifying information.\" So we only need to extract the consolidated case identification. That is likely the case number. So we need to extract \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR\". Also maybe \"ECF No. 160\" indicates the consolidated motion. But that's not case id. I'd extract the case number.\n\nThus we need to read the Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment doc around the header where case number appears. We have a snippet in step 6 match 1 tokens 123-623 shows \"Case 0:22-cv-61029-RAR Document 178 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/04/2024 Page 2 of 107\". So we can read that portion to capture the case number.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment, tokens maybe 100-200? Already have snippet. We can read tokens 100-200 to capture case number. Then append_checklist with that value.

The Docket has a \"NOTICE of Filing in Support of Defendants Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich, Avery Figueras, Steve Greenlaw, Douglas MacDoughall, Rick maglione\". That indicates a consolidated motion. We need to capture the consolidated case name, e.g., \"Defendants Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement\" with parties.\n\nAlso in Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment: \"the remaining Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment (“Non-Ramos MSJ”)\" indicates a consolidated MSJ. Also earlier \"Ratlieff’s Partial Motion for Summary Judgment (“Ratlieff PMSJ”), [ECF No. 159]; Defendant Officer Eliezer Ramos’s Motion for Summary Judgment (“Ramos MSJ”), [ECF No. 146]; and the remaining Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment (“Non-Ramos MSJ”)\".

Also \"Defendants Consolidated 160\" as a motion.\n\nThere might be other consolidation references in other documents. We have not searched Complaint documents. Probably there are consolidation references in the Complaint. We should search for \"Consolidated\" in Complaint etc. Use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Consolidated\" or \"consolidated\" with context. The earlier search returned 4 matches across Docket and Order. It didn't capture Complaint likely because not searched? It was all docs, but maybe not in the snippet. The earlier search had 4 total matches: Docket (3 matches), Order (1 match). That means no matches in Complaint docs. But maybe the pattern didn't capture due to capitalization? They used \"Consolidated\" pattern. Could be \"consolidated\" lowercase. Search again with regex pattern \"consolidated\" case-insensitive? Use flags IGNORECASE.

But maybe we need separate values: one is the consolidated MSJ by Defendants, the other is the consolidated MSJ for Non-Ramos defendants. Let's inspect Docket snippet: has \"NOTICE of Filing in Support of Defendants Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich, Avery Figueras, Steve Greenlaw, Douglas MacDoughall, Rick maglione\". That's one value. Also Order On Cross Motions for Summary Judgment has \"remaining Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment\". That's another. Also there is \"Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, Maglione, Greenlaw, MacDoughall, by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich\". That's from Docket match 2 maybe. But that might be same as earlier? It's the same group. But we want distinct values of consolidated case notes. Likely each separate consolidated motion. So we capture at least two: 1) Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement by City of Fort Lauderdale and defendants list. 2) Non-Ramos Defendants’ Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment. Also maybe Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, etc. But that's same group? Actually the second snippet says \"Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, Maglione, Greenlaw, MacDoughall, by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich\".

Also docket entry 174 \"Statement of: Reply ... in support of Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, Maglione, Greenlaw, MacDoughall, by City of Fort Lauderdale\". Probably also docket entry 169?

Also \"Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich, Avery Figueras, Steve Greenlaw, Douglas MacDoughall, Rick maglione\".\n\nWe need to extract unique values. We could use search_document_regex for \"Consolidated\" again but we already did. But maybe need to read more around the earlier docket entries for more consolidated motions. Also we might need to read the actual docket entries for the Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment by LaToya Ratlieff (maybe separate). The search results show many entries, but we need to capture each distinct consolidated case. For each, we need evidence snippet, document name, location.\n\nWe should read more of the Docket around token ranges 15500-15800 we already read. We might also need to read earlier tokens around 15400-15600? We saw the match 155 2024-01-12. That includes Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement by City of Fort Lauderdale etc. That is a consolidated case. Also there might be other consolidated entries later. We might need to read further tokens after 15856? We have coverage 15356-15856, 17900-18560. We might need to read more between 15856 and 17900. Also read earlier before 15356? Maybe earlier consolidated entries exist. But we can search again for \"Consolidated\" in Docket to get more matches. Since we already did search, but maybe we didn't search with IGNORECASE? But the key might be \"Consolidated\" with capital C. We saw 4 matches earlier. That might cover all Consolidated entries. But those matches include some lines. We need to capture each distinct consolidated case.\n\nLet's examine the matches:\n\nMatch 1 (tokens 15506-15706): includes \"NOTICE of Filing in Support of Defendants Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich, Avery Figueras, Steve Greenlaw, Douglas MacDoughall, Rick maglione\"\n\nSo one consolidated case: Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgment by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich, Avery Figueras, Steve Greenlaw, Douglas MacDoughall, Rick Maglione.\n\nMatch 2 (tokens 18052-18252): includes \"Statement of: Response to Defendants City of Fort Lauderdale, Paul Cristafaro, Steven Greenlaw, Robert Dietrich, Douglas MacDoughall, Avery Figueras and Rick Maglione's Statement of Material Facts in Support of their Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment by LaToya Ratlieff\".\n\nSo second consolidated case: Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment by LaToya Ratlieff (supporting the same parties). Might be same as earlier but new. But distinct.\n\nMatch 3 (tokens 18210-18410): includes \"Statement of: Reply Statement of Facts in support of Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, Maglione, Greenlaw, MacDoughall, by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich\". So third consolidated case: Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, Maglione, Greenlaw, MacDoughall, by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich.\n\nAlso earlier in the order on cross motions, we saw mention of \"Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment\" for Non-Ramos Defendants. That is a consolidated case too. The snippet: \"the remaining Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment (“Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment”?)\" Actually the snippet shows: \"the remaining Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment (“Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment”)\". The text is truncated. We need to capture that. The snippet shows \"the remaining Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment (“Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment”?)\". The snippet includes \"Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment\" as a distinct case.\n\nAlso there might be a Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment by LaToya Ratlieff? That appears in docket matches. But also the order might have similar mention. But we already captured.\n\nThus we have at least 4 distinct consolidated cases. We need to extract them with evidence.\n\nWe need to use append_checklist with key \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" and list each distinct value with evidence.\n\nWe should provide evidence snippets that include the case name. For each, include source_document, location.\n\nLocations: For Docket entries, we can give token range or maybe page number? We have token ranges of matches. Use token offsets. For Order on Cross Motions, we saw match tokens 273-473. Use that.\n\nThus we need to call append_checklist.\n\nBut we must ensure we didn't miss any other consolidated cases. We could search again for \"Consolidated\" ignoring case, but we already saw all matches. But there might be \"consolidated\" lowercase earlier? We might search again with pattern \"consolidated\" ignoring case. But maybe the matches we saw include all. But to be safe, we could search again for \"consolidated\" in Docket and Order to ensure no other. But we can probably proceed with these four.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values. We'll create 4 entries.\n\nLet's formulate append_checklist.\n\nWe need to provide evidence arrays. For each value, evidence includes text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nLet's extract from the match snippets we have.\n\nMatch 1 snippet: \n```\n2024-01-12 | NOTICE of Filing in Support of Defendants Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich, Avery Figueras, Steve Greenlaw, Douglas MacDoughall, Rick maglione\n```\nWe can use that as text.\n\nLocation: Docket, tokens 15506-15706.\n\nMatch 2 snippet:\n```\nStatement of: Response to Defendants City of Fort Lauderdale, Paul Cristafaro, Steven Greenlaw, Robert Dietrich, Douglas MacDoughall, Avery Figueras and Rick Maglione's Statement of Material Facts in Support of their Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment by LaToya Ratlieff\n```\nLocation: Docket, tokens 18052-18252.\n\nMatch 3 snippet:\n```\nStatement of: Reply Statement of Facts in support of Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, Maglione, Greenlaw, MacDoughall, by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich\n```\nLocation: Docket, tokens 18210-18410.\n\nOrder on Cross Motions snippet:\n```\nthe remaining Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment (“Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment”?)\n```\nLocation: Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment, tokens 273-473.\n\nWe need to extract distinct values: Let's list them:\n\n1. \"Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich, Avery Figueras, Steve Greenlaw, Douglas MacDoughall, Rick maglione\"\n2. \"Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment by LaToya Ratlieff (supporting the same parties)\". Provide full phrase: \"Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment by LaToya Ratlieff\". In snippet, the phrase includes \"Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment by LaToya Ratlieff\".\n3. \"Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, Maglione, Greenlaw, MacDoughall, by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich\". The phrase includes \"Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, Maglione, Greenlaw, MacDoughall, by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich\".\n4. \"Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment\". Use phrase: \"Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment\".\n\nWe should ensure uniqueness. Might be overlapping parties but considered distinct case names.\n\nWe should provide evidence.\n\nThus we will call append_checklist.\n\nWe must ensure we don't include duplicate entries. We'll create patch with key \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" and extracted array with 4 entries.\n\nLet's prepare JSON.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich, Avery Figueras, Steve Greenlaw, Douglas MacDoughall, Rick maglione\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"2024-01-12 | NOTICE of Filing in Support of Defendants Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich, Avery Figueras, Steve Greenlaw, Douglas MacDoughall, Rick maglione\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 15506-15706\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment by LaToya Ratlieff\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Statement of: Response to Defendants City of Fort Lauderdale, Paul Cristafaro, Steven Greenlaw, Robert Dietrich, Douglas MacDoughall, Avery Figueras and Rick Maglione's Statement of Material Facts in Support of their Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment by LaToya Ratlieff\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 18052-18252\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, Maglione, Greenlaw, MacDoughall, by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Statement of: Reply Statement of Facts in support of Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, Maglione, Greenlaw, MacDoughall, by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 18210-18410\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"the remaining Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment (“Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment”?)\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 273-473\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Consolidated_Cases_Noted", "extracted": [{"value": "Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich, Avery Figueras, Steve Greenlaw, Douglas MacDoughall, Rick maglione", "evidence": [{"text": "2024-01-12 | NOTICE of Filing in Support of Defendants Consolidated 160 Motion for Summary Judgement by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich, Avery Figueras, Steve Greenlaw, Douglas MacDoughall, Rick maglione", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 15506-15706"}]}, {"value": "Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment by LaToya Ratlieff", "evidence": [{"text": "Statement of: Response to Defendants City of Fort Lauderdale, Paul Cristafaro, Steven Greenlaw, Robert Dietrich, Douglas MacDoughall, Avery Figueras and Rick Maglione's Statement of Material Facts in Support of their Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment by LaToya Ratlieff", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 18052-18252"}]}, {"value": "Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, Maglione, Greenlaw, MacDoughall, by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich", "evidence": [{"text": "Statement of: Reply Statement of Facts in support of Consolidated MSJ by Figueras, Maglione, Greenlaw, MacDoughall, by City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paul Cristafaro, Robert Dietrich", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 18210-18410"}]}, {"value": "Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment", "evidence": [{"text": "the remaining Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment (“Non-Ramos Defendants’1 Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment”?)", "source_document": "Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment", "location": "tokens 273-473"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5685, "completion_tokens": 2569, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But there could be consolidated references in complaints (e.g., \"Consolidated Complaint\" or \"Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment\"). Let's search for \"Consolidated\" again but maybe we missed due to token boundaries? But we saw 4 matches across documents; maybe the search limited to 5 matches per doc. But we might want to search for \"Consolidated\" again to confirm no more matches. But also \"consolidated\" lowercase. The earlier search may have found only 4 matches.
