But we might have more judges? Need to check all documents for \"Judge\" names. We saw two in Docket. There might be other documents with judge names. Let's search all documents for \"Judge \" pattern again. But we already did pattern \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)\". That found 3 matches across documents. Only Docket had 2 matches. The other match was in Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment but that text didn't contain a judge name; it was just \"judge\" in lowercase. That may not be a judge name. So likely only two judge names. But we should verify if there are any other judge names in other documents (Complaint, Amended Complaints, Judgment, Order Granting in Part, Mediation Report). It's possible there are not. But to be thorough, we might search for \"Judge\" again but maybe with different patterns: like \"Judge\" followed by uppercase letter or \"U.S. Magistrate Judge\". But we might want to search for \"Magistrate Judge\". But we already have that. Maybe \"Judge\" appears in other documents as part of the judge's name. But we should search across all documents to confirm. Use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\"? Or use pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" with optional middle name or suffix. But we already captured those. There might be \"Judge\" as part of a title like \"Judge\" alone. But we only care about names. It's safer to search again with pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" maybe capturing \"Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz, II\" and \"Judge Jared M. Strauss\". But also maybe \"Judge\" appears in other doc like \"Judge\" with no following name? But not likely.\n\nSince we have extracted all distinct values for the key and have only two values, we might be done. But we need to ensure that we didn't miss any judge name that appears in other documents. We can do a search across all documents for \"Judge\" but maybe restrict to uppercase after Judge. The pattern used earlier might have missed \"Judge\" in the context of \"U.S. Magistrate Judge Jared M. Strauss\" because we captured that. But maybe there is \"Judge\" in \"Judge\" like \"Judge\" followed by \"Rodolfo A.\" etc. Already captured.\n\nTo be safe, we could search all documents again for \"Judge\" but maybe with \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]\" for additional names. But if we get matches in other documents, we can append. Let's do that.\n\nWe should call search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)\". But maybe we want to capture middle initials with dot. Pattern can be \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z]\\.?\\s*)?)+\". But we just need to capture names; but we can rely on earlier results. But to be thorough, we could search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]\" again. Let's do search_document_regex over all documents.\n\nGiven we already got results, but we can do again with a slightly different pattern to capture any other names. But maybe the earlier search is sufficient. But we cannot be sure that there are no other judge names in other documents. Let's attempt a broader search: \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)\" again. That has been used. But maybe there is \"Judge\" followed by \"Rodolfo A. Ruiz, II\" which we captured. And \"Judge Jared M. Strauss\". There might be \"Judge\" followed by \"U.S. Magistrate Judge\" but we captured. Could there be a \"Judge\" in the \"Final Judgment\" document? Possibly the judge's name appears there. But we haven't looked. But we can search the \"Final Judgment as to Individual Defendants\" doc for \"Judge\". But we don't have its content. We can search across all docs. Let's do search_document_regex on all docs with pattern \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)\". That should find any other names. Let's request that.\n\nAlso, we might also search for \"U.S. Magistrate Judge\" pattern to capture any names. But we already captured \"Jared M. Strauss\".\n\nWe might also search for \"Judge\" followed by something like \"Judge\" and then a name. But the pattern is fine.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern again. But we already did that earlier and got 3 total matches. But maybe we missed some due to token limits? But the earlier search returned 3 matches across documents. That might have covered all. But maybe there are more matches beyond the first 200 context tokens. But the function returns top_k per doc. Maybe we missed some. We can increase context_tokens or top_k. Let's do search_document_regex with top_k 10 and context_tokens 200 maybe. But the default is 5. However, we saw no matches in other docs.

But number of matches earlier was 3 total. There were 2 matches in Docket, 1 match in Order. The Order match didn't contain judge name. So likely only two judge names.\n\nBut the system earlier appended 2 values. So we have the key filled. Should we double-check if the docket had any other judge names beyond those two? Let's inspect the docket more fully. We saw tokens 0-300 earlier. There might be more judge names later. We need to ensure we didn't miss any. Let's search again for \"Judge\" across entire documents, maybe with more context. Use search_document_regex pattern \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)\" on all docs again.

But we captured \"Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz, II\" and \"Judge Jared M. Strauss\". Wait the second is \"U.S. Magistrate Judge Jared M. Strauss\". The regex might capture the name \"Jared M. Strauss\". So it's captured.\n\nBut maybe there's \"Judge\" in the final judgment or order granting motions. Let's search for \"Judge\" in those documents. We can search for \"Judge\" across all documents.

The instructions: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either complete or Not Applicable.\" We have one key, and we have 2 values. Are we sure that we captured all judge names? We need to check if any other judge names exist in the other documents.\n\nWe can search across all documents for \"Judge\" again to confirm. Let's do search_document_regex for pattern: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z]\" or maybe \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)\" but previously it returned 3 matches. That suggests there are only 3 matches across all docs. So likely we have all. But let's double-check by searching for \"Judge \" across all docs with a more exact pattern maybe \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)\" but we already did. We can search again for \"Judge\" with a minimal pattern \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+)\" just to see if there are other occurrences like \"Judge\" alone. But the regex could capture duplicates.\n\nBut the risk: maybe the docket also includes a judge name in the \"Clerks Notice of Judge Assignment to Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz, II.\" The \"Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz, II\" includes \"Judge\" and name. The \"U.S. Magistrate Judge Jared M. Strauss\" includes \"Judge\" and name. That's 2. The Order has no judge names.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nWe must produce JSON with decision stop.\n\nBut do we need to provide any evidence? No, the stop decision only requires JSON with decision and reason.
