We have seen docket entries with Notice of Appeal. We need to extract all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. Format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nWe have in docket matches: several Notice of Appeal entries. Already seen: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL by Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought.\" The appellate court: US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Also maybe other documents have appeals. The complaint? Not visited. But we might not need to read complaint; not necessary if we have docket entries.\n\nBut need to ensure all distinct appeals. The docket shows the same parties. Also maybe other documents mention appeal to Fourth Circuit. Search via regex likely enough. Already did search, but there may be other documents with appeals. Let's search in all documents for \"appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" or \"appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the ...\". But we could search for \"Notice of Appeal\" pattern. But we already have docket entries. Are there any other appeals like \"appeal to the Court of Appeals\" in other documents? Perhaps in other pleadings, the parties may file an appeal. But we don't know. We should search for \"appeal\" again but maybe we need to extract specific values. We already have one distinct value: \"Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But also maybe there's an appeal by the same parties to the Fourth Circuit but in another docket entry? The docket shows multiple entries: Notice of Appeal, Motion to Stay pending Appeal, etc. But all refer to the same parties and same court. So only one distinct value.\n\nBut maybe other documents like the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief may have an appeal? But it's a complaint, not an appeal. Maybe the Complaint may include a statement of appellate action? Unlikely.\n\nAlso the \"Application to Stay the Judgment\" may have mention of pending appeal to Fourth Circuit. That is a separate value? The format expects \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" The parties may be the same names? The application mentions \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" but does not list parties. So maybe we cannot fill unless parties are known. But we could still include parties from docket.\n\nWe need to be careful: For each distinct appeal, we need one entry. So we will append one entry with evidence from docket and maybe also from application to confirm.\n\nThus we need to append the extracted value.\n\nBefore appending, we need to ensure we haven't already appended any. None. So we can append.\n\nWe need to produce evidence: at least one snippet with parties and court. Use docket snippet at tokens 2268-2468 etc.\n\nWe should also include snippet from application that indicates pending appeal to Fourth Circuit. But parties not listed.\n\nBut evidence for parties are from docket. So we will include evidence with two entries? For one extracted value, we need evidence list of snippets. We can include multiple evidence items.\n\nThus we perform append_checklist with key \"Appeal\" and extracted entry.\n\nSo action: append_checklist.\n\nLet's craft JSON: patch array with key \"Appeal\" and extracted array containing one object with value and evidence list.\n\nEvidence: from docket tokens 2268-2468 snippet includes parties and mention of US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Actually snippet does not show court but the docket entry says \"NOTICE OF APPEAL by ...\". The docket may include the appellate court? The docket details: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL by ...\". The docket entry itself might not mention the court, but the docket line includes \"US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\"? In the docket snippet: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL by Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought.\" The docket context earlier had \"Transmission of Notice of Appeal and Docket Sheet to US Court of Appeals re 26 Notice of Appeal.\" That indicates the court. But that snippet may be separate. We could include \"Transmission of Notice of Appeal and Docket Sheet to US Court of Appeals re 26 Notice of Appeal.\" That confirms the court.\n\nThus evidence: two snippets.\n\nWe must provide location like \"page\" or \"section\". For docket, maybe \"Docket\" page? We'll use location \"Docket entry for Notice of Appeal, tokens 2268-2468\" and \"Docket entry for Transmission of Notice of Appeal to US Court of Appeals, tokens 2380-2580\" etc.\n\nSo produce JSON.\n\nLet's produce:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Appeal\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A.

But we need to extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So we need to find all appeals. Likely there are other appeals in other documents: e.g., in the Application to Stay the Judgment ... there may be \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That is an appeal. Also, the Docket shows multiple appeals by same parties. Also maybe in other documents: e.g., maybe a notice of appeal in Opposition to Applicants' Request for an Administrative Stay? Let's search.\n\nWe should search documents for \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"appeal to\" etc. But we already saw search results for \"appeal\" across all docs; 55 matches. But we didn't exhaust all. We need to identify distinct appeals: each unique combination of parties and appellate court. We have one: parties: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought; court: U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n\nBut other documents may have other appeals: e.g., the \"Application to Stay...\" mentions \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That could be same appeal? Parties? The parties are Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al., and Mary Boyle, et al. Wait the \"Application to Stay\" is a Supreme Court application, but it mentions pending appeal to the Fourth Circuit. That is likely an appeal from a district court case. That appeal might involve Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al. as applicants, and Mary Boyle, et al. as respondents? But the parties for that appeal may be the same? Actually the document is a Supreme Court application to stay the judgment of the district court. In that file, the parties include Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al. (applicants) and Mary Boyle, et al. (respondents). So the appeal is from the district court to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The parties are those. So we need to extract \"Appeal: Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al. appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But the parties are \"Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.\" Actually the text says \"Solicitor General—on behalf of applicants Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.—respectfully requests...\" So parties: Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al. (applicants). And respondents: Mary Boyle, et al. So we could list both parties or just the appealing parties. The requirement: \"Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court. The extracted value should be formated as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\" So we need parties. So we need to capture the appealing parties. In this case, the appealing parties are Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al. So we need that appeal.\n\nAlso, there's likely an appeal from the \"Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" etc. Might mention appeals. But that document maybe is the same case. But we need to find all distinct appeals. There may be multiple appeals: e.g., the Docket lists Notice of Appeal by Scott Bessent etc. That is an appeal. The Application to Stay also references pending appeal to the Fourth Circuit. That may be the same appeal? The parties differ: the Docket parties are Scott Bessent, etc., whereas the Application parties are Donald J. Trump etc. So they are different appeals.\n\nAlso maybe other documents: e.g., \"Opposition to Application to Stay\" might mention appeals. But we need to search for \"Appeal\" or \"appeal to\". We can search the remaining documents for \"Appeal\" pattern. But the search for 'appeal' gave many matches. We saw matches in Application. We saw many matches. We need to parse them.\n\nWe'll need to read the relevant sections of the Application to Stay to extract the appeal parties and court. The search matches for that document are token ranges 468-864, 1877-2077, 4101-4417, 4776-4976, 6913-7113, 10147-10347. We need to read those ranges to capture all appeals. But maybe all matches within that doc refer to the same pending appeal? Let's inspect one.\n\nWe have the snippet for Match 2 (tokens 657-857) from Application: It says \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That is the court. The parties: earlier we saw \"Solicitor General—on behalf of applicants Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.—respectfully requests...\" So we need to capture that. We should read that portion to get the parties. We may need to read more of the document to capture the parties. The snippet at 657-857 includes the phrase \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". The snippet also includes the earlier part: \"the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (App., infra, 32a-33a) pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and any further proceedings in this Court.\" So the parties are likely the same as earlier. But we need to confirm.\n\nWe may need to read the earlier part of the document where the parties are listed. That might be earlier tokens before 468. But we haven't visited that part. The document's token coverage: 468-864, 1877-2077, etc. But the parties might be earlier, maybe before token 468. We didn't view that. The document likely starts earlier. We didn't view tokens 0-467. So we need to read that portion to capture the parties. Let's search for \"Solicitor General\" or \"Applicants\" in the document. But we can search for \"Solicitor General\" across the document. Use search_document_regex for pattern \"Solicitor General\". That will return matches. But we only need to capture the parties. Maybe easier: search for pattern \"Applicants\" or \"applicants\" or \"applicant\". But we can search for \"applicant\" which may capture the parties. Let's search.\n\nWe also need to consider that the \"Application\" doc might mention other appeals. But likely only that one appeal.\n\nAlso the \"Opposition to Application\" might mention it again.\n\nBut we only need distinct appeals. So we have at least two distinct appeals:\n\n1. Appeal by Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. (From Docket)\n2. Appeal by Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al. to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. (From Application to Stay)\n\nBut there might be also appeal by Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr., etc. But that might be same as the one in Docket? The Docket shows that the Notice of Appeal is by Scott Bessent, etc. The later docket entries show responses by Mary Boyle, etc. But those responses are to the appeal, not new appeals.\n\nAlso the Docket might have other appeals from other parties. Let's search the docket for \"Notice of Appeal\" entries. The matches show 10 matches. We saw one Notice of Appeal by Scott Bessent etc. There might be other Notice of Appeals by other parties? Let's search the docket again for \"Notice of Appeal by\" or \"Notice of Appeal\". The matches we saw are all similar. We should read the entire docket to ensure no other appeals. The docket tokens 2268-3458 cover all matches. But maybe earlier parts of the docket (before 2268) contain other appeals? The docket document has 3827 tokens; we read 2268-3458 (31% coverage). So there may be earlier parts containing other appeals. We should read earlier tokens 0-2268. That might contain other appeals. Let's read 0-2268. That covers earlier docket entries. We'll read tokens 0-2268. That will cover earlier docket entries before the notice of appeal. Let's read that.\n\nWe should read the docket from 0 to 2268 to capture any other appeals. But note we haven't visited tokens 0-2268. So we will read that.\n\nAfter reading, we will extract any appeals.\n\nAlso we should consider \"Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" might mention the appeal. But we only need distinct appeals; this motion might be part of the same appeal, not another appeal.\n\nThus we need to read docket 0-2268, the Application doc 0-468, and maybe other docs.\n\nLet's start by reading docket 0-2268.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":2268}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 2268}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8686, "completion_tokens": 1923, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But there may be other appeals referenced elsewhere. There may be appeals in other documents: e.g., the \"Application to Stay the Judgment\" mentions pending appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. That may be an appeal by the government? Let's read relevant parts: The search results snippet shows \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That's likely an appeal by the government? The snippet shows \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" and \"any further proceedings in this Court.\" The parties: the government (Solicitor General) is appealing? The snippet includes \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and any further proceedings in this Court.\" We need to capture distinct values: maybe separate appeals by parties: one by the government (Solicitor General), and one by plaintiff parties (Scott Bessent et al).\n\nAlso other documents may mention appeals: \"Opposition to Applicants' Request for an Administrative Stay\" might mention an appeal? We need to search for \"appeal\" pattern again, but likely already found many matches earlier. But we might need to examine the \"Application to Stay the Judgment\" for other appeal statements. Also \"Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" probably mentions pending appeal to the Fourth Circuit. Let's search in that document. Use search_document_regex to find \"appeal\" occurrences.

Likely other documents include other appeals, e.g., Time-Sensitive Motion has \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687\", also other documents may have appeals. Also the \"Application to Stay the Judgment...\" mentions pending appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. That is a distinct appeal: \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". Also \"Opposition to Applicants' Request for an Administrative Stay\" might mention something. Let's search for \"appeal\" in other documents or maybe use regex on remaining unviewed docs.\n\nWe should search in \"Application to Stay the Judgment...\" for \"appeal\" pattern. Already search found matches but we didn't parse fully. But matches mention \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That is distinct. Also \"Time-Sensitive Motion\" has USCA4 Appeal. That is another distinct appeal. Also might be in \"Opposition to Application...\" etc. Let's search in each unviewed doc for \"appeal\". Use search_document_regex on remaining documents: Application..., Opposition..., etc. But we have partial coverage; let's search all for \"appeal\" but we shouldn't re-read same tokens. But we can search all; it returns context. Let's do search_document_regex on all docs for \"appeal\" again? We already did for all and got 55 matches. But we didn't parse all. We might need to extract additional appeals from those matches. We saw Docket gave one. There were also matches in Time-Sensitive Motion. Also matches in Application to Stay etc. We need to extract all unique appeals.\n\nLet's identify distinct appeals:\n\nFrom Docket: \"Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" (Appeal: SCOTT... appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit)\n\nFrom Time-Sensitive Motion: The heading shows \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687 ... Filed: 06/17/2025\" and then \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\". It lists parties: Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr. (Plaintiffs-Appellees) vs Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter A. Feldman (Defendants-Appellants). So the appeal is by the defendants? The title says \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687\" and parties reversed? Actually the document is a motion for stay pending appeal; it's filed by the defendants (appeal). So \"Defendants-Appellants\" includes Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter A. Feldman. So the appeal is by those defendants to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. So similar to Docket but with extra parties. So we need to extract that.\n\nAlso Application to Stay the Judgment mentions \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". Parties? Not explicitly named? Might be the same parties. But likely the same parties as in Docket. Might be that the applicant (the defendants) filed the stay. But the appeal is by the same parties.\n\nAlso \"Opposition to Applicants' Request for an Administrative Stay\" might mention appeal? It likely mentions \"appeal\" too.\n\nLet's search for \"appeal\" in the remaining docs. We can call search_document_regex on the remaining docs (Application to Stay..., Opposition to Applicants..., Opposition to Application..., Time-Sensitive Motion... etc). But we need to avoid re-reading same tokens? Search will return context; we haven't seen those contexts. We can request the results.\n\nLet's call search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"(?i)appeal\" again? But we already did and got 55 matches. But we didn't parse all. We need to parse the matches that belong to other documents.\n\nWe need to identify which matches correspond to which docs. The search results above are grouped by doc. The matches listed include \"Application to Stay...\" with 10 matches. We saw some matches. Also \"Time-Sensitive Motion...\" had 10 matches. We saw some. There may be matches in \"Opposition to Applicants' Request...\" etc.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct appeals. Let's parse each document's matches.\n\nWe have matches for Application to Stay: 10 matches. We saw match 1 tokens 468-668, match 2 tokens 657-857, etc. We need to extract appeal info. Let's read some parts.\n\nThe match 2 includes \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That phrase. Also earlier match 1 maybe contains the party names? Let's read around match 1 tokens 468-668 which we saw snippet. It didn't include parties. But maybe earlier part had parties? Let's search again with a narrower pattern including \"appeal to\" maybe.\n\nBut easier: We can search for \"appeal to\" pattern. But maybe simpler: We know the parties from Docket and Time-Sensitive Motion. They are same group: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought. Also Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka Jr. are plaintiffs. In Time-Sensitive Motion, the plaintiffs are plaintiffs-appellees. So the appeal is by defendants.\n\nThus we have two distinct appeals: one by defendants to Fourth Circuit. The others? Are there other appellate courts? Maybe Supreme Court? But the document says Supreme Court of the United States (in application). Actually the application is to Supreme Court to stay the judgment. That's not an appeal. So ignore.\n\nThus we have only one appeal? But maybe there is also an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit by the defendants. That is same as Docket. So maybe only one distinct appeal. But Docket and Time-Sensitive Motion represent the same appeal. But we need unique values. So maybe only one unique appeal.\n\nBut the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to list unique appeals. If there are duplicates, we only list once.\n\nThus we only have one: \"Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" That is what we have.\n\nBut we might also have an appeal by the plaintiffs? But no. The plaintiffs were appellants? They didn't appeal. They were appellants? Actually in Time-Sensitive Motion, \"Defendants-Appellants\" are the defendants. So the appeal is by defendants.\n\nThus only one appeal.\n\nBut maybe the \"Application to Stay the Judgment\" includes a pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, but parties are not listed. But still same parties.\n\nThus we can consider that as same appeal.\n\nThus our extracted list is correct.\n\nBut we need to confirm no other appeals exist. Let's search for \"U.S. Court of Appeals\" in other docs.\n\nSearch again for \"U.S. Court of Appeals\" in all docs. But we already saw in Docket and Time-Sensitive Motion. Might also appear in other docs. Let's quickly do search_document_regex on all docs for pattern \"U.S. Court of Appeals\".<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"U\\\\.S\\\\.

But need to extract ALL distinct values. There may be more appeals in other documents. We need to search for all appeals. We have seen appeals in Docket, Time-Sensitive Motion, Application to Stay, etc.\n\nWe need to find all appeals: from Time-Sensitive Motion, Application to Stay, maybe others. We need to identify all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document.\n\nSo we should search for appeals across documents. We already have some matches. We should now read more parts of documents, like Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal and an Administrative Stay, Application to Stay, etc., to capture all appeals.\n\nThe goal is to extract all distinct values of this checklist item.\n\nWe should search for \"appeal\" again but we already did. But we need to find all distinct values of appeals: e.g., Scott Bessent, etc. And also other appeals like Mary Boyle, etc. Let's examine the matches we saw:\n\n- From Docket: \"Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" That's one.\n\n- In Time-Sensitive Motion: appears multiple parties: Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr., Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter A. Feldman. That seems like a combined appeal. The text shows \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka, Jr., Plaintiffs-Appellees, v. Donald J. Trump ... Scott Bessent ... Russell Vought ... Peter A. Feldman ... Defendants-Appellants.\" So the appeal is between Plaintiffs-Appellees and Defendants-Appellants. But the appeal parties: Plaintiffs-Appellees: Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka Jr.; Defendants-Appellants: Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter A. Feldman. So the appeal is between those sets.\n\nBut the earlier Docket appeal was only Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought. That is a subset of the same parties? The Docket appeal might refer to the same appeal. But we need distinct values: maybe we count each distinct group of parties. But we need to ensure each distinct value. The example in Step 4 appended value: \"Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" That value is a specific format: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nWe must extract all distinct values, so possibly multiple appeals appear: e.g., maybe there is an appeal by Mary Boyle, etc. But the Docket shows only the four defendants appeal. The Time-Sensitive Motion shows the same parties. But maybe there is also an appeal by Mary Boyle? Let's search in other documents.\n\nSearch for \"filed by\" \"appeal\" \"U.S. Court of Appeals\" etc. But we have seen all.\n\nWe need to ensure we extract all distinct values. Let's search for \"Appeal:\" pattern in documents. Already found.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(?i)Appeal:\" to get all matches. But we already have 55 matches from earlier. But we need to parse to extract distinct values. Let's consider the documents:\n\n- Docket: we have the notice of appeal.\n\n- Time-Sensitive Motion: we have the appeal header.\n\n- Application to Stay: also references pending appeal.\n\n- Maybe the Complaint or other docs mention appeal.\n\nLet's search again more thoroughly. Use search_document_regex for pattern \"(?i)appeal\" on all documents. But we already did. But we need more targeted reading to capture all distinct parties.\n\nLet's check the Time-Sensitive Motion: the match shows the parties. But we need to confirm the appeal parties. Let's read the relevant portion of the Time-Sensitive Motion. We have matches 1-10, but we need to read more context around the parties. Let's read tokens 0-300 of Time-Sensitive Motion. That will include the header with parties. Let's do that.\n\nAlso Application to Stay: we need to read the part where it says pending appeal. Let's read tokens 600-900 maybe. But we should read the section around \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". Let's search for that phrase.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex to find \"pending appeal\" or \"U\\.S\\. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" in Application to Stay. That will give us context.\n\nAlso maybe there is a \"Notice of Appeal\" in Opposition to Applicants' Request for an Administrative Stay. Let's search that.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for pattern \"(?i)U\\.S\\. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" in Application to Stay. Also search in Time-Sensitive Motion for \"Appeal:\" maybe we have it.\n\nBut we might just read the Time-Sensitive Motion tokens 0-300 to capture the parties.\n\nAlso read Application to Stay tokens around 650-900 for the pending appeal.\n\nLet's perform two read_document calls? We can only do one per turn. So we choose one action. Which document to read? We need to capture new distinct values. The Docket already has one. The Time-Sensitive Motion likely contains the same parties. But we may need to capture the parties list as a distinct value: maybe the full set of parties. But the Docket only lists four defendants. The Time-Sensitive Motion includes both plaintiffs and defendants. So that is a distinct value: \"Appeal: Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr. (Plaintiffs-Appellees) vs. Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter A. Feldman (Defendants-Appellants) appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But the format requested: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So we should include all parties. But maybe the checklist expects a single string that includes all parties. The example is ambiguous.\n\nBut we should extract distinct values for the \"Appeal\" key. The earlier value had only defendants. So we need to add new value capturing all parties. But we might also add \"Appeal: Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr. appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But that may not be correct.\n\nBetter to read the full header and decide.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Time-Sensitive Motion for tokens 0-400 to capture parties.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal and an Administrative Stay\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":400}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal and an Administrative Stay", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 400}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9410, "completion_tokens": 1474, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We already have one from Docket: \"Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J.

Likely other documents include appeals: Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal and an Administrative Stay: this is an appeal itself? It appears to be a motion for stay pending appeal. It might contain a notice of appeal. The earlier search for \"appeal\" in that document found many matches. We should parse to extract appeals. Also Application to Stay has pending appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals for Fourth Circuit. Also there might be other appeals in other documents. Need to search systematically.\n\nWe should use search_document_regex to find \"appeal\" occurrences across all documents. Already did earlier with many matches but we didn't parse all. We need to read additional token ranges that contain appeals. The Docket already has the appeal notice. Time-Sensitive Motion contains \"TIME-SENSITIVE MOTION FOR A STAY PENDING APPEAL\" which is a filing that seeks stay pending appeal. It might contain a notice of appeal? The earlier search matches show many tokens but we need to read to capture the parties and court. The header shows \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687\" and parties. That is the appeal name. So we can extract: \"Appeal: Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka, Jr. (Plaintiffs-Appellees) v. Donald J. Trump, Scott No. 25-1687 Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter A. Feldman (Defendants-Appellants) appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But the text earlier didn't include the appeal to court phrase. The header shows \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687\" and indicates the court (United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit). So we can extract.\n\nAlso the Application to Stay includes a pending appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The search match shows \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" So we need to extract that.\n\nAlso Opposition to Application to Stay may mention appeal pending. We might need to gather all distinct appeals. Likely there are multiple appeals: one from Docket (appeal notice), one from Time-Sensitive Motion (appeal itself), one from Application to Stay (pending appeal), maybe others.

We have already appended 1 value from Docket. But likely there are other appeals in other documents: e.g., the Time-Sensitive Motion is an appeal itself: It is filed to the US Court of Appeals Fourth Circuit - the appeal arises from district court. Also Application to Stay includes pending appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals Fourth Circuit. Also maybe Memorandum Opinion includes mention of appeal? But likely we need to extract all distinct values: Appear \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\". So we need to capture appeal(s). Let's identify all appeals:\n\n1. From Docket: we need to see what the 1 value was. In Step 4, they appended 1 value. But we need to see the content. It likely extracted something like \"Appeal: Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr. appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" or similar. We need to confirm. But we don't have that entry. But we can search for the appended value. But we can read the Docket again to capture any appeals. The Docket list shows no appeal entry. But maybe the Docket includes a line \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" earlier? In the Docket snippet, I see no mention of appeal. But the appended value might have come from a different document. Actually Step 4: `append_checklist` (Appeal) was after reading Docket tokens 2781-3458. That snippet didn't show appeal. But maybe the 1 value came from something else earlier. But we need to verify.\n\nLet's search for \"Appeal:\" pattern. The search earlier found 55 matches across documents with \"(?i)appeal\". But we need to find each distinct appeal. Let's search for \"USCA4 Appeal:\" pattern. That appears in Time-Sensitive Motion. Also maybe in Application to Stay. Let's search for \"Appeal:\" in all documents. Use search_document_regex.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex on all docs for pattern \"Appeal:\"? But we need to capture the specific line. Let's see.\n\nBut we also need to capture the parties and the appellate court. So for each appeal we need to parse parties and court. For the Time-Sensitive Motion, the parties are Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr. as plaintiffs (appellees?) Wait the heading says Plaintiffs-Appellees (i.e., plaintiffs are appellants? Actually in appeal context, the parties listed before v. are \"Plaintiffs-Appellees\", meaning they are the appellees? The heading is \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka, Jr., Plaintiffs-Appellees, v. Donald J. Trump, ... Defendants-Appellants.\" That seems reversed: Plaintiffs-Appellees (the ones who assert the appeal?) Actually \"Plaintiffs-Appellees\" indicates they are the appellees? But the phrase \"Appellees\" means they are the ones who are being appealed to? Actually in appellate context, \"Appellee\" is the side that has won at trial and is defending the decision. \"Appellant\" is the side appealing. But here \"Plaintiffs-Appellees\" suggests that the plaintiffs are the appellees? That seems odd. But maybe the heading is mis-labelled. However, the appeal is by the plaintiffs (who are also appellants). The parties are \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr.\" (appellants) and \"Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter A. Feldman\" (defendants-appellants). Actually the heading says \"Defendants-Appellants\". So maybe the plaintiffs are appellants? Wait \"Defendants-Appellants\" means the defendants are the appellants. That seems reversed. But we can still extract parties as those listed before v. and after v. as the parties. But the instruction says \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\". So we need to capture the parties involved. The typical format might be \"Appeal: Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr. appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But we need to include all parties? Possibly we include all parties listed as appellants. The parties likely include both sides. But the instruction ambiguous: \"parties\" could be the appealing party or parties. For simplicity, we can list all parties as listed in the header: \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr.\" and \"Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter A. Feldman\". But maybe we only list the parties that are \"appellants\". In this case, the parties that appeal are \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr.\"? Actually maybe the plaintiffs are the appellants. We should double-check. The heading \"Plaintiffs-Appellees\" is confusing. But maybe the heading incorrectly labels. But the parties are those before \"v.\" are the appellants? The parties after v. are the appellees? Eh.\n\nBetter to extract the parties as all those listed before and after v. with the \"Appellees\" and \"Appellants\" labels. But the instruction: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" So maybe we should produce something like \"Appeal: Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr. and Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter A. Feldman appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But that seems wrong.\n\nLet's see other documents.\n\nThe Application to Stay includes \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That might have parties: The parties are the same as the case? The case title: \"Trump v. Wilcox\" maybe. The Application to Stay mentions \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and any further proceedings in this Court.\" That includes parties: Donald J. Trump and maybe the plaintiffs. But the parties are \"Trump v. Wilcox\" or \"Trump v. Wilcox\" is the case. But we might need to include the parties: Donald J. Trump and Scott Bessent? Actually the application mentions \"Trump v. Wilcox\" referencing the Supreme Court case. But the parties of the appeal might be \"Donald J. Trump\" vs \"Scott Bessent\"? But the actual appeal is between the plaintiffs (the CPSC commissioners) and Trump. But the Application to Stay may not list all parties.\n\nBut we need to extract all distinct appeals. Likely there are at least two appeals: the Time-Sensitive Motion, and the Application to Stay. Additional appeals might be in other documents like \"Opposition to Application to Stay\" etc. But we need to scan.\n\nGiven we have limited time, we can search for \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals\" pattern. Already did step 7 and 9. That match shows the line in Application to Stay. That is an appeal. So we need to extract that as \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" The parties are given in the case title: \"Trump v. Wilcox\". But we might need to capture the parties: Donald J. Trump and Scott Bessent? Actually \"Trump v. Wilcox\" indicates parties Donald J. Trump (plaintiff) and Scott Bessent (defendant). But the context: The Supreme Court case. But the application to stay is about the district court order. The parties of the application are the same as the underlying case: \"Donald J. Trump\" and \"Scott Bessent\" maybe. But we might need to capture the parties as the ones involved in the appeal: \"Donald J. Trump\" and \"Scott Bessent\" (or \"Trump v. Wilcox\"). But the text shows \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". So we can capture that.\n\nAlso the Time-Sensitive Motion is an appeal of the district court order. That appeal appears in the heading. So we need to capture that. We need evidence.\n\nWe should read more of the Time-Sensitive Motion to capture the parties and court. The snippet shows the heading, but we need the appellate court: \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687\" indicates it's the Fourth Circuit. So we can capture the court as \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". The parties: we need to list all parties: \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr., Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter A. Feldman\". But maybe we only list the parties that are the appellants: \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr.\"? The heading says \"Plaintiffs-Appellees\" and \"Defendants-Appellants\". That seems reversed. But anyway, maybe we should include all parties. But the instruction: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" It's ambiguous. We might choose to include the appellants only. But we need to be consistent.\n\nLet's check the \"Appeal\" value appended earlier from Docket. That might be from the Docket lines. The Docket had a line \"MOTION to Appear Pro Hac Vice for Nicolas A. Sansone ...\". But no appeal. But maybe the appellant is \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr.\" from the case. In the Docket, the parties are listed at the top: \"COMPLAINT against All Defendants filed by Mary Boyle, Richard Trumka, Jr, Alexander Hoehn-Saric.\" So the parties. The appeal might be the same parties. So the appended value may be \"Appeal: Mary Boyle, Richard Trumka, Jr, Alexander Hoehn-Saric appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" That is consistent.\n\nThus we need to extract appeals from:\n\n- Docket (already extracted)\n- Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal and an Administrative Stay\n- Application to Stay the Judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and Request for Administrative Stay\n\nAlso maybe other documents mention appeals, e.g., \"Opposition to Application to Stay\" might mention the appeal. But we can search.\n\nLet's search for \"pending appeal\" pattern again across all docs. But we already found that match. But maybe other docs mention \"appeal\" with \"Court of Appeals\". We can search \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" pattern. Let's search.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex on all docs for pattern \"U\\.S\\.

The search results indicated matches in Docket, Time-Sensitive Motion, Application to Stay, etc. We need to read those to extract evidence for each.\n\nWe should choose next action: read_document or search. We have already seen matches in Time-Sensitive Motion (0-400) showing an appeal: \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687 ...\". Also in Docket we saw appeal earlier. We need to read other parts of documents to capture all distinct appeals.\n\nWe need to identify unique appeals. Appears that Time-Sensitive Motion has one appeal: USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687. Also in Docket we have an appeal: maybe \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687\" too? The Docket snippet earlier might have a similar. Let's check Docket read earlier 0-2268. That had maybe \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687\" lines? Not sure. But we saw that in Time-Sensitive Motion.\n\nAlso Application to Stay has mention of pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit; but not a specific appeal number. But still an appeal: \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That is a distinct appeal: parties: likely the parties are the same as the motion: \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka, Jr., Plaintiffs-Appellees, v. Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter A. Feldman.\" We need to capture that.\n\nAlso the Memorandum Opinion mentions \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". But might not specify parties.\n\nThus we need to read Application to Stay document to capture the appeal line. We saw tokens 657-857 match includes \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". We can read that window to capture evidence.\n\nAlso we might need to read Memo Opinion for appeal? But maybe not necessary.\n\nAlso we might need to read other documents for other appeals.

But likely only the ones we saw.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Application to Stay (the document) at tokens 657-857 (or 660-860) to capture evidence. We can read that window. Then append to checklist. Also need to capture the parties and court. The statement: \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". It doesn't list parties there. But earlier in document maybe list parties. We might need to read earlier section where parties listed. We saw earlier tokens 468-864 included parties. The part 468-864 includes parties list and maybe mention appeal. We already saw 468-864: that includes parties list and \"pending appeal\". So reading that window will capture both parties and court. So we should read tokens 468-864 of Application to Stay. That's 396 tokens, within limit. That window will include the parties list and the appeal sentence.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Application to Stay, tokens 468-864.

We have seen that there might be other appeals, e.g., in Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, maybe some other appeals like in Opposition documents, etc. Also the Docket may have multiple appeals. We need to review more of Docket, but it seems we only captured one. Let's see if Docket has more appeal references. We have read tokens 0-3458, and 2781-3458. We should read the rest of Docket (3458-3827). Also maybe other documents like Order, Opposition, etc. We need to search for \"appeal\" pattern again but maybe we need to read entire documents to confirm all appeals. But we can use search_document_regex to find all matches, but we already did earlier. We saw 55 matches overall. But we need to parse each to extract all unique appeals.\n\nWe need to locate distinct appeals: For each appeal, we need parties and appellate court. The format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nWe saw from Docket: \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka, Jr., Plaintiffs-Appellees, v. Donald J. Trump ... Defendants-Appellants.\" Actually that's the parties, but the appeal is from district court to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. That is the appeal.\n\nAlso from Time-Sensitive Motion: \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687 ... In the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" That is also an appeal. The parties: Mary Boyle etc vs Donald J. Trump. So similar.\n\nAlso in Application to Stay: the appeal from district court to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, parties same.\n\nAlso maybe there is another appeal in Opposition documents. Let's search for \"appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals\" again or \"appeal to the U.S. Court\". We saw earlier. But maybe other documents mention \"appeal to the Fourth Circuit\" or \"appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\" etc.\n\nWe need to gather all distinct appeals. Let's list possible sources:\n\n- Docket: many docket entries likely mention appeals. We need to parse all.\n\n- Time-Sensitive Motion: we saw the appeal details.\n\n- Application to Stay: we saw the appeal.\n\n- Maybe Opposition to Applicants' Request for Administrative Stay may mention appeal.\n\nCheck search results: earlier search for \"appeal\" found many matches across documents. But we only extracted one. We need to extract all distinct appeals.\n\nThus next action: read remaining part of Docket (3458-3827). Also maybe read more of Time-Sensitive Motion for further appeals? But we have that already. Also read other documents like Order, Opposition, etc.\n\nBut to be systematic, we should search for \"appeal to the U.S.\" again but maybe limit to documents not fully visited. But we already did search. But we can parse the matches from search_document_regex results earlier: we saw matches in Application, Memorandum Opinion, Time-Sensitive Motion. The Docket matches were maybe 10 matches found earlier. We didn't capture all.\n\nThus we need to read Docket's remaining tokens to capture any additional appeals. Let's read Docket tokens 3458-3827.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":3458,\"end_token\":3827}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 3458, "end_token": 3827}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6138, "completion_tokens": 739, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to extract all distinct Appeal items. We have found some from Time-Sensitive Motion and Application to Stay. Likely there are multiple.\n\nWe need to read more documents to find all appeals. The Docket shows a notice of appeal by several parties to USCA (U.S. Court of Appeals). The Time-Sensitive Motion also includes an appeal. The Application to Stay includes pending appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Also maybe other documents have appeals: maybe Complaint etc. Let's search for \"appeal\" again but maybe capture the full text. But we already did search, but we need to read the matched contexts to capture details.\n\nWe already have some contexts: from Time-Sensitive Motion, we saw \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687 Doc: 13 Filed: 06/17/2025 Pg: 1 of 95\" and the parties: Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka, Jr., Plaintiffs-Appellees, v. Donald J. Trump, etc. That's an appeal. Also the Application to Stay includes \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" but parties not fully listed. The Docket shows notice of appeal filed by Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought and Donald J. Trump. So we need distinct values. We need to list each unique appeal with parties and court.\n\nWe have at least 3:\n\n1. From Time-Sensitive Motion: Plaintiffs-Appellees (Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka Jr.) vs Defendants-Appellants (Donald J. Trump, Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter A. Feldman). Court: U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. (Appeal: Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr. appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.) Actually the format: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" The parties: Plaintiffs-Appellees? We need to decide which parties are appealing. Likely the plaintiffs are appealing? Actually \"Time-Sensitive Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal\" is by plaintiffs. The plaintiffs (Mary Boyle, etc.) are appealing. The defendants are appellants? Wait, appellate parties: Appellees are the parties who are appealing? Actually in a USCA case, the parties who file the appeal are the appellees of the lower court. So the plaintiffs are the appellees in this appeal. So we list \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr. appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But the defendants (Trump, etc.) are appellants? But we just need the appealing parties.\n\n2. From Docket: Notice of Appeal filed by Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought and Donald J. Trump. Court: U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. So \"Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought and Donald J. Trump appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\"\n\n3. From Application to Stay: \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" but not listing parties. But we might extract parties from the application? The application is from Donald J. Trump and others (Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al., applicants). The application requests stay pending appeal to USCA. The parties appealing are the applicants: Donald J. Trump, et al. We may extract \"Donald J. Trump, et al. appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But we need to verify if the document indicates they filed an appeal. The text says \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" That suggests the appeal is pending. But do they file? It's a request for stay pending appeal. But we can treat as an appeal pending. So the parties are Donald J. Trump et al. So we add that.\n\nAlso maybe other documents such as \"Opposition to Applicants' Request\" might mention the appeal. Let's search again for \"appeal\" in those documents. We didn't read those sections. We might need to read the Opposition to Applicants' Request for an Administrative Stay. It might mention the appeal. Let's search entire doc for \"appeal\" but we have already searched all docs. But we only read some matches. We might need to read those matches.\n\nWe have search results for \"U\\.S\\. Court of Appeals\" and \"U\\.S\\. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". We saw some matches. But we need to capture the parties for the time-sensitive motion and application. Let's read those matched contexts fully.\n\nWe have token ranges:\n\n- In Time-Sensitive Motion: tokens 0-400 we saw. Likely includes the parties. The snippet includes \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687 Doc: 13 Filed: 06/17/2025 Pg: 1 of 95\" and the parties. We need to capture that.\n\n- In Application to Stay: tokens 468-864 we read. It had the parties? The snippet shows \"APPLICATION TO STAY...\" and \"Solicitor General—on behalf of applicants Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.—respectfully requests...\" It doesn't list all the applicants. But we can capture that.\n\n- In Application to Stay, maybe other tokens show the parties. But we can capture that.\n\n- In Docket: we have the notice of appeal with parties.\n\nWe also might have other appeals for other documents, e.g., \"Opposition to Applicants' Request\" might include an appeal. But we don't know.\n\nWe might search again for \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"Notice of appeal\" etc. But we may not need to if we already have all appeals.\n\nBut to be thorough, we should search for \"appeal\" again to find any other matches that might yield parties.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex for pattern \"(?i)appeal\" again. But we already did. But we didn't parse all matches. But we saw 55 matches. We may need to read more token ranges of those matches to capture all appeals.\n\nHowever, we might not want to read all 55 matches; we can read only those that include the phrase \"appeal to\" or \"filed an appeal\" etc.\n\nWe could search for \"appeal to\" pattern. Let's search for \"appeal to\" across all documents.\n\nAlso maybe \"appeal\" with \"filed\" etc. But we can write a regex for \"appeal to\" or \"appeal to the USCA\".\n\nLet's do search_document_regex for pattern \"(?i)appeal to the U\\.S\\. Court of Appeals\" across all docs. That might return matches. We saw one in Application to Stay. But there may be others.\n\nWe can also search for \"appeal to the U\\.S\\. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" across all docs. We saw matches.\n\nBut we also need to capture the parties. The parties might be in the same paragraph. For the Time-Sensitive Motion, the parties are listed before the \"USCA4 Appeal\" line. So we need to read a larger context.\n\nLet's read the Time-Sensitive Motion tokens 0-400. We saw that. The snippet includes the parties. That likely covers the parties.\n\nFor the Docket, we saw the notice of appeal with parties. That snippet is tokens 3458-3827, which we read. That includes the parties.\n\nFor the Application to Stay, we saw tokens 468-864. That snippet includes the applicant names (Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.). That's likely all. But there might be more parties in other sections.\n\nThus we might have 3 appeals.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have all distinct appeals. Could there be multiple appeals in the same case? Yes, but we captured the parties.\n\nBut perhaps there is a \"Notice of Appeal\" in the Complaint or Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order? We haven't read those documents. They might have appeals. But likely not.\n\nBetter to search for \"Notice of Appeal\" in all docs to see if any other appeals. Let's search for \"Notice of Appeal\" pattern.\n\nAlso search for \"Notice of appeal\" or \"Notice of appeal\" case-insensitive. Let's run a search.\n\nAlso maybe \"appeal\" with \"Filed\" etc.\n\nGiven we want to avoid reading entire docs, we can use search_document_regex to get matches.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for pattern \"(?i)notice of appeal\" across all docs.\n\nWe might also search for \"appeal filed by\" pattern.\n\nOk.\n\nLet's issue a search_document_regex for \"(?i)notice of appeal\" across all documents.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)notice of appeal\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)notice of appeal", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5861, "completion_tokens": 1920, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Currently we have 1 value from Docket. But we likely need to find all appeals in the corpus. The earlier search and read actions have found some appeals: e.g., in Application to Stay the Judgment etc, there is a pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Also in Time-Sensitive Motion, there is a USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687. Also in Docket, there are Notice of Appeal filings by parties. Also in Application, there may be a \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". Also in Memorandum Opinion, mention of U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Also there may be other appeals in other documents.\n\nWe need to extract every distinct value: format 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]'. So we need to capture each distinct appeal instance. Some may be \"Notice of Appeal\" with parties. Others may be \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" by certain parties. So each appeal is a distinct event, not just the court.\n\nWe have already extracted one from Docket: \"Notice of Appeal by Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought\". That entry is in Docket with parties. There's also a \"Notice of Appeal\" in Docket for \"26 Notice of Appeal filed by Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought and Donald J. Trump\". That's similar but maybe duplicate. The earlier extracted value probably was the first notice. Need to ensure uniqueness: maybe same parties but different docket numbers? In Docket, we have multiple entries for Notice of Appeal: 26 Notice of Appeal by those parties, and then 26 Notice of Appeal filed by the same parties. But the same parties, same appeal. So one unique entry.\n\nAlso in Docket, there might be other notices: e.g., \"Notice of Appeal by Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr.\"? That appears in one of the matches. Yes: In Match 3, there is \"RESPONSE in Opposition re 27 MOTION to Stay the Court's Order Pending Appeal filed by Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr\". That is not a Notice of Appeal. But there might be a Notice of Appeal by Mary Boyle etc. In the search results for \"notice of appeal\", we saw only that one match in Docket with parties. But maybe there are other appeals in other documents: e.g., in Time-Sensitive Motion, \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687\". That indicates an appeal to the 4th Circuit. The parties? The motion may be filed by the plaintiffs? Could be the same parties as the earlier.\n\nAlso in Application to Stay, there is a pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, but no parties listed in that clause. It says \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". The parties are presumably the applicants: Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al. So parties are \"Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.\".\n\nThus we need to extract distinct values:\n\n- Appeal: Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al. appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. (from Application)\n\n- Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. (from Docket, Notice of Appeal, 26)\n\n- Appeal: USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687 (maybe the same parties? Might be same parties as above, but likely same. But we should treat as separate if parties differ? The parties might be same. But if same parties, it's same appeal. But the \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687\" is a docket number. The parties are same as above. So maybe it's same appeal.\n\nBut we should check if there are any other appeals in the corpus. Search results for \"appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals\" found in Application and Memorandum and Time-Sensitive. But no explicit parties for Memorandum. The Memorandum mentions the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit but no parties. The parties likely are the same as the case. But we need to extract based on text.\n\nBetter to read the relevant windows in those documents.\n\nWe have partially visited Memorandum Opinion: token ranges 13362-13565, 15325-15525, 15537-15737, 16214-16414. We need to read portions that mention \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" or \"appeal\" to get parties. We can read more.\n\nAlso we have partially visited Time-Sensitive Motion: token ranges 0-423, 601-823, 990-1190, 1396-1596, 1768-1968, 23717-23917. The relevant part is the USCA4 Appeal line. We might need to read the token range around 23717-23917 to capture the full statement. But we might need to read more context to capture parties. The snippet shows \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687 Doc: 13 Filed: 06/17/2025 Pg: 52 of 95\". That indicates the appeal is the case. But doesn't mention parties. The parties might be earlier in the motion. We can search for \"appeal\" within that doc. But we may need to read a broader context.\n\nAlso in Application: we have read 468-864. That covers the \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". But not the parties. But we know the parties from the application header: \"Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.\" The snippet we saw earlier shows that header. So we can extract parties.\n\nAlso Docket has the Notice of Appeal with parties.\n\nThus distinct appeals:\n\n1. Appeal: Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al. appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. (Application)\n\n2. Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. (Docket Notice of Appeal)\n\nMaybe also Mary Boyle etc. But didn't find a Notice of Appeal for them. There might be a Notice of Appeal by Mary Boyle etc. But search didn't show. But maybe it's in the docket: In Match 3, there's \"RESPONSE in Opposition re 27 MOTION to Stay the Court's Order Pending Appeal filed by Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr. (Attachments: # 1 Affidavit Third Declaration of Richard Trumka Jr., # 2 Text of Proposed Order)(Sansone, Nicolas)\". That is not a Notice of Appeal. So maybe no appeal.\n\nThus likely only two distinct appeals. But we need to confirm if the Time-Sensitive Motion also contains a Notice of Appeal by the same parties. But that might be the same. But we should still include it? The question says distinct values. If same parties and same court, it's same appeal. But the USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687 might be a separate record but same appeal. But we should avoid duplication.\n\nThus we need to extract the two distinct appeals.\n\nWe currently have one value extracted from Docket. We need to add the other appeal from Application. Also maybe add USCA4 Appeal from Time-Sensitive Motion. But if it's same parties, may duplicate. But we could include as separate if we treat each distinct docket number.\n\nBut the format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]'. It doesn't include docket number. So if parties and court same, it's duplicate. So we should merge.\n\nThus we need to append the Application appeal.\n\nAlso check if there's any other appeal in Memorandum. It mentions \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". But no parties. So can't extract. So ignore.\n\nThus we will append the Application appeal.\n\nWe need to read the Application document. We have partially visited 468-864. But we also need to read the header to capture parties. The header includes \"Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.\" which is in tokens 0-468 maybe. We haven't read that part. The header is before 468. We need to read tokens 0-467 to capture the parties. But we need to read that window. The doc is 12,147 tokens. We can read tokens 0-467. That range is 467 tokens, fine.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Application to Stay (tokens 0-467). That will capture header. Then we can append the appeal.\n\nBut we must ensure we are not duplicating. We already have the Docket appeal. So we need to append the new appeal.\n\nThus next action: read_document for Application to Stay tokens 0-467.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Application to Stay the Judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and Request for Administrative Stay\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":467}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Application to Stay the Judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and Request for Administrative Stay", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 467}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7049, "completion_tokens": 1987, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought.\" But we need all distinct values of Appeal. In the docket we saw multiple notices of appeal: 26 Notice of Appeal filed by Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought and Donald J. Trump (seems same group). Also there are notices of appeal by Mary Boyle, etc? Let's check the Docket snippet: It contains:\n\n- 26 NOTICE OF APPEAL by Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought. (Stout, Abigail) (Entered: 06/16/2025)\n- 26 Notice of Appeal filed by Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought and Donald J. Trump. (slss, Deputy Clerk) (Entered: 07/01/2025)\n- 26 Notice of Appeal filed by Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought and Donald J. Trump. (slss, Deputy Clerk) (Entered: 07/01/2025)\n\nAlso there is a \"Notice of Appeal by Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr.\" Actually that appears in Docket match 1: \"26 | 2025-06-16 | NOTICE OF APPEAL by Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought. (Stout, Abigail) (Entered: 06/16/2025)\". Wait but earlier Docket match 3 had \"26 Notice of Appeal filed by Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, ...\". Another Docket snippet 3 shows \"26 Notice of Appeal filed by ...\" but also there is \"26 Notice of Appeal filed by Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought and Donald J. Trump.\" So same parties again. The Docket snippet also shows \"26 Notice of Appeal filed by Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought and Donald J. Trump.\" So maybe only one unique set of parties: Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Donald J. Trump.\n\nBut there might be other appeals: the Application to Stay the Judgment includes pending appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals for Fourth Circuit. That's the appeal itself. The Appeal item should be \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nWe have at least one appeal: from the Application to Stay the Judgment: \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" The parties are Donald J. Trump, etc. But the parties in the application are Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter Feldman (appellants). The respondents: Mary Boyle, etc. So we should extract \"Appeal: Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter Feldman appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But maybe we need to include respondents? The format: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" It might include both parties or just the parties that appealed. Usually \"parties\" are the appellant(s). So we can use the list of applicants: Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter Feldman.\n\nAlso the Docket shows \"Notice of Appeal by Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought.\" So we can extract that as an appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals? It didn't specify the court. But the Docket likely involves the case 25-1687, which is in the U.S. Court of Appeals for Fourth Circuit. So we can combine: \"Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But maybe we should use the same parties as in the application. Also includes \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka Jr.\"? No.\n\nAlso the Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal and an Administrative Stay mentions \"USCA4 Appeal\" which indicates U.S. Court of Appeals for Fourth Circuit. But no new parties.\n\nSo we need to extract all distinct values. We have at least two distinct sets: one from application (appellants) and one from docket (notice of appeal by same group). But they are same group. So only one distinct value? Actually the parties list may be same but order may differ: \"Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought\" vs \"Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter Feldman\". So same set. So one distinct value.\n\nBut we also have \"Notice of Appeal by Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr.\" That appears in Docket? Let's re-check Docket snippet: In match 1: \"26 | 2025-06-16 | NOTICE OF APPEAL by Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought.\" In match 2: \"26 | 2025-06-17 | Transmission ... re 26 Notice of Appeal.\" In match 3: \"26 | 2025-06-17 | Response ...\". In match 4: \"30 | 2025-06-17 | USCA Case Number 25-1687 for 26 Notice of Appeal filed by Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought and Donald J. Trump.\" So no Mary Boyle. But earlier in the snippet for Docket in match 1 we saw \"26 | 2025-06-16 | NOTICE OF APPEAL by Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought.\" So no Mary Boyle. But earlier in Docket snippet in match 1 we saw \"26 | 2025-06-16 | NOTICE OF APPEAL by Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought.\" So no Mary Boyle.\n\nBut earlier in the search results we saw \"Notice of Appeal by Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr.\" That might be from a different document? Let's search for that phrase: Not in the provided data. We might not have that. So likely only one appeal.\n\nBut the memo might mention \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has long recognized ...\". But that's not an appeal itself.\n\nThus we have one unique value: \"Appeal: Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter Feldman appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\"\n\nWe need to extract this from the Application to Stay the Judgment text (we have read tokens 468-864 which includes the sentence). That snippet: \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". It also lists the applicants. So we need to capture the parties: \"Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.\" The \"et al.\" refers to the other applicants: Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter Feldman. The snippet earlier lists them in the \"PARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING\" section. That's in tokens 0-467? Actually we read 0-467 earlier and saw the parties list. Good.\n\nThus we need to produce an append_checklist with key \"Appeal\" and extracted value \"Appeal: Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter Feldman appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" with evidence.\n\nWe need to ensure we include the evidence: text from the Application to Stay the Judgment (tokens 468-864) and maybe from tokens 0-467 for parties list. But we only have evidence from the snippet we read. We also might read more to get the party names. But we already have them in tokens 0-467 list. But we haven't used that text. We could use evidence from that list.\n\nWe may need to read the parties list again to have evidence. But we can also include evidence from the snippet we read: The snippet had the sentence \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That gives the court. The parties list is from tokens 0-467, which we have read earlier. We can reference that snippet as evidence. So in the evidence array, we can include two evidence objects: one for court, one for parties. But we can combine them into one evidence object containing snippet that includes all info? The evidence array can contain multiple evidence objects. Each evidence object has fields: text, source_document, location.\n\nWe need to provide location: e.g., \"Application to Stay the Judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and Request for Administrative Stay (tokens 468-864)\" and \"Application to Stay ... (tokens 0-467)\". But we might not be able to specify tokens; we can say \"tokens 468-864\" etc.\n\nThus we will send an append_checklist with patch.\n\nWe have only one value to append. The key is \"Appeal\". We must ensure that we are not marking Not Applicable.\n\nThus we will call append_checklist.\n\nBut we need to ensure we have not already appended the same value. We already appended 1 value for Appeal earlier from Docket. That value was likely \"Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to ___\" maybe. But that value may be the same. But the earlier appended value was from Docket. It likely had the same parties. So we might have duplicate. But the requirement is to extract every distinct value. If the earlier value is same, we should not duplicate. We need to check if the earlier value was the same. We don't see it. But we should check: earlier step 4 appended 1 value for Appeal. Which value? It was from Docket. The snippet in step 12 shows the docket entries, including the notice of appeal. The earlier appended value likely captured \"Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" So that matches. So we already have that value. So we should not add duplicate.\n\nBut we need to check if there is any other distinct value: maybe an appeal by Mary Boyle etc. But we haven't found that. But let's search again for \"Notice of Appeal by Mary\" maybe in other documents. Search in all documents with pattern \"Notice of Appeal by\". But we didn't do that. We can do search_document_regex with pattern \"Notice of Appeal by [A-Za-z ]+\"? That might bring many. But we should search all documents for \"Notice of Appeal by\" to see if there are other parties. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)Notice of Appeal by [A-Za-z ,.-]+\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\",\"MULTILINE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)Notice of Appeal by [A-Za-z ,.-]+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE", "MULTILINE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7400, "completion_tokens": 2395, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Currently we have 1 value extracted from Docket. But we need to extract all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. We have already found one value: from Docket: \"Notice of Appeal by Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought\" and the appellate court is US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit? The Docket entry mentions \"USCA\" but not explicitly the court? Let's examine the Docket snippet: It says \"ORDER of USCA Denying the motion ... as to 26 Notice of Appeal filed by Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought and Donald J. Trump.\" So the appellate court is US Court of Appeals (USCA). That is the Fourth Circuit as per earlier patterns. But to be safe, we need to find all appeals across documents. We saw other documents mention appeals: Application to Stay includes a sentence: \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That is one appeal. Also Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal likely contains appeal details. Also Memorandum Opinion and Order may mention appeals. Also other pleadings may have notices. We need to extract all distinct appeals: parties and appellate court.\n\nWe must gather evidence for each distinct appeal.\n\nKey value format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nThus we need to produce entries like \"Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" and maybe \"Appeal: Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al. appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But we need to ensure distinct values. The parties may be listed differently across documents.\n\nLet's enumerate potential appeals:\n\n1. From Docket: Notice of Appeal by Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought. Court: US Court of Appeals (assumed Fourth Circuit). We need to confirm the court name appears. The Docket entries referencing USCA may not specify \"Fourth Circuit\", but earlier steps found matches for \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" in other documents. We should search in Docket for that phrase. We can do search_document_regex on Docket for \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That might return a match. But we could also search all documents. But we need the evidence in each extracted value. So we need to find the exact text that includes the court name.\n\n2. From Application to Stay: there's a clause: \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That includes parties? The parties are listed earlier: \"Applicants (defendants-appellants below) are Donald J. Trump, President of the United States; Scott Bessent, Secretary of the Treasury; Russell Vought, Director...; and Peter Feldman\". So that appeal is by those parties. The text is: \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". We need to capture parties and court. The text \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" appears. That is evidence.\n\n3. In Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal and an Administrative Stay: likely includes a notice of appeal. We need to read that part.\n\n4. Possibly in Memorandum Opinion or Order we may find appeals. But given we may have already captured all.\n\nThus we need to gather evidence for each unique appeal.\n\nWe need to read document windows to capture the text.\n\nWe have partially visited Memorandum Opinion and Order, but not fully. But we can search for \"Notice of Appeal\" and \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" within those documents.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex across all documents for \"Notice of Appeal\" and capture context. We need tokens with parties and court. Let's search all documents for pattern \"Notice of Appeal\". We already did earlier but it was limited to Docket. We need to search all documents. Let's call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"(?i)notice of appeal\". That will return matches in all docs. We need to confirm the context includes the parties.\n\nWe also need to capture \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" in Application to Stay. That we already have from tokens 468-864. The snippet includes that phrase. We need to read tokens 468-864 which we already have. We can use that evidence.\n\nNow for Docket, we need evidence of the court name. Let's search Docket for \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That likely appears. Let's call search_document_regex on Docket tokens. But easier: search all documents.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex for \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" in all documents. That will give us context. Then we can confirm the parties from Docket or other docs.\n\nAlso we need to extract from Time-Sensitive Motion. We can search for \"Notice of Appeal\" in that doc.\n\nThus we need to gather all distinct appeals. Let's perform necessary searches.\n\nFirst search for \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" across all documents. Then search for \"Notice of Appeal\" across all documents. Also search for \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" maybe.\n\nSo we can call search_document_regex on all docs with pattern \"(?i)U\\.S\\. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That will give us matches.\n\nAlso we may want to capture the parties in each match. For Docket, the parties appear in the Notice of Appeal line. For Application to Stay, the parties are earlier.\n\nThus, next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(?i)U\\.S\\. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". Then we can parse.\n\nAlso search for \"Notice of Appeal\" to get parties. Let's do that.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex with two patterns? We can call twice. But we can also combine? The tool only accepts one pattern at a time. So we need to choose one. Let's first search for \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That will give us tokens with the court name. Then we can look at context to see if parties are near. But we may need to read more for parties if not included.\n\nSo first action: search_document_regex for \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\".<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Application to Stay the Judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and Request for Administrative Stay\",\"Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal and an Administrative Stay\",\"Memorandum Opinion\",\"Order\",\"Opposition to Applicants' Request for an Administrative Stay\",\"Opposition to Application to Stay the Judgment of the United States District of Maryland\",\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction\",\"Docket\"],\"pattern\":\"(?i)U\\\\.S\\\\.

But we might need to ensure all distinct appeals in any document. Let's check other documents for \"notice of appeal\" or \"appeal\" patterns. Already searched many.

For example, there could be an appeal of the order to stay, which is the same as the one in Docket. But there might also be a separate appeal from the same parties? Let's search for \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" pattern across other docs to see if other documents mention same appeal.

Currently we have one appeal from Docket: \"Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But there may be other appeals in other documents. We saw earlier search results: In Application to Stay the Judgment: there is mention of pending appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. That might be an appeal by the same parties? The application itself might be an appeal? But the application is to stay the judgment, not necessarily an appeal. But the text says \"pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\". That indicates the parties are appealing to that court. But who are the parties? The parties listed in the application: Donald J. Trump, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Peter Feldman vs Mary Boyle, etc. So this could be an appeal by those parties. We need to extract all distinct appeals. Also, there might be other appeals in the Time-Sensitive Motion or Memorandum Opinion. We saw \"USCA4 Appeal: 25-1687\". That could be a separate appeal? But likely same appeal. We need to check documents for each appeal. We must read more of the partially visited documents to find additional appeals.\n\nWe need to ensure all appeals are captured. The system has partial coverage of many documents; we should browse others for appeals. We could search for \"appeal\" pattern again across all documents, but we already did earlier and found many. But we need to confirm if there are additional distinct appeals that were not captured. Let's search for \"Notice of Appeal\" again to see if other documents have notices. But we already did search for \"notice of appeal\" and found 7 matches: 6 in Docket, 1 in Opposition to Application. The Docket had one? Actually the search found 7 matches; but we only extracted one from Docket. There might be other Notice of Appeals in Docket (6 matches). We need to read them all. But we might have only read one match at tokens 2265-2465. We need to read the other matches at other token ranges. We need to check Docket's full coverage tokens 0-3827 already visited fully; we have all notices. But we haven't extracted all. We need to parse Docket for all Notice of Appeal entries. We saw tokens 2265-2465 with Notice of Appeal by Scott Bessent etc. There may be other notices like \"NOTICE OF APPEAL by [other parties]\" maybe for other appeals. Let's examine Docket content for all notices. We need to read the Docket again maybe at other ranges. But we already visited entire Docket; but we may not have extracted all. We need to re-read relevant sections to extract all distinct appeals. We can use search_document_regex on Docket for \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" pattern to get all matches. That will give us token ranges. Then read those ranges and extract values.\n\nWe also need to check other documents: Time-Sensitive Motion, Memorandum Opinion, etc. We should search for \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" across those docs. And also search for \"appeal to\" patterns.\n\nGiven the current state, next action should be a search to identify all appeal instances. So action: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"(?i)notice of appeal\". Already did earlier but got 7 matches. But we need to confirm all. We need to read those matches. So next step: call search_document_regex on all docs with pattern \"(?i)notice of appeal\" again, but might need to specify context_tokens. But we already have that. We need to get top_k maybe 20. That will give us all matches. Then read each range. But we should be efficient: we can read directly from Docket for each match. For other docs, we can read ranges where matches occur.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for pattern \"(?i)notice of appeal\" across all documents.\n\nAlternatively, we could search for \"appeal to\" pattern to capture others.

The other documents might mention \"Appeal\" but not \"Notice of Appeal\". But the phrase \"appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" might be part of the same. But we should confirm if there are other appeals by other parties or same parties. Let's search for \"appeal\" with \"filed by\" maybe. Search pattern \"appeal filed by\" across docs.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)appeal filed by\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)appeal filed by", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6948, "completion_tokens": 480, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But the requirement is to extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. We have only one value currently. But there may be more. We need to search for all appeals. The docket shows multiple notices of appeal with same parties but maybe different case numbers. Also there's possible other appeals in other documents like \"Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" but that is a motion, not a notice of appeal. But maybe there are other appeals in other documents like \"Opposition to Application to Stay...\" might mention \"notice of appeal\". Already searched for \"notice of appeal\" found 7 matches. All in Docket. But there might be additional appeals elsewhere not yet fully visited: Memorandum Opinion, Order, Application, etc. But likely the only appeals are those in Docket. But we need to confirm if any other documents contain \"notice of appeal\" or \"appeal filed by\". Could be in other documents but not visited fully. Maybe in \"Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" there is mention of \"appeal\". But that's a motion pending appeal. That is not a separate appeal, it's same appeal. But we need to extract each distinct appeal. Possibly there are multiple distinct appeals with different parties or case numbers. We saw multiple matches: one for \"26 Notice of Appeal\" (appeal 26), and also references to \"25-1687\" case number for 26 Notice of Appeal. But is that a different appeal? That seems same appeal but with case number. Are there other appeals like \"27 Notice of Appeal\"? The docket entries show \"27 | 2025-06-16 | MOTION to Stay the Court's Order Pending Appeal by Scott Bessent, ...\". That is a motion to stay pending appeal, not a notice of appeal. There's no separate \"27 Notice of Appeal\". So only one appeal.\n\nBut check if there are any other appeals in other documents: maybe \"Opposition to Application to Stay the Judgment...\" could include \"Notice of appeal\" for some other parties. Let's search again for \"notice of appeal\" across all docs. Already did step 19, found 7 matches all in Docket. So no other appearances. Therefore only one appeal.\n\nHowever the requirement says extract every distinct value. We have one. But we need to ensure no missing. We might need to confirm if the appeal value includes all parties and court. The extracted value currently: \"Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" That includes parties and court. Good.\n\nBut we must verify if there are any other appeals with different parties or court. Let's search for \"appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals\" pattern again. Step 9 found 1 match in Application. That is same appeal.\n\nAlso search for \"appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals for the\" pattern: Step 16 found 3 matches all same appeal. So likely only one.\n\nThus we have all appeals extracted. But we must ensure that the extracted value matches the required format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' The current value includes that format. Good.\n\nNow we need to ensure that the checklist is complete. According to current status, Keys with Values: 1/1. That implies there is only one key: Appeal. So we are done. But we must double-check if any \"Not Applicable\" needed. But there is an appeal, so not applicable not needed.\n\nWe must check if there is any missing evidence. The evidence provided earlier: two excerpts from Docket. But we need to include evidence for the value. We already appended the value via update_checklist. But the evidence for the value includes two excerpts. But we need to ensure that the evidence objects include `text`, `source_document`, `location`. In the update_checklist call, they had evidence 1 and 2. But the evidence content was truncated? Let's see Step 18 update_checklist: It shows evidence 1 from Docket (tokens 2265-2465): \"26 | 2025-06-16 | NOTICE OF APPEAL by Scott Bessent, ...\", evidence 2 from Docket (tokens 3458-3827): \"39 | 2025-07-01 | ORDER of USCA Denying the motion...\". So evidence is present. Good.\n\nBut we need to ensure that the evidence includes location details. In the evidence shown, they didn't include location field, but the update_checklist likely included location. But the assistant hasn't shown the actual JSON. But we need to produce a new action. The current state: we have one value. The status says Keys with Values: 1/1. So maybe all is done. But we should double-check if there might be another appeal earlier in the docket, like \"Notice of Appeal\" for a different case number (maybe 25-1687). But that's same appeal. The docket shows \"USCA Case Number 25-1687 for 26 Notice of Appeal filed by Peter A. Feldman, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought and Donald J. Trump.\" That's same parties and court. So not a distinct appeal.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut before stopping, we should ensure that the checklist key is marked as complete. The status shows Keys with Values: 1/1, which indicates the key is filled. So we can stop.\n\nThus return stop decision.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All appeals have been extracted and the Appeal key is complete.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All appeals have been extracted and the Appeal key is complete.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7875, "completion_tokens": 1178, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The user earlier said \"All appeals have been extracted and the Appeal key is complete.\" But is that correct? We should verify if there are any other appeals in other documents. The docket had the Appeal; other documents might list appeals as well. For example, the application to stay might include an appeal? The search earlier found a \"notice of appeal\" in the application to stay. That might be the same appeal. But the earlier step 18 updated the Appeal key with only one value: \"Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" That covers the parties and court.\n\nBut maybe there are other appeals, like an appeal of a different decision, or appeals of orders? Let's search in other documents for \"appeal\" to see if any other appeals are present. We should search across all documents for \"appeal\" again but maybe we already did. But we might need to read the documents where matches were found but not fully read. Eg. Memorandum Opinion, Order, Application to Stay, Opposition to Applicants', Opposition to Application, Time-Sensitive Motion, Complaint, Plaintiffs' Motion. Those might contain appeals or references.\n\nBut the key \"Appeal\" is a checklist item: \"Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\" Do we need to extract multiple appeals? If there are other appeals, e.g., an appeal of the same case? Probably only one appeal. But if there were multiple appeals, we would need multiple entries.\n\nWe need to ensure no other appeals exist. Let's search in documents that haven't been fully visited: Memorandum Opinion, Order, Application to Stay (partial), etc.\n\nWe might want to search for \"Notice of Appeal\" in those documents. But we already saw that the docket had the notice. However other documents might mention \"appeal\" as part of earlier or later events.\n\nMaybe there is an appeal of a different order that is in a different document. For instance, the \"Order\" may have an appeal of an order. But the order may not mention an appeal.\n\nThe \"Time-Sensitive Motion\" might mention the pending appeal. But it's not an appeal itself.\n\nThe \"Opposition to Applicants' Request for an Administrative Stay\" might mention the appeal? It references the case. But unlikely.\n\nThe \"Complaint\" may mention the appeal? Probably not.\n\nThus likely only one appeal.\n\nBut we must confirm that we didn't miss any. Let's search for \"appeal\" in the remaining documents. Use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(?i)appeal\" again. But we already did earlier with 55 matches. But we might want to confirm if any other appeals appear outside the docket. Let's check the matches we saw earlier: 10 in Application to Stay, 10 in Docket, 4 in Memorandum Opinion, etc. But the application to stay had 10 matches for \"appeal\". Those might include references to the appeal. But the docket had the notice. So we extracted the appeal from docket. The application to stay had references to the appeal. But we didn't need to extract anything new.\n\nBut maybe there is an appeal of a different decision. For example, the \"Order\" might include a \"Notice of Appeal\". Let's search. Use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Notice of Appeal\" again. But we saw earlier 7 matches. 6 in docket, 1 in Opposition to Application. That opposition match was from some other document. Let's check that one. The opposition to application had 1 match: tokens 5957-6157: but that snippet didn't contain \"Notice of Appeal\". Wait that snippet shows something else. Let's re-read that snippet: It shows text about the law, not a notice. So maybe that match was incorrectly identified. But the search result said 1 match in Opposition to Application. Maybe the match is something else.\n\nBut the key point: The only appeal is the one in docket.\n\nThus we have a single value. Should we mark as complete? The checklist status shows 1/1 filled, 0 empty. So the system thinks we are done.\n\nBut we need to verify that we didn't miss any other appeals. Let's read other documents that have not been fully visited, but might contain \"appeal\" references. Eg. Memorandum Opinion: 5% coverage, but we haven't read the rest. Could contain mention of an appeal, but likely not. But let's search again for \"appeal\" in the remaining part of Memorandum Opinion. We can issue search_document_regex on the remaining parts of Memorandum Opinion. But easier: use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"(?i)appeal\" again. But the system will return matches across all documents again, but we might only get those already found. But we can specify doc_names to search only in remaining docs.\n\nThe list of documents with coverage: Memorandum Opinion, Order, Application to Stay, Opposition to Applicants' Request, Opposition to Application, Time-Sensitive Motion, Complaint, Plaintiffs' Motion.\n\nLet's search for \"appeal\" in those documents. We can call search_document_regex with doc_names array. But we need to specify pattern.

We have one appeal already from Docket. But there may be more appeals in other documents. The prior steps show many matches. They extracted one value, likely \"Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\" which we saw in Docket. But there might be appeals by other parties? For example, in other documents, maybe the plaintiffs or defendants appealed. Also might be appeals by other parties like Mary Boyle, etc. The \"Appeal\" key likely refers to any appeal. We need all distinct values. Already one value: \"Appeal: Scott Bessent, Peter A. Feldman, Donald J. Trump, Russell Vought appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But maybe there is also an appeal by Mary Boyle, etc. Let's search for \"appealed\" or \"appeal\" in other docs. The search earlier found many matches. We need to find distinct appeals. Let's examine the matches from the search in other docs (Memorandum Opinion, Order, Application, etc). Many matches mention \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\" But that might be the same appeal. The order is the appeal itself: the case is being appealed to the Fourth Circuit. The parties on appeal are the defendants? The order lists Plaintiffs – Appellees and Defendants – Appellants. The plaintiffs are Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn–Sarik, Richard Trumka Jr. The defendants are Donald J. Trump, etc. So the appeal is by the defendants (Appellants). So the same parties as in Docket. So maybe only one appeal.\n\nBut check if there are any other appeals, like an appeal by plaintiffs? In the order, the plaintiffs are appellees, not appellants, so not an appeal. So likely only one appeal.\n\nBut the required extraction may want all distinct values. So we need to confirm that no other appeals exist. Could there be an appeal by the plaintiffs in a different case? Unlikely.\n\nThus we have only one distinct appeal. We already extracted one value. Need to ensure we have correct evidence. We should add evidence from the Docket. But we already have appended one value. Let's check the append_checklist call: It appended 1 value. Did we provide evidence? According to prior step, it appended 1 value. But we need to confirm that the evidence was included. The earlier call was step 4 and step 17. We don't see the evidence details. But we have to ensure the entry is present with evidence.\n\nWe can check the checklist status. The summary says \"Keys with Values: 1/1, Empty 0/1, Not Applicable 0/1, Total Values Extracted: 1.\" So only one value for Appeal. That likely is the only appeal. So we can stop.\n\nBut we should double-check that no other appeals exist. The search results show many matches for appeal but they refer to the same appeal. There might be appeals by the plaintiffs? But the order shows plaintiffs are appellees, so not.\n\nThus we can stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct appeals have been identified and extracted.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct appeals have been identified and extracted.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11689, "completion_tokens": 694, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
