We have seen matches in Docket entries: \"Case assigned to Judge Susan Illston\". Also in other docket entries. We need to extract all distinct judge names. The documents likely mention the judge.

We have partial coverage: tokens 1507-1707, 2329-2588, 3056-3256, 3726-3926. These have judge names: Susan Illston. Maybe others like \"Judge Alsup\" in Order Granting Preliminary Injunction.

The checklist only has one item: First_and_Last_name_of_Judge. We have two values: Susan Illston. That seems sufficient; we should check if there are any other judge names that might be present. The regex searched for \"Judge <Capitalized>\" across all documents and found the matches. The extracted value is \"Susan Illston\". The question: Must we include all distinct values? The pattern might match other judges: \"Judge Susan Illston\" appears multiple times. Are there any other judges? Let's think: The case is 25-3293. The judge is Susan Illston. No other judge in documents? Could be other judges e.g., \"Judge William A. Fletcher\" etc. In the excerpt from Order, it lists \"Before: William A. Fletcher, Consuelo M. Callahan, and Lucy H. Koh, Circuit Judges\". But the main presiding judge is Susan Illston. The checklist item is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\". Usually singular. So we should have only one value? The specification says \"extract every distinct value of each checklist item\". If multiple judges, include each. But here likely only Susan Illston. So we have it. But we should verify no other judge names that could be considered. The regex matched many \"Judge \" but we didn't check all. Let's quickly search again maybe \"Judge \" pattern across all documents to see if any other judge names appear. The search earlier returned 77 matches across all documents, but many were not judge names? The matches include \"Judge Susan Illston\" in docket and order. There were also matches like \"Judge\" in other contexts? But likely only Susan Illston. The docket snippet shows \"Case assigned to Judge Susan Illston.\" The order snippet shows \"Susan Illston, District Judge, Presiding\". The \"Before:\" list includes other judges but they are circuit judges, not presiding. But the item likely expects the presiding judge, which is Susan Illston. We have that. So checklist is complete.\n\nWe should check if there is a \"not applicable\" scenario: no, we have a value. So we should stop. But before stop, we need to ensure the extracted list for the key includes all distinct values. We have one value. Also we had appended two entries? We appended one value twice? We appended two entries? The append_checklist earlier added two entries? The log shows \"Append_checklist\" succeeded but we might have appended two entries? We appended 1 key with value \"Susan Illston\" twice? Let's check: In the prior step, we appended value 1 and 2? Actually the append_checklist call appended \"Susan Illston\" twice? The evidence shows two sources. But we should only have one unique value. But the spec says multiple entries allowed; but duplicate entries are not needed. We could combine into one entry with two evidence pieces. But we already have two entries? That might be duplicate. But it's acceptable? Maybe we should consolidate. But the spec didn't forbid duplicates. But might be fine. But we could refine: we could update the key to a single entry with both evidence.\n\nBut the requirement: \"extract every distinct value\". Duplicate entries are not distinct. So we should only have one entry for Susan Illston. So we should update the checklist to set extracted list to one entry. Let's do update_checklist to replace the extracted list with one entry containing both evidence. That will reduce duplication.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist for First_and_Last_name_of_Judge with extracted list containing one entry value \"Susan Illston\" with evidence from both sources.

Possibly there could be other documents with other judges. But from step 5, we saw only Susan Illston. However, there might be other documents where the judge is different. The extraction should capture all distinct values of each checklist item that directly match the item's definition. If there are multiple judges presiding over different documents, we should list all. The question: In the case documents, is there only one presiding judge? It might be a single case with one judge. But we need to verify if any other judge appears. Search for pattern \"Judge\" again. Step 4 found 5 matches in Docket. Those may be for the same judge. Step 5 found 1 match in Order.\n\nBut we have other documents partially visited. We can search for \"Judge\" across all documents to confirm if any other judge names appear. The previous search regex used \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" and found many matches across documents. But the extraction step ended after Step 8, calling stop. But step 9 says get_checklist shows 1/1 filled. So they believe only 1 value. However, the system may not have considered other judges. We should re-evaluate.\n\nWe should search again across all documents for \"Judge\" pattern to see if there are other names. But we also need to avoid re-reading already visited token ranges. The catalog shows many documents partially visited but not fully. We can search across all documents for pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" again. That might yield matches. But we should avoid duplicates. We can use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" and pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" flags IGNORECASE? Actually case-sensitive. The pattern from earlier: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" might match \"Judge Susan\" etc. We should search again.\n\nAlternatively, we could search for \"Judge\" pattern that captures the judge name only. But the earlier search returned many matches. But we only extracted one. Maybe the other matches include \"Judge\" as part of other contexts e.g., \"Judge\" as a title but not the presiding judge? But we need the presiding judge. The definition says \"The name of the presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided).\" That likely refers to the presiding judge of the case. Usually it's one. So we might be fine.\n\nBut the system indicated \"Keys with Extracted Values: 1/1\" meaning there is only one key. The checklist has only one key: First_and_Last_name_of_Judge. So we could stop if we are confident that there are no other judges.\n\nBut the system is expecting us to consider potential gaps. The rule says: \"Your decision now: Call stop if satisfied. Continue with more tool calls if you identify gaps or need to extract more items.\" The only key is the judge name. We have extracted a value. Do we need to confirm that no other judge appears? The document might have multiple judges (e.g., panel). But the definition says \"presiding judge\". Usually only one. But we can search for \"Judge\" again to confirm no other distinct names. But we have 13 documents. It's possible that other documents mention other judges (e.g., \"Judge\" as a reference to another judge). But the presiding judge might be consistent across documents.\n\nWe might search for \"Judge\" pattern across all documents to see if any other judge names appear. But we need to ensure we don't double count the same judge.\n\nLet's search all documents for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" again. Use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\". Then we can examine matches. If we find new judge names, we can extract them.\n\nBut careful: The system already did search_document_regex earlier and found many matches. But we might need to confirm if any match includes a different judge name. Let's do that.\n\nWe should call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\", flags IGNORECASE? Actually we want to capture names like \"Judge Susan Illston\". The pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" will match \"Judge Susan\" but not \"Judge Susan Illston\"? It matches first space then first name. But we might want to capture full name. Alternatively, we can use pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" to capture both first and last names. That was earlier used. But there may be cases with only one name? Possibly \"Judge Susan\". But we only need first and last name if available.\n\nBut to find distinct values, we should also consider pattern \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)?)\" capturing up to two names. But we can search with two patterns: one capturing two names, one capturing one name. But easier: search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" and then parse the captured names.\n\nBut we need evidence for each extracted value. So we need to retrieve context.\n\nLet's do a search across all documents.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Judge\\\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4522, "completion_tokens": 1191, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
