Also 08/26/2025 in other documents. Might be more distinct dates like 05/20/2025? Search results show many 06/27/2025. But we need all distinct values of filing date. The filing date of the lawsuit: The lawsuit likely first filed 06/27/2025? Actually filing date of lawsuit is the earliest filing: In Complaint introduction, \"Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025\". But there is also motion filed later. Also the docket shows many Entered: 06/27/2025. So the filing date is 06/27/2025. But there is also a filing date 08/26/2025 for a different action? That might be a subsequent appeal or motion. But the first filing is 06/27/2025. The question: \"Extract the filing date from the legal documents.\" It could mean the date the lawsuit was first filed. That is 06/27/2025. But we must capture all distinct values? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we should list all distinct dates: 06/27/2025 and 08/26/2025. Are there any others? Search shows 05/?? Not seen. Let's search again for \"08/26/2025\" maybe also \"08/26/2025\" appears in other documents. Already extracted. Also 06/27/2025 appears in many. So distinct: 06/27/2025, 08/26/2025. No other dates. Also maybe \"06/27/2025\" appears in docket entries, but same. So we have two distinct values.\n\nWe have evidence for 06/27/2025 from Complaint introduction. Also evidence from docket entries. For 08/26/2025 from Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal and for Administrative Stay (Match 1) and Untitled Document (Match 1). We can provide evidence from those sources.\n\nWe already appended 2 values earlier. But we might need to include all evidence for each value. We should update the checklist to include all evidence for each value.\n\nWe have appended earlier: For 08/26/2025 we had evidence from Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal and for Administrative Stay (Match 1) and Untitled Document (Match 1). For 06/27/2025 we had evidence from Complaint introduction. But we also have evidence from docket entries but not appended. We could append more evidence for 06/27/2025.\n\nWe need to ensure each value has evidence list. The earlier append had evidence 1 and 2 for 08/26/2025. For 06/27/2025 we had evidence 1 from Complaint introduction. Could add evidence from docket entries. But the requirement: \"Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So we can include multiple evidence entries per value. The earlier append had evidence list of 2 for 08/26/2025. That's fine. For 06/27/2025 we had 1 evidence. We could optionally add more evidence from docket, but not necessary. But we may want to include to satisfy \"supporting evidence\". It didn't say minimal. But we should provide at least one evidence per value. We already have one. But we might want to add docket evidence for completeness.\n\nWe need to ensure no duplicate entries. The current extracted list has 2 values, each with evidence. We might need to update the entry for 06/27/2025 to add docket evidence. That would be an update_checklist for Filing_Date, replacing existing extracted list or appending new evidence? Actually we cannot modify existing evidence for a value by append_checklist because the value is same. We could append new evidence for the same value, but the spec says \"append_checklist\" to add new entries for keys. But each appended entry must be a new value. We cannot append evidence to existing value. So we cannot add more evidence to the same value. To add evidence to existing value, we would need to update the entire list with that value, including all evidence. But we can also simply keep existing evidence. But missing docket evidence not necessary.\n\nBut maybe we should ensure we captured all distinct dates. We have 06/27/2025 and 08/26/2025. Are there any other distinct dates like 06/27/2025? Already captured. So we can stop.\n\nWait but the earlier extraction list had 2 values. That's correct. But we must verify that no other distinct dates exist. Search results show 65 matches of date pattern. Many are 06/27/2025. Possibly 08/26/2025. Might also have 05/?? Not seen.

The current extracted values: Filing_Date: 2 values (06/27/2025, 08/26/2025). The step says earlier we had 2 values. But we need to ensure we captured all distinct filing dates from any document. The search earlier found 10 matches: 5 in Motion to Stay..., 5 in Untitled Document. We extracted 08/26/2025 from both Motion and Untitled. 06/27/2025 from Complaint. But maybe there are more filing dates in other documents such as Docket, Omnibus Order, Order (001), Order (002). We also saw docket entries with date 06/27/2025. The search step 6 found 65 matches of dates across many documents, but many are docket entries logged on 06/27/2025. But the filing date of the lawsuit is the date the complaint was filed. That is 06/27/2025. However there might be other documents that show a filing date like 08/26/2025 also. Are there any other filing dates? The search found 10 matches: 5 in Motion to Stay and 5 in Untitled Document. That likely includes 08/26/2025. But maybe other documents contain the filing date as 08/26/2025? The search step 6 shows many matches across various docs but those are docket entries. The filing date is likely just the initial complaint's docket entry. But the motion to stay might have a filing date of 08/26/2025 (the motion filed after the complaint). The untitled doc might contain a filing date of 08/26/2025 too. But the filing date we need is the date the lawsuit was first filed/initiated. That is 06/27/2025. The 08/26/2025 might be a later filing. But the step 5 indicates they appended 08/26/2025 as a Filing_Date value, which might be incorrect. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" They want all distinct filing dates found. That could include 06/27/2025 and 08/26/2025. But is it necessary to include 08/26/2025? The filing date is the first filing. But the instruction says \"distinct value of this checklist item found in any document\". So yes, include all distinct dates that are labeled as filing dates. The earlier extraction appended both values. But are we sure 08/26/2025 is indeed a filing date? The evidence: \"Date Filed: 08/26/2025\" in Motion to Stay and Untitled Document. That is a filing date for those documents, but not the filing date of the lawsuit. But the requirement might interpret that as separate filing dates for any document. But the checklist item is \"Filing_Date: The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So it's specifically the lawsuit's filing date. That should be 06/27/2025. So we might need to remove 08/26/2025. The earlier step appended 08/26/2025 incorrectly.\n\nWe need to correct: The only filing date of the lawsuit is 06/27/2025. We should update the checklist to only contain that date. But the earlier step appended two values. We must update the checklist to set only 06/27/2025. Since the earlier extraction included 08/26/2025 incorrectly, we need to update.\n\nBut the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" If we interpret strictly, we might need both dates. But the description says \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So 08/26/2025 is not the first filing. So we should not include it. The earlier extraction appended 08/26/2025 incorrectly. So we need to correct. But the system may have automatically considered the last step as final; but we can update.\n\nWe should confirm that 06/27/2025 is indeed the filing date. The evidence: \"Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025\" in Complaint. Also the docket entry shows \"Entered: 06/27/2025\". So that's the filing date.\n\nHence we should update the checklist to remove 08/26/2025. We need to use update_checklist for Filing_Date to set extracted to [06/27/2025] only. But we need to provide evidence for that date. Use the evidence from the Complaint introduction and Docket entry. Provide one or more evidence entries.\n\nThus the next action: update_checklist. Provide patch for Filing_Date: extracted array with one entry value \"06/27/2025\" with evidence from Complaint and Docket. Let's produce evidence:\n\n- From Complaint: \"Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025\" (page 1 tokens 0-500). Provide location: \"Page 1 of 27\" maybe. Document: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction.\n\n- From Docket: \"(Entered: 06/27/2025)\" within docket entry. Provide location: \"Match 1 tokens 61-261\" etc. Document: Docket.\n\nThus patch. The evidence includes the text snippet, source doc, location.\n\nWe need to ensure we do not include 08/26/2025.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist.\n\nLet's construct JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"06/27/2025\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 of 27 (tokens 0-500)\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"text\": \"(Entered: 06/27/2025)\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"Match 1 tokens 61-261\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "06/27/2025", "evidence": [{"text": "Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction", "location": "Page 1 of 27 (tokens 0-500)"}, {"text": "(Entered: 06/27/2025)", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Match 1 tokens 61-261"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8861, "completion_tokens": 1340, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Wait step 9 shows 1 value? It says extracted 1 value but earlier step 5 had 2 values: 08/26/2025 and 06/27/2025. But step 9 updated to only 06/27/2025? They omitted 08/26/2025. That may be incomplete. We need to extract all distinct filing dates. We found 06/27/2025 and 08/26/2025. Possibly other dates? Search again. The earlier search found 10 matches across documents, 5 in Motion to Stay and 5 in Untitled Document. Those likely include 08/26/2025. Already extracted 08/26/2025 from those documents. But step 9 removed it. We need to re-append 08/26/2025.\n\nCheck remaining coverage: We have not fully read Untitled Document; we have only 2% coverage. There may be other filing dates. But likely only those two.\n\nWe should update checklist to include both values. Use update_checklist to replace list with both values. Provide evidence for each: from Untitled Document (maybe match 1 tokens 0-115). Also from Motion to Stay etc. But we already have evidence for 08/26/2025 from Untitled Document and Motion to Stay. We need to include evidence.\n\nWe also need evidence for 06/27/2025 from Complaint and Docket.\n\nThus perform update_checklist with two entries. Provide evidence list for each. Provide text snippet, source_document, location. Use evidence we have. Provide location as page or token range.\n\nWe need to generate evidence. For 06/27/2025: evidence 1 from Complaint - \"Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025\" (Page 1 of 27, tokens 0-500). evidence 2 from Docket match 1 tokens 61-261: \"(Entered: 06/27/2025)\". For 08/26/2025: evidence 1 from Motion to Stay preliminary injunction pending appeal and for administrative stay: \"Date Filed: 08/26/2025\" (tokens 0-114). evidence 2 from Untitled Document: \"Date Filed: 08/26/2025\" (tokens 0-113). Provide location details.\n\nThus final action: update_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"06/27/2025\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1 of 27 (tokens 0-500)\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"text\": \"(Entered: 06/27/2025)\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"Tokens 61-261\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"08/26/2025\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Date Filed: 08/26/2025\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal and for Administrative Stay\",\n              \"location\": \"Tokens 0-114\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Date Filed: 08/26/2025\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Untitled Document\",\n              \"location\": \"Tokens 0-113\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "06/27/2025", "evidence": [{"text": "Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction", "location": "Page 1 of 27 (tokens 0-500)"}, {"text": "(Entered: 06/27/2025)", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Tokens 61-261"}]}, {"value": "08/26/2025", "evidence": [{"text": "Date Filed: 08/26/2025", "source_document": "Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal and for Administrative Stay", "location": "Tokens 0-114"}, {"text": "Date Filed: 08/26/2025", "source_document": "Untitled Document", "location": "Tokens 0-113"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8311, "completion_tokens": 796, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Current status shows Filing_Date has 2 values: 06/27/2025 and 08/26/2025. But the step 7 said all distinct filing dates extracted. However the extraction summary shows only 2 values but documents list shows potential duplicates maybe? We need to verify all distinct filing dates across corpus. There might be other dates like 09/08/2025? Let's search again for dates.\n\nWe have the search results from Step6: 65 matches of dates. We saw 06/27/2025 and 08/26/2025. Are there other dates? Let's search again for pattern of dates 06/27/2025 etc. But we need to confirm no other distinct filing dates.\n\nThe steps after step7 indicate extraction of 08/26/2025 from Motion to Stay and Untitled Document. So likely only two distinct dates. But we need to ensure no other date like 08/26/2025 appears elsewhere, but duplicates are fine.\n\nThus the checklist is complete.\n\nWe need to verify that the checklist contains exactly these two values with evidence. The last update_checklist replaced 2 values.\n\nWe need to confirm that no other dates appear. But we might want to do a search_document_regex for dates across all documents again to confirm no other distinct date values. The matches found 65 matches including 06/27/2025 and 08/26/2025. But maybe there are other dates like 07/01/2025, 10/01/2025, etc.\n\nGiven that the search earlier only matched those two date patterns. The search pattern used: \\b\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\\b. That would catch all mm/dd/yyyy dates. The matches list shows 65 matches but only 06/27/2025 and 08/26/2025. They repeated many times.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we must ensure that the checklist is complete: It has 2 values. Are there any other filing dates that should be extracted? Maybe the filing date of the Complaint vs. filing date of the Docket? The filing date of the Complaint is 06/27/2025. The filing date of the Motion to Stay is 08/26/2025. That seems correct. The Untitled Document also has 08/26/2025. So only two distinct values.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the current checklist has those values. The last update_checklist had 2 values. So it's ready.\n\nThus the next action is \"stop\".\n\nWe need to return JSON:\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct Filing_Date values extracted with evidence.\"\n}\n\nLet's output.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct Filing_Date values extracted with evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct Filing_Date values extracted with evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8388, "completion_tokens": 613, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
