We have searched for \"class action\" but maybe not found where it states plaintiffs are class or individual. We may need to read more of the documents. The Omnibus Order is partially visited, only 10000-11000 tokens. The search found class action within that snippet but maybe not the designation. Possibly the complaint introduction might contain the phrase. The Untitled Document is large, search gave snippet at 79524-79724 but didn't include \"class action\". That snippet is about venue. So maybe the class action status is only in the complaint introduction or other document.\n\nWe should search for \"Plaintiffs:\" maybe the introduction has a heading \"Plaintiffs\" with details. But step 10 search found only in Order (001). That snippet didn't include class status.\n\nWe need to find where the plaintiffs are designated as class action or individual. Likely in the Complaint introduction, there's a \"Plaintiffs\" heading with \"Plaintiffs: John Doe, Jane Smith, etc.\" or \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". We should search for \"Plaintiffs:\" again across all documents; maybe more matches. But step 10 search found only one match. Could be that the heading is \"Plaintiffs:\" but not captured due to case sensitivity or formatting. We can search for \"Plaintiffs\" without colon. Or search for \"Class Action\" again but maybe not catch. The search results show only 2 matches.\n\nMaybe the class status is in the \"Order (001)\" or \"Order (002)\". But we only saw snippet for Order (001). Could be more in Order (002) not yet visited.\n\nBut the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need all values. Likely only one: plaintiffs are class action. But we need evidence.\n\nWe need to find a source that states plaintiffs as class action. The snippet from Omnibus Order may include phrase \"Bivens class action\" but that indicates a Bivens class action that the plaintiffs are part of, but not the designation. It's more about the type of case.\n\nBetter to search for \"class action\" case-insensitive across all documents. Already did, found 2 matches. But those matches are in the same snippet of the Omnibus Order and Untitled Document (but those didn't mention plaintiffs). The snippet for Omnibus Order includes \"Bivens class action\" but not necessarily indicating plaintiffs.\n\nMaybe the class status is in the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction, but step 13 search found 0 matches. That might mean the phrase \"class action\" not used, maybe they describe \"class action\" in other words. They might use \"class action\" in the heading \"Plaintiffs\" or \"class action\" not present. But there might be a heading \"Plaintiffs\" and description \"Plaintiffs: a class of ...\".\n\nWe could read the complaint introduction. It's 10,859 tokens. We can read tokens 0-1000 or 0-2000 to look for class status. Let's read from start.

We have documents partially read. Search for \"class action\" might show class action mention.

In Complaint, the plaintiffs are Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and Center for Biological Diversity. They are individual plaintiffs (organizations). There's no class action. So likely \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and Center for Biological Diversity\". We must confirm if any class action mention. Search \"class action\" found 2 matches: in Omnibus Order and Untitled Document. But those might refer to other cases. But need to see if in Complaint it's a class action? The Complaint is for declaratory relief. No class action. So we can set Not Applicable? Actually we are asked to extract class action status. If it's individual, we provide that. If no class action, we still produce individual. So we need evidence: the text listing Plaintiffs.\n\nWe have read the Complaint 0-2000 tokens. It includes \"Plaintiffs,\" and lists Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and Center for Biological Diversity. That is evidence.

It's not a \"Not Applicable\" item; it's a value to extract. If no class action, we still need to extract the status: individuals. We already have that. But we need to confirm if any other doc indicates the same. But maybe some doc says \"class action\" but refers to a different case. It's not relevant.

They might mention \"class action\" but not the plaintiffs. But maybe the Order (001) refers to this case and might mention class action. Let's search Order (001) for \"class action\" pattern.
