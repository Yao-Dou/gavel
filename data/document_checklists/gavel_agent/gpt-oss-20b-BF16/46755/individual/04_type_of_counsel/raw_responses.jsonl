COOGLE (BAR NO. 21846) DEMOCRACY FORWARD FOUNDATION. Also earlier: /s/ Joel McElvain, JOEL MCELVAIN (BAR NO. 31673). Those are attorneys for Plaintiff? The part \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" is within that section. Also earlier at start: \" /s/ Joel McElvain JOEL MCELVAIN (BAR NO. 31673)\". That might be lead counsel. We need separate entries for each side if clear. For Plaintiff: Counsel: private counsel? Actually \"Democracy Forward Foundation\" indicates a nonprofit. The attorney is CORTNEY ROBINSON* and CHRISTINE L. COOGLE. They are counsel for Plaintiffs. So we could label as \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\" or \"Plaintiff: public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\"? The instructions: brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and include specific organizations in parentheses when available. So we need to decide category: Democracy Forward Foundation is a nonprofit organization, presumably public interest nonprofit. So label as \"Plaintiff: public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". Also Joel McElvain is a private attorney. He is attached to the same group? The document shows his signature and a separate address? He is likely counsel for plaintiffs as well. He is private counsel. But is he part of Democracy Forward Foundation? He is listed separately. He may be the lead counsel. He is not part of the nonprofit. So we might need two entries: \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Joel McElvain)\" and \"Plaintiff: public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". We need to check if the document indicates he is also counsel for plaintiffs. The snippet: \"/s/ Joel McElvain JOEL MCELVAIN (BAR NO. 31673)\" appears before \"CORTNEY ROBINSON* CHRISTINE L. COOGLE\". It may be the lead counsel's signature line. That indicates he is counsel for plaintiffs. So we have two counsel entries for plaintiffs.\n\nWe also need counsel for defendants. The search for \"Counsel for Defendant\" returned nothing. Perhaps there is no counsel for defendant listed; maybe the defendants are represented by government counsel. But we have no evidence. We will need to search again for \"Counsel for Defendants\" or \"Counsel for Defendant\" maybe pattern \"Counsel for Defendants\". Also search for \"Counsel for\" includes \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" only. Let's search again for \"Counsel for Def\" or \"Counsel for defendants\" across all documents. Also maybe \"Counsel for the United States\" or \"Counsel for\" with defendant side names. Let's search for \"Counsel for\" again but maybe include \"Counsel for the\". But we can just search for \"Counsel for\" again but earlier we only got one match in complaint. But maybe there are more matches beyond the viewed range. We should read more of the complaint to see if there are other counsel lines. Let's read the complaint earlier tokens 13344-15000? The earlier read_document had tokens 13599-15000 but returned empty. That seems weird. The snippet is blank. Maybe the read didn't capture because token boundaries are wrong. We need to read again from a broader range to capture the entire counsel section. Let's read from 13300-15000. But we need to ensure we don't exceed 10,000 tokens. That range is 1700 tokens, fine.

We have evidence for Plaintiffs counsel: from Complaint: \"CORTNEY ROBINSON*  CHRISTINE L. COOGLE (BAR NO. 21846) DEMOCRACY FORWARD FOUNDATION...\" and \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\". Also \"Joel McElvain\" appears but that's likely counsel for ... maybe defendant? But we need to identify types: \"private counsel\" or \"public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". We have the plaintiff counsel: a private counsel representing plaintiffs, and organization is Democracy Forward Foundation. Could be private counsel or public interest nonprofit? The instruction: \"brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available (e.g., Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)). If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\"\n\nWe have no clear defendant counsel info. The docket indicates \"Summons Issued to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, Mehmet Oz, United States Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney General\". That suggests defendant is Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and U.S. Attorney (maybe representing the government). But we don't have counsel names. The docket entries show \"PAPERLESS ORDER granting 5 Motion to Appear Pro Hac Vice on behalf of Cortney R Robinson.\" That suggests Cortney R Robinson is appearing for... maybe defendant? Actually, \"Motion to Appear Pro Hac Vice on behalf of Cortney R Robinson\" likely means Cortney is representing defendants? The docket entry has \"pro hac vice on behalf of Cortney R Robinson\". But the earlier complaint shows \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" is the group. There's no \"Counsel for Defendant\" in complaint. The \"Memorandum Opinion\" doesn't show counsel.\n\nThus we probably only have plaintiffs counsel. The type: \"private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". But is Democracy Forward Foundation a public interest nonprofit? It's a nonprofit? It's a public interest organization. But the instruction: \"brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se)\". So we can label as \"public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". Also \"private counsel\" might apply to Joel McElvain? He is presumably private counsel for plaintiffs too? But we have \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" listed only once. That line shows only the group with C. L. Coogle. Joel McElvain is at top as \"Joel McElvain\" with address? He may be the lead counsel for plaintiffs. But the group is \"Democracy Forward Foundation\". So the counsel type is \"public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\".\n\nShould we include \"private counsel (Joel McElvain)\"? He is a private attorney. But the instruction: \"brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available\". So we could have two entries: \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Joel McElvain)\" and \"Plaintiff: public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". But the instructions say: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" It doesn't say to split multiple counsel for same side. We could combine? But they want each distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So if there are multiple counsel types for plaintiff, we might need separate entries. But the type is \"private counsel\" and \"public interest nonprofit\". They are distinct. So we should include two entries for Plaintiff: one private counsel (Joel McElvain) and one public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation). But we need evidence for both.\n\nEvidence for Joel McElvain: He appears as signature line: \"/s/ Joel McElvain\" and \"JOEL MCELVAIN (BAR NO. 31673)\". That implies he is counsel. Also he is listed as \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" earlier? Actually the \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" group includes C. L. Coogle. There's no explicit \"Counsel for Plaintiffs: Joel McElvain\". But we can infer he is counsel for plaintiffs because he signs. But we need evidence. The evidence snippet is the signature line. Good.\n\nEvidence for Democracy Forward Foundation: The group line shows \"Christiane L. Coogle\" and \"Democracy Forward Foundation\". That's evidence.\n\nWe also might find \"Pro hac vice\" indicates that Cortney R. Robinson is a private counsel pro hac vice. That may represent defendants? But unclear.\n\nThus we will extract two entries:\n\n- \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Joel McElvain)\"\n- \"Plaintiff: public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\"\n\nWe need to include evidence snippet for each. Provide source_document and location. Use \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" and token ranges. For the signature line, we have tokens 13599-... Actually we saw earlier the snippet includes signature line. That was read in step 6, but not captured exactly. We can re-read a bit around signature line to capture evidence. Let's search for \"Joel McElvain\" in document.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on complaint for \"Joel McElvain\".

We have no evidence yet; we must append.\n\nWe know from Complaint: Plaintiff counsel: Joel McElvain, CORTNEY ROBINSON, CHRISTINE L. COOGLE, all labeled \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\". They are part of Democracy Forward Foundation. So we can extract entries: Plaintiff: private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation). But requirement: \"brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available.\" So we need \"private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". Also we have pro hac vice mention; maybe category \"private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\" still. Also we might note \"private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\".\n\nAlso we need Defendant counsel if present. If none, maybe not applicable? But per instructions, don't include an entry for side if type not clear. So we only include Plaintiff side.\n\nThus we need to read the Complaint to confirm counsel info. We already read tokens 13300-13599 for that. That includes the names and \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" line. So we have evidence.\n\nWe should append to checklist.\n\nBut we need to ensure we don't miss any other counsel info in other documents. Could be also other side counsel in other docs. Let's search for \"Counsel for Defendant\" again across all documents but maybe the pattern is in other docs but not captured earlier? The search step 9 found 0 matches. So likely none.\n\nSearch for \"Counsel for the Defendant\" maybe also none. But we can search for \"Counsel for the Defendants\" or \"Counsel for the Defendant's\" etc. But maybe none.\n\nAlso we could search for \"Counsel for the\" but that will produce many results. But we can examine counsel lines.\n\nBut key is to extract all distinct values. So maybe there are multiple counsel entries for plaintiffs: one for each attorney? But the requirement: \"type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available\". So we just need a single entry per side: e.g., \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". If multiple organizations, but same? We have one organization: Democracy Forward Foundation. So one entry.\n\nBut we might also consider the names: Joel McElvain, etc. But no need.\n\nThus we need to append one entry.\n\nWe must ensure evidence: text snippet with source_document and location. The snippet should include \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" and organization. The read window included that. So we can use that as evidence.\n\nWe need to confirm that the snippet has the organization text \"DEMOCRACY FORWARD FOUNDATION\". That was present. So we can include snippet.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with key Type_of_Counsel, extracted entry: value \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". Evidence: text snippet from Complaint (the read window). We'll provide location: \"Page 30\" or token range? We can use location \"Page 30 of 30\" maybe. Or token range? We'll give location \"Page 30 of 30\". That is fine.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't have any other counsel info. Might be other documents with counsel for defendant. Let's search quickly for \"Counsel for Defendant\" again across all docs with context maybe. But we already did step 9 search. But maybe the pattern might not match due to punctuation or case. But we can search for \"Counsel for the Defendant\" and \"Counsel for the Defendants\". Let's do that search now. We might need to read the results. But we can't do two actions in one turn. So maybe we can do search_document_regex for both patterns at once? We can pass doc_names array? But we can only call search_document_regex once. But we can set pattern with alternation: \"(Counsel for Defendant|Counsel for the Defendant|Counsel for the Defendants)\". But the tool's regex likely supports alternation. Yes. So we can search all docs for that pattern.\n\nBut maybe we can just do append_checklist now and then later will search for defendant counsel if needed. But we don't know if any exist. But we can be safe: we can search for counsel for defendant again. But we might risk missing other counsel info. Let's search again.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Counsel for Defendant|Counsel for the Defendant|Counsel for the Defendants\". We'll then read the matches if found. That is the next step.\n\nBut we should check if we should first append the plaintiff counsel. But we could also combine both steps? We can't do two actions. But we could do search_document_regex for defendant counsel now, then read the match to extract evidence. But we still need to append plaintiff counsel. But we can append after reading defendant counsel. But we could also skip searching defendant counsel if we think none. But to be thorough, we should search.\n\nWe need to choose one action. Let's do search_document_regex for defendant counsel. Then next turn, after reading results, we can append plaintiff counsel. But we already have evidence for plaintiff counsel from earlier read. But we can still append now.\n\nBut we can also combine: we could set patch with key Type_of_Counsel and extracted entry for plaintiff counsel. But we must have evidence from text. We have that evidence from earlier read. But we can reuse that snippet. So we can append now. But then we still need to search for defendant counsel. But we can do it in next turn. But the instruction: choose exactly one action. So we can choose to append_checklist now. But we might risk missing defendant counsel if exists. But we could also choose to search for defendant counsel now. But perhaps safer to capture plaintiff counsel first. But we can search for defendant counsel later.\n\nWe need to decide. The key is to extract all distinct values. If we skip searching for defendant counsel, we might miss it. But we don't know if any exist. But we saw search earlier of \"Counsel for Defendant\" returned 0 matches. So likely none. But might still exist but not matched due to regex. But we can search again with more patterns. But we can do that after.\n\nThus first action: append_checklist for plaintiff counsel.\n\nWe need evidence: snippet: \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" and \"DEMOCRACY FORWARD FOUNDATION\".

We need to read that token range. Let's find the match details. We saw earlier \"search_document_regex\" on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (pattern \"Counsel for\") returned 1 match. We didn't see the match snippet. We need to retrieve the match context. Let's call search_document_regex again to get context around \"Counsel for\" in Complaint. Since we have partial coverage, but we can get context again.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for pattern \"Counsel for\" to get the snippet.\n\nAlternatively, do search on all documents for \"Counsel for\" with context. That might return same match.\n\nWe should also search for \"Counsel for Defendant\" again to capture defendant counsel. But earlier we saw one match in Memorandum Opinion. Let's get the context for that match.\n\nWe need to extract the type: For plaintiff counsel: likely private counsel (Attorney). For defendant counsel: maybe government counsel (HHS). Need to confirm.\n\nAlso there might be other counsel for other parties? The case is 1:25-cv-02114-BAH. Might be a class action against HHS. The plaintiff may be a group of individuals or a public interest organization. But we need evidence.\n\nLet's search all documents for \"Counsel for Defendant\" again to get context. Also search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" and \"Counsel for the United States\" etc.\n\nAlso maybe there are \"Counsel for the United States\" or \"Counsel for the Department of Health and Human Services\".\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Counsel for\" to get matches. The earlier search returned 2 matches (1 in Complaint and 1 in Memorandum). Let's retrieve context. Thus call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"Counsel for\" top_k maybe 10, context 200.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Counsel for\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Counsel for", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4272, "completion_tokens": 859, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Let's examine the documents.\n\nWe have Complaint: appears to list counsel for Plaintiffs: \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" followed by names. That was extracted earlier. We need to extract that as an entry: \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)?\" Actually the snippet shows: \"CORTNEY ROBINSON* CHRISTINE L.

So counsel for plaintiffs is private counsel from Democracy Forward Foundation. That is the extracted value.\n\nWe also need counsel for defendant. The search results for \"Counsel for Defendant\" in Memorandum Opinion, but we haven't read the actual snippet. We need to read that part to confirm. The snippet we saw earlier did not show counsel for defendant; it was a generic text about HHS. The search results show a match but maybe not the counsel section. We need to find the counsel for defendant section in the documents. It might be in the memorandum opinion; perhaps the order includes counsel for the defendant. We need to locate the counsel section.\n\nWe can search for \"Counsel for Defendant\" specifically but we already did. The match snippet didn't show. We need to read more around that region. The snippet shows tokens 33309-33509, but we didn't see counsel. Perhaps the counsel for defendant is earlier or later. Let's search again for \"Counsel for Defendant\" in the entire document, maybe more matches. But we already searched and only found that region? The search results show only 1 match in Memorandum Opinion. It might be that the counsel for defendant is not present in the memorandum opinion; maybe in the docket. Let's search docket for \"Counsel for Defendant\" again. The previous search for docket returned no matches. So maybe the defendant counsel is not in docket. The memorandum opinion may not have counsel details either.\n\nBut we have \"Counsel for\" in complaint (for plaintiffs). There may be \"Counsel for Defendant\" in complaint? The complaint may only list plaintiff counsel. So defendant counsel might not be in complaint. The defendant might be represented by government counsel? We need to find any mention of counsel for defendant.\n\nSearch for \"Counsel for Defendant\" again but maybe with different pattern: \"Counsel to Defendant\" or \"Counsel for the Defendant\". Already searched. Let's search for \"Counsel for the\" or \"Counsel for\" more generally. We saw 2 matches: one in complaint, one in memorandum. We saw those. The complaint match shows counsel for plaintiffs. The memorandum match maybe is in a different section that might contain counsel for defendant. But the snippet didn't show; maybe the snippet didn't capture the counsel lines. Let's read around that area to see if counsel for defendant appears. We need to read more tokens around match 1 in memorandum. The match was tokens 33309-33509. We read 300 tokens earlier. That might not have captured the counsel lines. Maybe counsel lines are earlier or later. Let's search for \"Counsel for the\" again but maybe with context. The search might have only captured part. Let's search for \"Counsel for\" again on all documents with context 500? But we already did with 200 context. We might need to get more context. Let's search again with larger context tokens maybe 500 to see more. But we need to keep within 10k token limit. Let's do search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Memorandum Opinion\", pattern=\"Counsel for Defendant\", flags=[\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k=5, context_tokens=500. That will give us context around the match. Then we can read that snippet.\n\nAlso, maybe the defendant counsel is in the docket. But docket had no matches.

That likely is the counsel for plaintiffs: \"Democracy Forward Foundation\" with attorneys: Cortney Robinson, Christine L. Coogle. But we need to extract the type of counsel: \"private counsel\" or \"public interest nonprofit\" etc. The snippet shows \"Democracy Forward Foundation\" which is a public interest nonprofit. So Type_of_Counsel should be \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\" or something. Also we need counsel for defendant side: Did we find any? We have search results for \"Counsel for Defendant\" in Memorandum Opinion but not actual content due to truncated. We didn't read those tokens. We need to read the matching region in Memorandum Opinion to see if there's counsel for defendants. The snippet in search for \"Counsel for Defendant\" returned a block with no counsel text. Likely the actual text is elsewhere. We need to read the relevant tokens.\n\nWe saw read_document on Memorandum Opinion tokens 33300-33600 (300 tokens). That block didn't show counsel. The search result earlier shows tokens around 33309-33509 but no counsel. Maybe counsel for defendants appears later in the Memorandum Opinion.\n\nWe need to search for \"Counsel for Defendant\" again and get context tokens. We used search_document_regex on all docs pattern \"Counsel for Defendant\" and got 1 match in Memorandum Opinion. That match had no counsel content. Might need to search for \"Counsel for the Defendant\" or \"Counsel for the Defendants\" etc. But no matches found. Perhaps counsel for defendants is not in the documents. Maybe the defendant counsel is not represented, meaning pro se or government counsel. We need to check if any side has counsel. The complaint only lists counsel for plaintiffs. For defendant side, maybe there is no counsel listed. The Memorandum Opinion might mention counsel for defendant but not captured. But search did not find \"Counsel for Defendant\" in other docs. So likely no counsel for defendant.\n\nThus we only have plaintiff counsel: Democracy Forward Foundation with attorneys: Cortney Robinson, Christine L. Coogle. The Type_of_Counsel should be \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\".\n\nWe need to append that value. We currently have appended 1 value, but we didn't include organization name. The appended value likely was just \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\". But we didn't see the append_action details. It said appended 1 value for 1 key: Type_of_Counsel. It probably appended \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" as value. But we need to update to more precise category. The requirement: \"Using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available\". So we should update the value to \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". We need to update the checklist.\n\nThus we should call update_checklist to replace the existing extracted list for Type_of_Counsel with the new accurate value.

Evidence includes text snippet and source_document and location.\n\nWe should also confirm no counsel for defendants. Since we have no evidence of counsel for defendants, we might not add a value.

We'll read 0-3781 tokens. But we need to avoid re-reading tokens already visited? We have visited 754-1051 and 1643-1843. We haven't read 0-754 or 1051-1643 or 1843-3781. So reading 0-3781 would re-read visited ranges. We should read unvisited ranges: 0-754, 1051-1643, 1843-3781. We can read 0-3781, but that's fine? We must not re-read already visited tokens. We should read unvisited tokens: 0-754, 1051-1643, 1843-3781. Let's just read 0-3781 but that would re-read 754-1051 etc. Not allowed. So we should read 0-754, 1051-1643, 1843-3781 separately. But we can read 0-754, 1051-1643, 1843-3781. Let's do 0-754 first.\n\nAlso, we need to read more of Memorandum Opinion for counsel for defendant. We have partial coverage 33159-34000, 38535-38735.

We know from docket and memorandum, there is \"Counsel for Defendant\" mention in Memorandum Opinion. But we haven't read the text to confirm the defendant counsel names. We need to extract that.\n\nWe have search results but not the actual names. We need to read the portion of Memorandum Opinion containing \"Counsel for Defendant\" to get names. The search results show only generic snippet. We need to read that part. Let's read the relevant token range: we saw tokens 33309-33509, but that snippet didn't include the counsel names. Likely further down. Let's search again with narrower pattern maybe \"Counsel for Defendant\" but include around. But we need read. Maybe the docket has appearance entries which list names: e.g., line 4: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Joel L McElvain on behalf of CITY OF CHICAGO, CITY OF COLUMBUS, DOCTORS FOR AMERICA, MAIN STREET ALLIANCE, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE (McElvain, Joel)\". That may be counsel for defendants? Actually defendants are city and agencies. The counsel appears to be Joel McElvain. But the docket shows appearances for plaintiffs and defendants. However the docket shows \"NOTICE of Appearance by Christine L Coogle, Coogl on behalf of All Plaintiffs\". So there is counsel for plaintiffs: Christine L. Coogle. Also \"NOTICE of Appearance by Joel L McElvain\" on behalf of defendants? That line says \"on behalf of CITY OF CHICAGO, CITY OF COLUMBUS, DOCTORS FOR AMERICA, MAIN STREET ALLIANCE, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE\". That seems like the defendants. So we can extract that.\n\nBut we should verify from Memorandum Opinion. Search again maybe \"McElvain\" in Memorandum Opinion. We should read the portion containing \"McElvain\".

The counsel for plaintiffs includes possibly private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation). So we have one entry: \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". For defendant counsel, we haven't found. Search in Memorandum Opinion but earlier search didn't find. But we need to confirm if any counsel for defendant. Search in Docket maybe? The docket shows appearance of Joel L McElvain on behalf of CITY OF CHICAGO etc. That might be defendant counsel. But in Docket, it's a filing. \"NOTICE of Appearance by Joel L McElvain on behalf of CITY OF CHICAGO, CITY OF COLUMBUS...\" That is an appearance by Joel L McElvain, presumably representing defendant. So defendant counsel: Joel L McElvain, private counsel? He is private counsel representing municipalities. He might be private counsel. Document shows his name. So we can extract defendant counsel: \"Defendant: Private counsel (Joel L McElvain)\". Additional counsel maybe? Also Christine L Coogle appears on behalf of plaintiffs. She is private counsel. Also Cortney Robinson is private counsel.\n\nSo we have to extract both sides. We need to read the relevant sections to provide evidence. We already have evidence for plaintiff counsel from Complaint. For defendant counsel from Docket we have evidence.\n\nBut we need to ensure that we have read these tokens. We have already read Docket 0-754. That includes the line: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Joel L McElvain on behalf of CITY OF CHICAGO, CITY OF COLUMBUS...\". That is evidence. So we can append checklists for both sides.\n\nBut we need to confirm that we need to format as \"Plaintiff: …\" and \"Defendant: …\". The instructions: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'\". So we need two entries.\n\nThe current extracted values: 1 value from Complaint for Plaintiffs. That is likely \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". But we need to ensure that we include names of counsel and organization. The evidence snippet shows names and organization. We can create value: \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". We might also include \"Cortney Robinson, Christine L. Coogle\" but the requirement: brief category label and include specific organizations in parentheses when available. So we can include the organization Democracy Forward Foundation. That's enough.\n\nFor defendant: \"Defendant: Private counsel (Joel L McElvain)\". That is clear.\n\nWe need to append these two entries. The current checklist has 1 value. We need to add the defendant value. But maybe we should also add plaintiff value if it hasn't been fully captured? It was appended earlier. But we see current status: 1 value, but only 1 extracted. It might be the plaintiff. So we need to add defendant.\n\nThus action: append_checklist with key Type_of_Counsel, two entries: Plaintiff and Defendant.\n\nWe must provide evidence for each.\n\nEvidence for plaintiff: from Complaint snippet. We should reference that snippet. Provide text: \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" plus names. Provide source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". Location: page 30? The snippet shows \"Page 30 of 30\". So location: page 30. Or token range 13485-13599. Use that.\n\nEvidence for defendant: from Docket snippet token 0-754. Provide text: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Joel L McElvain on behalf of CITY OF CHICAGO, CITY OF COLUMBUS, DOCTORS FOR AMERICA, MAIN STREET ALLIANCE, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE\". Provide source_document: \"Docket\". Location: maybe \"Line 4\" or token range 0-754 (but we can't specify token offset maybe page 1). Use location: \"Line 4\" or \"Entry 4\". But we can say \"Entry 4\" or just \"token range 0-754\".\n\nWe should provide evidence snippet containing the relevant phrase \"NOTICE of Appearance by Joel L McElvain on behalf of CITY OF CHICAGO...\".

The requirement: extract all distinct values of Type_of_Counsel. We currently have 3 values: Defendant: Private counsel (Joel L McElvain); Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation). Wait 3 values? The list says 3 values but only shows 2? Let's check: In the extracted values list: Value 1 Defendant: Private counsel (Joel L McElvain). Value 2 Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation). That is 2 values. But earlier says 3 values. Maybe missing third? It said 3 values total extracted, but only 2 listed? Might be missing a value such as Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit? Let's review documents for other counsel.\n\nWe have Docket entries with other appearances: Entry 2: NOTICE of Appearance by Christine L Coogle, Coogl on behalf of All Plaintiffs (Coogle, Christine). That indicates Plaintiff: Private counsel (Christine L. Coogle). Also Entry 4: NOTICE of Appearance by Joel L McElvain on behalf of CITY OF CHICAGO, etc. Already captured. Entry 5: MOTION to Appear Pro Hac Vice for Cortney Robinson (Filing fee). Also Entry 3: Consent MOTION for Leave to File Excess Pages by CITY OF CHICAGO, etc. That's more appearances.\n\nAlso Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief had counsel for Plaintiffs: CORTNEY ROBINSON*, CHRISTINE L. COOGLE, DEMOCRACY FORWARD FOUNDATION. So there are at least 3 Plaintiff counsel: Cortney Robinson, Christine L. Coogle, and maybe others? But the requirement says each side's counsel separately; \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'\". So we need to list each side separately. So we should have two values: Plaintiff: Private counsel (list of counsel). But maybe we need separate entries for each counsel? The instruction: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'\". It doesn't say separate per attorney. So we can combine counsel for a side into one value string? But we need distinct values of the checklist item. Might mean each side's counsel as one value, but potentially multiple counsel names in parentheses. The example: \"Plaintiff: …\" and \"Defendant: …\". The \"type of counsel\" refers to categories: private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se, etc. So we should identify type per side. For Plaintiff side: private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation). For Defendant side: private counsel (Joel L McElvain). But we also have \"CORTNEY ROBINSON\" and \"CHRISTINE L. COOGLE\" as private counsel, but they are part of the same firm? They are likely private counsel as well. So we might list: Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation, Cortney Robinson, Christine L. Coogle). But the requirement: \"including specific organizations in parentheses when available\". So we can mention Democracy Forward Foundation. The attorneys names are private counsel but not organization. So we could mention \"Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\".\n\nThus we already have two values: Defendant: Private counsel (Joel L McElvain) and Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation). But we may need to add another value for Plaintiff: Private counsel (Cortney Robinson) and Plaintiff: Private counsel (Christine L. Coogle) individually? But that's not per side. The spec says separate value per side. So only two. But the extracted values list has 3 values but only shows 2. Maybe missing a third - maybe a new value for plaintiff if there is a public interest nonprofit? Check the docket: \"CITY OF CHICAGO, DOCTORS FOR AMERICA, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE, CITY OF COLUMBUS, MAIN STREET ALLIANCE.\" These are entities but not counsel. The \"NOTICE of Appearance by Christine L Coogle, Coogl on behalf of All Plaintiffs\" indicates her counsel. There's also \"NOTICE of Appearance by Joel L McElvain on behalf of CITY OF CHICAGO, CITY OF COLUMBUS, DOCTORS FOR AMERICA, MAIN STREET ALLIANCE, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE\" indicates his counsel.\n\nAdditionally, \"MOTION to Appear Pro Hac Vice for Cortney Robinson\" indicates his presence. So we might have separate value for defendant: Private counsel (Joel L McElvain). But we might need to add \"Defendant: Private counsel (Cortney Robinson)\"? No, Cortney is plaintiff.\n\nThus likely only two distinct values. But the extraction says 3 values; maybe one is from the complaint: \"Counsel for Plaintiffs: CORTNEY ROBINSON*, CHRISTINE L. COOGLE (BAR NO. 21846) DEMOCRACY FORWARD FOUNDATION\". That includes 3 names. But maybe the system counts each counsel separately. But spec says each side separate. So I'd produce 2 values.\n\nBut we have 3 values currently? Let's check: The appended checklist had 3 values? Wait step 43: \"append_checklist\" (Type_of_Counsel) → Successfully appended 1 key: Type_of_Counsel. Extracted Values: • Type_of_Counsel: → Value 1: \"Defendant: Private counsel (Joel L McElvain)\" → Value 2: \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". That's 2 values. But the earlier status says 3 values extracted. Maybe miscount.\n\nNow we need to ensure all distinct values captured. Are there any other counsel? Let's search \"Counsel for\" in Docket for other appearances. There's \"NOTICE of Appearance by Christine L Coogle, Coogl on behalf of All Plaintiffs\" - that's plaintiff counsel. Already captured maybe. But we might need to reflect this as a separate value? But it's same side, same category. The requirement: For each side, extract each as separate value. So we don't need separate entries per counsel. So still 2.\n\nBut maybe there is also \"Defendant: Private counsel (Cortney Robinson)\"? Wait Cortney is plaintiff. So no.\n\nAlso maybe \"All Plaintiffs\" includes multiple organizations; we might need to list \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation, Cortney Robinson, Christine L. Coogle)\". That would be one value. We already include Democracy Forward Foundation.\n\nBut the requirement: \"including specific organizations in parentheses when available\". So we should list the organization names: \"Democracy Forward Foundation\". The attorneys names may not be organizations, but still private counsel. So it's fine.\n\nThus we have two values.\n\nCheck if any other parties: \"CORTNEY ROBINSON\" is an attorney, but not an organization. \"CHRISTINE L. COOGLE\" also attorney. \"Democracy Forward Foundation\" is an organization.\n\nSo the final checklist should have 2 values. But our current extracted list has 2 values. So we might be done. But the status says 3 values extracted. There might be an extra value: maybe \"Defendant: Private counsel (Joel L McElvain)\" + \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\" + \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Cortney Robinson)\"? But that would be two plaintiff values. But spec says separate value per side. So likely not.\n\nThus we have all distinct values: two.\n\nBut we must confirm there's no other counsel type e.g., public interest nonprofit. Search for \"public interest\". Let's search in Docket. But we already have a docket with many names; maybe there is \"CORTNEY ROBINSON\" is private counsel. No other counsel type appears. So we can stop.\n\nBut we must ensure that the checklist is complete: 1 key: Type_of_Counsel, with 2 values. We must verify with get_checklist.

But we have 3 values? The appended values include Defendant: Private counsel (Joel L McElvain) and Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation). That's 2, but they said 3 values. Maybe there's another? Let's check earlier: In step 44, it says 3 values. Maybe the third value is from Docket? Wait, step 43 appended 1 key: Type_of_Counsel. It lists Value 1: Defendant: Private counsel (Joel L McElvain) with evidence from Docket. Value 2: Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation) with evidence from Complaint. That's 2 values. But they listed 3 values? The description says 3 values. Possibly they appended a third value earlier from other doc. But not shown. But check: earlier, step 10 appended 1 value: maybe that was Plaintiff: ...? Then step 32 updated the key. Hard to know. But current status says 3 values.\n\nGoal: We must ensure we capture all distinct values. We need to examine the remaining partially visited documents to see if any additional counsel representations exist. The Docket partially visited: tokens 0-1051, 1643-1843. We saw entries for appearances by Joel L McElvain and Christine L Coogle. Christine L Coogle appears on behalf of All Plaintiffs. That indicates a counsel for plaintiffs: Christine L Coogle (private counsel). Also, earlier, we saw \"MOTION to Appear Pro Hac Vice for Cortney Robinson\" by City of Chicago etc., but that's not counsel. But \"Cortney Robinson\" might be counsel for plaintiffs? Actually, Coultons: \"Cortney Robinson\" appears as \"Pro Hac Vice\". But maybe not. But we should confirm.\n\nAlso need to check if there are other counsel names. The Complaint likely lists counsel for plaintiffs: \"CORTNEY ROBINSON*\" and \"CHRISTINE L. COOGLE\". Both are private counsel. The Docket also lists appearances for these individuals. So we need to extract counsel for plaintiffs: private counsel (Cortney Robinson) and private counsel (Christine L Coogle). Also maybe other counsel for defendants? The Complaint might list counsel for defendants? Not sure. The Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief may not include counsel for defendants. But Docket shows appearances by Joel L McElvain on behalf of defendants. Also, who else? The Docket shows \"NOTICE of Appearance by Christine L Coogle, Coogl on behalf of All Plaintiffs\". So we have two plaintiff counsel. The Docket also shows \"NOTICE of Appearance by Joel L McElvain on behalf of CITY OF CHICAGO, CITY OF COLUMBUS, DOCTORS FOR AMERICA, MAIN STREET ALLIANCE, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE\". That's defendant counsel. Also \"MOTION to Appear Pro Hac Vice for Cortney Robinson\" maybe indicates that Cortney Robinson is a private counsel appearing pro hac vice? That might be a motion to appear for a private attorney, so that could be considered plaintiff counsel as well. But it's a motion to appear, not the counsel representation. But we should check the Complaint for counsel names. The Complaint maybe lists counsel for plaintiffs.\n\nThus the missing values: Plaintiff: Private counsel (Cortney Robinson). Also maybe Plaintiff: Private counsel (Christine L. Coogle). The earlier appended value might have only included one of them. Let's check the earlier appended values: step 43 had Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation) - but that is a firm name, not a person? Wait, that lists \"Democracy Forward Foundation\" as counsel? Actually, the text: \"Counsel for Plaintiffs CORTNEY ROBINSON* CHRISTINE L. COOGLE (BAR NO. 21846) DEMOCRACY FORWARD FOUNDATION\". So it lists both the attorneys and the firm. The value appended was \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\" but that lumps both attorneys under the firm. We need to capture each distinct value. The requirement: \"The type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available (e.g., Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)). If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to list each side's counsel type. We could list:\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Cortney Robinson)\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Christine L. Coogle)\n- Defendant: Private counsel (Joel L McElvain)\n\nBut is Cortney Robinson and Christine L Coogle separate? They are both private counsel. The value \"Democracy Forward Foundation\" is the firm. But maybe we should list \"private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\" as the firm. But the instruction says include specific organizations in parentheses when available. So we could list \"Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\" as the counsel type. And for individuals, we could list \"Private counsel (Cortney Robinson)\" etc. But we need to ensure each distinct value. The earlier appended value lumps all counsel under one value. We need to update accordingly.\n\nThus we need to replace the current Type_of_Counsel list with the correct set. We must use update_checklist to replace the entire list for Type_of_Counsel.\n\nWe have evidence for each value: from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: page 30, tokens 13485-13599. That covers the counsel names. Also from Docket: tokens 0-754 includes appearances. So we need evidence for each.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist for Type_of_Counsel with four entries: Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation), Plaintiff: Private counsel (Cortney Robinson), Plaintiff: Private counsel (Christine L. Coogle), Defendant: Private counsel (Joel L McElvain). Provide evidence for each.\n\nWe must ensure not to duplicate. Provide evidence token ranges.\n\nWe have evidence for the first three from Complaint. For the fourth from Docket. So we need evidence for each.\n\nThus we will call update_checklist. We'll include patch with key Type_of_Counsel and extracted array with four entries.\n\nWe'll craft evidence: For value 1: \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\" evidence: text snippet from Complaint: \"DEMOCRACY FORWARD FOUNDATION\". Provide source_document \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location \"Page 30 (tokens 13485-13599)\".\n\nFor value 2: \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Cortney Robinson)\" evidence: snippet \"CORTNEY ROBINSON*\" from same page.\n\nFor value 3: \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Christine L. Coogle)\" evidence: snippet \"CHRISTINE L. COOGLE\" from same page.\n\nFor value 4: \"Defendant: Private counsel (Joel L McElvain)\" evidence: snippet from Docket: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Joel L McElvain on behalf of CITY OF CHICAGO, ...\" provide location tokens 0-754.\n\nThus call update_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"DEMOCRACY FORWARD FOUNDATION\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 30 (tokens 13485-13599)\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Cortney Robinson)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"CORTNEY ROBINSON*\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 30 (tokens 13485-13599)\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Christine L.

According to current status, 4 values extracted: 3 plaintiff counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation, Cortney Robinson, Christine L. Coogle) and 1 defendant counsel (Joel L McElvain). Are there any other counsel? Perhaps other parties like government counsel? The Docket shows \"NOTICE of Appearance by Joel L McElvain on behalf of ...\". That is defendant counsel. The Complaint shows plaintiff counsel.\n\nWhat about other documents: Untitled Document maybe contains something? We should inspect it. Also Docket partially visited; maybe there are other counsel entries. The Docket has some tokens 0-1051, 1643-1843. We haven't seen any other counsel. But we might search Docket for \"Counsel for\" again but we already did earlier; no matches. But we may want to read the rest of Docket to confirm no other counsel. Similarly, Memorandum Opinion partially visited; maybe it has counsel info? But earlier we searched for counsel for, found matches? We saw matches for \"Counsel for\" in Memorandum Opinion but the snippet didn't show counsel names. The search returned a match but the context snippet didn't show counsel names. Likely there is counsel for defendant in Memorandum Opinion? But earlier we saw the docket had counsel for defendant; the memorandum might be opinion of court, not counsel. So likely no counsel names.\n\nUntitled Document: unknown; maybe contains \"NOTICE of Appearance\" or other counsel. We should read it. So next action: read Untitled Document (full 832 tokens). That will ensure no missing counsel. Also maybe Docket still partially visited; but we saw tokens 0-1051, 1643-1843; we might want to read rest of Docket to ensure no counsel. But we already searched for \"Counsel for\" across all documents and only found matches in Complaint and Memorandum Opinion. But the search didn't find in Docket; but maybe counsel info is not in \"Counsel for\" phrasing. For defendant counsel, we saw \"NOTICE of Appearance by Joel L McElvain on behalf of CITY OF CHICAGO...\". That might not be captured by \"Counsel for\" pattern. But we have that.

We have one key, it has values. Are we sure all possible values are extracted? The instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We need to ensure we captured all distinct values. The docket had 1 value for defendant private counsel. The complaint had 3 values for plaintiff counsel: democracy forward foundation, cortney robinson, christine l. coogle. Are there any other counsel entries in other documents? The Memorandum Opinion may also mention counsel. It had matches for Counsel for Defendant. Let's inspect. The search results earlier found matches for \"Counsel for Defendant\" in Memorandum Opinion tokens 33200-34000, etc. The appended values 4 already include defendant counsel. But maybe the memorandum has additional counsel. We haven't read that portion fully. The docket partially visited; we read 0-754 tokens. We saw the defendant counsel. But maybe docket has other counsel entries? The docket might have multiple entries. We only read first 754 tokens. The docket is 3,781 tokens, partially visited: 0-1051, 1643-1843. We read 0-754. There are still tokens 754-1051 and 1051-1643 and 1843-... We should search for \"Counsel for\" in docket to see if any other counsel. The earlier search with \"Counsel for\" found no matches. But maybe we didn't search whole docket. The search_document_regex on Docket (pattern: \"Counsel for\") returned no matches. but maybe we need to search for other patterns like \"Counsel for Plaintiff\". But the complaint already covers plaintiff counsel. But maybe docket includes attorney names that are not captured. But the requirement says extract type of counsel from legal documents. If docket also lists counsel for plaintiff or defendant, we need to capture. But we only have one entry for defendant from docket. The complaint has plaintiff counsel. So we likely have all.\n\nBut the memorandum opinion might list counsel for defendant or plaintiff. The search results earlier indicated \"Counsel for Defendant\" matches.

Maybe there is counsel for other parties in docket or memorandum. We could search for \"Counsel for\" in Docket further, maybe there is \"Counsel for Respondent\". Also in Memorandum Opinion maybe \"Counsel for the Defendant\" etc. Let's search all documents for \"Counsel for\" again, maybe see matches.\n\nBut we saw earlier search_document_regex found matches: 1 in Complaint, 1 in Memorandum Opinion, 0 in Docket.

We can read remaining parts of Docket beyond 1843 to 3781. We have partially visited 0-1051 and 1643-1843. So we have not read 1843-3781. Let's read that to see if other counsel.

But we need to read more of the Memorandum Opinion to find other counsel. Maybe we should read more sections of Memorandum Opinion, like near the beginning or near the end. Let's search for \"Counsel for\" again in Memorandum Opinion. Use search_document_regex with doc_name \"Memorandum Opinion\" for pattern \"Counsel for\". It will return top matches with context.

However maybe there are additional plaintiffs with counsel indicated. Let's check if the complaint includes counsel for other individuals beyond those three. But we saw \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" list of those three. There might be other counsel for other parties like \"Counsel for Respondent\" maybe not.\n\nThus likely all counsel captured.

We need to read more of Memorandum Opinion to capture counsel for each side. The docket already has counsel names. But we need distinct types of counsel: plaintiff and defendant. In docket, we have multiple attorneys listed: City of Chicago, City of Columbus, Doctors for America, Main Street Alliance, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, Mehmet Oz, United States Department of Health and Human Services. Those are entities, not counsel. We need to identify counsel representing the parties. The docket shows appearances by attorneys: Zachary W. Sherwood on behalf of CMS, etc. But we need categories: private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se. In the Complaint, likely counsel for plaintiff: Joel McElvain? Actually the complaint possibly lists counsel for plaintiff: Joel McElvain? We saw \"Counsel for\" match in complaint. We need to read that portion fully. But the complaint was fully visited, but we didn't see evidence yet for counsel. We need to locate the \"Counsel for\" match and read it.

We need to read that portion. Let's find the token range of that match: We don't have the range. We could search again with a more specific pattern: \"Counsel for\" in Complaint. But we already did and found 1 match. We need to read that window. Let's do search_document_regex for \"Counsel for\" with context 200 tokens in Complaint. Then we can read the snippet. However we already saw that the match included \"Counsel for\" but no name. Might be \"Counsel for Plaintiff: Joel McElvain\" etc. We need to read. So next action: search_document_regex again in Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief with pattern \"Counsel for\" to get context.

We have partially visited Memorandum Opinion: tokens 33159-34000, 38535-38735. Not searched for counsel. We need to find all counsel types. The last search on Memorandum Opinion for \"Counsel for\" returned a match but the snippet didn't include counsel. The snippet shows only some text unrelated to counsel. It seems the match was not at counsel. Maybe earlier search found \"Counsel for Defendant\" but maybe the context was not captured.\n\nWe need to read more of Memorandum Opinion near the match at tokens 33309-33509 to see if counsel is mentioned. But the snippet didn't show counsel. Maybe counsel is mentioned elsewhere in the document. We should search for \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" or \"Counsel for Defendants\" etc. We have already searched for \"Counsel for\" and found matches, but they didn't show counsel details? The first match in Complaint for Declaratory shows counsel names. That yielded 3 values: likely Plaintiff counsel: \"CORTNEY ROBINSON*  CHRISTINE L. COOGLE (BAR NO. 21846)  DEMOCRACY FORWARD FOUNDATION\". And maybe also \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\", maybe two counsel? Actually the snippet shows:\n\n```\nCORTNEY ROBINSON*  \nCHRISTINE L. COOGLE (BAR NO. 21846) \nDEMOCRACY FORWARD FOUNDATION  \n...\nCounsel for Plaintiffs  \n*Pro hac vice motion pending\n```\n\nSo it's likely two counsel names: CORTNEY ROBINSON and CHRISTINE L. COOGLE. That's two entries maybe? But we have 3 values from Complaint. Maybe also a third counsel? Let's examine snippet: after names there is \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" but maybe also \"Counsel for Defendants\" is present somewhere else? But earlier we had no match for Counsel for Defendant in Complaint. So maybe there's only plaintiffs counsel.\n\nAlso we have 1 value from Docket? The Docket might mention counsel: maybe \"Counsel for Defendant: ...\" We didn't see. The Docket had no matches for \"Counsel for\". But earlier we had search for \"Counsel for Defendant\" in Docket and got no matches. So maybe Docket has no counsel. But the status says 1 value from Docket. Maybe earlier we appended from Docket? Actually step 10 appended 1 value for 1 key: Type_of_Counsel. That might have been from Docket? Wait Step 10 after search_document_regex on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (pattern \"Counsel for\") we appended 1 value. That might have been from Complaint. Step 43 appended 2 values for 1 key: Type_of_Counsel. Step 45 updated 4 values. So we now have 4 values: maybe 2 from Complaint (Cortney and Christine) and 2 from Docket? But Docket had no counsel matches. So maybe Docket includes counsel? Let's search Docket again for \"Counsel for\" but we saw no matches. Hmm.\n\nWe need to ensure we have all counsel types. We might need to read more of Memorandum Opinion to find counsel. The match earlier didn't include counsel. Maybe counsel is mentioned earlier or later. Let's search again for \"Counsel for\" with context in Memorandum Opinion. Use search_document_regex on Memorandum Opinion. But we already did search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"Counsel for\" and got matches: 2 matches: one in Complaint, one in Memorandum Opinion. But the snippet didn't include counsel. That suggests the match maybe inside a paragraph referencing counsel but not the names. But we need names.\n\nBetter to read the region around that match: tokens 33309-33509. That is near the start of the document? Actually Memorandum Opinion is 43k tokens. So 33k is near the middle. Let's read that region. Use read_document on Memorandum Opinion tokens 33200-34000 (already read). The snippet earlier didn't show counsel. Let's read further earlier or later around that region to find counsel. Maybe counsel names appear at the very beginning of the opinion? Let's search for \"Counsel\" alone. Use search_document_regex on Memorandum Opinion pattern \"Counsel\" maybe with IGNORECASE.

We have 4 documents. Already extracted 4 values: 3 from Complaint, 1 from Docket. But we need to confirm if any other values exist, especially from Memorandum Opinion which is partially visited. Also maybe from Untitled Document? But Untitled Document might not contain counsel info. Let's examine the Document list.\n\nWe have Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (fully visited). Let's see the extracted values from that: The snippet from Step 51 shows Counsel for Plaintiffs with names: CORTNEY ROBINSON*, CHRISTINE L. COOGLE (BAR NO. 21846) DEMOCRACY FORWARD FOUNDATION. That indicates type: \"Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\" maybe. But we have 3 values: 3 from Complaint, 1 from Docket. We need confirm what those 3 are. Let's open the Complaint full text in the snippet? We only saw snippet of Counsel for Plaintiffs. There might also be counsel for Defendants? We need to search. Let's search the Complaint again for \"Counsel for Defendant\" pattern. Step 8 had no matches. So maybe no counsel for defendants. But there might be counsel for plaintiffs and maybe \"Counsel for the Plaintiffs\" as \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" is a category. We need to extract distinct values. So from Complaint we might have:\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation) (Cortney Robinson, Christine L. Coogle)\n\nBut there might be multiple counsel: Cortney Robinson? Possibly representing plaintiffs. Also maybe \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" could list multiple names. We saw 3 names: Cortney Robinson*, Christine L. Coogle (BAR NO. 21846), Democracy Forward Foundation. The text also includes \"jmcelvain@democracyforward.org crhenderson@democracyfoward.org ccoogle@democracyfoward.org\". So we have 3 counsel. But we may need to extract each as separate value? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence. Each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context included.\" So we need separate entries for each distinct value. Each value could be \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\"? But we might need to differentiate counsel for plaintiff vs defendant. The instructions: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So we need to produce separate entries: \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\" and maybe \"Defendant: ...\" if present.\n\nBut we have 4 values extracted: 3 from Complaint, 1 from Docket. Maybe the 3 from Complaint are: \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\", \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Cortney Robinson?)\", \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Christine L. Coogle)\". But perhaps we should group them? The instructions: \"The type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available.\" So we should format like \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\" and maybe \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Cortney Robinson)\"? But the example shows category label plus organization. So maybe \"Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\" is enough; we don't need separate for each counsel. Probably multiple counsel for plaintiffs but same category. But we need to extract distinct values. Each distinct value might be \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Democracy Forward Foundation)\". If there are multiple categories, we list each.\n\nLet's check Docket. Step 11 and others didn't find counsel. But maybe Docket has counsel. Step 11 says \"search_document_regex\" on Docket (pattern: \"Counsel for\") → No matches. But maybe there is counsel info elsewhere. But the current extraction shows 1 value from Docket. How? Maybe we read earlier some part of Docket where counsel info appears. But Step 11 got no matches. So maybe the Docket has counsel info but not matched because of case sensitivity or pattern? But we already used search pattern \"Counsel for\" which should match. But maybe the Docket has \"Counsel\" but not \"Counsel for\"? We need to examine Docket content. Let's read Docket partially. The Docket is 3781 tokens. We have read 0-754 (Step 40) and 1843-3781 (Step 48) and 1051-1643 (Step 49). So we have read all tokens 0-3781? Actually we read 0-754, 1051-1643, and 1843-3781. That covers all ranges except 754-1051 and 1643-1843. Those ranges were not read. So some tokens remain unread. We need to check if \"Counsel\" appears in those ranges. We should read those ranges.\n\nLet's read Docket tokens 754-1051 and 1643-1843. Also 1643-1843 we read? Step 49 read 1051-1643, step 48 read 1843-3781. So missing 754-1051 and 1643-1843.\n\nWe should read those ranges to confirm counsel info. Also maybe the Docket has counsel for defendants or plaintiffs.

This shows defendants include \"United States Department of Health and Human Services\" and \"U.S. Attorney\" etc. But counsel might be listed elsewhere in Docket.

But the search results that we saw in the recent actions show only 1 match in Memorandum Opinion for \"Counsel for\". That match likely is the same as the earlier one. So no new counsel. So we likely have all.\n\nThus the next action: stop.\n\nBut we must be careful: The instructions say \"Stop when every key is complete or Not Applicable, or no further progress is possible.\" Here we have 1 key with 4 values, which is presumably complete. But we need to be sure that we have extracted all distinct values. The prior steps show 4 values. We can use get_checklist to confirm. But the current status says 4 values. So yes.\n\nThus we should stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items have been extracted with complete evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items have been extracted with complete evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10723, "completion_tokens": 896, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
