That includes remedies: declare, vacate and set aside, stay effective date, enjoin defendants, award costs, grant other relief. Also earlier there might be other remedies in other parts of complaint not read. The complaint likely has other remedies earlier. Also memo may have requested relief. We should search for “prayer for relief” or “relief” patterns. But we can directly search regex for \"prayer for relief\" and \"remedy\" or \"relief\" patterns. Also for \"order that\" etc.\n\nWe should use search_document_regex to find all matches for pattern like \"(Plaintiff|Defendant) (prays|asks|seeks|requests|wants)\". But reading the complaint may have a paragraph listing remedies. Also other documents like docket may have settlement. But we only need remedies as requested by parties. So we should search across all documents for \"pray that\" or \"request that\" etc. Use regex: \"(?:Plaintiff|Defendant).*?(?:prays|asks|requests|seeks|wants).*?that\". Might be heavy.\n\nAlternatively, read entire complaint again near the prayer for relief. Already have lines 83-88. That gives 6 items. We should confirm if other remedies appear earlier: maybe the complaint earlier lists \"seek declaratory relief\" etc. That might be in the beginning of the complaint. We can search for \"declare\" or \"vacate\" etc. But we have covers 83-88.

We have read some parts of Complaint. The prayer for relief lists several remedies. We need each requested remedy separately, formatted as 'Plaintiff: [remedy]' or 'Defendant: [remedy]'.\n\nWe have already read tokens 12785-13599, which includes the prayer for relief lines 83-88. We saw remedies: declare, vacate and set aside, stay effective date, preliminarily and permanently enjoin, award costs, attorneys’ fees, disbursements, grant other relief.\n\nAlso earlier maybe there is mention of remedy in other documents. But we should focus on the complaint. The plaintiff seeks those remedies. So we need to extract each remedy as separate value, with evidence.\n\nWe need to provide append_checklist with key Remedy_Sought, extracted list entries. Each entry contains value: e.g., \"Plaintiff: declare that the provisions of the 2025 Rule identified in Counts I and II are arbitrary, capricious, without observance of proper procedure, or otherwise not in accordance with law under the Administrative Procedure Act\" etc. But we should keep each remedy as a distinct value. We could include the full remedy description or just the summary? The requirement: \"Formatted as: 'Plaintiff: [remedy]' or 'Defendant: [remedy]'.\"\n\nSo we need to create entries like \"Plaintiff: declare that the provisions of the 2025 Rule identified in Counts I and II are arbitrary, capricious, without observance of proper procedure, or otherwise not in accordance with law under the Administrative Procedure Act\" etc.\n\nWe must include evidence: text snippet, source_document, location. For each remedy, we can provide snippet lines from the prayer for relief. The snippet we have is tokens 13176-13376 includes the prayer. We saw lines 83-88. We might need to read further tokens to capture all lines. The snippet from read_document includes tokens 12785-13599, which covers prayer lines 83-88. So we can use that as evidence.\n\nWe should produce append_checklist with multiple entries for the same key Remedy_Sought.\n\nWe need to ensure each entry has evidence array with at least one evidence. The snippet can be the snippet that includes the remedy. We need to show location: page 29-30? The snippet includes page 29 of 30. So location: \"Page 29-30\" or \"Page 29 of 30\".\n\nGiven the snippet we have: start token 12785 to 13599. So we can use that as source. For each remedy, we can provide evidence snippet from that range. For simplicity, we can provide the same snippet for all remedies, but it's okay.\n\nBetter to provide distinct snippets: maybe we can copy each specific remedy text from the snippet.\n\nLet's check snippet: lines 83-88:\n\n```\n83. declare that the provisions of the 2025 Rule identified in Counts I and II are\narbitrary, capricious, without observance of proper procedure, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law under the Administrative Procedure Act; \n84. vacate and set aside the provisions of the 2025 Rule identified in Counts I and II\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act; \n85. stay the effective date of the provisions of the 2025 Rule identified in Counts I\nand II under 5 U.S.C. § 705; \n86. preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from implementing the\nprovisions identified in Counts I and II; \n87. award Plaintiffs their costs, attorneys’ fees, and other disbursements for this\naction; and  \n88. grant such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.\n```\n\nWe need to format each as \"Plaintiff: declare ...\", \"Plaintiff: vacate and set aside ...\", etc.\n\nThus we need 6 entries.\n\nAlso, maybe there are other remedies requested in other documents, like the Memorandum Opinion? But that's an opinion, not a request. The memorandum likely contains a court opinion, not a request.\n\nThus we have 6 remedy entries.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't duplicate. Provide evidence snippet.\n\nWe need to call append_checklist with patch key Remedy_Sought, extracted array of entries.\n\nLet's construct entries:\n\nValue: \"Plaintiff: declare that the provisions of the 2025 Rule identified in Counts I and II are arbitrary, capricious, without observance of proper procedure, or otherwise not in accordance with law under the Administrative Procedure Act\"\n\nEvidence: text snippet containing that line. location: \"Page 29 of 30\" or \"Page 29-30\". source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". offset tokens: maybe 13176-13376. But we can just provide location \"Page 29 of 30\" and token range.\n\nSimilarly for vacate: \"Plaintiff: vacate and set aside the provisions of the 2025 Rule identified in Counts I and II under the Administrative Procedure Act\"\n\nStay: \"Plaintiff: stay the effective date of the provisions of the 2025 Rule identified in Counts I and II under 5 U.S.C. § 705\"\n\nEnjoin: \"Plaintiff: preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from implementing the provisions identified in Counts I and II\"\n\nCosts: \"Plaintiff: award Plaintiffs their costs, attorneys’ fees, and other disbursements for this action\"\n\nOther relief: \"Plaintiff: grant such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper\"\n\nThat's 6.\n\nWe will use the snippet from the prayer for relief. For each, we might use a shorter snippet containing the relevant line. For simplicity, we can use the full snippet lines for each, but we need evidence text exactly. We'll capture the relevant lines for each remedy.\n\nWe have the snippet in the read_document: tokens 12785-13599. The snippet includes lines 83-88. So we can extract those lines.\n\nWe can provide evidence text for each remedy as the line(s). Provide location token range maybe 13176-13376 covers all prayer lines. But to keep consistent, we can use that range.\n\nThus we need to call append_checklist.\n\nNow produce function call.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist

The Docket might list \"motion for stay\" but that is a request. But we might ignore docket because it's not a document containing the request text. But maybe the docket includes \"Motion for Stay\" but not the content.\n\nThus we might be done.\n\nBut check if any other documents contain \"remedy\" context like \"request\" or \"seek\" not found earlier. But earlier search with pattern \"(Plaintiff|Defendant) seeks[^.]+\\.\" found none. So likely no other remedies.\n\nThus we should stop.\n\nBut must verify that all keys are complete: We have one key Remedy_Sought with 6 values. That seems complete. But we might double-check if there are any other remedies like \"preliminary injunction\" already included as \"preliminarily and permanently enjoin\". That covers injunction.\n\nThus all good.\n\nWe should return stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All requested remedies have been extracted from the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief; no other documents contain additional remedies sought.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All requested remedies have been extracted from the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief; no other documents contain additional remedies sought.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7242, "completion_tokens": 641, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The system says we have extracted 6 remedies from complaint. We need to check if any other documents contain additional remedies sought. The documents: Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, Untitled Document (order), Docket. The remedy sought should be from pleadings or motions, not orders. The order document may contain the \"motion for clarification\" etc. But those are orders, not remedies sought. Remedy sought is what parties ask the court to grant, not what the court ultimately ordered or settled. The order may contain \"motion for clarification\" but that's not remedy sought, it's a motion. Also the order includes \"Plaintiffs' motion for a stay ... is granted in part and denied in part.\" That might represent the remedy sought: a stay. But the order is the actual order, not the remedy sought. Remedy sought should be in pleadings or motions. Did the docket include any motions? The docket may have motions. We need to search docket for \"prayer for relief\" or \"remedy\" maybe. But we have not searched docket. The docket is unvisited. The memorandum opinion likely contains the court's decision, not remedy sought. But maybe the memorandum opinion contains the \"remedies\" the parties requested? Usually the memorandum opinion is the judge's opinion, not the parties' requests. However, sometimes the memorandum includes the \"remedy\" in the context of \"the court's findings\" etc. But the requirement says we should extract the remedies each party asks the court to grant, not what the court ordered. So we should only extract from pleadings or motions where parties ask for relief. The complaint is a pleading; also there may be other pleadings or motions.\n\nWe have Untitled Document: it's an order. So not relevant.\n\nWe may need to check the Docket for motions or pleadings. The docket could include \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" etc. But the docket might not contain the text of the motion, just docket entries. But still if docket has the title \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Stay\" etc, that might count as remedy sought? The requirement says: \"Extract the remedies each party asks the court to grant, not what the court ultimately ordered or what the parties settled. Include requests from both plaintiffs and defendants.\" It doesn't specifically say the remedy must be in the pleading; but the remedy sought is the request. Docket entries might summarize the request. But we should verify that the remedy is a request. The docket might contain \"Plaintiffs' motion for stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705\" which is a request for a stay. That is a remedy sought. But the docket might not contain full details, but the remedy is the request for a stay. But we need to extract the remedy as a distinct value: \"Plaintiff: stay the effective date of the provisions of the 2025 Rule etc.\" Already extracted.\n\nBut other remedy sought might be from a \"Defendant's Motion to dismiss\" which is a request to dismiss the case. That's a remedy sought. But the complaint we extracted only plaintiffs' remedies. We need to check if there are any defendant remedies sought. The docket may contain \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\" or \"Defendants' Motion to Modify\" etc. The complaint didn't have defendant requests. There may be a \"Defendant's Reply\" or \"Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\" not yet extracted. We need to search the docket for \"Defendant\" or \"defendant\" and \"motion\" or \"remedy\". But we need to see the actual text of the motion, not just docket entry. The docket may not contain the motion text. But we can search the docket for \"Defendant\" and \"motion\" to see if there is a motion to dismiss. But we need to confirm the remedy sought: \"Defendant: dismiss the action\" etc.\n\nBut we might need to read the docket entries to see if there are motions. The docket entries may just list docket numbers and titles. But maybe the docket contains the full text of the motion. Unlikely. But we can search.\n\nAlso the memorandum opinion might contain a summary of the parties' remedies sought, but the requirement says not to extract the court's order or settlement. But the memorandum may include the parties' requests in the context of \"the parties sought\" but that is presumably the same as the complaint's request. But the memorandum's text may mention \"Plaintiffs seek to have the rule declared unconstitutional\" etc. But that would be the same as complaint. So no new remedy.\n\nBut maybe the memorandum includes a \"Defendants seek dismissal\" or \"Defendants seek injunctive relief\" etc. But that is a remedy sought by defendants. So we need to extract that as well. Let's search the memorandum for \"defendant\" and \"seek\" and \"remedy\" etc.\n\nThe user hasn't provided the memorandum text. We have only partial view. The system's current status shows only partial coverage of memorandum. We need to search for patterns. Let's use search_document_regex on the memorandum document for \"Defendant.*seek.*\" or \"Defendants.*seek.*\" pattern. Or for \"Defendants\" followed by any phrase and \"request\" etc.\n\nBut the pattern \"Defendant.*seek.*\" might match a phrase like \"Defendants seek to dismiss the action.\" Let's do that.\n\nWe need to specify doc_name: \"Memorandum Opinion\". We can search pattern: \"(Defendant|Defendants).*seek.*\". Use flags IGNORECASE, MULTILINE. Get context 200. That will show matches. Then read the relevant tokens if needed.\n\nAlso we might search for \"Defendant\" and \"request\" or \"request for\" etc.\n\nWe also need to check the docket.\n\nWe should also search the docket for \"Defendant\" pattern and \"motion\" or \"request\".\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"(Defendant|Defendants).*motion.*\" and maybe also \"Defendant.*request.*\".\n\nWe'll need to read the docket entries.\n\nAlso maybe the complaint includes a \"Defendants\" section? Probably not.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex for the memorandum, then read relevant token ranges if needed. We'll need to extract any remedy sought by defendants.\n\nProceed with search_document_regex on \"Memorandum Opinion\" doc.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\": [\"Memorandum Opinion\"], \"pattern\": \"(Defendant|Defendants).*seek.*\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\", \"MULTILINE\"], \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Memorandum Opinion"], "pattern": "(Defendant|Defendants).*seek.*", "flags": ["IGNORECASE", "MULTILINE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4919, "completion_tokens": 1379, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But we see step 9 was stop, but we still have partially visited other docs. However, the system states all requested remedies extracted. We should verify if Docket contains any remedy requests. But Docket likely has docket entries of motions, e.g., \"motion for stay\" etc. Could contain remedy requests. We should check. Let's search docket for \"stay\", \"injunction\", \"prayer\", \"remedy\". Use search_document_regex on Docket. Not yet visited. So next action: search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"prayer for relief|remedy|stay|injunction\". But we must decide. The system instructions: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either complete or Not Applicable.\" We have 1 key, Remedy_Sought. We think complete. But to be safe, we should check Docket.

The user instruction: \"Extract the remedies sought from the legal documents.\" We have already extracted 6 values from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. But the system said that after step 9 \"stop\" but we are not yet at final. We see that the system has not yet verified if there might be remedies in other documents: \"Memorandum Opinion\" and \"Docket\". The search regex for remedies in Memorandum Opinion found 0 matches for \"(Defendant|Defendants).*seek.*\". Also we performed search for \"remedy\" in Docket and found 0 matches. But maybe in the Complaint there are other remedies beyond the 6 we extracted. The earlier read_document was tokens 12785-14000. The Complaint is 13,599 tokens. We have partial coverage of 12,054-12,254 and 12,585-13,599. That covers token ranges near end of complaint. But we might need to check earlier parts for remedies. The initial search for \"prayer for relief\" found 1 match in Complaint. That likely includes remedies. But we only appended 6 values. But maybe there are more remedies in other parts of the complaint not yet read.\n\nWe need to ensure all distinct remedies are extracted. We have partial coverage of complaint; need to read earlier tokens maybe 10k earlier. Also we have not read the Docket; maybe it contains \"remedy\" earlier. But search found 0 matches. But maybe the Docket includes remedy description but not containing the word \"remedy\" but e.g., \"injunction\" or \"seeking injunctive relief\". We might need to search for \"injunctive\", \"injunction\", \"injunctive relief\", \"injunctive relief\" or \"injunctive\" etc. But the current instruction says to extract remedies sought, not necessarily the word \"remedy\". The tools permit regex search. We can search for \"injunctive\" or \"injunction\" etc.\n\nBut we need to check the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief: the remedy section likely lists \"injunctive relief\" and \"declaratory relief\" and perhaps other orders.\n\nWe already extracted 6 values from the complaint. But we don't know what those 6 are. We need to see the extracted values; not provided. We should request to get the current checklist to see what we have. But we don't need to build new ones if we already have all.\n\nBut we need to confirm if there are any other remedies that might be in the complaint that we haven't extracted. The complaint is partially read; we haven't read earlier tokens 0-12054-12585? The first coverage is 12054-12254 and 12585-13599. The earlier part up to 12054 is not covered. So we should read earlier part. Let's read from 0 to 12054? That is 12054 tokens which is less than 10k. We can request read_document to read tokens 0-12054 of Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. That will give us the earlier parts where remedies might be sought. We'll then examine the returned text for remedy entries.\n\nBut we need to consider that we might also need to read the Docket for any remedy. The search for \"remedy\" found 0 matches, but there could be remedy terms not containing \"remedy\". But likely the Docket is a docket list, not the complaint. So maybe remedies are only in the complaint.\n\nThus, next action: read_document on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief tokens 0-12054. Then we can process.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":12054}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 12054}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4043, "completion_tokens": 810, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
