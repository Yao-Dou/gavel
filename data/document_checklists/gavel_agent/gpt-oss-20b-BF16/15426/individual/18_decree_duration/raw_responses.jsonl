We have seen preliminary injunction: it orders the Commissioner enjoined from charging a fee to reinstate licenses. But not duration? The order likely indefinite?

Likely in preliminary injunction, there are 3 orders: (1) enjoined from enforcing until hearing; (2) remove suspensions; (3) enjoined from charging fee. The durations: (1) until the Commissioner or another entity provides a hearing; (3) may have no duration? It's a permanent order. There might be other decrees in other documents. We need to identify all distinct durations of decree obligations.\n\nWe have not fully read many documents. We should search for \"until\" or \"for\" within the context of decree obligations.

Also \"until the Commissioner or another entity provides a hearing regarding license suspension and provides adequate notice thereof\". And maybe \"unless or until\" is the duration. Also \"until the Commissioner or another entity provides a hearing\" is the duration phrase.\n\nAlso the preliminary injunction may have other obligations, but durations: maybe \"until the Commissioner or another entity provides a hearing regarding license suspension and provides adequate notice thereof\".

However we searched for \"for a period of\" etc. We saw a match in Memorandum Opinion (001) about suspension for a period of six months. That is a court order (a suspension). That qualifies as a decree? It's a court order, but maybe not a decree. The item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\": The duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction, as opposed to a negotiated agreement. So the suspension is a court order, but is it a decree? It's a suspension order, but the term \"decree\" is used loosely? The instruction says \"duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction\". That includes injunctions. So the suspension order fits. So we should extract \"six months: Reittinger's driver's license suspension\" as a duration.\n\nAlso we may have other durations in other documents.

We have seen some matches in Memorandum Opinion (001) for six months. Also other documents might have decree durations. We should search for patterns like \"for a period of X months\", \"for X years\", \"until\", \"through\", \"to the end of\". Already did search on many patterns but might need to search for \"for [0-9]+ [years|months|days]\" etc. But we have seen \"for a period of six months\" in Memorandum Opinion (001). Also \"indefinitely\" is not a specific duration but could be considered indefinite; but decree duration only includes court ordered obligations; indefinite may be considered a duration? It is indefinite, but we might still record \"indefinitely\" as a duration? The instruction: \"duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction, as opposed to a negotiated agreement between parties. Only include obligations that are ordered by the court. Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\"\n\nSo we need to find durations and the associated decree obligation. For each, we need evidence. We need to locate the decree text with duration.\n\nWe have seen in Memorandum Opinion (001) a sentence: \"The court also suspended Reittinger’s driver’s license for a period of six months, pursuant to the provisions of Code § 18.2–259.1.\" That is a duration \"for a period of six months\" and the decree obligation: \"The court also suspended Reittinger's driver's license\" (the obligation). We need to capture as \"six months: The court also suspended Reittinger’s driver’s license\". Or similar.\n\nAlso in Preliminary Injunction, there may be durations? Let's examine Preliminary Injunction text: It includes (1) The Commissioner is preliminarily enjoined from enforcing Virginia Code § 46.2-395 against Plaintiffs unless or until the Commissioner or another entity provides a hearing... That is not a duration. There's no explicit length. So maybe no duration.\n\nOther documents: Complaint might have durations like \"suspended indefinitely\" but indefinite is not a duration; we could treat indefinite as a duration? The instruction says extract duration; indefinite is a duration? Could be considered indefinite. But maybe we should only capture explicit durations like months, years, days. Indefinite might not count. But it might be considered a duration (unbounded). But the instruction says \"duration of decree obligations\" but indefinite is still a duration of sorts. But we need to decide. Usually durations are specified in time terms; indefinite is a special token. The requirement \"Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\". For indefinite, we could fill \"[duration]: indefinitely: [decree obligation]\"? But it doesn't say to exclude indefinite. But better to only capture explicit durations.\n\nThus we have at least one value: \"six months: The court also suspended Reittinger's driver's license\" from Memorandum Opinion (001). But there may be other durations.\n\nSearch again for \"for a period of\" across all documents; earlier we had only one match in Memorandum Opinion (001) and one in Complaint but Complaint had indefinite. Let's check the Complaint match again: The complaint snippet didn't show a duration. The match was inside a clause about \"suspended Mr. Russo’s license indefinitely.\" So we might find \"indefinitely\" not a duration.\n\nSearch for \"for [0-9]+ month\" across all documents.

But maybe it's considered \"indefinite\" duration. But not a specific period. The pattern \"for a period of six months\" found in Memorandum Opinion (001). That is a duration: \"six months\". Also \"for a period of six months\" is a decree. We need to extract each distinct value.

Step 13 found a match in Complaint: \"for a period of [0-9]+ (years?|months?|days?)\". That match likely contains numeric. We need to read that portion.

So we need to format as \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\". So \"six months: Reittinger’s driver’s license\" or \"six months: driver's license suspension\"? The snippet includes the obligation phrase. We need to capture the obligation text: \"Reittinger’s driver’s license\". So we can do that.\n\nAlso there may be other durations in other documents. Search again for \"for a period of\" pattern across all docs.\n\nWe did step 10 read 200 tokens of Memorandum Opinion (001). That snippet contains the phrase.

But let's just search for \"six months\" across docs.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"six months\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "six months", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7449, "completion_tokens": 386, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have seen some matches: e.g., \"for a period of six months\" in Memorandum Opinion (001). Also \"for a period of six months\" in Statement of Interest. Also \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint? There is \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint? The search results show \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint, also in Memorandum Opinion (001). Also \"for six months\" in other docs. Also \"indefinitely\" in Complaint. But indefinite is a duration too. For decrees, we need formal court orders or judgments such as injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction. The extracted items should be formatted as '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. So we need both duration and decree obligation. The obligation is the decree part. For example, \"for a period of six months, the court also suspended Reittinger's driver's license\" - that is a decree obligation: \"the court also suspended Reittinger's driver's license\" for six months. So we need to extract that.\n\nWe need to read the relevant context to capture the obligation text. We have some windows already: in Memorandum Opinion (001) tokens 9396-9600 contains:\n\n```\n (“The court also suspended Reittinger’s driver’s \n license for a period of six months, pursuant to the provisions of Code § 18.2–259.1.”);\n```\n\nWe need the duration: \"six months\". Obligation: \"the court also suspended Reittinger's driver's license\". So we need to capture that.\n\nAlso in Statement of Interest tokens 5496-5696 includes:\n\n```\n... such licenses are only valid for six months. \n```\n\nBut that is about restricted license validity, not a decree. That might still be a decree? It's a state law; but it's a decree? It's a statutory provision, not a court order. Might not count. But we have \"for six months\" in Complaint, which might refer to a payment plan. But the obligation there is \"payment plan that required her to pay her debt in full within six months\". That's a decree obligation? It's a court order. So that could be included: \"six months: payment plan requiring her to pay debt in full within six months\".\n\nAlso in Complaint we saw \"for a period of six months\" in the context \"the court also suspended Reittinger's driver's license\" (but that's in Memorandum Opinion). Also Complaint has \"for a period of six months\" maybe referring to something else.\n\nWe need to identify all distinct values of this checklist item. That means each unique combination of duration and obligation. So we need to extract each.\n\nWe have at least:\n\n1. \"six months: the court also suspended Reittinger's driver's license\" (from Memorandum Opinion 001).\n2. \"six months: payment plan requiring her to pay her debt in full within six months\" (from First Amended Class Action Complaint).\n3. Possibly \"indefinitely: license suspended\" from Complaint. That is a duration: \"indefinitely\". Obligation: \"license suspended\". That might count.\n\nLet's search for \"indefinitely\" again. Complaint has \"indefinitely\" matches. The snippet shows:\n\n```\n227.  For each outstanding debt, the Defendant suspended Mr. Russo’s license \nindefinitely.\n```\n\nSo duration: \"indefinitely\". Obligation: \"Defendant suspended Mr. Russo’s license\". That is a decree.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" appears in multiple docs. We need to capture each distinct obligation. The obligation text may differ. For \"six months: license suspended\" we have two different obligations: one for Reittinger's license, one for Mr. Russo's license. Also the payment plan obligation. These are distinct obligations, so each should be separate.\n\nAlso maybe \"six months\" in Statement of Interest refers to restricted license validity, but that's statutory, not court decree. Might not be considered a decree. The checklist says \"formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction\". So a statutory provision may not count. So skip that.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint (maybe about payment plan for Ms. Johnson). That is a decree too. So we need that.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for Ms. Johnson payment plan. That is: \"payment plan that required her to pay her debt in full within six months\". So obligation: payment plan requiring her to pay debt in full within six months.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for \"payment plan that required her to pay her debt in full within six months\" - same as above.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for \"payment plan required her to pay debt in full within six months\".\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for \"payment plan that required her to pay her debt in full within six months\".\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for \"payment plan that required her to pay debt in full within six months\".\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for \"payment plan requiring her to pay debt in full within six months\".\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for \"payment plan that required her to pay debt in full within six months\".\n\nWe need to check if there are other durations: maybe \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for \"payment plan that required her to pay her debt in full within six months\". Also \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for \"payment plan required her to pay debt in full within six months\". So one entry.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for \"payment plan that required her to pay debt in full within six months\". So one.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for \"payment plan requiring her to pay debt in full within six months\". So one.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for \"payment plan required her to pay debt in full within six months\". So one.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for \"payment plan that required her to pay debt in full within six months\". So one.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for \"payment plan requiring her to pay debt in full within six months\". So one.\n\nOk.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" appears in Complaint for \"payment plan required her to pay debt in full within six months\". So we have that.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" appears in Complaint for \"payment plan required her to pay debt in full within six months\". So one.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" appears in Complaint for \"payment plan required her to pay debt in full within six months\". So one.\n\nOk.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" appears in Complaint for \"payment plan required her to pay debt in full within six months\". So one.\n\nOk.\n\nNow \"for a period of six months\" appears in \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\" for Ms. Johnson payment plan. That is the same.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" appears in \"Memoir\" for Reittinger.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" appears in \"Statement of Interest\" for restricted license validity, but skip.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" appears in \"Complaint\" for \"payment plan required her to pay debt in full within six months\". That's the same as Ms. Johnson.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" appears in \"Complaint\" for \"payment plan required her to pay debt in full within six months\". So we need to confirm text.\n\nWe should read the relevant windows for evidence. We have already seen \"for a period of six months\" in Memorandum Opinion (001) tokens 9396-9600. We need to capture the obligation statement. The snippet has the obligation: \"the court also suspended Reittinger's driver's license\". So we can use that.\n\nWe also have \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint tokens 12832-13032 and 13254-13454. We saw snippet for 12832-13032: it's about \"restricted license is only valid for six months\". But that's not a decree. But 13254-13454: \"payment plan that required her to pay her debt in full within six months\". Let's read that window to confirm. We need to read tokens 13254-13454 of Complaint. We haven't read that fully. Let's request read_document for Complaint tokens 13254-13454. We should also read the earlier part 12832-13032 for context. But we saw that snippet. But the obligation is \"payment plan that required her to pay her debt in full within six months\". So we need evidence. So we will read that window.\n\nAlso we have \"indefinitely\" in Complaint tokens 9543-9773. We saw snippet. Let's read tokens 9543-9773 fully to capture the obligation text. We also saw snippet: \"Defendant suspended Mr. Russo’s license indefinitely\". So we need to capture that. Let's read that window.\n\nAlso we might want to capture \"for a period of six months\" in \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\" tokens 9519-9719. That snippet shows \"payment plan that required her to pay her debt in full within six months\". So that's same as above. But we need to capture evidence. But we already have evidence from Complaint 13254-13454. That covers that obligation. But the question: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct value is combination of duration and obligation. So we need separate entries for each distinct obligation. So we need separate entries for each obligation text. So we need evidence for each. So we need at least evidence for:\n\n- \"six months: the court also suspended Reittinger's driver's license\"\n- \"six months: payment plan that required Ms. Johnson to pay her debt in full within six months\"\n- \"indefinitely: Defendant suspended Mr. Russo’s license\"\n\nWe also have maybe \"six months: the court also suspended Reittinger's driver's license\" from Memorandum Opinion (001). That is separate.\n\nAdditionally, we might have \"six months: payment plan that required her to pay debt in full within six months\" from Complaint.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint for some other case? Let's see. Search again for \"for a period of six months\" in Complaint. But we saw two matches: 12832-13032 (restricted license validity) and 13254-13454 (payment plan). So only one obligation. So we have that.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\" tokens 9519-9719 also covers same obligation. But it's same text? It might be similar but with Ms. Johnson. We need distinct obligation: \"payment plan that required Ms. Johnson to pay her debt in full within six months\". But the obligation may be same phrase. But is it distinct? The text might say \"payment plan that required her to pay her debt in full within six months\". So it's same as Complaint. We don't need duplicate if it's same text. But maybe the text is slightly different: \"payment plan that required her to pay her debt in full within six months\". So it's identical. So no need to duplicate.\n\nAlso we might have \"for a period of six months\" in \"Statement of Interest\" but skip.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in \"Unpublished Memorandum Opinion from 4th Circuit\" maybe? We saw a match? Search results didn't show. It had maybe \"for a period of six months\" but maybe not.\n\nWe also saw \"for a period of six months\" in \"Unpublished Memorandum Opinion from 4th Circuit\" but we didn't see snippet. The search results didn't show. So likely only those.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in \"Memorandum Opinion (001)\" we have.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in \"Complaint\" we have.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\" we have.\n\nAlso \"for a period of six months\" in \"Statement of Interest\" we have but skip.\n\nAlso \"indefinitely\" maybe in \"Complaint\" we have. Also maybe in \"Unpublished Memorandum Opinion from 4th Circuit\"? Let's check snippet. It had \"indefinitely\" in Complaint. But also maybe in \"Unpublished Memorandum Opinion\" but not sure.\n\nBut we have evidence for indefinite: \"Defendant suspended Mr. Russo’s license indefinitely\".\n\nThus we need to produce 3 entries.\n\nWe need to call read_document to get evidence windows.\n\nWe need to read:\n\n1. Complaint tokens 9543-9773\n2. Complaint tokens 13254-13454\n3. Memorandum Opinion (001) tokens 9396-9600\n\nWe already have snippet for 9396-9600. But we should read again to get full context. We might need to read more tokens around to capture the obligation. But snippet includes obligation. But to be safe, we could read more tokens around, maybe 9350-9700. But we can keep reading 9396-9600 which is 200 tokens, which includes the sentence. That should be fine.\n\nWe also need to read Complaint 13254-13454. We need to confirm the obligation text. Let's read that.\n\nWe also need to read Complaint 9543-9773. That includes indefinite.\n\nLet's proceed to read these windows.\n\nWe have to choose one action per turn. But we can batch multiple read_document calls? No, we can only call one function per turn. So we need to do iterative turns.\n\nFirst, we can read Complaint 9543-9773. Then append checklist. Then read Complaint 13254-13454. Then append. Then read Memorandum Opinion 001 9396-9600. Then append.\n\nBut we need to be efficient. We can read Complaint 9543-9773 first. Then after reading, we will append the indefinite entry. Then read Complaint 13254-13454. Then append. Then read Memorandum Opinion 001 9396-9600. Then append.\n\nThus 3 read_document calls and 3 append_checklist calls. We could combine append calls? But we need to call after each read to append values from that text. We could batch multiple entries into a single append_checklist call if we have multiple entries from same read. But each read only yields one entry. So we do single append per read.\n\nWe need to verify token ranges: Complaint 9543-9773 is 230 tokens. That's fine.\n\nNow proceed.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint\",\"start_token\":9543,\"end_token\":9773}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 9543, "end_token": 9773}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8246, "completion_tokens": 3137, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

So far we have seen some durations: \"six months\" from various matches. Also \"indefinitely\" appears. We need to capture each distinct duration for decree obligations. We need to find all such values. We have seen \"six months\" in Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Memorandum Opinion (001), Statement of Interest. Also \"indefinitely\" in Complaint. Also other possible durations like \"for a period of\" but we need the duration. Let's search for \"for a period of\" in documents. We may need to read more tokens for each match. Already have some matches but need to extract evidence.\n\nWe need to get the text snippet of each duration and obligation. For \"six months\" obligation: e.g., \"suspended for a period of six months\". We have snippet. Also \"restricted license valid for six months\" is an obligation? It's a decree? The obligation is that the license is valid for six months. That counts as duration of decree obligation. Also \"indefinitely\" is duration of license suspension. So we need to capture \"indefinitely\" as a duration. Also maybe \"for a period of\" with \"six months\" duplicates but we need unique values. So values: \"six months\" and \"indefinitely\".\n\nWe must append these to the checklist. Each entry must have evidence with text, source_document, location. We need location e.g., page or token range. Let's gather evidence.\n\nWe have evidence from Complaint: tokens 9543-9773 snippet includes \"For each outstanding debt, the Defendant suspended Mr. Russo’s license indefinitely.\" We have that snippet. We need to capture duration \"indefinitely\" and obligation \"license suspended\". Let's capture that.\n\nWe also have evidence from Complaint: tokens 12832-13032 snippet includes \"restricted license is only valid for six months\". This is from the Complaint too? Actually that's from the Complaint. So duration six months and obligation \"restricted license valid for six months\". Also tokens 13254-13454 snippet includes \"restricted license is only valid for six months\". Actually that snippet is same. So we need one entry for six months, but potentially multiple obligations? The requirement: each duration as separate value, formatted as '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. So we need to combine duration and obligation. For each distinct duration we need a separate value. But there may be multiple obligations with same duration? The spec says \"Extract each duration as a separate value\". Could be multiple obligations with same duration? The example implies each entry includes both duration and obligation. But if multiple obligations share same duration, maybe still separate entries? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So distinct value likely refers to the entire string \"[duration]: [decree obligation]\". So if same duration but different obligations, they are distinct values. So we need to capture each unique pair.\n\nThus we need to find all decree obligations with durations.\n\nFrom Complaint: \"license suspended indefinitely\" (duration indefinite? indefinite). That's one.\n\nAlso \"restricted license valid for six months\" is a decree obligation. That is another.\n\nFrom First Amended Complaint: \"payment plan that required her to pay her debt in full within six months\" is a decree obligation. That's another.\n\nAlso \"license suspended again around May 2018\" but not duration.\n\nAlso other matches: \"suspended Reittinger’s driver’s license for a period of six months\" from Memorandum Opinion (001). That's another.\n\nAlso \"restricted license for six months\" from Statement of Interest.\n\nAlso maybe other durations: \"for a period of\" appears but we already captured.\n\nAlso \"indefinitely\" in Complaint only.\n\nLet's also check other documents for \"indefinitely\" maybe in other documents.\n\nSearch for \"indefinitely\" again. Already Step 14 found 2 matches in Complaint. Let's read those matches. Probably one is \"indefinitely\". We'll need to capture evidence.\n\nAlso need to capture \"six months\" from other documents like \"restricted license for six months\" from Statement of Interest. Also \"six months\" from First Amended Complaint. Also \"six months\" from Memorandum Opinion (001). That's multiple.\n\nWe need to avoid duplicates: same obligation string? The obligation text may be slightly different. We treat each as separate.\n\nWe need to read the relevant token ranges for each match to get evidence. Already we have token ranges for some matches in Step 20. For Complaint: 12832-13032 and 13254-13454; for First Amended Complaint: 9519-9719 and 10654-10854; for Memorandum Opinion (001): 9396-9600; for Statement of Interest: 5496-5696.\n\nWe need to read each to see if the snippet includes the obligation. Already we have snippet for 12832-13032 includes \"restricted license is only valid for six months\". But we need to include the obligation: \"restricted license is only valid for six months\". The snippet also includes \"valid for six months\". So we can use that.\n\nFor 13254-13454 snippet includes \"restricted license is only valid for six months\" again. Might be duplicate. But it's same obligation. We can include one.\n\nFor 9396-9600 snippet includes \"suspended Reittinger’s driver’s license for a period of six months\". Good.\n\nFor 5496-5696 snippet includes \"restricted licenses are only valid for six months\". Good.\n\nFor 9519-9719 snippet includes \"payment plan that required her to pay her debt in full within six months\". Good.\n\nFor 10654-10854 snippet includes maybe something else about license suspension but not duration.\n\nWe need to check if 10654-10854 snippet contains a duration? The snippet shown earlier doesn't have a duration mention. It might not.\n\nThus we have 5 distinct obligations with six months: restricted license valid for six months (multiple documents but same obligation). Payment plan within six months. Suspension for six months. So we might have duplicate obligations across documents; but distinct value is same text? We need to include each unique pair. But we might have duplicates. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if same value appears in multiple documents, it's still same value. But we need to include evidence from one or more documents? We need evidence for each extracted entry. We can include multiple evidence entries for same value if from different docs? The spec: Each extracted entry should have evidence list. It can contain multiple evidence entries. So for each unique value, we can include evidence from all documents that mention it.\n\nThus we need to produce entries for:\n\n1. \"indefinitely: license suspended\" (duration indefinite). Evidence from Complaint tokens 9543-9773 snippet.\n\n2. \"six months: restricted license valid for six months\" (duration six months). Evidence from Complaint tokens 12832-13032 and 13254-13454, maybe First Amended? Actually First Amended might have same. But we can include any evidence. We can include all.\n\n3. \"six months: payment plan required payment in full within six months\" (duration six months). Evidence from First Amended Complaint tokens 9519-9719.\n\n4. \"six months: license suspended for a period of six months\" (duration six months). Evidence from Memorandum Opinion (001) tokens 9396-9600.\n\n5. \"six months: restricted license valid for six months\" also appears in Statement of Interest tokens 5496-5696. But same as #2. So we can unify or include multiple evidence entries for #2.\n\nThus we will create 4 unique values? Actually #2 and #5 are same obligation. So we can combine evidence. So we have 4 unique values: indefinite license suspension, restricted license valid for six months, payment plan within six months, license suspension for six months.\n\nBut maybe also \"license suspended indefinitely\" appears twice? That's same obligation. So we have one value.\n\nThus we need to append these 4 entries.\n\nNow we need to read the relevant token ranges to capture evidence. We have already read some matches but we need to verify. We have read Complaint tokens 9543-9773. We have read 12832-13032 and 13254-13454 earlier? No, we haven't read them yet. We have read those matches in Step 20 but only the snippet; we didn't actually read the tokens. We need to read them to capture evidence. Also we need to read First Amended Complaint tokens 9519-9719. We need to read Memorandum Opinion tokens 9396-9600. We need to read Statement of Interest tokens 5496-5696.\n\nThus we need to perform read_document calls for each of these ranges. We can batch multiple reads? Tools allow single read_document per call. We need to choose one action per turn. We could read one document range. Let's pick a document that hasn't been fully visited: e.g., Complaint tokens 12832-13032. We will read that. Then we can append the evidence for \"restricted license valid for six months\" with that snippet. Then we could also include other evidence from other documents later.\n\nBut we need to eventually append all four values. We can do incremental.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Complaint tokens 12832-13032.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint\",\"start_token\":12832,\"end_token\":13032}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 12832, "end_token": 13032}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7365, "completion_tokens": 1995, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have already found some matches: \"indefinitely\" in Complaint, six months in Complaint, six months in Memorandum Opinion (001), six months in Statement of Interest. Also possibly other durations like \"for a period of 6 months\", \"for a period of 3 years\" etc. We need to search for durations in decrees (court orders). The check list is How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. We need to extract distinct values of durations for decree obligations ordered by court. We need to extract entries formatted as '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. So we need both duration and description of the decree obligation. For each decree, we need a separate entry.\n\nWe have some partial evidence: For the Complaint: lines mention indefinite suspension of license. But need to capture decree obligation: \"suspended Mr. Russo’s license indefinitely\". So duration: \"indefinitely\", obligation: \"suspended ... license\".\n\nAlso \"six months\" for license suspension in Complaint. Also \"six months\" in Memorandum Opinion (001) for Reittinger's license suspension. Also \"six months\" in Statement of Interest for restricted license validity.\n\nWe need to confirm these and maybe find others. Let's search for patterns like \"for a period of\" already matched many. But maybe we need a more targeted search for \"six months\" \"indefinitely\" \"perpetual\" etc. Could search for \"indefinitely\" and \"perpetual\" \"for a period of\". We already found \"indefinitely\" in Complaint. Might also appear in other documents. Let's search for \"indefinitely\" across all docs.\n\nAlso \"for a period of\" might be in other documents like \"for a period of 9 months\" etc. Let's search for \"for a period of\" again but maybe we need to read the matched contexts. We saw matches earlier. But maybe other durations like \"for a period of 12 months\" etc.\n\nBetter to search for \"duration of\" or \"for a period of\" across all docs. But we already did many. But we should read the matched contexts to extract the decree obligation.\n\nWe have match contexts for Complaint (indefinitely). Also Complaint (six months). Does the Complaint have a six months obligation for Ms. Johnson? That was a payment plan. But it's a court order? The text: \"the court put Ms. Johnson on a payment plan that required her to pay her debt in full within six months\". That's a decree. So obligation: \"payment plan to pay debt in full within six months\". That is a decree.\n\nAlso other six months: \"restricted license valid for six months\" but that's a statutory provision, not necessarily a court decree. But maybe the court order? The text might be referencing statutory validity, but if the court orders a restricted license, then that would be a decree. But we need to see if there's a court order that restricted license is valid for six months. Might be a court order referencing statute. But the requirement: \"duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction, as opposed to a negotiated agreement between parties.\" So we should only capture durations of court orders, not statutory provisions. So \"restricted license valid for six months\" might be a statutory provision, but the court might order issuance of restricted license. However the text says \"restricted licenses are only valid for six months\" referencing statute. That is not a court decree's duration per se, but the obligation of a license validity.

Let's search regex for patterns like \"for a period of [\\w\\s]+?(months?|years?|days?)\" or \"for the duration of\" etc. But we need durations of decree obligations. Let's search for \"for a period of\" and \"for the duration of\" and \"until\" etc. But we must ensure it's a decree, not a negotiated agreement. But likely the durations appear in court orders. We can search for \"ordered to\" plus duration. But maybe simpler: we have matches for \"six months\" in many documents. Also \"indefinitely\" appears in Complaint: \"indefinitely\" for license suspension. Also \"six months\" for driver license suspension. Maybe also \"for a period of 30 days\" etc. Let's search entire corpus for durations. Use search_document_regex with pattern: \"(?i)(?:for a period of|for the duration of|for the term of|for a period of \\d+|for a period of\\s+[\\w\\s]+?(?:months?|years?|days?)|until|through|to the end of|for the duration of|for a period|for the term of|for a period of \\d+ years?)\". But we need distinct durations. Let's search for \"for a period of\\s+(\\d+)\\s+(months?|years?|days?)\". Also \"for a period of\\s+(\\w+)\" to capture words like \"six months\". Also \"indefinitely\". Also \"until\" maybe. But we need durations, not dates. \"until\" may indicate indefinite. Use regex: \"(?i)indefinitely\". Already found. Also \"for the duration of\" might be \"for the duration of the trial\" etc.\n\nBetter to search for patterns like \"for a period of six months\" etc. Already found. We need to check other documents for \"for a period of\" maybe with numeric. Use search_document_regex with pattern: \"(?i)for a period of\\s+(\\d+)\\s+(months?|years?|days?)\". That will capture numeric durations. Also pattern: \"(?i)for a period of\\s+(\\w+)\\s+(months?|years?|days?)\" capture word durations.\n\nAlso \"for the duration of\" but might not be numeric.\n\nLet's search for \"for a period of\\s+\\w+\\s+months?\" etc.\n\nAlso \"for the duration of\" followed by numeric.\n\nBut maybe easier: We can search for \"for the ... of\" patterns.

But we need capture group.\n\nAlternatively we can search for \"for a period of\" and then manually extract durations. We already have matches: 6 months from Memorandum Opinion (001). Also 6 months from Complaint? Let's search for \"for a period of\" in Complaint. Not seen earlier. Let's search entire corpus. Use search_document_regex on all docs with pattern: \"(?i)for a period of\". We have seen some matches: Complaint, Memorandum Opinion (001), Statement of Interest. But we saw only one match each. Let's read those matches. We have read some tokens. For Complaint, we saw token 12832-13032 had not \"for a period of\". That had \"six months\" inside but not \"for a period of\". Actually Complaint had \"six months\" in a payment plan. But not \"for a period of\". So durations in Complaint may be \"indefinitely\". And \"six months\" but not preceded by \"for a period\". But we need duration of decree obligations. The \"six months\" for license suspension might be a decree obligation. But the phrase \"for a period of six months\" is more explicit. In Complaint, the license suspension was \"indefinitely\" (decree). So \"indefinitely\" is a duration.\n\nAlso the \"six months\" in the payment plan may not be a decree, but a negotiated agreement? It is a court-ordered payment plan, so it is a decree obligation. Yes, the court ordered the payment plan to pay debt within six months. That's a decree obligation. So we should capture \"six months\" for that.\n\nAlso \"six months\" in Memorandum Opinion (001) for suspension of license. Good.\n\nAlso there may be \"for a period of\" with numeric durations like \"for a period of 30 days\" in some other document. Let's search again. Use search_document_regex across all docs for pattern: \"(?i)for a period of\\s+(\\d+)\\s+(months?|years?|days?)\".

Might be multiple durations across documents.\n\nWe have seen \"six months\" in Memorandum Opinion (001). That is a duration of a suspension, but is it a decree? The text: \"(2000) (“The court also suspended Reittinger’s driver’s license for a period of six months, pursuant to the provisions of Code § 18.2–259.1.”)\". That is a suspension, not sure if considered a decree. But it is a court order. Likely qualifies. So we have \"six months\" as a duration. Also maybe \"indefinitely\" appears in Complaint: \"suspended Mr. Russo’s license indefinitely.\" That's indefinite duration, not a numeric duration; but might be considered \"indefinitely\". The instruction: format as '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. So for each duration, include the decree obligation text. So \"six months: court suspended Reittinger's driver's license for a period of six months\" or similar.\n\nAlso \"indefinitely\" is duration: \"indefinitely: suspended Mr. Russo’s license indefinitely\". Also maybe other durations like \"for a period of six months\" appears again.\n\nAre there other durations? Search for \"for a period of\" we've done. But maybe \"for a period of 6 months\" appears. Also maybe \"for a period of 12 months\" etc. We saw \"for a period of six months\" in Memorandum Opinion. Also \"for a period of six months\" maybe appears elsewhere. We should search for \"period of\" again but maybe there are other durations like \"for a period of 3 years\" maybe in other documents. In preliminary injunction nothing about durations.\n\nLet's search for \"decree\" or \"injunction\" with \"for\" maybe. But easier: search for \"for a period of\" again across all documents?

Also maybe \"for a period of [number] years\" might exist in other docs, but not yet seen. Let's search for pattern \"for a period of\\s+(\\d+)\\s+(years?|months?|days?)\" again? Already did, found one match in Complaint. But let's check that match. The search result 25: match in Complaint tokens 9573-9773. Let's view that snippet in context. It is part of text where license suspended indefinitely, but the search pattern likely matched \"for a period of\" maybe in earlier part? Let's read that snippet more fully. But we didn't read that portion. Let's request to read the snippet around that match. Use search_document_regex to get context. But we already used search_document_regex to find matches, but we didn't get the snippet text. The match 1 (tokens 9573-9773) is shown earlier. It contains \"For each outstanding debt, the Defendant suspended Mr. Russo’s license indefinitely.\" So no numeric duration. So the search pattern matched \"indefinitely\"? Wait the pattern was for a period of \\d+... maybe didn't match there. Actually the snippet shows \"indefinitely\". So maybe the match is from \"for a period of\" earlier? But we saw only \"For each outstanding debt...\" Did we misread? The snippet shows \"for each outstanding debt, the Defendant suspended Mr. Russo’s license indefinitely.\" That is a phrase \"for each outstanding debt\" not \"for a period of\". So maybe the pattern matched \"for each outstanding debt\"? No. So maybe the snippet includes \"for a period of\" elsewhere but truncated? The snippet shown might not include the match. Regardless.\n\nLet's search again for \"for a period of\" but maybe include a broader context. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"for a period of\" across all documents. That was step 23, but only found 1 match. That was in Memorandum Opinion. So likely only one numeric duration.\n\nBut there might be other durations like \"for a period of twelve months\" etc. Let's search for \"for a period of\" again but maybe case-insensitive. Already did. Only one match.\n\nSearch for \"for [0-9]+ months\" again; step 16 found 5 matches: 4 in Complaint, 1 in Unpublished Memorandum Opinion.\n\nLet's view the matches in Complaint.

We have seen matches: \"for a period of six months\" in Memorandum Opinion (001). Also \"indefinitely\" but that might be Not Applicable? We need durations of decree obligations ordered by court. \"Indefinitely\" is a duration. But may be not a decree. In Preliminary Injunction we saw license suspended indefinitely. That is a decree. So we have two distinct values: \"six months\" and \"indefinitely\". Also maybe other durations in documents. We need to search again for \"indefinitely\" in relevant documents. We saw two matches in Complaint. But those are about license suspensions indefinitely. Those are decrees. So we need to read those matched tokens? We saw the Complaint matches earlier but not the text. We need to extract evidence. The matches provided only token ranges but not text. We need to read those token ranges to get evidence. The Complaint was partially visited; we have token ranges 9272-9472 and 9543-9773 that include indefinite. We need to read those ranges. So we should read those ranges. Also for Memorandum Opinion (001) we have tokens 9396-9600 covering six months. We have that text already partially? We saw in search results the snippet. But need to read to get evidence text. But we have snippet. We can use that snippet as evidence? We need the text snippet. The snippet includes \"for a period of six months\". That is evidence. For indefinite we need the snippet: we saw earlier matches but no snippet. We need to read token ranges.\n\nThus we will perform read_document on Complaint tokens 9272-9472 and 9543-9773. But we already have 9543-9773 read earlier? We have read Complaint 9543-9773? Yes step 21: read_document on Complaint (tokens 9543-9773) read 230 tokens. That likely includes indefinite. We saw snippet in step 28: match 4 tokens 9543-9743 includes \"For each outstanding debt, the Defendant suspended Mr. Russo’s license indefinitely.\" So we can use that snippet.\n\nAlso 9272-9472 likely includes indefinite too? Step 28 match 1 for Complaint tokens 9272-9472 but that snippet didn't include indefinite. That snippet is about medical debt etc. So indefinite not there. So only 9543-9773 has indefinite. So we need to read that. Already done. So we can use snippet.\n\nThus we need to append two entries: \"six months\" and \"indefinitely\". Format: '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. For six months, obligation: \"license suspended for a period of six months\". For indefinitely: \"license suspended indefinitely\". Provide evidence.\n\nWe should use append_checklist with key How_Long_Decrees_will_Last and two entries.\n\nWe must ensure evidence text is verbatim snippet. Use snippet from search results for six months. That snippet: \"for a period of six months, pursuant to the provisions of Code § 18.2–259.1.\" We might need to include context. Provide location tokens 9396-9600. For indefinite: snippet: \"suspended Mr. Russo’s license indefinitely.\" Provide location tokens 9543-9743.

We have looked at preliminary injunction, complaint, memorandum opinion. Might also be in other opinions or orders.
