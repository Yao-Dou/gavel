We have partial views but need more info. We saw in Order (002) a match: \"In this putative class action, five individual plaintiffs and three membership associations...\" Also in Memorandum: \"filing FAP/Compl. ... adds class action claims...\" So we have evidence of a class action. Also there is mention of individual plaintiffs: e.g., \"five individual plaintiffs\". So we need to extract both values: Plaintiffs: Class Action and Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]. The description should be brief description of individuals when applicable. In Order (002) we have \"five individual plaintiffs and three membership associations\". That describes individuals? But we need description of individuals when applicable. Maybe we can use \"five individual plaintiffs\" as description. So we need two entries:\n\n1. Plaintiffs: Class Action\n2. Plaintiffs: Individual, described as \"five individual plaintiffs\"\n\nWe must provide evidence from docs. Use search_document_regex to find more. Already we have matches. Maybe need to read more context for description. Let's search for \"individual plaintiffs\" in Order (002) and Memorandum. Use search_document_regex on Order (002) for \"individual plaintiffs\". Also maybe on Memorandum for \"class action\". But we already have matches. We need to confirm that it's a class action. Provide evidence snippet: \"In this putative class action, five individual plaintiffs ...\" from Order (002). Also \"adds class action claims concerning detention conditions ...\" from Memorandum. So we have evidence.\n\nThus we need to append both entries. Do we need to set Not Applicable? No.\n\nWe need to use append_checklist. Provide evidence blocks with text, source_document, location. Location can be page or token range. We have token ranges for matches. For Order (002) match 1 tokens 884-1084. For Memorandum match 1 tokens 1268-1468. Provide location: token offsets or page? Provide token offsets.\n\nThus call append_checklist with two patches: one for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs? Actually patch key same. We can add multiple extracted entries in one patch. So patch: key: \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", extracted: array of two entries.\n\nFirst entry: value \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". evidence: one evidence object from Memorandum: text: snippet, source_document: \"Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Petitioner Osorto's Ex Parte Application for Release from Immigration Custody\", location: \"tokens 1268-1468\".\n\nSecond entry: value \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five individual plaintiffs\". evidence: snippet from Order (002): text: snippet, source_document: \"Order (002)\", location: \"tokens 884-1084\".\n\nLet's include snippet: \"In this putative class action, five individual plaintiffs and three membership associations allege that Defendants...\" for context. Provide full snippet from match. We'll embed entire snippet. Actually snippet provided earlier: \"In this putative class action, five individual plaintiffs and three membership associations allege that Defendants, twelve senior federal officials...\" We'll use that.\n\nAlso maybe include description \"five individual plaintiffs\".

But we need to ensure all distinct values found in any document. We might have missed other values. We should search for \"class action\" and \"individual plaintiffs\" again, but might need to read more of Order (002) for other mention: maybe there are multiple classes? The search provided matches. It may have other value: maybe \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ... other individuals? Let's analyze Order (002) matches: We have two matches around 884-1084 and 889-1089 essentially same section. Also 3059-3259 etc. But might contain \"class action\" mention earlier. The search results show 5 matches, but we only captured one. We should read more tokens around other matches for potential distinct values: maybe \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\". We should also check if there are other documents that contain class action status. For example, Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications... might mention class action. Also Docket might mention. But we need to extract all distinct values. The current extracted values: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" with no description. \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five individual plaintiffs\". We might also have \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ... other individuals\" maybe in Order (001) or other order. But we only have data from two documents. We should search again for \"class action\" and \"individual plaintiffs\" in all documents, but we already did search regex. But maybe we need to read more of those matches to capture full description. For example, in Order (002) the description might say \"five individual plaintiffs and three membership associations\". The description currently used \"five individual plaintiffs\" only. But we might also want to include membership associations? The requirement: \"A designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs (with a brief description of the individuals when applicable).\" So for individual plaintiffs case, we should describe the individuals. The evidence snippet we captured has \"five individual plaintiffs\". That is fine. But we might also have other values, e.g., \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ... \" maybe in other docs.\n\nLet's search again with pattern including \"class action\" or \"individual plaintiffs\" but we might already have all. But maybe there is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\" in Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte... Let's search that doc.\n\nWe should run search_document_regex for \"class action\" across all docs. But we already did search and found 6 matches across 5 docs. The matches we saw:\n\n- Memorandum Opinion: one match, tokens 1268-1468, which had class action claim. It says \"adds class action claims concerning detention conditions\". That indicates plaintiffs as class action. So we have that.\n\n- Order (002) had 5 matches, we only captured one. Let's examine each for distinct values. The first match (884-1084) says \"In this putative class action, five individual plaintiffs and three membership associations\". The second match seems duplicate. Third match (3059-3259) may be about something else. Fourth match (5447-5647) mentions \"members of the plaintiff associations\". Fifth match (9906-10106) includes \"Individual Plaintiffs\" heading maybe. But we have captured only one value. But maybe there are distinct values: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five individual plaintiffs\" and \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ... membership associations\" - membership associations are not individuals. So not relevant. The description of individuals is \"five individual plaintiffs\". So same value.\n\nBut maybe there is also \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ... \" in Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications. Let's search that. We'll call search_document_regex for that doc maybe. But quick look at its snippet: \"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications for Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause Regarding Preliminary Injunction\". Might contain class action mention. Let's search.\n\nWe need to read documents that might contain other class action status. Docket may mention but might not be needed. But for completeness, we should search again across all documents for class action or individual plaintiffs. But we already did. However, we only captured first match for Order (002). There might be other matches that refer to \"class action\" but we might not have captured. Let's examine the search results: They listed 6 total matches across 5 docs. The list shows 1 match from Memorandum, 5 matches from Order(002). That totals 6. So no matches in other docs. Thus, we have all matches. But we may have missed that the Order (002) also has a description for the individual plaintiffs beyond \"five individual plaintiffs\". It may mention \"five individual plaintiffs\" but also might describe them in other lines. But the requirement: \"brief description of the individuals when applicable\". The snippet we used provides \"five individual plaintiffs\". That is acceptable.\n\nBut we might also need to include \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five individual plaintiffs\" and maybe also \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ...\" in other doc? But no.\n\nThus we have all distinct values: two.\n\nBut we need to ensure that we haven't missed the \"class action\" value for the Memorandum. The snippet we used: \"adds class action claims concerning detention conditions\". That indicates plaintiffs as class action. The description might not need individuals. So value \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" is ok.\n\nNow we should ensure that we haven't missed that there might be a \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" value that indicates \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five individual plaintiffs\" but we may need to differentiate between the two values? We have that.\n\nBut the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" There are two distinct. We have them.\n\nNow we should not stop yet because we need to ensure we have captured all evidence. We have evidence for each value. But we might need to confirm that the evidence snippet for \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" is from the correct document. The snippet given earlier: \"In a stipulation filed on June 27, 2025, respondents agreed that petitioners would be housed at Adelanto and not transferred to another district outside of the Central District for at least until the ...\" That snippet does not mention class action. Actually the snippet from the search match 1 of memoranda gave the text: \"In a stipulation filed on June 27, 2025, respondents agreed that petitioners would be housed at Adelanto and not transferred to another district outside of the Central District for at least until the date they received bond hearings. On July 2, 2025, petitioners Osorto, Vasquez Perdomo, and Villegas Molina, along with two other individuals and four organizational plaintiffs, filed the FAP/Compl. The FAP/Compl. maintains the claims in the initial habeas petition and adds class action claims concerning detention conditions and the denial of counsel\". So the snippet includes \"adds class action claims concerning detention conditions\". Good. So we captured that.\n\nNow for the second value: The snippet from Order (002) match 1: \"In this putative class action, five individual plaintiffs and three membership associations allege that Defendants, twelve senior federal officials...\" So the snippet includes \"In this putative class action, five individual plaintiffs\". That indicates class action? But it says \"putative class action\". Wait, but the value we extracted is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five individual plaintiffs\". But the snippet says \"In this putative class action, five individual plaintiffs\". That is contradictory: It's a putative class action but the plaintiffs are individuals. The value seems to be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five individual plaintiffs\". That matches the snippet: \"five individual plaintiffs\". Good.\n\nBut is there a possibility that there is another distinct value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as ... membership associations\"? But membership associations are not individuals. So not relevant.\n\nThus, we have all values.\n\nWe need to ensure we haven't erroneously appended too many values. We already appended two values. But maybe we need to check that the key is complete. We need to confirm if there are any more matches in other docs. The search results show no more matches. So key is complete.\n\nThus we can stop. However, we should double-check that we didn't miss the possibility that the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" key might need to be set to Not Applicable if no class action? But we have found two values, so not applicable.\n\nThus we can stop. But we need to confirm that the extracted values are properly formatted: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" and \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as five individual plaintiffs\". They are fine.\n\nWe must respond with stop decision.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct values for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs have been identified and extracted with supporting evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct values for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs have been identified and extracted with supporting evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4517, "completion_tokens": 1920, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
