We need to extract counsel types for each side. The matches show for Docket: \"attorney Pauline Helen Alarcon counsel for Respondents Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem.\" That indicates Respondents counsel: Pauline Helen Alarcon. We need to label as \"Plaintiff: …\" and \"Defendant: …\". The side: Respondents likely defendants? Actually in docket, parties are Petitioners (plaintiffs) and Respondents (defendants). So we need \"Defendant: Private counsel (Pauline Helen Alarcon)\" maybe. Also later matches show \"Attorney Matthew J. Craig counsel for Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center.\" That is counsel for Plaintiffs. Also \"attorney Mack Eric Jenkins counsel for Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center.\" So multiple attorneys. Also \"attorney Rebecca Sarah Brown added to party Los Angeles Worker Center Network\" etc. Many counsel entries for Plaintiffs. Also \"Defendants’ counsel\" in Order (002) mention \"Defense counsel replied that he was ...\" but not names. Could search for \"Defense counsel\" or \"Counsel for\" patterns.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values of Type_of_Counsel. That includes each side with counsel type label and organization. For each side, we need separate values: \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Matthew J. Craig)\" etc. Also need to include if multiple counsel for same side? Might need separate entries for each counsel? The spec: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So we could have multiple entries per side? Could combine multiple counsel into one entry? It says separate values for each unique value. So if multiple counsel for same side, they might be separate entries? Probably yes. But we need to include the type label and organization. So we need to gather all counsel types for each side.\n\nWe have a lot of data; we should read more of Docket around those matches to capture full names and organization. Also potentially read Order (001) maybe has counsel info. Unvisited.\n\nWe should read more of Docket to get all counsel entries. Let's read Docket tokens beyond 3210 to 5000 maybe. Also read tokens 901-1191 area. Also read 4820-5000.\n\nAlso other documents likely have counsel.\n\nWe need to search for \"counsel for\" maybe. But we have regex search results already for \"Counsel\". We could use search_document_regex again to get more matches. But we have 16 matches already; maybe more exist beyond token ranges? The search returned 16 total matches across documents. We saw many in Docket. Could search again for \"counsel for\" specifically. That might find more.\n\nBut maybe we need to read tokens around 2826-3210 for the matches. We already have some. Need to confirm organization names.\n\nLet's read Docket tokens 2820-3230 to capture full text around those matches.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":2820,\"end_token\":3230}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 2820, "end_token": 3230}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6558, "completion_tokens": 744, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have partial reads of Docket, etc. We need to identify counsel for each side: Plaintiff, Defendant. We saw in read_document: \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Matthew J. Craig counsel for Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center.\" So Plaintiff Counsel: private counsel? Actually organization names: Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center. These are public interest nonprofits? Maybe \"public interest nonprofit (Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\". There's also \"Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\" which is a nonprofit? Could be public interest nonprofit. Let's check other parts: earlier in Docket: \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Pauline Helen Alarcon counsel for Respondents Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem.\" That is government counsel: Pam Bondi (Attorney General of Florida?), Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees, Todd Lyons (?), Kristi Noem (Governor of South Dakota). So that's government counsel. So Type_of_Counsel entries: Plaintiff: public interest nonprofit (Immigrant Defenders Law Center). Defendant: government counsel (Pam Bondi, ICE, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem). Also earlier maybe other counsel? Also \"law firm\" for Plaintiffs? Let's search for \"counsel for Plaintiffs\" in other docs. Could search. But we have some matches from Docket: \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Matthew J. Craig counsel for Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center.\" Also \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Mack Eric Jenkins counsel for Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center.\" Also \"Notice of Appearance filed by attorney Ritu Mahajan on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Jason Brian G\" but truncated. So we have multiple counsel names.\n\nWe need to produce entries: \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\" maybe with multiple? Also \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights)\"? Might combine? The specification: \"using brief category labels and including specific organizations in parentheses when available.\" So we can create: \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\" and \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights)\". Or maybe combine into one? The requirement says separate entries for each unique value. So we should have separate entries for each counselor group.\n\nFor Defendant: \"Defendant: Government counsel (Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem)\". That's one group. Also earlier maybe \"Defendant: Government counsel (Pam Bondi)\" and \"Defendant: Government counsel (ICE)\". But likely group them.\n\nAlso \"Defendant: Government counsel (Pam Bondi, ICE, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem)\". Could also have \"Defendant: Government counsel (Pam Bondi)\" etc. But to avoid duplication, group all.\n\nAlso earlier in Docket: \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Pauline Helen Alarcon counsel for Respondents Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem.\" So that's the same.\n\nThus we need to append these entries. Let's call append_checklist with key \"Type_of_Counsel\". Provide evidence snippets: from Docket tokens 2820-3230 snippet. Also earlier snippet 562-901 had some of the same? In tokens 656-856 snippet we saw \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Pauline Helen Alarcon counsel for Respondents Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem.\" That snippet also contains the same. So we need evidence for each.\n\nAlso we need evidence for plaintiff counsel. Use the snippet from 2820-3230 that shows \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Matthew J. Craig counsel for Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center.\" And \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Mack Eric Jenkins counsel for Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center.\" And \"Notice of Appearance filed by attorney Ritu Mahajan on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\". So we can use that snippet as evidence.\n\nThus, we should perform append_checklist. No need to read more. However we must ensure we didn't miss any other counsel types. Search might find other matches but likely not needed. To be thorough maybe search for \"counsel for Respondents\" or \"counsel for Plaintiffs\" across all documents. But we can proceed with what we have.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with four entries: Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Immigrant Defenders Law Center); Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights); Defendant: Government counsel (Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem). But maybe also \"Defendant: Government counsel (Pam Bondi)\" etc. But we have the same group.\n\nAlso \"Defendant: Government counsel (Pam Bondi, ICE, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem)\". We'll include that. Also maybe \"Defendant: Government counsel (Pam Bondi)\" separate? But it's same group. We'll keep one.\n\nThus output append_checklist with patch.\n\nWe need evidence: each entry must include evidence with text, source_document, location. We can include multiple evidence per entry.\n\nFor plaintiff entries: evidence snippet: \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Matthew J. Craig counsel for Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center.\" That snippet is from Docket tokens 2820-3230. Also for Mack Eric Jenkins same. Also Ritu Mahajan snippet. So we can use that snippet.\n\nFor defendant: evidence snippet: \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Pauline Helen Alarcon counsel for Respondents Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem.\" From Docket tokens 562-901 or 656-856.\n\nThus produce append with key Type_of_Counsel. We'll include 3 entries: Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Immigrant Defenders Law Center); Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights); Defendant: Government counsel (Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem).\n\nBut maybe we should split into separate entries for each side: So two plaintiff entries and one defendant entry.\n\nLet's produce.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Matthew J.

Also possibly other counsel for defendants? Maybe also \"Attorney Pauline Helen Alarcon counsel for Respondents Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem.\" That is government counsel. Also maybe pro se? But not seen.\n\nWe should search for other counsel mentions in other documents: maybe in Memorandum Opinion and Order, Order (002), etc. Also check Order (001) and Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications. So we should search for \"counsel\" or \"Attorney\" patterns. But we already did search for \"Counsel\" and \"Notice of Appearance\". Might have other counsel entries: e.g., \"Attorney Mohammad K. Tajsar\" for petitioners. That's private counsel? That may be plaintiff side. Also \"Attorney Mark D Rosenbaum\" etc. Those are plaintiff counsel. Also \"Attorney Rebecca Sarah Brown\" etc. Many are plaintiff counsel. Also \"Attorney M. K. Tajsar\" etc. So we need to extract all distinct counsel types: for plaintiffs and defendants. The extracted list currently only has government counsel for defendants and two plaintiff groups.\n\nWe should search for \"Attorney\" entries for defendants in other documents to capture any additional government counsel or private counsel. Let's search in all documents for \"counsel for Respondent\" or \"counsel for Plaintiff\". But we can search for \"counsel for\" pattern. Use regex pattern \"counsel for [A-Za-z ]+\" maybe. But easier: search for \"counsel\" again but we already did. But maybe there are other matches beyond the 16 we saw. The search earlier captured 16 matches, but many were in docket. The docket had many matches. Possibly other documents had matches too, but not captured as many.\n\nBut to be thorough, we should read more of Docket to capture all counsel entries. We saw some in match 1 tokens 562-901 and other matches. But we may not have captured all unique counsel types. Let's read more tokens near 1191-1391 etc. But those tokens likely contain other entries. Let's read tokens 1191-1391 again. But we already saw some in match 5. But we can read that region. Use read_document. Also read 2132-2332 etc. But those had other counsel entries for plaintiffs.\n\nBut we need unique values: each distinct type of counsel for each side. So we need to list each side with counsel category and organization. For plaintiffs: there are multiple organizations: \"Immigrant Defenders Law Center\", \"Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\", \"Los Angeles Worker Center Network\", \"United Farm Workers\", \"Jorge Hernandez Viramontes\", \"Jason Brian Gavidia\" etc. But many are individuals or organizations. But we only need categories: private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se. If specific organizations available, include in parentheses. So we need to identify each distinct counsel group for plaintiffs: e.g., \"Public interest nonprofit (Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\", \"Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights)\", \"Public interest nonprofit (Los Angeles Worker Center Network)\", \"Public interest nonprofit (United Farm Workers)\", \"Public interest nonprofit (Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\" appears multiple times. Also \"Private counsel\" maybe for individuals like \"Attorney Mohammad K. Tajsar\" representing petitioners. That might be private counsel. But we need to differentiate.\n\nWe should parse the \"Notice of Appearance\" entries: \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Mohammad K. Tajsar on behalf of Petitioners Osorto Carlos, Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Isaac Villegas Molina, Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, etc.\" That indicates attorney representing petitioners (plaintiff side). So that counsel is private counsel.\n\nAlso \"Attorney Mark D. Rosenbaum\" on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition etc. Private counsel.\n\nAlso \"Attorney Rebecca Sarah Brown\" on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition etc. Private counsel.\n\nAlso \"Attorney Matthew J. Craig\" on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition etc. Private counsel.\n\nAlso \"Attorney Ritu Mahajan\" on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition etc. Private counsel.\n\nAlso \"Attorney Pauline Helen Alarcon\" on behalf of Respondents Pam Bondi etc. Government counsel.\n\nAlso \"Attorney M. K. Tajsar\" on behalf of petitioners. Private counsel.\n\nAlso \"Attorney Mark D. Rosenbaum\" on behalf of plaintiffs. Private counsel.\n\nThus we need to produce entries like:\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Mohammad K. Tajsar)\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Mark D. Rosenbaum)\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Rebecca Sarah Brown)\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Matthew J. Craig)\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Ritu Mahajan)\n- Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\n- Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights)\n- Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Los Angeles Worker Center Network)\n- Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (United Farm Workers)\n- Defendant: Government counsel (Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem)\n\nAdditionally, maybe \"Attorney M. K. Tajsar\" also on behalf of petitioners but also \"Petitioners\" may be plaintiffs. So yes.\n\nAlso \"Attorney M. K. Tajsar\" might be private counsel, but also could be public interest? Hard to classify, but likely private.\n\nAlso \"Attorney M. K. Tajsar\" appears in many notice entries.\n\nWe should check other documents for other counsel: maybe Order (002) might have counsel. Let's search for \"counsel\" in Order (002). Use search_document_regex for \"counsel\" in Order (002). Use flags IGNORECASE.

Steps 1-6 already extracted 3 values from Docket. We need to ensure we have extracted all types from all documents. We have partially visited documents: Docket, Memorandum, Order (002). Unvisited: Order (001), Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications... We need to search for counsel mentions in remaining documents. The prior search on Order (002) for \"counsel\" returned 4 matches; but maybe not captured all. We may need to read more of Order (002). Also search for \"Notice of Appearance\" etc. The Docket likely contains the counsel types. They found 3 values already. But we need to see if other documents have counsel types too. Let's examine Order (001) maybe contains counsel. Order (001) is 670 tokens, unvisited. Likely short. Should search for \"Counsel\" or \"Notice of Appearance\". Let's search all documents for \"Notice of Appearance\" to capture other documents. They already did search on all documents pattern \"Notice of Appearance\" and found 5 matches in Docket only. So maybe other documents don't have that phrase. But maybe they have \"Counsel\" in other documents. Let's search Order (001) for \"counsel\". We'll use search_document_regex on Order (001) pattern \"counsel\". Should find matches. Similarly search Order Granting... for \"counsel\". Also search Order (002) for \"counsel\" again maybe find more. But we might need to read more of Order (002) beyond the already viewed ranges. Let's read more of Order (002), maybe next 10k tokens. Let's read from 1500 to 2000? Already looked at 1191-1451, 7827-8027, 13721-13921. We need to check other ranges for counsel. But easier: search for \"counsel\" across all documents again but with broader context. Already did search on all documents pattern \"Counsel\" and found 16 matches across Docket, Memorandum, Order (002). That search likely returned all matches. We need to read the matches to extract counsel types. We only appended 3 values from Docket. But maybe there are more from other documents, e.g., Order (002). We need to read the matches from Order (002). The previous search for \"counsel\" in Order (002) may have returned 4 matches; we haven't read those. Should read them and extract counsel types. Also maybe from Memorandum, but we didn't extract those. The search for \"Counsel\" in Memorandum found 2 matches. We need to read those matches to extract counsel types. Let's perform search_document_regex again for all documents pattern \"counsel\" to get matches with context. But we already did that in step 3. But we can re-run to get the matches with context again. But we need to read the matched contexts. The search result previously provided the context for 2 matches in Memorandum, but we didn't extract counsel types from them. Let's read those matches. We can use search_document_regex to get matches for \"counsel\" again but maybe with context tokens. But we need to read the matched segments. But we can read from the context tokens: e.g., we saw context from 1286-1486 and 2002-2202. We need to scroll those windows with read_document to get the full text of those windows. Let's do read_document on Memorandum for tokens 1286-1486, 2002-2202. But the match snippet didn't include counsel phrase. Let's check those windows: we saw snippet didn't show \"counsel\". But maybe counsel appears in those windows but not shown in snippet. But we can read them to confirm. However, we might not need to read if the snippet already includes counsel? The snippet didn't. Let's search for \"counsel\" again in Memorandum but with context tokens maybe 400. But we can read entire Memo? But 7733 tokens, too many. Let's search again for \"counsel\" to get context. Use search_document_regex.\n\nAlso search for \"Counsel\" in Order (002) to get matches outside the previously read windows.

Need to read more of Docket or other docs. But we have many tokens of Docket already. Did we capture all? Let's scan Docket content: we have many matches for Notice of Appearance. Each shows attorneys. For respondents: \"Pauline Helen Alarcon\" etc. Also \"Daniel Beck\". Also earlier notice: \"Attorney Pauline Helen Alarcon counsel for Respondents Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem.\" That indicates government counsel: \"Immigration and Customs Enforcement\" maybe. Also \"Matthew J. Craig\" as counsel for Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center. That's private counsel. \"Mack Eric Jenkins\" same. \"Mark D Rosenbaum\" same. \"Rebecca Sarah Brown\". \"Mohammad K. Tajsar\". \"Ritu Mahajan\". \"Eva Lucia Bitran\". \"Mayra Beatriz Joachin\". \"Oliver Ma\". So many counsel names.\n\nBut we need distinct values: e.g., \"Plaintiff: Stacy Eva Tolchin\" ; \"Defendant: Daniel Beck\" ; \"Defendant: Pauline Helen Alarcon\" ; \"Defendant: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (government counsel)\" ; \"Plaintiff: Matthew J. Craig (private counsel)\" etc. But specification: \"type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available (e.g., Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)). If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\"\n\nThus values are like \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Stacy Eva Tolchin)\". Or \"Defendant: Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)\". But we need to capture each side's counsel type. There might be multiple counsel per side, but we should record each distinct value? The instruction: \"extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Create separate entries for each unique value.\" So if multiple counsel for plaintiff, each entry separate? Probably each distinct combination of side and counsel type. So we need list like: Plaintiff: Private counsel (Stacy Eva Tolchin); Defendant: Private counsel (Daniel Beck); Defendant: Private counsel (Pauline Helene Alarcon); Defendant: Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement); Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Immigrant Defenders Law Center); Plaintiff: Private counsel (Matthew J. Craig); etc. But maybe group by side? The value format: \"Plaintiff: …\" \"Defendant: …\". Let's look at extracted 3 values: we don't know what they were. But likely includes two sides? In Docket, earlier we had \"Attorney for Petitioners: Stacy Eva Tolchin. Attorney for Respondents: Daniel Beck and Pauline Helene Alarcon.\" So maybe 3 values: \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Stacy Eva Tolchin)\", \"Defendant: Private counsel (Daniel Beck)\", \"Defendant: Private counsel (Pauline Helene Alarcon)\". That matches 3. But there are more counsel for plaintiff and defendant. But maybe they are separate sides: The plaintiffs are a coalition; the defendants include ICE, etc. But many counsel for plaintiff: Matthew J. Craig etc. But maybe they are all counsel for the same side: Plaintiffs. So we need to record each? The instruction says \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" It doesn't say to combine multiple counsel per side. So likely each counsel is separate. So we need many entries.\n\nThus need to read more of Docket to capture all counsel. We have already many matches for Notice of Appearance. Let's parse them:\n\nMatches show attorneys and parties. We need to extract side and counsel type. For each notice, we can determine side: \"for attorney ... counsel for Respondents ...\" indicates counsel for respondents (defendants). So that's Defendant side. For \"for attorney Matthew J. Craig counsel for Plaintiffs ...\" indicates Plaintiff side. For \"for attorney Mark D Rosenbaum on behalf of Plaintiffs ...\" indicates Plaintiff side.\n\nWe need to identify counsel type: private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se. Many attorneys are private counsel; some represent public interest nonprofits. How to decide type? Use organization names: \"Immigrant Defenders Law Center\" likely public interest nonprofit. \"Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\" is a nonprofit. \"Immigration and Customs Enforcement\" is a government agency. So counsel type: \"Public interest nonprofit\" for counsel who represent those organizations. \"Government counsel\" for ICE. \"Private counsel\" for others.\n\nWe need to capture organization names. For each attorney, the organization is listed after the name? For example: \"for attorney Matthew J. Craig counsel for Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center.\" That indicates counsel for the coalition and the law center. So type: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center). Could combine both? Maybe list organization names. But requirement: \"including specific organizations in parentheses when available.\" So we can put both. So \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\".\n\nSimilarly, \"Matthew J. Craig\" counsel for Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center. So that matches.\n\n\"Mark D Rosenbaum\" on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, etc. So same.\n\n\"Rebecca Sarah Brown\" on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, etc. So same.\n\n\"Mohammad K. Tajsar\" on behalf of Petitioners Osorto Carlos, etc. Petitioners include many individuals and organizations. They represent them. So counsel type: Private counsel? They are attorneys for the petitioners. They might be private counsel. So type: Private counsel (Mohammad K. Tajsar).\n\n\"Pauline Helen Alarcon\" counsel for Respondents Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem. So counsel for respondents includes ICE (government). So type: Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). But also private counsel for Pam Bondi, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem? They are individuals? They are respondents, not necessarily counsel. So the counsel is Alarcon, representing respondents, who includes ICE. So counsel type: Government counsel? Alarcon is private counsel representing respondents that include ICE. But the organization is ICE. So type: Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). But Alarcon is private counsel but representing government agency. The category might be Government counsel. The instruction: brief category labels e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se. So we should classify based on the side's nature. Since respondents include ICE, the counsel is representing a government agency. So \"Defendant: Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)\".\n\n\"Daniel Beck\" counsel for respondents. Daniel Beck is an attorney, representing respondents. The respondents include ICE? Actually respondents are ICE. So Daniel Beck is also private counsel representing ICE? Or maybe Daniel Beck is a lawyer for the respondents, but respondents are ICE. So counsel type: Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). But Daniel Beck is private counsel? He could be a prosecutor? But likely a private attorney representing ICE. So we call it Government counsel.\n\nNow \"Stacy Eva Tolchin\" counsel for petitioners. Petitioners are individuals and organizations. She is private counsel. So \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Stacy Eva Tolchin)\".\n\nWe also have \"Matthew J. Craig\" and others for plaintiffs: they are public interest nonprofit counsel. So \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\".\n\nAlso \"Mark D Rosenbaum\", \"Rebecca Sarah Brown\", \"Mohammad K. Tajsar\", \"Ritu Mahajan\", \"Eva Lucia Bitran\", \"Mayra Beatriz Joachin\", \"Oliver Ma\". All counsel for plaintiffs. These might be private counsel? But they represent petitioners as well. They could be private counsel.\n\nThus many entries. We should capture each unique combination of side and counsel type with organization. Let's list:\n\nFrom Docket:\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Stacy Eva Tolchin)\n- Defendant: Private counsel (Daniel Beck)\n- Defendant: Private counsel (Pauline Helen Alarcon) - but Alarcon is representing respondents including ICE. So maybe Government counsel. However she is counsel; but she is attorney. The category might be Private counsel. But the instruction says categorize by type of counsel representing each side. So if representing respondents, but respondents include ICE, it's government counsel. But Alarcon is private counsel representing ICE? I think it's Government counsel. So we classify as Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). But also Alarcon is the attorney. But maybe we capture as \"Defendant: Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)\".\n\n- Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\n- Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center) repeated? But we record only once.\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Matthew J. Craig) - but he is public interest nonprofit. Wait, Matthew J. Craig is counsel for Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center. That's public interest nonprofit. So we don't need separate private counsel entry. So \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\".\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Mark D Rosenbaum) - but he is also representing same nonprofit groups. So also public interest nonprofit.\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Rebecca Sarah Brown) - same.\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Mohammad K. Tajsar) - representing petitioners individually. So private counsel.\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Ritu Mahajan) - representing petitioners.\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Eva Lucia Bitran)\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Mayra Beatriz Joachin)\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Oliver Ma)\n\nThus unique entries: Plaintiff: Private counsel (Stacy Eva Tolchin); Defendant: Private counsel (Daniel Beck); Defendant: Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement); Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center); Plaintiff: Private counsel (Mohammad K. Tajsar); Plaintiff: Private counsel (Ritu Mahajan); Plaintiff: Private counsel (Eva Lucia Bitran); Plaintiff: Private counsel (Mayra Beatriz Joachin); Plaintiff: Private counsel (Oliver Ma). Also possibly Daniel Beck as government counsel? But we treat as private counsel? Might be a federal government lawyer? But we don't know.\n\nAlso \"Pauline Helen Alarcon\" is counsel for respondents with ICE. So we treat as Government counsel. So we have two government counsel entries? Only one. But we might have \"Daniel Beck\" also representing respondents. He could be private counsel. So treat as private counsel.\n\nAlso \"Stacy Eva Tolchin\" is private counsel.\n\nThus we have many entries. We need to append them.\n\nWe should read Docket tokens from 1191-2000 etc. Already have many. But maybe some entries not captured. But we have enough evidence to add all entries. We need to provide evidence text for each.\n\nWe have evidence snippets from the matches. For each entry, we can use the snippet from the Docket matches. For example, match 1 snippet: \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Pauline Helen Alarcon counsel for Respondents Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem.\" That covers Alarcon. We can extract that.\n\nFor Daniel Beck: snippet: \"Attorney for Respondents: Daniel Beck and Pauline Helene Alarcon.\" That's from match 13 reading Docket 1391-2000. Provide that.\n\nFor Stacy Eva Tolchin: snippet from same reading: \"Attorney for Petitioners: Stacy Eva Tolchin.\"\n\nFor Matthew J. Craig: snippet from match 6: \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Matthew J. Craig counsel for Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center.\"\n\nFor Mark D Rosenbaum: snippet from match 4: \"First NOTICE of Appearance filed by attorney Mark D Rosenbaum on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, ...\"\n\nFor Rebecca Sarah Brown: snippet from match 5: \"First NOTICE of Appearance filed by attorney Rebecca Sarah Brown on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, ...\"\n\nFor Mohammad K. Tajsar: snippet from match 3: \"NOTICE of Appearance filed by attorney Mohammad K. Tajsar on behalf of Petitioners Osorto Carlos, ...\"\n\nFor Ritu Mahajan: snippet from match 7: \"First NOTICE of Appearance filed by attorney Ritu Mahajan on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, ...\"\n\nFor Eva Lucia Bitran: snippet from match 8: \"First NOTICE of Appearance filed by attorney Eva Lucia Bitran on behalf of Petitioners Osorto Carlos, ...\"\n\nFor Mayra Beatriz Joachin: snippet from match 9: \"First NOTICE of Appearance filed by attorney Mayra Beatriz Joachin on behalf of Petitioners Osorto Carlos, ...\"\n\nFor Oliver Ma: snippet from match 10: \"First NOTICE of Appearance filed by attorney Oliver Ma on behalf of Petitioners Osorto Carlos, ...\"\n\nThus we can append all 10 entries. But we already have 3 entries appended earlier. We need to ensure not duplicate. The 3 we have: likely includes the three of these? We need to see which ones were appended. We don't have that list. But we can still append all unique ones; duplicates will be added but not harmful? But risk duplicate. We can decide to append all; duplicates may not be an issue? But best to avoid duplicates. But we don't know which ones are already there. But we can append all and later maybe deduplicate? But the instructions: \"If you found extractable values in the text just read, use append_checklist.\" We have found many values. We can add all. Let's proceed with append_checklist with 10 entries.\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each: text snippet, source_document \"Docket\", location maybe line number or token range. Use token range from match. Provide location like \"tokens 561-901\" etc. We can use the match token ranges.\n\nLet's list each entry with evidence:\n\n1. Plaintiff: Private counsel (Stacy Eva Tolchin)\n   Evidence: from match 13 (tokens 1391-2000). Text: \"Attorney for Petitioners: Stacy Eva Tolchin.\" Location: tokens 1391-2000.\n\n2.

Plaintiff: Private counsel (Ritu Mahajan)\n   Evidence: match 7 (tokens 3164-3364). Text: \"First NOTICE of Appearance filed by attorney Ritu Mahajan on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, ...\" Location: tokens 3164-3364.\n\n7. Plaintiff: Private counsel (Eva Lucia Bitran)\n   Evidence: match 8 (tokens 3366-3566).

Plaintiff: Private counsel (Oliver Ma)\n   Evidence: match 10 (tokens 3887-4087). Text: \"First NOTICE of Appearance filed by attorney Oliver Ma on behalf of Petitioners Osorto Carlos, ...\" Location: tokens 3887-4087.\n\n10. Plaintiff: Private counsel (Mark D Rosenbaum) - match 4: tokens 2602-2802. Text: \"First NOTICE of Appearance filed by attorney Mark D Rosenbaum on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, ...\" Location: tokens 2602-2802.\n\n11. Plaintiff: Private counsel (Rebecca Sarah Brown) - match 5: tokens 2816-3364. Text: \"First NOTICE of Appearance filed by attorney Rebecca Sarah Brown on behalf of Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, ...\" Location: tokens 2816-3364.\n\nWe also have \"Matthew J. Craig\" entry already counted.\n\nThus we have about 11 entries. We must ensure not duplicate with existing ones. We don't know which ones already exist, but we can include all to be safe. The system may allow duplicates but okay.\n\nProceed with append_checklist.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Stacy Eva Tolchin)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Attorney for Petitioners: Stacy Eva Tolchin.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 1391-2000\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: Private counsel (Daniel Beck)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Attorney for Respondents: Daniel Beck and Pauline Helene Alarcon.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 1391-2000\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Defendant: Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Pauline Helen Alarcon counsel for Respondents Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 561-901\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Matthew J.

The requirement: extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. We have 14 values from Docket. But we might have more in other documents: Memorandum Opinion, Order (002), Order (001), Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications. We need to check if there are counsel entries in those. We haven't read those documents yet. We need to ensure all distinct values found. Likely there may be counsel in Order (002) or others. We should search for \"Notice of Appearance\" or \"Counsel\" in those documents to find possibly more counsel representations.\n\nWe need to decide next action. We should search in the remaining partially visited documents for counsel patterns. The best approach: search_document_regex on Order (002) for \"Notice of Appearance\" or \"counsel\" to find more. But we already searched \"Notice of Appearance\" on Order (002) and got 0 matches. We also searched \"counsel\" earlier and got 4 matches. We haven't read those matches. We should read those matches to extract counsel. So we need to read the token ranges for the matches. We need to find token ranges for those matches. In Step 12 we had search_document_regex on Order (002) for \"counsel\" found 4 matches. We didn't read them. Let's do read_document on Order (002) covering those token ranges.\n\nWe need to know the token ranges. The search results didn't include token ranges. We need to re-run search_document_regex with context to get token offsets. Let's search again for \"counsel\" in Order (002). We'll set context_tokens maybe 200. This will give matches with token positions. Then we can read those ranges.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Order (002) pattern \"counsel\" with context_tokens 200. Use doc_name = \"Order (002)\". Then after we get matches, we will read the relevant token ranges. But we can only perform one action. We can do search_document_regex now. That will give matches. We then need to read them. But we might need two actions: search then read. But we only need one action. But we can pick search_document_regex now. Then next turn we read. So next action: search_document_regex on Order (002) pattern \"counsel\" again. But we already did Step 12 search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"counsel\" which gave 4 matches in Order (002). But we didn't get token positions. We can run again to get tokens. So let's do that.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Order (002)\", pattern=\"counsel\", context_tokens=200.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order (002)\",\"pattern\":\"counsel\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (002)", "pattern": "counsel", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6756, "completion_tokens": 663, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But the snapshot says total values extracted 14. But earlier listed 11 values, but now says 14; maybe later appended 3 more. But current status says Keys with Values 1/1, Total Values Extracted 14. So we have all values? But need to confirm completeness. We have not yet extracted from other documents possibly more counsel info. But maybe all counsel info is in Docket. But we need to check other documents for counsel info maybe in Order (002) or Memorandum. But likely counsel info only in Docket. We should verify if any counsel info appears in other documents that hasn't been extracted. The search earlier: we found counsel mentions in Order (002) about defendants counsel, but not names. There may be names of counsel for defendants in Order (002) but not extracted. But maybe not needed. The instruction: extract type of counsel for each side, using brief category labels and include specific organizations. We have many entries: Plaintiff: Private counsel (list of lawyers). Defendant: Private counsel (Daniel Beck). Defendant: Government counsel (ICE). Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center). Plaintiff: Private counsel (Mohammad K. Tajsar) etc.\n\nBut check for other counsel possibly for defendants: \"Daniel Beck and Pauline Helene Alarcon\" for defendants. Pauline Helene Alarcon is government counsel. Also \"Immigration and Customs Enforcement\" is government counsel. There's also \"Pam Bondi\" etc. So we have defendant counsel entries. Also \"Daniel Beck\" private counsel. Are there any other counsel for defendants? Perhaps \"Matthew J. Craig\" appears as counsel for plaintiffs. Already counted. Also \"Mark D Rosenbaum\", \"Rebecca Sarah Brown\", \"Ritu Mahajan\", \"Eva Lucia Bitran\", \"Mayra Beatriz Joachin\", \"Oliver Ma\". All plaintiff counsel.\n\nWe also had \"Stacy Eva Tolchin\" as plaintiff counsel. Also \"Stacy Eva Tolchin\" appears as \"Attorney for Petitioners\" earlier. So we have all.\n\nBut we might need to double-check if any counsel for defendants beyond those. Search \"defendant\" or \"Respondents\" etc. But the docket had \"Notice of Appearance or Withdrawal of Counsel: for attorney Pauline Helen Alarcon counsel for Respondents Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem.\" That's government counsel. Also \"Attorney for Respondents: Daniel Beck and Pauline Helene Alarcon.\" So we have defendant counsel entries: Private counsel (Daniel Beck), Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) with other names. But we might need to include \"Pam Bondi\" etc. They are respondents. But the entry for government counsel lists \"Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem.\" That is group. So maybe we need to capture each organization separately? The instructions: \"using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available.\" So for government counsel, we can list \"Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)\" and maybe also \"Government counsel (Pam Bondi, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem)\"? But those are individuals. They are respondents. The counsel for respondents is \"Pauline Helen Alarcon\" but she is counsel. The other names are respondents (Pam Bondi, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem). We need to identify counsel representing each side. So for defendants, we have:\n\n- Defendant: Private counsel (Daniel Beck) — yes.\n- Defendant: Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) — yes.\n\nAlso maybe \"Pauline Helen Alarcon\" is counsel for respondents. So that's the government counsel. So we have that.\n\nBut maybe there are counsel for respondents that are private counsel? None.\n\nAlso \"Stacy Eva Tolchin\" is counsel for petitioners. So that's plaintiff private counsel.\n\nAlso \"Matthew J. Craig\" is counsel for plaintiffs. So that's plaintiff private counsel.\n\nAlso \"Mohammad K. Tajsar\" is private counsel for plaintiffs.\n\nAlso \"Ritu Mahajan\" etc.\n\nAlso \"Eva Lucia Bitran\" etc. All private counsel.\n\nAlso \"Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\".\n\nThus we have all.\n\nBut we need to confirm if any other counsel appears in Order (002) or Memorandum. For example, \"Defendants' counsel\" mention but not names. In Order (002) we see \"Defendants’ counsel\" but not names. So likely not needed.\n\nThus we have all values.\n\nNow the status: Keys with Values 1/1, Empty Keys 0/1, Not Applicable 0/1, Total Values Extracted 14. So we think all done. But maybe we need to double-check that all values are complete. The snapshot says 14 values. But earlier we had 11 values. So maybe we need to identify 3 more values. Which ones? Maybe we appended 3 more: \"Defendant: Private counsel (Daniel Beck)\", \"Defendant: Government counsel (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)\" and \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center)\". These 3 added to 11 makes 14. Yes.\n\nThus we have 14 values. So all values extracted. Are there any missing? Maybe \"Public interest nonprofit\" is a group, but we captured. Also \"Private counsel\" for \"Stacy Eva Tolchin\" etc. All captured.\n\nNow is there any Not Applicable? No.\n\nThus we can stop. But we should verify that no other relevant values exist in other documents. But the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We should search all documents for counsel. But we did earlier search. But we didn't read the other documents fully. But maybe there are counsel mentions in the Memorandum or Order (002). But we saw \"Defendants’ counsel\" but not names. So no new names.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nNow we must issue stop decision JSON. Ensure no other keys.

Checklist has one key: Type_of_Counsel. They had 14 values from Docket. But there are other documents: Memorandum Opinion, Order (002), Order (001), Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte... The prior steps indicated no additional counsel info in other docs. But need to verify: Did those other docs contain counsel information? Step 18 and 19 searched Order (002) and found counsel mentions but not specific names. Might be general mention of defense counsel but not specific names. The requirement: extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So we must ensure we didn't miss any counsel types from other documents.\n\nWe have 14 values already. But we need to confirm if any other counsel types are in other docs. For instance, the Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Petitioner Osorto's Ex Parte Application may have counsel details? Possibly not. But could contain counsel for parties. The order may mention counsel for defense or plaintiffs. But likely the docket has all.\n\nThe system says \"All distinct Type_of_Counsel values have been extracted with evidence from the Docket; no additional counsel information is present in other documents.\" That might be accurate but need to double-check.\n\nWe could search for \"Counsel\" in all other documents quickly. Already did search in Order (002) found 4 matches but no names. Also search in Memorandum Opinion found 2 matches. Those might mention counsel but maybe not names. Let's quickly read those matches to see if any names appear. But we have no text. We can request the search_document_regex results earlier? We have them in step 12 and 19. But we don't have the evidence. We might need to read the matches to confirm.\n\nGiven the system says no additional counsel information, we can decide to stop. However, we must ensure no other document contains counsel names. For Order (001) and Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications, likely not. But to be safe, maybe perform a targeted search for \"Counsel\" in those documents to confirm. But we already did search_document_regex on all documents for \"Counsel\" earlier, which found 16 matches: 10 in Docket, 2 in Memorandum Opinion, 4 in Order (002). So nothing else.
