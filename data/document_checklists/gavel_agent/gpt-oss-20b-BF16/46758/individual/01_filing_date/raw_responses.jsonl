We already have search results from Docket with pattern \"Entered: 06/20/2025\" repeated. That seems to be filing date. Also other documents may have filing dates. We need to inspect other documents to ensure no other filing dates. The Docket shows many entries all 06/20/2025. Likely the filing date is 06/20/2025. But we need to check other documents like Order/Opinion etc. Let's search for \"Filed\" or \"filed\" in other docs. We could search in all documents for \"filed\" dates. The Docket search already provided matches. But we need to read the Docket token ranges to confirm the date. We have search results with context, but we need to provide evidence. The evidence must include text snippet, source_document, location. We can use the search_document_regex matches themselves as evidence? But we need to read the exact text. The search_document_regex returns context tokens, but I'm not sure if that includes the evidence. The evidence requirement: we need to provide text snippet from the document. The search_document_regex returns matches with context. But we need to use read_document to read the relevant text range to capture evidence. But we can also use the search_document_regex result as evidence if it includes the snippet. But the evidence must be from the document. The search result includes the snippet, which is from the document. So we can use that snippet as evidence. But the requirement says: \"verbatim snippet\". The snippet given from search includes the date. We can use that as evidence. The location: we can specify token positions or page. The search result gives token ranges e.g., tokens 0-150, etc. We can use that.\n\nWe should read the Docket to capture the date. Maybe we should read token range 0-200 to capture the snippet \"Entered: 06/20/2025\". But we already have the snippet from search. But to be safe, we can read to confirm.\n\nThe pattern \"Filed\" appears in Docket entries. But we need to extract the filing date. The filing date is likely the date when the lawsuit was first filed. That might be the date of the first docket entry. The first docket entry may be \"PETITION for Writ of Habeas Corpus\" etc. The date may be 06/20/2025. So we can extract that.\n\nWe should also confirm if other documents have a filing date. For example, Order/Opinion documents likely have a docket number and maybe \"Filed\" date. But we can search. But to save time, we can search for \"filed\" in all documents. But we already have Docket search. But there could be a date in the Order/Opinion documents. But those are orders, not the filing. The filing likely occurs in docket. So only docket has filing date.\n\nThus we need to append the Filing_Date with value \"2025-06-20\" or \"06/20/2025\"? The format of date: the task says \"calendar date\". We should use \"2025-06-20\" or \"06/20/2025\"? The pattern used was \"Filed.*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\". So the date format appears as mm/dd/yyyy. The extracted value should be the calendar date. We can use \"2025-06-20\" or \"06/20/2025\". The checklists might accept either. But we should match the date string as found. Probably \"06/20/2025\". We'll use that.\n\nWe need to provide evidence. We can use the snippet from the search result. The snippet includes \"Entered: 06/20/2025\". So evidence: text: \"Entered: 06/20/2025\" or the full snippet. The location: tokens 0-150, etc. We'll choose one match. Use first match tokens 0-150. That includes the date. The snippet shows \"Entered: 06/20/2025\". That is evidence.\n\nThus we need to call append_checklist for Filing_Date with extracted value \"06/20/2025\" and evidence referencing Docket doc, location tokens 0-150. We should also maybe include other evidence from other matches to show we captured all distinct values. There's only one distinct value.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't miss any other filing dates. We should search again for \"Entered:\" in Docket to confirm no other dates. But we saw all are 06/20/2025. So it's fine.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.\n\nWe must provide JSON with patch containing key \"Filing_Date\" and extracted array with one object: value \"06/20/2025\", evidence array with the snippet.\n\nLet's craft evidence:\n\n{\n  text: \"Entered: 06/20/2025\",\n  source_document: \"Docket\",\n  location: \"tokens 0-150\"\n}\n\nWe can also include more context like \"Entered: 06/20/2025\" within the snippet. The snippet includes \"Entered: 06/20/2025\". We'll use that.\n\nThus call append_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Filing_Date\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"06/20/2025\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Entered: 06/20/2025\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-150\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "06/20/2025", "evidence": [{"text": "Entered: 06/20/2025", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 0-150"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3829, "completion_tokens": 1200, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But maybe other documents have different filing dates? Usually filing date is same across docket entries. But there could be different filing dates for other actions? \"Filed\" maybe in other documents? Let's search all documents for \"filed\" with regex. But we might need to read documents for confirmation. Use search_document_regex on all documents pattern: \"filed.*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\" was previously used. It found matches only in Docket. So other documents may not contain that pattern. But maybe filing date appears in other documents like \"Filed: 06/20/2025\" or \"Filed on 06/20/2025\". Let's search for \"Filed\\s*[:|on]\" pattern. Use regex \"Filed\\s*[:\\s]*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\". Search all documents. Also maybe \"Filing Date\" explicitly. Let's search for \"Filing Date\" phrase.

Already have one distinct value. We need to ensure no other distinct dates. But maybe the other documents have different filing dates for other petitions? But likely same. To be safe, we should check each unvisited document for any date patterns after \"filed\". We can search all docs again. But we already did. Could be that other documents have date in different format, like \"06/20/2025\" not preceded by \"filed\". But maybe the docket file shows filing date for each docket entry. Other documents may not mention filing date. But some documents might say \"filed on 06/20/2025\" etc. Search for \"filed on \\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\". Search all. Let's do search_document_regex pattern \"filed on\\s+\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\". Also maybe \"filed by\" with date. But likely no. Let's search for \"Filed:\" pattern. Use regex \"Filed\\s*:\\s*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\". Also \"Filed\\s+by\" maybe not date. Let's search for any date pattern in documents to see if any other dates appear. But we need only those that are filing dates. Maybe not necessary. Since we have only one distinct value, we might be done. But we must be sure that no other date exists. To be thorough, we could search for \"Filed\" pattern again but this time in unvisited docs. But search all still includes them. It returned only Docket. So no other docs contain that pattern.

Let's search other documents for \"Filed\" or \"Entered\" patterns.\n\nWe can search all documents for \"Entered:\" or \"Filed:\" patterns. The search already found matches in Docket.

But we can search for \"06/20/2025\" across all. That may give matches. Let's do search_document_regex with pattern \"06/20/2025\". But we also want to capture other dates if any.\n\nBut the filing date is likely only one distinct date: 06/20/2025. But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document\". So if only one date, we are done. But we must ensure that no other date appears in other docs. Let's search for \"06/20/2025\" in all docs. And also search for \"05/??/2025\" etc. But maybe the orders include dates in 2025 but not the filing date.

We have 06/20/2025. Maybe 06/06/2025 is not filing date. But maybe the order had a filing date of 06/06/2025? But the order text shows \"On June 6, 2025, U.S. Customs...\" That is not a filing date. So we exclude.\n\nAlso in Order (001) the \"Case: 25-4312, 07/16/2025\" indicates the case was filed on 07/16/2025. That is a filing date. In Order (002) \"Case: 25-4312, 08/01/2025\" indicates filed 08/01/2025. Also the Memorandum has \"On July 21, 2025, petitioner Carlos Osorto filed an ex parte application...\" That is a filing date. Also \"Case 2:25-cv-05605-MEMF-SP     Document 132     Filed 07/30/25\" indicates 07/30/25 filing date. So we have 07/30/25 which is 07/30/2025 maybe.\n\nThus distinct dates: 06/20/2025, 07/16/2025, 08/01/2025, 07/21/2025, 07/30/25. Also maybe \"07/16/2025\" appears multiple times. There might also be \"07/30/25\" maybe 07/30/2025.\n\nWe need to confirm evidence for each.\n\nWe already have evidence for 06/20/2025 from Docket. We need to gather evidence for the other dates.\n\nTherefore next action: search_document_regex across the remaining unvisited documents (Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications, Order (002) maybe already partially visited but maybe we need to confirm 08/01/2025). But we already have evidence for 08/01/2025 from Order (002) match 1. Also we have evidence for 07/16/2025 from Order (001) match 1. We need evidence for 07/21/2025 and 07/30/25 from Memorandum. Also possibly 07/30/25 is in the document.\n\nThus we should search for dates in the \"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications\" document. Also search in Memorandum for other dates.\n\nThus we'll do a search_document_regex across the two documents for date patterns.\n\nWe can use pattern: \"\\b\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}\\b\". Also we can capture month names like \"July 21, 2025\". But we can capture just numeric.\n\nBetter to search for both patterns: numeric and spelled.\n\nOk, let's call search_document_regex with doc_names: [\"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications for Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause Regarding Preliminary Injunction\", \"Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Petitioner Osorto's Ex Parte Application for Release from Immigration Custody\"] and pattern: \"\\b\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}\\b\". Also maybe we want to include month-year patterns like \"\\b(?:January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December) \\d{1,2}, \\d{4}\\b\".\n\nBut the numeric pattern should capture 07/30/25? That's only 2-digit year? It's 07/30/25, but that's 2-digit year. The pattern expects 4 digits. So we might miss that.\n\nWe could also search for pattern \"\\b\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}\\b\". But we need to confirm it's a filing date. But we can also rely on context: \"Filed 07/30/25\" appears. So we need evidence.\n\nThus maybe we search for pattern: \"(?:Filed|filing|filed|filed on|filed by|filed by|filing date|filing date:|filing date: \\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4})\" etc.\n\nBut simpler: search for \"Filed\" and then capture date.\n\nOk we can perform two searches: one for numeric dates 4-digit, one for \"Filed\" with date.\n\nBut we need to avoid reading too many tokens.\n\nBetter: do search_document_regex on the two documents for pattern: \"(?:Filed|filing|filed) \\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}\". That may capture \"Filed 07/30/2025\". But the pattern may not match \"Filed 07/30/25\" 2-digit year. But we can capture that too.\n\nBut easier: just search for numeric dates in the two documents, we may get 07/21/2025, 07/30/25? Might miss 07/30/25 due to 2-digit year. But maybe the file uses 07/30/25.\n\nSo we may do two searches: numeric 4-digit and 2-digit.\n\nOk, let's perform search_document_regex on the two documents for pattern: \"\\b\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}\\b\". Then separately search for pattern: \"\\b\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}\\b\". Also pattern for spelled month names.\n\nBut we can do combined pattern: \"(?:\\b\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}\\b|\\b\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}\\b|\\b(?:January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December) \\d{1,2}, \\d{4}\\b)\". That covers many.\n\nBut the search_document_regex function expects a pattern string; we can use regex.\n\nLet's do a search with pattern: \"(?:\\\\b\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{4}\\\\b|\\\\b\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{2}\\\\b|\\\\b(?:January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December) \\\\d{1,2}, \\\\d{4}\\\\b)\". And flags: \"IGNORECASE\", but probably not needed.\n\nOk.\n\nWe'll search only those two documents.\n\nThus we will call search_document_regex with doc_names: [\"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications for Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause Regarding Preliminary Injunction\", \"Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Petitioner Osorto's Ex Parte Application for Release from Immigration Custody\"].\n\nOk.\n\nThen after we get matches, we will parse them to identify distinct dates: there will be 07/21/2025, 07/30/25, maybe 07/30/2025? But we will evidence.\n\nBut we need to decide next action: search_document_regex. So we should do that.\n\nThus we produce function call.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications for Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause Regarding Preliminary Injunction\",\"Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Petitioner Osorto's Ex Parte Application for Release from Immigration Custody\"],\"pattern\":\"(?:\\\\b\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{4}\\\\b|\\\\b\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{2}/\\\\d{2}\\\\b|\\\\b(?:January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December) \\\\d{1,2}, \\\\d{4}\\\\b)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications for Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause Regarding Preliminary Injunction", "Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Petitioner Osorto's Ex Parte Application for Release from Immigration Custody"], "pattern": "(?:\\b\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}\\b|\\b\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{2}\\b|\\b(?:January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December) \\d{1,2}, \\d{4}\\b)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8068, "completion_tokens": 2277, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Already one date from Docket: presumably 06/20/2025. But maybe other documents have filing dates. We should search for filing date patterns across all docs. We have seen many matches for dates, but many are \"Entered: 06/20/2025\" from docket entries. Also the documents Order (001) and (002) have \"Case: 25-4312, 07/16/2025\" etc. Also the memorandum has \"Filed 07/30/25\" but that's the filing date of that document, not the lawsuit. The filing date of lawsuit is likely the earliest date when the lawsuit was filed. From docket entries, the earliest \"Entered\" date is 06/20/2025. Check if there's earlier. Might be earlier docket entries not yet visited. We have visited only 0-582 of the 33k tokens. There may be earlier entries earlier? Docket start tokens 0-582 show several entries with 06/20/2025. Could be earlier but likely same date. All docket entries show 06/20/2025. So only one filing date. But we must confirm no other distinct filing dates exist. The other orders might have their own filing dates but those are separate filings. The lawsuit was filed on 06/20/2025. So we need to append the value with evidence from Docket.\n\nWe need to read the specific token range where the filing date appears. The search results show tokens 34-234 etc. But we need to read the relevant portion. Let's read one of those ranges: maybe tokens 34-234 in Docket. We'll read that to capture the date. The snippet shows (Entered: 06/20/2025). Provide evidence. So we'll do read_document on Docket start_token 34 end_token 234. That will give us the text.\n\nAfter reading, we will append the value. Then stop. But we need to ensure no other distinct filing dates. Could any other doc have different filing dates for the same lawsuit? If the lawsuit was filed on 06/20/2025, all other documents are later. So we can stop after appending.

The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We need to check other documents for filing dates. From the search results, many documents show \"Filed 07/30/25\" etc. But \"Filed\" may refer to filing date of a document, not necessarily the lawsuit filing date. The lawsuit filing date likely appears in the docket and maybe in the orders. We should search for filing dates in other documents. The docket shows 06/20/2025. The orders might have dates of filing too. For example, Order (001) shows \"Case: 25-4312, 07/16/2025\". That might be the filing date of the appeal. That might be a filing date for a higher-level case. But the initial lawsuit filing date is probably 06/20/2025. But we need to confirm if there are other distinct dates. In Memorandum Opinion, we saw \"Filed 07/30/25\". That could be the filing date of that order. But the requirement is \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" That is one date. So likely only one date: 06/20/2025. But we should double-check if any earlier date appears, like 06/20/2025 is first entry. Could there be 06/19/2025? Search for \"Filed\" dates earlier. In the docket, the earliest entry is 06/20/2025. In other documents, the earliest might be 07/16/2025. But that's later. So unique date is 06/20/2025. So we already have that. But we must ensure no other filing date exists. But the question might consider any \"Filed\" date as filing date. But the docket shows the \"Entered: 06/20/2025\". That is the filing date. There may be other docket entries with same date. But distinct value count is 1.\n\nThus we have complete extraction. We need to stop. But we must confirm no other distinct dates. The search results for other documents show \"Filed 07/11/25\" in Order Granting Plaintiffs, \"Filed 07/30/25\" in Memorandum Opinion. Those are filing dates for those documents but not the lawsuit. But the requirement is for lawsuit first filed.
