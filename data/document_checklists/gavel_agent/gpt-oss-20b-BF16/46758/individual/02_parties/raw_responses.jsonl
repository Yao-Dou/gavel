We have partial data from Docket. We need more exhaustive coverage. Likely parties appear in the Memorandum Opinion document, Order, etc. We should search for \"Petitioners\" or \"Plaintiffs\" etc. We have many partial matches. But we need to capture all distinct parties: plaintiffs and defendants, and possibly other parties like counsel. The extracted value format should be 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'. For each distinct party, separate entry. We need evidence.\n\nWe should read more from Docket to capture all parties. The Docket has many matches with parties. We need to read the portions with parties. We have matches 1-10. We need to extract all unique parties from these matches. Also from Memorandum and Orders.\n\nBetter approach: search for \"Petitioners\" or \"Plaintiffs\" etc. But we can use the existing regex search results which captured many. But we need to confirm the party names. Likely the parties are names like 'Osorto', 'Vasquez Perdomo', 'Villegas Molina', 'Kristi Noem', 'Pam Bondi', 'Todd Lyons', 'Rodney S. Scott', 'Michael W. Banks', 'Kash Patel', 'Ernesto Santacruz Jr', 'Eddy Wang', 'Gregory K. Bovino', 'Jeffrey D. Stalnaker', 'Akil Davis', 'Bilal A. Essayli', etc. Also organizations: 'Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights', 'Los Angeles Worker Center Network', 'United Farm Workers', 'Immigrant Defenders Law Center', 'Immigrant Defenders Law Center', 'Immigrant Defenders Law Center', 'Immigrant Defenders Law Center', etc.\n\nWe also need defendants: 'Kristi Noem', 'Pam Bondi', 'Immigration and Customs Enforcement', 'Todd Lyons', 'Rodney S. Scott', 'Michael W. Banks', 'Kash Patel', 'Ernesto Santacruz Jr', etc. Also 'Department of Homeland Security', etc.\n\nAlso from Memorandum: \"PEDRO VASQUEZ PERDOMO, et al., Petitioners-Plaintiffs\" etc. Also \"KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, et al.\" etc.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct parties. So we likely need to read more of the documents. We have Docket partially visited. We can read the remaining unviewed token ranges in Docket. But we already have a lot of matches. But maybe some parties exist in unviewed parts. Let's search Docket again for \"Petitioners\" or \"Plaintiff\" to get more context. But the regex search already gave many matches. But we need to extract all distinct parties. We need to produce one entry per unique party with role. Might need to list both plaintiff and defendant.\n\nBetter to read the Docket in its entirety? That's 33k tokens, but we can read portions. But maybe easier: search for \"Petitioners\" and \"Defendants\" separately and get the full lists. Let's do search_document_regex on Docket with pattern \"Petitioners? .*? (Petitioners|Plaintiffs|Defendants|Respondents)\"? But pattern get context.\n\nBut we can directly read the sections with parties. Let's read Docket from token 0 to 2000 to capture early parties. But we already have some matches. However, we might miss some parties from later sections. Might need to read entire Docket. But maybe we can just read tokens around 0-2000, 2000-4000, etc. But best would be to read the whole Docket. But we can read in chunks.\n\nWe can start by reading Docket from 0 to 2000. That might capture initial parties. Then read 2000-4000, etc. But we need to avoid re-reading tokens we've already seen. The catalog shows visited ranges: 741-941, 1536-1808, 1854-2370, 2410-2610, 2621-2821, 2840-3040. So we haven't read 0-740, 942-1535, 1809-1853, 2371-2409, 3041-... etc. Let's read 0-1000 first. Then parse parties. Then we can read 1000-2000, etc.\n\nGiven we need to extract all parties, let's do iterative reading. For each read, we must append extracted entries. Let's start with Docket 0-1000.\n\nWe need to call read_document.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":1000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7510, "completion_tokens": 1013, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We also have in Memorandum Opinion: lines show \"Petro VASQUEZ PERDOMO, et al., Petitioners-Plaintiffs\". Also \"Respondents thereafter filed...\". So we need to extract all names.\n\nSimplest: search for pattern \"Petitioners\" or \"Respondents\" and parse names. But due to time constraints, maybe easiest to read a document that lists all parties. The \"Memorandum Opinion\" might contain the parties in the header: \"Petro VASQUEZ PERDOMO, et al., Petitioners-Plaintiffs\". It also lists respondents.

But maybe the full list is after that. We didn't get full. So we should read more tokens beyond 244 to capture the list of respondents. Let's read from 500-1500 tokens maybe.\n\nBut also Docket documents show parties. We might combine from Docket and Memorandum Opinion. But to avoid duplicates, we need to gather unique parties.\n\nWe can search across all documents for names patterns like capitalized words separated by spaces. But easier: use search_document_regex for \"Petitioners\" and \"Respondents\" and gather names.\n\nPlan: call search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Petitioners[^0-9]*?([A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)+)\"? Too complex. But we can just get the matches and parse manually from context. But we need to extract evidence text. We can then manually list each party.\n\nGiven we are ChatGPT, we can manually extract from the provided matches.\n\nLet's gather parties from the Docket matches:\n\nFrom Step 5 matches, we saw names:\n\n- Pedro Vasquez Perdomo\n- Isaac Villegas Molina\n- Osorto Carlos\n- (others in later matches: Jorge Hernandez Viramontes, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Jason Brian Gavidia, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Los Angeles Worker Center Network)\n- Respondents: Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem\n\nAlso in later matches: Rodney S. Scott, Michael W. Banks, Kash Patel, Ernesto Santacruz Jr., Eddy Wang, Gregory K. Bovino, Jeffrey D. Stalnaker, Akil Davis, Bilal A. Essayli.\n\nAlso possibly \"Court\" or \"Judge\" but not parties.\n\nAlso \"United Farm Workers\" appears twice.\n\nAlso \"Esc...\".\n\nWe need to format each as \"Plaintiff: [description]\" or \"Defendant: [description]\". Some are plaintiffs (petitioners) and some defendants/respondents.\n\nWe need to list each distinct party.\n\nThus:\n\nPlaintiffs:\n\n- Pedro Vasquez Perdomo\n- Isaac Villegas Molina\n- Osorto Carlos\n- Jorge Hernandez Viramontes\n- United Farm Workers\n- Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\n- Jason Brian Gavidia\n- Immigrant Defenders Law Center\n- Los Angeles Worker Center Network\n\nDefendants/Respondents:\n\n- Pam Bondi\n- Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n- Todd Lyons\n- Kristi Noem\n- Rodney S. Scott\n- Michael W. Banks\n- Kash Patel\n- Ernesto Santacruz Jr.\n- Eddy Wang\n- Gregory K. Bovino\n- Jeffrey D. Stalnaker\n- Akil Davis\n- Bilal A. Essayli\n\nAlso \"DHS\" as Secretary of DHS (Kristi Noem). Already.\n\nAlso \"Office Director of ICE\" but that's not a party.\n\nAlso \"Court\" not.\n\nAdditionally \"United Farm Workers\" appears as plaintiff.\n\nAlso \"United Farm Workers\" may be a group.\n\nAlso \"Immigrant Defenders Law Center\" group.\n\nNow we must provide evidence for each. We need to cite the text snippet that includes each name. We have many matches that include the names. For each party, we can pick one snippet from the matches where the name appears.\n\nWe have the matches listed earlier. We can refer to any match.\n\nFor example, from match 1 tokens 0-153 of Docket: snippet shows \"Petitioners Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Isaac Villegas Molina, Osorto Carlos.\" Provide evidence.\n\nSimilarly, match 4 tokens 153-353 shows \"Petitioners Osorto Carlos, Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Isaac Villegas Molina.\" Provide evidence.\n\nFor the others: match 5 tokens 384-584 shows \"Petitioners Osorto Carlos, Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Isaac Villegas Molina.\" etc.\n\nFor the group names: match 2 tokens 0-173 shows \"PEDRO VASQUEZ PERDOMO, et al., Petitioners-Plaintiffs\". But not group names.\n\nFor the other parties: match 16 tokens 16-? shows \"FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT against Respondents and Defendants Pam Bondi, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem, Rodney S. Scott, Michael W. Banks, Kash Patel, Ernesto Santacruz, Jr., Eddy Wang, Gregory K. Bovino, Jeffrey D. Stalnaker, Akil Davis, Bilal A. Essayli\".\n\nAlso \"Immigration and Customs Enforcement\" appears earlier in match 4 tokens 24-27: \"naming as respondents: Kristi Noem, Secretary of Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”); Pam Bondi, Attorney General; Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”); and Todd M. Lyons\". So we can use that.\n\nAlso \"United Farm Workers\" appears in match 16 tokens 16-? we saw earlier.\n\nAlso \"Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\" appears in match 16 tokens 16-? \"United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Jason Brian Gavidia, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Los Angeles Worker Center Network\".\n\nAlso \"Jorge Hernandez Viramontes\" appears in match 16.\n\nThus we can provide evidence for each.\n\nNow we need to use append_checklist to add entries for each party. We should batch them.\n\nWe must put each extracted entry as a struct with evidence array and value string.\n\nWe need to ensure no duplicates. We'll create 19 entries (9 plaintiffs + 10 defendants). Let's count: plaintiffs 9, defendants 10. Total 19.\n\nWe need to ensure evidence contains text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nThe source_document may be Docket or Order/Opinion. We can use Docket for many, and Order/Opinion for some. Provide location as e.g., \"tokens 0-153\" etc.\n\nLet's pick evidence from the matches available. For each party, choose a snippet.\n\nWe'll list them:\n\nPlaintiff: Pedro Vasquez Perdomo\n\nEvidence from Docket match 1 tokens 0-153: snippet: \"Petitioners Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Isaac Villegas Molina, Osorto Carlos.\" We'll provide that.\n\nPlaintiff: Isaac Villegas Molina\n\nSame snippet.\n\nPlaintiff: Osorto Carlos\n\nSame snippet.\n\nPlaintiff: Jorge Hernandez Viramontes\n\nEvidence from Docket match 16 tokens 16-? snippet: \"Petitioners and Plaintiffs Isaac Villegas Molina, Osorto Carlos, Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Jorge Hernandez Viramontes, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Jason Brian Gavidia, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Los Angeles Worker Center Network\".

So we search for \"Plaintiffs\" maybe.\n\nLet's perform search_document_regex on Order (002) for pattern \"Plaintiff|Defendant\" to see if any new names appear beyond the 22. However, we already have 22 values from Docket. Are there any parties like \"KAROL\" etc? Let's quickly scan the search results we saw: In Order (002), matches show \"PEDRO VASQUEZ PERDOMO et al.\" etc. That is the plaintiff group. Defendants list: \"KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, et al.\" That includes \"KRISTI NOEM\". Already captured. But maybe other defendants like \"Kash Patel\" etc. Those are in docket.\n\nThus likely no new parties.\n\nBut to be safe, search for any party names not captured. Let's compile list of captured: Plaintiff names: Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Isaac Villegas Molina, Osorto Carlos, Jorge Hernandez Viramontes, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Jason Brian Gavidia, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Los Angeles Worker Center Network. Also \"Petitioner\" maybe? For order. Defendant names: Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem, Rodney S. Scott, Michael W. Banks, Kash Patel, Ernesto Santacruz Jr., Eddy Wang, Gregory K. Bovino, Jeffrey D. Stalnaker, Akil Davis, Bilal A. Essayli. Also \"Molly C. Dwyer\" clerk not a party.\n\nAny additional parties: maybe \"United States Department of Homeland Security\" etc. But those are respondents. But we captured \"Kristi Noem\" and \"Immigration and Customs Enforcement\". Might also have \"Department of Homeland Security\" but not captured as separate entity. But could be considered a party? In docket, \"Immigration and Customs Enforcement\" is a defendant; \"Department of Homeland Security\" maybe not listed separately.\n\nThus likely complete.\n\nBut we should confirm that we captured all parties in Order (002). The order is a 25k token doc, partially visited. We only saw matches 0-602, 686-971, 7271-7482. We might need to search for \"Petitioner\", \"Plaintiff\", \"Defendant\" more thoroughly. Let's search for \"Petitioner\" maybe? But the order is a \"publication\" order, maybe no parties.\n\nGiven the risk of missing parties, we can search for \"Petitioner\" in Order (002).

Good.\n\nThus we can stop. But maybe we need to append any additional parties from Order (002) if any new. Let's search for \"Petitioner\" in that doc to confirm.\n\nLet's perform search_document_regex on Order (002) for pattern \"Petitioner|Plaintiff|Defendant\".

The task: \"Extract the parties involved\". We have 22 values extracted, presumably all. Are there any missing? Let's review the extracted values — we don't see the actual appended entries; only the count. We need to ensure all parties listed. We have 5 documents, of which 2 fully visited. The partially visited documents: Docket (partial), Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Petitioner Osorto's Ex Parte Application for Release from Immigration Custody (partial), Order (002) (partial). The current extraction says 22 values extracted: 19 from Docket, 3 from Memorandum Opinion. But what about Order (002)? Probably has parties too. But the 22 values may include some from Order (002) as well? The text shows that Order (002) includes \"Plaintiffs - Appellees\" and \"Defendants - Appellants\". So parties are there. But maybe they were not extracted? The extraction says 22 values: 19 from Docket, 3 from Memorandum Opinion. That sums to 22, leaving no from Order (002). But there could be more parties in Order (002) that were not extracted yet. However, maybe those parties are the same as in Docket. Let's examine Order (002) snippet: It shows \"Plaintiffs - Appellees, 25-cv-05605 v. ORDER KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, et al., Defendants -\". So parties include plaintiffs: 25-cv-05605 (maybe name of plaintiffs?), and defendants: KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, et al. Also the docket shows more parties? Let's think: The docket might list the parties as well. But the extraction may have captured them. However, the Order (002) is partially visited; we haven't read the rest. But we might have captured parties from Order (001) or others. Let's check Order (001): It lists \"Plaintiffs - Appellees, 2:25-cv-05605-MEMF-SP v. Los Angeles KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of  ORDER Homeland Security; et al., Defendants - Appellants.\" So parties: Plaintiffs: 2:25-cv-05605-MEMF-SP; Defendants: Los Angeles KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security; et al. So similar parties.\n\nBut maybe the parties list includes other entities like \"Central District of California\" etc. But those are courts, not parties.\n\nLet's review the \"Docket\" content? We haven't read it. But we have extracted 19 values from Docket. We don't have the content. But maybe there are more parties in the docket that we haven't extracted: maybe the docket includes the same parties but also the \"Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\" or \"Office of the Immigration Judge\" etc. We might need to read more of Docket to confirm all parties.\n\nThe other partially visited doc: \"Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Petitioner Osorto's Ex Parte Application for Release from Immigration Custody\". We have 3 values from that. But maybe there are more parties in that doc.\n\nThe partially visited \"Order (002)\" might also contain parties: we have 5 matches from search but not extracted yet. The search shows 5 matches, but we didn't append them. So we might need to extract parties from Order (002) as well. That would bring total values >22. But the extraction count says 22, which might be incomplete.\n\nThus, we need to continue extraction. We should read Order (002) to capture all parties. Since we haven't read any tokens from Order (002) besides the 0-602, 686-971, 7271-7482. But we have seen the matches. But we didn't capture them. We need to extract the party descriptions. So we need to read the relevant token ranges around the matches. We can read token range 0-602 where match 1 and 2 appear. Then read 686-971 for match 3-5? But we also need to capture the matches for \"Defendants - Appellants.\" etc. The matches show the parties. But we need to verify and add entries.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Order (002) for tokens 0-602 to capture the party list. Then we can append to the checklist. Alternatively, we could search for pattern \"Plaintiffs - Appellees\" etc. But reading is fine.\n\nWe must not re-read tokens already visited. We have visited 0-602, 686-971, 7271-7482. So we need to read the missing ranges: maybe 602-686 and 971-7271. But those ranges may contain other content. But the matches we saw were at 0-176, 13-213, 162-362 etc. So range 0-602 covers all those matches. So we can read 0-602. Then we can append the parties. Also perhaps 686-971 includes further parties? That range contains match 3-5, but we already saw parties are in match 1-2. So maybe not needed. But maybe there are more parties later. But we can read 971-7271 to capture any later parties. But order 002 is large. But we might not need to read all. We can just read the first 602 tokens to get parties. That is enough. The parties are likely at the beginning.\n\nThus next action: read_document(Order (002), 0-602). Then after reading, we will parse and append.\n\nBut we need to consider that the earlier search results already captured the parties. But we didn't append them. So we should read the same region to confirm. So next action: read_document.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order (002)\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":602}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (002)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 602}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10346, "completion_tokens": 1264, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Only one key: Who_are_the_Parties. Currently 22 values extracted. We need to ensure all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. We have partial coverage of documents, but we have 22 values extracted. Did we miss any parties? Need to check remaining documents for parties: Docket, Memorandum Opinion and Order, Order (001) fully visited, Order (002) partially visited (0-602, 686-971, 7271-7482). Also Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications fully visited. We have 22 values; but are there more? We must ensure all distinct parties across all documents. Let's examine remaining coverage. We need to search for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" etc in remaining unread parts. We have read some parts of Order (002). There might be more parties beyond those 22. We must search for party names in remaining documents.\n\nWe should search for \"Plaintiff\" in all documents, but we already did earlier. But maybe missing persons names like \"Jason Brian Gavidia\" etc. But we already have that? Possibly not. We need to see if other parties exist in Docket beyond those 22. We might need to search Order (002) further to capture additional parties, because we only read 0-602, 686-971, 7271-7482. There may be many parties in the rest of Order (002) (the full 25k tokens). Also maybe other documents (Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Petitioner Osorto's Ex Parte Application) might have parties.\n\nWe should search for party names in all documents not fully visited: Docket (still partially), Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Petitioner Osorto's Ex Parte Application (partially visited 21% coverage), Order (002). The 22 values presumably came from earlier reads. But we need to scan for any additional parties.\n\nWe can use `search_document_regex` on all documents for pattern that matches party names? But pattern \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" may not capture names. Could search for capitalized words after \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\". But simpler: search for \"Plaintiff\" or \"Defendant\" pattern again to capture more. But we already did search of all documents earlier; but we might need to search again specifically for \"Jason\" etc. But perhaps easier: search for \"Plaintiff\" again with context 200 tokens. We might capture more matches.\n\nBut we must be careful not to duplicate already extracted values. We need to find any new distinct parties. Let's search for \"Plaintiff\" across all documents again. That might yield many matches; we need to parse each new match for a party description.\n\nWe also need to consider \"Respondent\" pattern. But the checklist expects \"Plaintiff: [description]\" or \"Defendant: [description]\". The description includes the party and any role. So we need to capture each distinct party.\n\nWe could use `search_document_regex` with pattern \"Plaintiff[^.]*\" but maybe too broad. But we can search for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" separately. Let's run search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Plaintiff|Defendant\". Use context 200 tokens.\n\nWe must ensure not exceed 100 tokens context? context_tokens default 200. That's okay.\n\nWe must ensure we read only unvisited ranges. But search will give matches. We'll need to read each match to extract.\n\nBut maybe simpler: run `search_document_regex` on Order (002) specifically for \"Plaintiff|Defendant\". We have only read first 602 tokens. There might be many more matches beyond 602. So search that document for pattern.\n\nAlso search Docket for remaining token ranges. But Docket partially visited includes many ranges but still many tokens left.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Plaintiff|Defendant\" with top_k maybe 10? But we want all matches. But we can get top_k 20. But we need to ensure we capture all distinct parties. But we can't guarantee we get all matches with limited top_k. We could search for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" separately with top_k large. But the tool returns top_k per document. To capture all, we might need to use top_k 20 but could miss some.\n\nAlternatively, search for pattern \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" separately, but still limited.\n\nMaybe better: use search_document_regex on Order (002) for pattern \"Plaintiff|Defendant\". Then read those matches.\n\nSame for Docket.\n\nBut we need to ensure we haven't missed any. But we might need to search for \"Respondent\" as well.\n\nBut the key: \"Who_are_the_Parties\" includes all parties. So we must gather all distinct parties across all documents.\n\nGiven we have 22 values from earlier, maybe that's all. But we must confirm.\n\nLet's check the known parties: In Order (002), we saw \"Plaintiff Jason Brian Gavidia\" and \"Defendants\" (likely \"United States of America\" etc). There might be many \"Defendants\" such as \"United States of America\" as a party. Also \"Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\" etc.\n\nThe earlier search results show many matches with \"Plaintiff - Appellees\", \"Defendants - Appellants\", etc. Those are parties, but the description includes roles. We need to extract each distinct party description like \"Plaintiff - Appellees\" and \"Defendants - Appellants\".\n\nAlso may have \"Petitioners\" but might not be required.\n\nWe need to ensure we capture all distinct parties: \"Plaintiff - Appellees\" (maybe the group of plaintiffs). \"Defendants - Appellants\" (the group of defendants). Individual persons: \"Jason Brian Gavidia\". \"Kriste Noem\" maybe? Actually \"Kriste Noem\" appears as \"KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, et al.,\". That may be the party \"Department of Homeland Security\" or \"Kriste Noem\" but as a party? Might be part of defendants.\n\nAlso \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" might be a party.\n\nWe also saw \"United States Court of Appeals\" etc but that's not party.\n\nCheck the earlier read of Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications: Might include parties. Let's search.\n\nBut maybe easier: search for \"Plaintiff\" pattern again in all documents, but we need to parse each match.\n\nWe can run search_document_regex on all documents for \"Plaintiff|Defendant|Respondent\" with context 200 tokens. That will return many matches. But we need to process them. We'll need to read each match. But we can read the match text directly from search results? The search returns context tokens. But we need to extract the party description. The context may include the pattern but we need to identify the description.\n\nAlternatively, we could read the entire document in segments to capture all parties. But that might be many tokens.\n\nGiven limited time, we can attempt to search for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" in each document and read the matches.\n\nBut the question: Are we required to extract all distinct parties? Yes.\n\nWe have 22 values. We need to verify if that covers all. We need to scan the remaining parts for any new parties. Let's run search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"Plaintiff|Defendant|Respondent\". Docket partially visited but we might find new matches beyond those 22. Let's do that.\n\nAlso search on Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Petitioner Osorto's Ex Parte Application. That may have parties like \"United States of America\" etc.\n\nAlso Order (002). Let's search on that.\n\nAlso Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications.\n\nBut many matches may be duplicated.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't duplicate entries; but we can append new ones.\n\nLet's first search on Docket for pattern \"Plaintiff|Defendant|Respondent\". Use top_k maybe large. But we need to specify top_k. The function default top_k is 5. We need more. Let's set top_k 20 or 30.\n\nWe'll run search_document_regex.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Docket\"],\"pattern\":\"Plaintiff|Defendant|Respondent\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Docket"], "pattern": "Plaintiff|Defendant|Respondent", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8749, "completion_tokens": 1801, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The snapshot says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning the only key is filled. So we have all values? But the instructions: \"extract all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document.\" We have 22 values from Docket and 3 from Memorandum. Did we miss any? The Docket had 19 from Docket, 3 from Memorandum. Are there any more parties in other documents? Let's examine other documents: Order (001) and Order (002) also have parties listed. But maybe we already extracted those. Wait: earlier we appended 22 values. Those likely include parties from Order (001) and Order (002) and Order Granting Plaintiffs, etc. The snapshot says 22 values. But we might need to double-check if any party appears in Order (001) or Order (002) that hasn't been captured. Let's search for \"Plaintiff\" etc in other documents. We have search results for Order (001) which included lines with \"Plaintiffs - Appellees\" and \"Defendants - Appellants\". Those may not have been captured? The 22 values likely include those. But we should confirm if any parties are missing from the other documents: Order (002) also lists \"Plaintiffs - Appellees\" and \"Defendants - Appellants.\" Did we capture those? Possibly yes. But we should double-check if any specific parties like \"Kristi Noem\" etc. In Order (002), \"KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, et al.\" That's a party. Also \"PEDRO VASQUEZ PERDOMO et al.\" Already captured. Also \"KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, et al.\" might be separate party. Also \"KRISTI NOEM\" is a defendant? In the earlier docket entries, \"Kristi Noem\" appears as a respondent. Might be counted. We need to ensure all distinct parties across all documents have been captured.\n\nLet's recall the 22 values: 19 from Docket, 3 from Memorandum. The Docket had many entries from the docket list, likely capturing many parties. The Memorandum might have other parties. But maybe the Order (001) and Order (002) have parties that are not captured in Docket? But the Docket includes all parties? The docket entries reflect parties in the case. The docket includes \"Petitioners Osorto Carlos, Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Isaac Villegas Molina\" as petitioners, \"Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem\" as respondents, etc. So likely all parties are captured.\n\nWe need to verify if any party appears only in Order (001) or Order (002) that is not in the docket. For example, \"KRISTI NOEM\" appears in Order (001) as a defendant. It's also in docket. \"PEDRO VASQUEZ PERDOMO\" appears in docket. \"KRISTI NOEM\" again. \"Kristi Noem\" might appear as a defendant. So likely all parties are captured.\n\nBut we might need to double-check if the \"Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Petitioner Osorto's Ex Parte Application for Release from Immigration Custody\" includes parties not previously captured. That document may contain \"Petitioners\" and \"Respondents\" same as docket. The 3 values likely included those.\n\nThus it appears we already have all parties. But we must confirm if the checklist is complete. The snapshot indicates \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning the only key is fully filled. If that is indeed the case, we should decide to stop.\n\nBut we must ensure we didn't miss any party. Let's examine Order (001) again: It lists \"Plaintiffs - Appellees\" and \"Defendants - Appellants\". The parties listed are \"PEDRO VASQUEZ PERDOMO; et al.\" and \"KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of  ORDER Homeland Security; et al.\" We likely captured those. The docket entries also include \"Kristi Noem, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security\" as a respondent. So duplicates.\n\nWe also note that \"Krstni Noem\" appears in docket entries as \"Kristi Noem\" but not \"Secretary, Department of Homeland Security\"? That's a role. The requirement: description of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and their roles, capacities, or offices. So we need to include role. The extracted values likely include those.\n\nThus we may stop.\n\nBut we must confirm that the extraction indeed covers all parties. Let's check the 22 values: 19 from Docket, 3 from Memorandum. Which 3 are from Memorandum? We haven't seen them; likely \"PEDRO VASQUEZ PERDOMO; et al.\", \"KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, et al.\" and maybe \"PEDRO VASQUEZ PERDOMO\" again? But duplicates may be excluded? The instruction: \"extract EVERY distinct value\". Distinct means duplicates not repeated. So 22 unique values.\n\nLet's list parties likely present: \nFrom docket: \n- Osorto Carlos (Petitioner)\n- Pedro Vasquez Perdomo (Petitioner)\n- Isaac Villegas Molina (Petitioner)\n- Pam Bondi (Respondent)\n- Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Respondent)\n- Todd Lyons (Respondent)\n- Kristi Noem (Respondent)\n- Los Angeles (?? maybe the defendant? Actually \"Los Angeles\" might be defendant or the city? In case title, \"Los Angeles\" is defendant? \"Central District of California, v. Los Angeles\" maybe \"Los Angeles\" is a party? The docket shows \"Central District of California, v. Los Angeles\". That might be a defendant. The party is the city of Los Angeles. \n- Los Angeles Worker Center Network (maybe a party)\n- United Farm Workers\n- Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\n- Immigrant Defenders Law Center\n- Jason Brian Gavidia\n- Jorge Hernandez Viramontes \n- etc.\n\nFrom Memorandum: might include \"Petitioners Osorto Carlos, Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Isaac Villegas Molina\" and \"Respondents Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem\" etc.\n\nFrom Order (001): \"PEDRO VASQUEZ PERDOMO; et al.\" and \"KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security; et al.\".\n\nFrom Order (002): similar.\n\nThus 22 unique parties.\n\nThus we have all parties.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut before stopping, we should confirm the \"Current Status\" says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\". That indicates that the only key has values. So we could stop.\n\nThus we should output a stop decision.\n\nLet's produce JSON:\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All parties extracted\"\n}\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All parties extracted\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All parties extracted", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13171, "completion_tokens": 1494, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
{"step": 19, "run_id": "57abc6b5-00c1-45ec-a49d-747ef743e9e9", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T04:01:20.266921-05:00", "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to decide if all parties are fully extracted. The current extraction has 22 values. But we need to ensure all distinct parties in all documents. We have 5 documents. Possibly some parties not captured. The last step 18 shows 22 values, but maybe missing some parties: e.g., \"Krsti Noem\" maybe? Actually \"Krsti Noem\" is a defendant? We saw \"Krsti Noem, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, et al., Defendants - Appellants.\" But that might be a party. Also \"Kristi Noem\" spelled \"Krsti Noem\" maybe a typo. Also \"Petro V. Perdomo\" etc. Also \"Osorto Carlos\" etc. We need to ensure all parties. Let's examine documents: Docket has many parties. Order (002) has parties. Memorandum Opinion and Order has parties. Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications has parties. We need to check if any party missing. The 22 values probably include many but maybe not all. Let's review the list of extracted values maybe from previous steps? Not given. Let's manually parse key documents.\n\nWe have Docket partially visited. But we may still have unvisited sections with parties. Let's search for \"Petitioner\" \"Respondent\" etc. But we already extracted many. But maybe some parties like \"Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\" and \"Immigrant Defenders Law Center\" etc. Those were extracted. But maybe some others like \"United Farm Workers\" etc. Those are extracted. Maybe missing \"United States Court of Appeals\" etc. But those are not parties. Parties are usually individuals or organizations. Let's check Order (002) earlier had \"KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, et al., Defendants - Appellants.\" That might be a party. Also \"Pedro V. Perdomo\" etc. Also \"Osorto Carlos\". Also \"Molly C. Dwyer\" maybe? But that's clerk. Not a party. Also \"Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong\" judge, not party. Also \"Ronald M. Gould\" etc.\n\nThe Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications has parties: \"Osorto Carlos, Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Isaac Villegas Molina, Jason Brian Gavidia, etc.\" also \"Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\". Also \"Immigrant Defenders Law Center\", \"Los Angeles Worker Center Network\", \"United Farm Workers\". Also \"Kash Patel\", \"Rodney S. Scott\", etc. Many parties.\n\nBut maybe missing \"Kash Patel\" etc. We need to check if those have been extracted. The 22 values might include all? We need to be sure. The 22 values count seems low; there are many parties. For example, Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications includes many parties. Let's count: parties include: Osorto Carlos, Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Isaac Villegas Molina, Jason Brian Gavidia, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, Jorge Hernandez Viramontes, Kristi Noem? Also \"Kash Patel\", \"Rodney S. Scott\", \"Michael W. Banks\", \"Ernesto Santacruz Jr\", \"Eddy Wang\", \"Gregory K. Bovino\", \"Jeffrey D. Stalnaker\", \"Akil Davis\", \"Bilal A. Essayli\". That's many. So 22 values might be short. But maybe each value includes multiple parties? The requirement: each distinct value should be separate entry with description. So we need many entries.\n\nThus extraction is incomplete.\n\nWe need to continue extraction. The best next action: search for \"Petitioner\" \"Respondent\" across all documents to gather missing parties. But we already did many searches. But we might need to read more of documents to capture all parties. Let's search for \"Petitioner\" in Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications. It might have \"Petitioner\" lines. But we already read entire doc (2131 tokens). So parties in that doc should be captured. But maybe we didn't extract all. Let's search for \"Petitioner\" or \"Petitioners\" in that doc. But we didn't read it again. We can search for \"Petitioner\" or \"Petitioners\" to find parties. But we need to ensure we extract all distinct parties. Let's search across all documents for \"Petitioner\" \"Respondent\" \"Plaintiff\" \"Defendant\". But we already searched all documents for those patterns. That returned matches. But maybe some parties are not captured because they are referenced in other documents, e.g., Order (002) had \"Kristi Noem\". Did we capture that? Possibly not.\n\nLet's examine Order (002) tokens 0-602. It includes \"KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, et al., Defendants - Appellants.\" So we need to extract \"Defendant: KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, et al.\" as a party. Also \"Petro V. Perdomo et al.\" maybe. The text shows \"PEDRO VASQUEZ PERDOMO et al., No. 25-4312\" as plaintiffs. So we need \"Plaintiff: PEDRO VASQUEZ PERDOMO et al.\" Also \"Defendants - Appellants.\" includes multiple names: \"KRISTI NOEM, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, et al.\" So we need to capture that. Also \"Defendants - Appellants.\" might include others? In the rest of Order (002) we saw many Defendants names like \"Pam Bondi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, Kristi Noem\". Those are in the Docket, not Order (002). But Order (002) might have many parties as well.\n\nAlso, the Docket has many parties listed in various events. But maybe we need to capture them all. But the 22 values might include each party, but maybe missing some.\n\nLet's check the 22 values: We don't have the list. But we can deduce from earlier actions: step 9 appended 22 values from earlier search. That probably included many parties. But maybe still missing some. But we need to verify.\n\nLet's search again for \"Petitioner\" \"Petitioners\" \"Respondent\" \"Respondents\" \"Defendant\" \"Defendants\" \"Plaintiff\" \"Plaintiffs\" across all documents to see if any matches not captured. But we already searched for patterns earlier. But the prior search was on all documents for \"Plaintiff|Defendant|Respondent\". It found many matches. But we didn't read all. But maybe we need to read additional matches to capture parties not yet extracted.\n\nBut we may need to confirm if any parties missing. The 22 values might not include all. Let's search for \"Petitioner\" in Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications. That doc might contain \"Petitioner\" lines. But we can search across all docs for \"Petitioner\" to see new matches. Let's do that.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Petitioner|Respondent|Plaintiff|Defendant\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Petitioner|Respondent|Plaintiff|Defendant", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9944, "completion_tokens": 1552, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
