We have 5 docs. We already searched for \"Trial\" and found a match in Order (002). That snippet is some law text, might not be trial info. But we should search for trial info maybe in other docs. We should read more of Order (002) to see if trial info appears. But maybe other documents contain trial info. Let's examine the other documents. The docket may have trial info. The memorandum opinion may contain trial info. The other orders may have trial info. We should search for patterns like \"trial\", \"court\", \"date\", \"scheduling\" etc. But typical trial info might include \"Trial is scheduled for\", \"Trial date\", \"Trial Court\", \"Trial concluded\", etc.\n\nGiven we have only 5 docs, we can search for \"trial\" across all and get matches. But the previous search only found one match. That suggests maybe no other \"trial\" word. But maybe the trial info is not using the word \"trial\". Could be \"trial court\" or \"court\" etc. But the requirement: \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" So we need to find any mention of a trial. The only mention might be in Order (002) (the snippet). But that snippet is about equitable relief, not a trial. It might be referencing a trial court decision: \"Defendants must establish that 'no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court'.\" That is a reference to a trial court, but not an actual trial event. So maybe not considered a trial. But still maybe they want to capture that trial court decision? It's a trial court ruling. Could be considered a trial.\n\nBut the snippet shows \"defendants ... view adopted by the trial court.\" But not a trial event. But it's a trial court decision. The checklist may want to capture \"trial court decisions\" as part of trial info. The snippet: \"Defendants must establish that 'no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court.'\" That is a reference to a trial court decision. We could extract that \"trial court\" as a trial. But the snippet also references \"Stone v. City & County of San Francisco, 968 F.2d 850, 861 & n.19 (9th Cir. 1992).\" That may be a trial court decision. But this is a case law reference.\n\nHowever, it's likely that the trial info may be in other documents. Let's search for \"court\" or \"trial court\" across all. But the search regex function can search for pattern. Use pattern \"trial court\" or \"Trial Court\". Let's do search_document_regex for pattern \"Trial Court\" across all. But we need to not re-read the same snippet. But we can search again.\n\nGiven we have a partially visited Order (002) with tokens 21393-21593. We might read further down to see more content. Let's read next 2000 tokens? But we need to identify trial info. Maybe the trial info is in the docket. Let's search the docket for \"trial\" or \"Trial\". But the previous search didn't find any. But maybe the docket uses \"Trial\" but not captured because we didn't search? But we did search all and found only 1 match. So likely no \"trial\" word in others.\n\nBut the trial info might be in the title of one of the documents - e.g., \"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications for Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause Regarding Preliminary Injunction\" may mention \"preliminary injunction\" but not trial. The memorandum may mention \"Trial\" but maybe not.\n\nGiven the instructions, we need to extract every distinct value of Trials. If none found, we may need to set Not Applicable. But we must provide evidence that there is no trial info. We need to read enough to confirm no trial info. We can search for \"trial\" again but we already did. But we need to confirm that none of the documents mention a trial. But the snippet we saw is a reference to a trial court but not a trial event. However, the checklist item likely expects trial events. The snippet is not a trial schedule or outcome. So maybe No trials -> Not Applicable.\n\nBut we need evidence that there is no trial info. We could search for \"trial\" across all documents again but we already did and found only one match. That match didn't contain a trial event. But we need to confirm that no other trial info exists. We could read the docket to ensure there is no trial. But let's search again for \"Trial\" pattern across all docs; we did. But maybe we need to search for \"court\" or \"trial\" in other contexts. But the requirement: \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" The snippet only references a \"trial court\" decision. That is not a trial event information. So it's likely Not Applicable. But we need evidence that there is no trial info. The evidence could be that the only mention of \"trial\" is in a reference to a trial court decision and not an actual trial event. But we need to provide an evidence snippet that shows that no trial info is present. We could provide one snippet that covers all doc content? Hard.\n\nWe can search for \"trial\" again maybe with case-insensitive. The search had flags? The previous search was default flags. So we may get same result.\n\nWe could read the docket for a chunk to confirm no trial. But the docket is 33k tokens; reading entire could be heavy. But we can search within docket for \"Trial\" again. But we already searched all docs. That indicates no other matches. That likely means no other references.\n\nThus we can set Trials to Not Applicable.\n\nWe need to update the checklist for Trials with Not Applicable. Provide evidence: the fact that search found no matches except the reference, which is not a trial. But we need to provide evidence snippet.\n\nWe can provide the snippet from the search match that shows \"trial court\" but not a trial event. That is evidence that the only mention is not a trial event. But we still need to support Not Applicable: maybe we include evidence that the search found no relevant trial info. But we need to provide evidence snippet. We'll use the snippet showing the reference to trial court. That indicates no trial event. But that might not be enough. But we can also include evidence that the search returned only 1 match and the match content does not mention a trial schedule, outcome, etc. But we need to provide a snippet. Let's use the snippet from the match.\n\nThus we will update checklist for Trials with a single extracted entry with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence snippet.\n\nLet's do update_checklist with key \"Trials\". Provide extracted array with one entry: value \"Not Applicable\", evidence with text snippet from the match, source_document \"Order (002)\", location \"Page 52 of 61\" or token range 21393-21593.\n\nWe'll confirm that the snippet includes \"trial court\".

The current evidence says: \"Defendants must establish that ‘no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court.’ Id.\" That indicates there was a trial court decision. But the trial itself might not be described. The evidence says \"view adopted by the trial court\" but not the trial. The requirement: \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" The evidence refers to a trial court but not a trial. But maybe the trial court decision is present. But the evidence could be considered as a \"ruling\" from trial court. But the question is whether that qualifies as \"trial information.\" The instruction: \"Trials: Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" So if there is a trial court decision, that might be a \"ruling\" from trial court. But the evidence says \"view adopted by the trial court\" but doesn't mention trial details. However, it might be considered as a trial court ruling. But the evidence is from Order (002). The previous update set it to \"Not Applicable\" with that evidence. That might be considered as not enough to consider trial info. But maybe there are other documents with trial info. Let's search for \"trial court\" or \"trial\" in other documents. We can do a search_document_regex for pattern \"trial court\" or \"trial\". But we should be careful: we already searched for \"Trial\" and got one match. We could search for \"trial court\" to see if there are other matches. Or \"trial\" with lowercase may be found.

Use search_document_regex with doc_name: \"all\", pattern: \"trial court\", flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"]. That will give matches. Then we can read relevant parts. Or we could directly read the other documents fully. But we should be efficient. Let's search all docs for \"trial\" (case-insensitive). That may yield more.

The instruction says Not Applicable only if explicit evidence supports that there is no trial. The text mentions \"trial court\" but doesn't state there was a trial. It's a reference to trial court decisions. So perhaps we need to search other documents for any actual trial info.\n\nWe have 5 documents. We have looked at Order (002) partially. We need to search for any \"trial\" or \"Trial\" mention across all documents. We already performed search for \"trial\" and \"Trial\" but only found the snippet from Order (002). That might be the only mention. But maybe other documents have \"trial\" mention outside the snippet. The search only returned 1 total match across 5 docs. That means indeed only match was in Order (002). But maybe the search didn't capture all contexts? It used regex \"trial\" or \"Trial\". Maybe other docs contain \"trial\" but not captured because pattern may have case sensitivity? We used default flags none, but it will be case-sensitive. We searched for \"trial\" and \"Trial\" separately.

Better search with \"Trial\" and \"trial\" and maybe \"court\" but we'll rely. The search gave only one match.

But likely not.\n\nWe need to confirm that there are no trial proceedings. We should read more of Order (002) to see if maybe a trial was held. But likely not. The content is about equitable relief and abuse of discretion. It may not mention a trial.\n\nBut we should also consider other documents like Docket or other orders that might have trial info.

We should search for \"trial\" terms. Already searched for \"trial\" and \"Trial\" pattern, found only that snippet. But maybe other documents mention trial. Let's search for \"trial\" in all documents again. But we need to search on other documents. We can search for \"trial\" or \"Trial\" with broader pattern. The search already returned only that match. But maybe the token range view was limited; search returned top_k 5 matches. Maybe it didn't capture other matches due to token context? But search_document_regex returns context tokens 200 around each match. But it returned 1 total match across all documents. So likely no other matches.\n\nBut we should confirm entire documents maybe have trial info beyond that snippet. Let's read other documents more. We can read entire documents, but could be large. However the key is to extract all distinct trial info. If none, then Not Applicable is correct. But evidence must support. The evidence we have: \"Defendants must establish that “no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court.”\" That indicates trial court existed but not that a trial occurred. The phrase \"trial court\" refers to the court that heard the case, not necessarily a trial proceeding. So maybe the lawsuit did not have trial. We need to decide if Trials key should be Not Applicable. But we must check if any trial was actually held. Let's search for \"court\" or \"trial\" again but maybe \"trial\" appears as part of \"trial court\", \"trial proceedings\". The snippet includes \"trial court\". But no mention of \"trial date\" or \"trial\" proceedings. So likely no trial.\n\nBut the key is \"Trials: Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" If no trial, then Not Applicable.\n\nHowever we must confirm no trial in other documents. Let's read other documents partially. For each, we might do search for \"trial\" again but we already did search across all documents. But maybe the search didn't capture \"Trial\" with capital T? It did search for \"Trial\" pattern separately and found none. So that's fine.\n\nThus we can mark Not Applicable. But we already did update_checklist earlier to set Not Applicable. But maybe we need to double-check that the evidence is sufficient. The evidence snippet we have is from Order (002) page 52. It says \"Defendants must establish that “no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court.” So that references a trial court. But does that constitute a trial? It may not. The language indicates that the trial court made a decision; the trial court may have been a trial court or may refer to the district court. But it indicates that a \"trial court\" was involved. But the question: Are there any trials? The snippet indicates a trial court made a decision, but that could mean a trial was held. But we need to find trial info: scheduling, proceedings, outcomes. There's no mention. So we might consider that a trial occurred but we lack details. But the snippet indicates the trial court's decision; perhaps the case had a trial. But no details. But the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. If none, Not Applicable.\" So if there's a trial but no details, we might still need to extract the fact that a trial occurred? But the checklist expects scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, rulings. If none, Not Applicable.\n\nThus we should ensure no other trial info. Let's read more of Order (002) maybe earlier or later. But the snippet maybe part of a discussion, but not a trial. Let's search for \"trial\" in all documents again. Perhaps the search missed due to regex pattern. Let's try pattern: \"(?i)trial\" to ignore case. But we can search again.

The doc size is 25,436 tokens. So we need to read more segments. Let's read from 21393 to maybe 40000? Wait doc ends at 25436 tokens. We can read from 21593 to maybe 25500. Let's read 21593-26000 but max 10000 tokens. So 21593-26000 is 441? Wait 25436-21593=3843 tokens. So we can read from 21593-25436. We'll read 21593-25436.\n\nAlso check if other docs have trial info like Order (001) 670 tokens maybe containing trial info? It's short, maybe order about trial? Let's read Order (001). But first read Order (002).<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order (002)\",\"start_token\":21593,\"end_token\":25436}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (002)", "start_token": 21593, "end_token": 25436}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11921, "completion_tokens": 598, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
