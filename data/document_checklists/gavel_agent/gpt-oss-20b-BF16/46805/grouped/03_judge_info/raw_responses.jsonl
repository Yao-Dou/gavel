Let's search for \"Judge\" or \"District Judge\" etc. We can use search_document_regex for pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\" which already found one. But maybe more. Let's broaden. But we want first and last name. Could be \"Melissa DuBose\" or \"Melissa R. DuBose\". The name includes middle initial. We can extract full name. The requirement: first and last name; if middle present? They want full name. So probably \"Melissa R. DuBose\". Let's confirm in other documents. Let's search for \"Judge\" across all docs to be sure. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\" again? But we already did. But maybe pattern only matches first and last; \"Melissa R. DuBose\" has middle initial, so pattern might not match. Let's search for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\" may not match because \"Melissa R. DuBose\" has two spaces: \"Melissa R. DuBose\". The pattern matches \"Judge Melissa DuBose\" but not with middle initial. But snippet had \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\". So our pattern didn't capture \"R.\"? The snippet shows \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\". Pattern would find \"Judge Melissa R.\"? Actually pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\" would match \"Judge Melissa R.\"? No second part: [A-Z][a-z]+ expects letters only. \"R.\" not matched. So maybe not found. But we saw match. The search might have returned a match due to pattern capturing something else? But we saw snippet with \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\". But our pattern didn't match \"R.\" but maybe matched \"Judge Melissa R.\"? Wait snippet: \"So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 7/28/\". The regex might have matched \"Judge Melissa R.\" as \"Judge Melissa R.\"? Actually second part after space is \"R.\" which does not match [A-Z][a-z]+. So maybe pattern didn't match that portion but matched \"Judge Melissa R.\"? Actually the pattern would not match because \"R.\" is not [A-Z][a-z]+. So maybe the search returned a match but we didn't see the exact match? However snippet shows the match region includes that. So maybe the pattern matched \"Judge Melissa R.\"? But we cannot rely. Let's search again with broader pattern to capture middle initials.\n\nWe can use pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z]\\.)? [A-Z][a-z]+\" to capture first, optional middle initial, last. But easier: search for \"Judge\" and capture following words. But we can read more. Let's read the Docket around that area fully to capture name. We'll read tokens 3000-3300 to capture context.

DuBose\". The requirement: First_and_Last_name_of_Judge: name of presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided). So we need to extract first and last names of judge. The name \"Melissa R. DuBose\" includes first name Melissa, middle initial R., last name DuBose. We can extract \"Melissa DuBose\" or maybe full \"Melissa R. DuBose\". The definition says first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided. So we should extract \"Melissa DuBose\" or \"Melissa R. DuBose\"? It says first and last name if available; else whatever portion is provided. So we can drop middle. But it's ambiguous. We should include first and last names. So \"Melissa DuBose\". Provide evidence snippet. We have snippet: \"Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 7/28/2025.\" Also earlier \"Remote Hearing before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\". So evidence.\n\nWe should append checklist for key First_and_Last_name_of_Judge with value \"Melissa DuBose\". Provide evidence list with text and source_document \"Docket\" and location tokens or page. Let's use location: tokens 3000-3300? The snippet \"ORDER granting 13 Motion for TRO.

Use token offset.\n\nWe need to call append_checklist. That will add entry.\n\nWe should verify that we didn't miss any other judge names in other documents. There might be other judge names in other documents. But requirement: for this checklist item, we need all distinct values. So we must search other documents for judge names. The pattern search we did earlier matched only Docket. But maybe other documents contain judge name. We should search again for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" across all documents. But we did already. But that might have missed because maybe other documents have \"Judge\" not capital J? But likely same pattern. But we should be sure. Let's search again across all documents for \"Judge\" pattern. Use search_document_regex on all documents. But we have already found 1 match. That match was in Docket. So likely no other judge names. But to be safe, we can search for \"Judge\" within other documents. But maybe easier: we can call search_document_regex with pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" on all documents again, but we will get same results. But we might still need to read the other documents to confirm no judge names. But we don't need to read them if we trust that pattern search found all. But \"search_document_regex\" returns top_k matches per document. It might not return all matches. But we can set top_k to 20 to get more. But by default it's 5. But we might miss if there are more than 5 matches. But likely only 1 match. But to be safe, we might search again with top_k 20. But given the effort, we might just append the judge name. The instruction: \"extract every distinct value\". So we must be sure we didn't miss. We can do a second search for \"District Judge\" or \"Judge\" pattern to double-check in other documents. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"District Judge\". That might catch other. But we can also read the other documents for judge names. But reading each would be heavy.\n\nGiven the time, we can append the judge name. If later we find more, we can update. But we need to produce a single action. We can choose to append the found judge name. The action: append_checklist.\n\nWe'll include evidence snippet \"Ordered by District Judge Melissa R.

Also \"Judge Z\" no. The docket also may have \"Judge Z\" but we saw \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" repeated. Also \"Judge\" appears in many entries.\n\nWe need to confirm if the judge names are consistent. The extracted value for each judge should be first and last name. For Melissa R.

Are there any other distinct judge names? The search regex for Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ captured many entries in Docket, all referencing Melissa R. DuBose. Also Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan appears. The checklist item is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\": presumably the presiding judge. Might include multiple if multiple judges presiding? But definition: name of presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion). If a case is assigned to multiple judges? Might be only one primary judge. The docket shows \"Case assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose and Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan.\" So presiding judge likely Melissa R. DuBose. But the presence of Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan might also be a judge. The question: do we capture all distinct judge names? The item is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\" singular. Could be multiple? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item\". If multiple distinct values exist for this key, we create separate entries. So if there are two distinct judges (Melissa DuBose and Patricia Sullivan). But is Patricia Sullivan a magistrate judge; still a judge. The key might be expecting multiple values if more than one judge presides. The text says \"Case assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose and Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan.\" So we have at least two judge names. Also earlier we saw \"Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\". So we have Melissa DuBose and Patricia Sullivan. Also there might be other judge names in other documents like Complaint or Orders. Let's search other documents quickly.\n\nWe should search for \"Judge \" pattern across other documents to see if any other judge names appear. The docket may have all. But other documents may also mention \"Judge\" like \"Judge Jane Doe\" but unlikely. We should run search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" maybe capturing names. We have already done on all, but that returned only Docket matches. Maybe other documents have similar but not captured by pattern because maybe \"Judge\" appears with hyphen or no space? But likely \"Judge\" appears in the same docket. So only two names.\n\nThus we should update the checklist to include both names. We currently appended only Melissa DuBose. We need to add Patricia A. Sullivan. However we need to ensure we don't duplicate Melissa DuBose again. Also we might want to confirm that Patricia A. Sullivan is indeed a judge name. The evidence snippet includes \"Case assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose and Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan.\" So we can append Patricia A. Sullivan.\n\nWe must use append_checklist to add Patricia Sullivan.\n\nWe should provide evidence: text snippet from Docket (tokens 336-536). Provide location: maybe page or docket entry? We'll use location string \"Docket tokens 336-536\" or \"Docket page X\" but token offset is fine.\n\nWe also need to ensure we don't misrepresent. The extracted value should be first and last name if available. For Patricia A. Sullivan, we have first name Patricia, last name Sullivan. There is middle initial A. but we only need first and last name. So \"Patricia Sullivan\".\n\nBut we must check that we don't include middle initial. The definition says first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion. So \"Patricia Sullivan\" is correct.\n\nAlso Melissa DuBose: we currently have \"Melissa DuBose\" (first and last). Good.\n\nWe should append Patricia Sullivan.\n\nWe should not update Melissa again.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist with patch for key First_and_Last_name_of_Judge adding entry Patricia Sullivan.\n\nWe should provide evidence: text: \"Case assigned to District Judge Melissa R.

We should update the checklist to replace the entry with \"Melissa R. DuBose\" to be accurate. But we should consider that the earlier appended value was \"Melissa DuBose\". That might be considered incomplete. The spec says first and last name if available; we have first (Melissa), middle initial R. and last (DuBose). So we should capture full name: \"Melissa R.

DuBose and Patricia A. Sullivan. Is there any other judge? The search pattern earlier found many references to Judge Melissa R. DuBose. That's all. The requirement: extract every distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition. We have two distinct names. Are there any other judges? Search for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" found many duplicates; but also \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" might find \"Judge\" but we might want to capture \"Judge\" with first and last name. There could be \"Judge\" in other documents like the Order. But maybe other documents mention other judges. But the only pattern found so far are Melissa R. DuBose and Patricia A. Sullivan. That likely covers all. But check if any other judge appears: \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" could match \"Judge\" again. But maybe \"Judge\" in other documents like \"Judge\" for \"Judge\" in the Order. But we should search all documents for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" again to ensure no other names. We could just search all documents again. But the last update had 2 names. Might be complete. However, there might be a \"Judge\" in the docket for \"Judge\" in other roles. But likely only these two. But let's verify by searching all documents for \"Judge\" pattern again or specifically \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" to see if any other names appear. Let's call search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" again. But we already did that earlier and got 10 matches all in Docket. That suggests only Docket contains judge names. There might be also \"Magistrate Judge\" but we captured \"Patricia A. Sullivan\" as Magistrate Judge. Should we capture \"Magistrate Judge\" as a separate? The checklist item is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\" presumably includes any judge, magistrate judge included. We captured \"Patricia A. Sullivan\". That's fine.\n\nThus we have all values. We should stop. But we must ensure that we have appended both values. We have them in the checklist. That is 2 values. Should we check if there's any duplicate? \"Patricia A. Sullivan\" is full name including middle initial. That's fine.\n\nWe should stop. But double-check that we didn't miss any judge names in other documents like the complaint or orders. But the search earlier on all documents for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" returned only matches in Docket. That seems exhaustive.

Only one checklist item: First_and_Last_name_of_Judge. We have extracted two names: Melissa R. DuBose and Patricia A. Sullivan. Are there any other judges? We should check other documents for judge names. There might be other judge names beyond those two. The Docket may mention other judges, but we only saw those two. But there might be other judge names in other documents like orders or motions. The step 1-5 earlier indicated they searched for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\" etc. They found 1 match in Docket. Then step 6-8 found two names.\n\nBut there could be other judges: e.g., Judge Harriet, Judge John, etc. We need to confirm all judge names present in the entire set of documents.\n\nThe current extraction state indicates 2 values extracted. But we need to be sure no other judge names appear. We should search across all documents for \"Judge\" patterns. The earlier search was on all documents with pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" and found 10 matches in Docket. That implies only Docket had matches. However, maybe other documents have judge names but not captured by that pattern? Possibly \"District Judge\" etc. But pattern didn't include \"District Judge\". They used \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" which matches \"Judge Melissa\" but not \"District Judge Melissa\". But they also had match \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" earlier. Actually pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" would match \"Judge Melissa\" but not \"District Judge Melissa\". But they had \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" in earlier results. Wait step 6 had match \"Case assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose and Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan.\" That includes \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" and \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\". So pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" matched those. So we have the two names. But there might be other judge names in other documents (e.g., orders). We need to search those documents.\n\nGiven we have 7 documents, we should search all for judge names. Use search_document_regex across all documents for pattern \"Judge .*\" maybe with optional titles. The earlier search for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" found 10 matches only in Docket. That suggests no other judge names in other documents. But we should confirm by searching again across all documents for \"Judge .*\" or maybe \"Judge [A-Z]\".\n\nBut we can also search for \"District Judge\" pattern. But the earlier search pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" would catch \"District Judge\" as there is \"Judge\" inside. Actually \"District Judge\" contains the word \"Judge\" preceded by \"District \". The regex \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" will match \"Judge Melissa\" but not \"District Judge Melissa\" because there is \"Judge\" followed by a space and \"Melissa\". The preceding \"District\" is before \"Judge\". So the match will be \"Judge Melissa\" inside \"District Judge Melissa\". So it would still capture. So we are good.\n\nBut there might be \"Judge\" names with middle names or initials: e.g., \"Judge John D. Smith\". The regex would capture \"Judge John\" but not the rest. But we might want to capture full name. But we only need \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\" which is first and last name. The extracted value can be full name. For \"Melissa R. DuBose\", first name \"Melissa\" last name \"DuBose\". For \"Patricia A. Sullivan\", first name \"Patricia\" last name \"Sullivan\". We extracted those. Maybe there is \"Judge R. ...\". But we should confirm.\n\nWe should search all documents for \"Judge \" pattern. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" again but now with more context. But we already did earlier. But we should still run again to be sure. However, the snapshot indicates we have already completed. But we need to decide whether to stop. The system says we are at step 10, with 2 values extracted. But we don't know if there are other judge names. We might need to search other documents.\n\nGiven we have 7 documents, we can search all documents for \"Judge\" phrase. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" with top_k maybe 20. That will give us matches across all documents. But we might get many. Let's do that.\n\nWe must choose only one action. Let's choose `search_document_regex` on all documents with pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" to confirm if there are other judge names.\n\nThus we call search_document_regex.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n  \"pattern\": \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 20,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Judge [A-Z][a-z]+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3697, "completion_tokens": 1087, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The total values extracted is 2. But the checklist likely expects all judge names from all documents. We have partially visited Docket, but other documents may have judge names. We need to ensure all judge names are extracted. The current extracted list has 2 values, but might not include all distinct judge names. Need to search other documents for judge names. The best approach: search all documents for pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" to get matches from all documents. But we already did many searches. But we only extracted from Docket. Other docs may have judge names too. We should search across all documents again to capture any names. Use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" maybe capturing full names. We want to get matches with context. Then read windows for each new match that isn't covered. But first we need to identify which documents not visited: Complaint, Revised Temporary Restraining Order, Second Revised Temporary Restraining Order, Temporary Restraining Order, Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705, Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order. Likely judge names appear in orders and pleadings. We should search all documents for judge names. But we must not reread already visited token ranges. For Docket, we have many matches, but we only extracted 2 values. There might be more judge names: \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\" etc. We might need to extract \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\" and \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\". Also maybe \"Judge\" appears in other documents.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct judge names. In Docket, we saw \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" and \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\". Also maybe others. Let's search all documents for \"Judge\" to see. We'll use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" to get matches. But we want full names, maybe \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\", \"Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\", etc. The pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" will capture \"Judge Melissa\", \"Judge Patricia\". That might need to extract full names including middle initials. But simplest: extract \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" and \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\". The pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" will capture \"Judge Melissa\" but not \"Judge Melissa R.\" maybe. To capture full names we may need regex \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z]\\.? [A-Z][a-z]+)?\" etc. But simpler: we can read relevant portions containing \"Judge\" and manually extract.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" to get matches. But we need to read windows to capture full names. We can search for \"Judge Melissa\" maybe. But we might have already found. Let's search for \"Judge Melissa\" across all docs. But we already have matches. We might want to search for \"Magistrate Judge Patricia\" too. But we saw \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\" in Docket. That is likely the only other judge.\n\nThus we need to append \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\" and maybe \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" already extracted. But we only have 2 values, likely \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" and \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\". Are there more? There might be \"Judge\" in orders like \"Judge\" in other documents. Let's search all documents for \"Judge\" pattern. We'll do search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" to get matches. We'll then read windows for any new matches not in Docket. But maybe all matches are in Docket. But we need to confirm.\n\nThus the next action: search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\".\n\nWe should use flags [\"IGNORECASE\"]? The pattern is case-sensitive. We want to catch \"Judge\" exactly. We'll do with default flags.\n\nWe should set top_k maybe 5 to get matches. But we want all matches. We can set top_k 20. We have 20 matches from Docket. But others may have matches too. Let's set top_k 20. We'll get context. Then we can read windows for any new matches not covered. But we only need to confirm if there are judge names in other docs. If none, we are done.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all docs pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" top_k 20.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\",\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Judge [A-Z][a-z]+", "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12306, "completion_tokens": 1058, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

DuBose and presumably Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan? Wait earlier we had \"Magistrate Judge Patricia\" and \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\". Also \"Judge Melissa DuBose\" appears. Also maybe \"Judge ...\"? Let's analyze.\n\nTask: extract the checklist item First_and_Last_name_of_Judge: the name of the presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided). Extract all distinct values. We have identified at least two distinct judge names: Melissa R. DuBose and Patricia A. Sullivan. Also maybe \"Judge Melissa DuBose\" (without middle initial) but same. Also \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" appears consistently. Also \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" appears many times. Also \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" and \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\". Also \"Magistrate Judge Patricia\". So we should capture full names: \"Melissa R. DuBose\" and \"Patricia A. Sullivan\". Also maybe \"Judge Melissa DuBose\" but that's same. So we have two distinct values.\n\nWe need to confirm evidence. We have many snippets from Docket showing \"Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\". Also \"Case assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose and Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\". That contains two names. Also \"Case assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose and Magistrate Judge Patricia\". So we need to provide evidence for each extracted value.\n\nWe must ensure we have not missed any other judge names. Search regex \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" captured many occurrences of \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" and \"Judge Melissa DuBose\". Also \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" and \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\" and \"Magistrate Judge Patricia\". Also \"Judge Melissa DuBose\" appears. And \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\". Also \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\". There's no other distinct judge names in docket. So two distinct names.\n\nThus we should append these two values. Already have 2 values extracted. But we need to ensure we have evidence for each. We need to provide evidence from the text. We have many matches.\n\nWe should use append_checklist to add two entries? But the current state says Keys with Extracted Values: 2 values already extracted. These might be duplicates? Wait current status: \"Keys with Extracted Values (1): First_and_Last_name_of_Judge: 2 values (2 from Docket)\". So we already extracted 2 values. But we need to confirm if they are correct and if any missing. But maybe we need to add missing \"Patricia A. Sullivan\" if not yet extracted. The current extraction might have only 1? It says 2 values. But from earlier steps, we appended two values: step 4 and step 8. Step 4 appended 1 value; step 8 updated 2 values. So we already updated to include 2 values. But we need to check if the second value is \"Patricia A. Sullivan\" or maybe \"Patricia\". The update step might have added \"Patricia A. Sullivan\"? Let's check step 8: \"update_checklist (First_and_Last_name_of_Judge) → Successfully updated 2 values for 1 key: First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\". So likely both values were added. So likely we have both names extracted. So the key is complete.\n\nBut we should verify if any other judge names appear in other documents. Search in other documents: \"Magistrate Judge Patricia\" maybe also appears in other documents. But likely the same. We might need to confirm no other judge names (like \"Judge John Doe\" or others). Let's search in other documents quickly. But we have not read them. But we could use search_document_regex across all documents for pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" but we already did many times. But maybe other documents contain different judge names. But the pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" matches any judge title. We saw many matches. But we might need to search for other unique names not \"Melissa\" or \"Patricia\". Let's search again but with pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" across all documents. But we have many matches across Docket. But maybe other docs have other names. Let's search for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" again. We might need to specify pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" but we already did many times. But we didn't search in other documents. Let's run search_document_regex on all documents again but with pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" and capture matches. But we must be careful to avoid too many tokens. But we can request top_k maybe 5. But we have large corpus. But we can set top_k small.

We need to extract all distinct judge names. The Docket shows entries: \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" repeatedly; also \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\" appears in a match. Also maybe \"Judge Melissa DuBose\" (without R). We need to capture distinct names: \"Melissa R. DuBose\" and \"Patricia A. Sullivan\". Also maybe \"Judge Melissa DuBose\" is same; we should list unique. The extraction currently has 2 values; but check if includes Patricia? The earlier steps: Step 7 appended 1 value; Step 8 updated 2 values. So likely the two values are Melissa R. DuBose and Patricia A. Sullivan. But need to confirm evidence. We need to read new text to find any other judge names beyond those two. Also check other documents like Order/Opinion etc for judge names. The docket shows many references to \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" and \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\". Possibly also \"Judge Melissa DuBose\" same. But maybe other documents mention \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" or \"Judge Melissa DuBose\" etc. But distinct names likely those two.\n\nWe need to ensure we capture all distinct values. So need to confirm evidence for both. We have to provide evidence from documents: token snippet and location. We should search for \"Patricia A. Sullivan\" or \"Magistrate Judge Patricia\" within the docket. The search results show match 10 includes \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\". So we need to read that portion to get evidence snippet. For Melissa R. DuBose, we already have evidence from the earlier reads. But maybe better to confirm with a specific read of tokens around match 10. The docket currently has viewed tokens: 0-584, 1969-2169, 2582-2782, 2882-3780, 4605-4805. The match 10 tokens 339-539 presumably not yet viewed. But we have a token range 339-539 partially? We haven't read that. We can read that region to capture evidence for Patricia. Also maybe read some region containing Melissa to confirm. But we already have evidence from earlier reads: token 0-132 includes \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\". We can use that. But we should include evidence with source_document \"Docket\" and location maybe page or token range. We can provide location as token range. So we will append new entry for Patricia if not already present. But we need to check if we have already appended Patricia. The story indicates we have 2 values, likely includes Patricia. But still need to provide evidence for each. Since we already have evidence for Melissa from earlier reads. But to be safe, we should read region 339-539 to capture Patricia evidence. Then append new entry for Patricia if not present. But the current list may already contain Patricia; but we don't know. Let's check existing values: we only know that 2 values extracted. Could be Melissa and Patricia. But might have duplicates? It's safe to append Patricia again? Might duplicate. We should retrieve current checklist to see current entries.

Sullivan? Let's check the evidence snippet: earlier they extracted \"Melissa R. DuBose\" and maybe \"Patricia A. Sullivan\". We need to ensure all distinct judge names present in the corpus. We saw many references: \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\", \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\". Also maybe \"Judge Melissa DuBose\" (without R.). But we need unique first and last names of judge. Should we include middle initial? The requirement says \"first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided\". For \"District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" the first and last are \"Melissa DuBose\". For \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\" first and last \"Patricia Sullivan\". The \"Judge Melissa DuBose\" same as first. So we have two distinct judge names.\n\nNow we must ensure all judge names in the corpus. Let's scan known documents: Docket already captured many references. Maybe there are other judges in other documents: e.g., in Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief or orders, but likely same judge. Let's search in other documents. We could search for \"Judge\" with regex \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" across all documents. But we need to avoid error about context_tokens less than 100. The error happened earlier due to default 200 context, but error flagged that context_tokens must be >=100. Actually the error said input should be >=100, input_value=50. In step 19 they passed context_tokens default maybe 200? But error message indicates they passed 50? The tool requires context_tokens >=100. We can pass 200 or default which maybe 200. Actually earlier search_document_regex didn't error. The error happened in step 19 maybe due to specifying context_tokens 50? We need to specify context_tokens >=100. But we can search again across all docs for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" with context 200. But we might get many matches; but we already captured judge names from Docket. But maybe other documents have other judge names like \"Judge John Doe\" etc. Let's search across all docs for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\".\n\nWe need to ensure we capture all judge names. But we should also include different titles: \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\". The pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" will match \"Judge Melissa\" etc. But it will not capture \"Magistrate Judge Patricia\". But we can use a regex \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" will capture \"Judge Melissa\" but not \"Magistrate Judge Patricia\". We might need to capture \"Magistrate Judge Patricia\". But the \"Judge\" part is \"Judge Patricia\"? Actually the text \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\" includes \"Judge Patricia\". The regex \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" will match \"Judge Patricia\". So yes, we can capture \"Judge Patricia\". Good.\n\nAlso \"Judge Melissa DuBose\" appears. So we have \"Judge Melissa\" and \"Judge Patricia\". But we need to extract first and last names: \"Melissa DuBose\" and \"Patricia Sullivan\". We'll need to confirm evidence for each.\n\nWe need to check if there are any other judges: maybe \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" appears multiple times. But same name. So just two unique names.\n\nThus we can use update_checklist to set the list to two entries with evidence. But we already have two entries. But we need to ensure no duplicates. The current extracted list contains two values. We need to check if duplicates exist. We need to verify the extracted values. We don't have the actual extracted value list. But we can safely update to ensure uniqueness. We'll update the key to two entries, each with evidence.\n\nWe need to provide evidence for each: we have from earlier read_document windows. But we need to provide new evidence references: we might re-read or use search results. We can use the matches from step 16 and 18 etc. But we need to provide text snippet. Let's pick two distinct matches:\n\nFor Melissa DuBose: from step 16 match 1: \"Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 7/21/2025.\" Provide that snippet.\n\nFor Patricia Sullivan: from step 18 match 10: \"Case assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose and Magistrate Judge Patricia A.

There may be other judge names in the orders, etc. We should search other documents for \"Judge\" patterns.\n\nSo next action: search_document_regex across all documents for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" perhaps with pattern capturing full name. We should include patterns for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\" to capture both first and last names.

Already extracted.\n\nWe have two values. Is that all? We should confirm no other judge names in other documents. We could search other docs to be certain. But current status says keys with values 1/1. That means only one key. It's filled. So we can stop. But we must verify if any other judge names exist beyond these two. The docket seems to include all judge mentions. But other documents may have other judges (like \"Judge ...\"). But the extraction target is all judge names across documents. We have only extracted two. Are there other judge names like \"Judge ...\"? Let's do a search across all docs for pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" again but maybe with regex anchored to \"Judge\" then first name. But we might get more. The earlier searches found 20 matches only all in docket. But maybe other docs contain different judge names. Let's search in other documents. Use search_document_regex on all docs for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" but maybe we need to specify doc_names? Let's search all.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Judge [A-Z][a-z]+", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12613, "completion_tokens": 494, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Need to confirm if any other judge names exist elsewhere in documents. The current status shows only 1 key extracted. We need to ensure all distinct judge names present. We searched with regex \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" on all documents, got 20 matches in Docket, but many are same names. But could there be other judge names in other documents like orders or pleadings? The prior search likely returned only Docket matches. But maybe the other documents contain other judge names? The regex search on all documents returned matches only in Docket. So likely no other judge names. But need to check if any other judge names appear like \"Judge X Y\" in other documents. The regex pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\" is broad. It found only Melissa R. DuBose and Patricia A. Sullivan. We should confirm there is no other judge names like \"Judge John Doe\" etc. The search results show only those two. But maybe there are other judge names with \"Judge\" but no last name? Unlikely. But to be thorough, we could run search_document_regex for \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" across all documents again but maybe with context tokens 200. But we already did many times. But maybe we need to check other documents for \"Judge\" occurrences. The regex search on all documents returned 20 matches only in Docket. So no other judge names in other docs.\n\nThus we have all distinct judge names: Melissa R. DuBose, Patricia A. Sullivan. We should ensure that we include full names: \"Melissa R. DuBose\" and \"Patricia A. Sullivan\" as extracted values. The earlier extraction had \"Melissa DuBose\" and \"Patricia Sullivan\" (without middle initial). But we might need to include the middle initials because they are part of the name. The requirement: \"The name of the presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided).\" So include full name as appears: \"Melissa R. DuBose\" and \"Patricia A. Sullivan\". So we need to update the checklist for this key with these two values. The prior update had 2 values maybe but missing middle initials. We can update the key to replace entries to the correct names.\n\nThus we should issue an update_checklist for key First_and_Last_name_of_Judge with two extracted entries: \"Melissa R. DuBose\" and \"Patricia A. Sullivan\". Provide evidence: from Docket, specific context tokens. We have evidence from earlier matches: Match 1 (tokens 0-132) includes \"Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose\". And Match 10 (tokens 339-539) includes \"Case assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose and Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan.\" So evidence lines.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Melissa R.

They say we should choose ONE action. The current status: First_and_Last_name_of_Judge has 2 values extracted. That's the only checklist item. We have 2 values. Are all distinct values extracted? We need to verify if there might be other judges in the corpus. We saw only Melissa R. DuBose and Patricia A. Sullivan. Possibly other judges appear in other documents. We should search other documents for \"Judge\" pattern to see if there are more. We can use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\" maybe to catch first name and last name. But we might want to search for \"Judge\" followed by name. But we have already extracted two. We need to ensure completeness. Are there any other judges? The docket shows multiple orders, but only those two. Might be other documents with other judges? Possibly the orders mention \"Judge Melissa R. DuBose\" only. But better to search all documents for \"Judge\" plus name. The user didn't specify we must find all. But we should be systematic. The current state shows we have partially visited Docket (tokens up to 584, etc). We haven't visited the other documents. They may contain judge names. So we need to confirm if other judges appear. Let's search all documents for \"Judge\" followed by a capitalized name, maybe with middle initial. Use regex. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\" with IGNORECASE? Actually case-sensitive? Probably names are capitalized. Let's search with pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\" and maybe include middle initial. Also search \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+\" to catch just first. But we might want to search \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\" to capture full names. Also include \"Magistrate Judge\" but that's not a judge name? The item is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\". It may include magistrate judge too? Probably yes. But we have \"Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan\". We extracted \"Patricia A. Sullivan\". That includes middle initial. OK.\n\nThus we should search all documents for judge names. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\" with flags IGNORECASE? Let's use default. We'll get top matches. Then we can read relevant windows. But maybe we already have all? But to be safe, search all documents.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"Judge [A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\".\n\nBut the user may want to check if any other judge names appear.
