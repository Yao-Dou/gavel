We have seen the docket; many entries mention \"NOTICE of Hearing: Zoom Chambers Conference set for 8/8/2025 at 03:00 PM before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose.\" That is a hearing. Also \"Notice of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction and Relief under 5 USC 705: Hearing set for 9/4/2025 at 11:00 AM in Courtroom 4 before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose.\" These are hearings. There's also \"TRANSCRIPT of TRO held on 07/24/2025 before Judge DuBose.\" That is a TRO hearing. But Trials: maybe actual trial scheduled? There is no trial date found so far. We need to extract all trial info: scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, rulings. We saw hearing schedules but maybe a trial is scheduled further. We haven't read the other documents like Revised TROs, etc. But likely the docket and the order documents contain trial info. We could search for \"trial\" again; earlier attempts found none. But maybe \"trial\" appears in other documents not yet read. We should search again across all documents for \"trial\" pattern but earlier search 10-14 found 0. But maybe the earlier search missed due to context? We used pattern \"\\btrial\\b\". That should catch \"trial\". But we saw \"trial\" in docket? The docket entries had \"NOTICE of Hearing\" not \"trial\". So maybe no trial scheduled. But maybe the orders mention \"trial\" in the context of \"trial date\" etc. We haven't read the orders fully. Let's search \"trial\" again in all documents with broader pattern: include \"trial date\", \"trial scheduled\". Already did search pattern \"trial date|trial scheduled|trial set|no trial date\" but found 0. So maybe no trial. But the requirement: \"Trials: Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" So if no trial scheduled, maybe Not Applicable. But we need evidence that no trial scheduled. We have evidence that there is no trial date mentioned. However \"Notice of Hearing\" is not a trial. So we can set Not Applicable with evidence that no trial date found. But we must be careful: we must provide evidence that it is not applicable. The evidence should include explicit text or dispositive posture. We have to find text that says \"no trial\" or \"no trial date\". We didn't find any \"No trial\" in searches. But we can use the docket entries to show no trial scheduled; but that's not explicit. We may need to search again for \"trial\" maybe case-insensitive. But earlier search might have missed due to token limits? We used search_document_regex on all documents, pattern \"\\btrial\\b\". That should catch all. But maybe the pattern didn't catch because \"trial\" is part of \"trial\" but we looked for word boundaries. It should catch it. So if we didn't find any matches, maybe indeed no \"trial\" word appears. Then we can set Not Applicable. But we need evidence: we can provide evidence that the docket lists no trial scheduled and only hearings. But that might not be dispositive. But we can also search for \"trial\" in all docs again but maybe we need to confirm. But we have evidence that the docket had no trial. The docket entries show many hearing entries but no trial. That might be sufficient to say no trial scheduled. But the requirement says \"If later evidence shows the item does have real values, use update_checklist to replace the Not Applicable entry.\" So we can set Not Applicable now.\n\nThus we need to update the checklist for key \"Trials\" with one extracted entry: value \"Not Applicable\", evidence text: maybe \"No trial scheduled; docket entries show only hearings and orders, no trial date.\" Provide evidence snippet from docket. We can use a snippet like \"None | 2025-08-08 | NOTICE of Hearing: Zoom Chambers Conference set for 8/8/2025 at 03:00 PM before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose.\" But that is a hearing, not trial. We can also use \"None | 2025-08-27 | NOTICE of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction and Relief under 5 USC 705: Hearing set for 9/4/2025 at 11:00 AM in Courtroom 4 before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose.\" Provide evidence that no trial is mentioned. But maybe we need to search for \"trial\" again to capture any hidden mention; but we already did search and found none. So we can set Not Applicable.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist for key Trials with \"Not Applicable\". Provide evidence: maybe from docket. Use location: Docket tokens 4800-6492 (the portion we read). We'll include snippet: \"None | 2025-08-08 | NOTICE of Hearing: Zoom Chambers Conference set for 8/8/2025 at 03:00 PM before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose.\" Also maybe \"None | 2025-08-27 | NOTICE of Hearing re 30 MOTION for Preliminary Injunction and Relief under 5 USC 705: Hearing set for 9/4/2025 at 11:00 AM in Courtroom 4 before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose.\" That shows hearing but no trial. Or we can use \"search_document_regex\" to find \"No trial\" but we didn't find. Use the snippet as evidence. Provide evidence with source_document Docket, location: page? We can use \"line 35\" or token range. Provide location string \"Docket tokens 4800-6492\".

But the instruction says: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. ... Each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context.\" So we need to extract all trial information. The earlier update set Not Applicable, but that may be premature if there are trials. The current status shows that Trials set to Not Applicable with evidence from Docket: hearing notices but no trial. But maybe there are trial info in other documents (maybe the complaint, orders). We need to search for trial, hearing, etc. There was earlier search for \"trial\" etc, but maybe not exhaustive. We should search again for \"trial\" or \"hearing\" or \"trial date\" in the remaining documents that haven't been fully visited: Revised TRO, Second Revised TRO, Temporary TRO, Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO, Complaint, Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\n\nWe need to find any trial info. The docket shows hearing notices but not trial. But maybe the orders mention trial date? Also the complaint might have trial info. Let's search for \"trial\" pattern in the unvisited documents: \"Complaint\" big one, \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705\" etc. We could use search_document_regex for pattern \"trial\" or \"hearing\" or \"trial date\" but we need to find trial or hearing that might be scheduled. The earlier search in all documents for \"trial\" returned 7 matches in docket; but perhaps there are other matches that were not captured because we didn't search all documents? Step 2 did search all documents pattern \"\\btrial\\b|\\bhearing\\b\" and found 11 matches: 5 in Docket, 1 in Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, 2 in Revised Temporary Restraining Order (+2 more docs). That suggests there were matches in other documents. But we didn't read beyond those. We need to extract trial info.\n\nLet's search again for \"trial\" pattern in all documents to get top matches.\n\nBut we need to ensure we don't re-read visited ranges. The docket is mostly visited. But we might need to read the parts of the other documents that contain matches. So we can search all documents for \"trial\" pattern, and then read those specific ranges.\n\nThus we should call search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"\\btrial\\b|\\bhearing\\b\" maybe with flags, top_k maybe 10. That will give us matches context. Then we can inspect and read the relevant windows.\n\nHowever earlier search had no matches after step 10. But step 2 earlier had matches. Maybe earlier search didn't find them because we limited? But earlier search had pattern \"\\btrial\\b|\\bhearing\\b\" and it found 7 matches? The summary says step 2 found 11 matches: 5 in Docket, 1 in Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO, 2 in Revised TRO (+2 more docs). So there were matches. It might not have captured them fully? But we didn't read them.\n\nThus we should search again but now to get matches. Then read.\n\nOk decide to call search_document_regex on all documents (doc_name=\"all\") pattern \"\\btrial\\b|\\bhearing\\b\" flags maybe IGNORECASE. Top_k maybe 5? But we want all matches. We can set top_k=10 per doc. That will give us matches across all documents. Then we can read relevant windows.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"\\\\btrial\\\\b|\\\\bhearing\\\\b\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "\\btrial\\b|\\bhearing\\b", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5261, "completion_tokens": 782, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The docket shows hearings, not trial. But maybe there are trial scheduled? The docket shows hearing set for 8/8/2025 etc. No trial entries. So maybe Not Applicable is correct.\n\nBut the step 15 they did update with Not Applicable. The current status says keys with values: 1/1, Not Applicable set. So we may be done.

They already searched. Step 16 search all docs for trial/hearing patterns found many matches. Those are hearing entries. No trial.\n\nThus we can stop.

The current status: Trials marked Not Applicable with evidence from Docket. But we have evidence of trials from docket entries: hearing dates etc. The Not Applicable was set earlier. But the evidence suggests there were trials or hearings? Let's check: Docket entries show \"NOTICE of Hearing re 13 MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order: Hearing set for 7/24/2025\". That is a hearing, not a trial. But later there is mention of \"Minute Entry for proceedings held before District Judge ... proceedings held on 7/24/2025\" and \"Court grants motion\". That is a hearing, not a trial. There is also \"Zoom Chamber Conference set for 8/8/2025\". That's a hearing.\n\nTrials would be actual trial dates? The docket shows no trial dates. The \"Not Applicable\" likely because no trial. But the step 15 updated Trials to Not Applicable with evidence: Docket tokens 4800-4810: \"None | 2025-08-08 | NOTICE of Hearing: Zoom Chambers Conference set for 8/8/2025 at 03:00 PM before District Judge Melissa R. DuBose.\" So they considered that not a trial. But we need to extract all distinct trial info. If no trials, then Not Applicable is correct. But we must ensure no trial info exists. The docket does not show trial. The orders mention hearing. The orders mention \"hearing held on July 24, 2025\" etc. So no trial.\n\nThus Trials key should be Not Applicable. The earlier update did that, but we must confirm no trial info elsewhere. The complaint, motions, etc. Might mention trial? Usually not. The docket likely covers all hearings. So we can keep Not Applicable. But we need to verify that \"Trials\" is indeed the only key. There is one key. All extracted? The status shows Trials filled with 1 value (Not Applicable). So we might stop. But we should double-check if any other trial info exists. The docket entries include \"Notice of Hearing\", \"Minute Entry\", \"Transcripts of TRO held\", \"Video Status Conference\". None are trials. The orders talk about hearings, not trials. So likely correct.\n\nThus we can stop. But we must ensure that the evidence for Not Applicable is adequate. The evidence from Docket tokens 4800-4810 and 4930-4945 are given. Those show none.
