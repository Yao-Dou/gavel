Some have cooperating counsel, e.g., ACLU Foundation of RI, Lawyers' Committee for RI, National Women’s Law Center. So there are private counsel and public interest nonprofits. We should categorize each as \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC)\" etc. But we need distinct values, maybe aggregated? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Create separate entries for each unique value... including specific organizations in parentheses when available. If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\" So we need separate entries per side with counsel type. For plaintiffs, we have multiple counsel. That is multiple entries? \"Extract EVERY distinct value.\" So each counsel is a distinct value. But do we combine them into one entry like 'Plaintiff: Private counsel (Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC)'? Actually each counsel is distinct. So we should create separate entries per counsel.\n\nBut need to be cautious: The key probably expects entries like \"Plaintiff: Private counsel (Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC)\", \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (ACLU Foundation of RI)\", etc. And for defendants maybe none found.\n\nWe must provide evidence for each entry.\n\nWe haven't yet read all documents.

Also likely Defendant counsel not found yet. We need to extract all distinct values for Type_of_Counsel. We have evidence that Plaintiffs are represented by: Robin F. Thurston (private counsel?), Skye L. Perryman (private counsel?), Democracy Forward Foundation (public interest nonprofit), etc. Also National Women’s Law Center (public interest nonprofit). Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC (private). ACLU Foundation of RI (public interest nonprofit). Lawyers’ Committee for RI (public interest nonprofit). So we need to produce entries: \"Plaintiff: Private counsel\", \"Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\", etc. But we need to avoid duplicates: each distinct value. We need to extract type(s) of counsel representing each side. We have evidence that Plaintiffs represented by multiple counsel. We need to produce separate entries for each unique type with organization in parentheses when available. Format: 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …' but only if clear.\n\nWe need to read more to get Defendant counsel. We haven't seen any counsel for defendants in the provided snippet. We need to search for \"Counsel for Defendants\" maybe later. No matches earlier. Maybe in other documents. Let's search for \"Counsel for\" in all docs again but maybe we need to find defendant counsel. The earlier search had 3 matches for \"Counsel for\" all docs, all were plaintiffs. So likely no defendant counsel listed. So we may set Defendant as Not Applicable? But requirement: \"Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So we should not add Defendant. So only plaintiff entries.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values. Let's list unique counsel types we saw:\n\nFrom Complaint snippet:\n\n- Robin F. Thurston (D.C. Bar No. 1531399)+\n- Skye L. Perryman (D.C. Bar No. 984573)+\n- Democracy Forward Foundation\n- National Women’s Law Center\n- Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC\n- ACLU Foundation of RI\n- Lawyers’ Committee for RI\n\nWe need to categorize each as Private counsel or Public interest nonprofit or Government counsel or pro se. The names are law firms or nonprofits. Let's interpret:\n\n- Robin F. Thurston: individual attorney; likely private counsel.\n- Skye L. Perryman: individual attorney; private counsel.\n- Democracy Forward Foundation: public interest nonprofit.\n- National Women’s Law Center: public interest nonprofit.\n- Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC: private law firm.\n- ACLU Foundation of RI: public interest nonprofit.\n- Lawyers’ Committee for RI: public interest nonprofit.\n\nWe must create entries for each distinct value. So we might have:\n\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel\n- Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\n- Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (National Women’s Law Center)\n- Plaintiff: Private counsel (Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC)\n- Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (ACLU Foundation of RI)\n- Plaintiff: Public interest nonprofit (Lawyers’ Committee for RI)\n\nBut maybe we should combine same types with organization names? The requirement: \"using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available\". So each distinct value is a combination of category and specific org. For private counsel, if we have multiple private law firms, we should include each: \"private counsel (Robin F. Thurston)\", etc. But that would be too many; but requirement says \"specific organizations in parentheses when available\". For individuals, maybe include name? But the example: \"Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)\". For private counsel we could use \"private counsel (Robin F. Thurston)\" or \"private counsel (Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC)\". Let's interpret: each distinct value includes category and org. So we should list each counsel individually with category and org. So we need 7 distinct entries:\n\n1. Plaintiff: private counsel (Robin F. Thurston)\n2. Plaintiff: private counsel (Skye L. Perryman)\n3. Plaintiff: public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation)\n4. Plaintiff: public interest nonprofit (National Women’s Law Center)\n5. Plaintiff: private counsel (Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC)\n6. Plaintiff: public interest nonprofit (ACLU Foundation of RI)\n7. Plaintiff: public interest nonprofit (Lawyers’ Committee for RI)\n\nWe need evidence for each. We have snippet with names and organizations. We need to provide evidence for each entry: text snippet. We should include specific lines. For each entry, evidence array with one element containing text, source_document, location. Location can be page numbers or token ranges. We'll use the snippet tokens 39400-39925 in Complaint for Declaratory... We can provide location as \"Page 88\" maybe. But we can also give token range. We have tokens 39400-39925. But each entry may be from that snippet. We'll use location \"Page 88\" or \"Tokens 39400-39925\". Let's use page numbers if available. The snippet shows \"Page 88 of 88\". So location \"Page 88\". For each, we can provide text snippet that includes the name and affiliation. Let's pick relevant lines.\n\nFor Robin Thurston, snippet: \"Robin F. Thurston (D.C. Bar No. 1531399)+\". That indicates private counsel. For Skye Perryman: \"Skye L. Perryman (D.C. Bar No. 984573)+\". For Democracy Forward Foundation: \"Democracy Forward Foundation\". For National Women’s Law Center: \"National Women’s Law Center\". For Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC: \"Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC\". For ACLU Foundation of RI: \"Cooperating counsel, ACLU Foundation of RI\". For Lawyers’ Committee for RI: \"Cooperating counsel, Lawyers’ Committee for RI\". So evidence text lines accordingly.\n\nWe need to call append_checklist with patch entries for each value. But we must ensure not to duplicate. We'll create patch array with one item: key \"Type_of_Counsel\", extracted array of 7 entries each with evidence array of one object. That is allowed.\n\nWe must not set Not Applicable.

Also maybe \"Counsel for the Defendant\" not found. We should confirm no counsel for defendant or government counsel. Probably not present.\n\nBut we might also need to capture \"Plaintiff: ...\". Already extracted 7 values. Are there other counsel entries maybe in other documents? We saw earlier that search found matches in Complaint, Motion for Relief, and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, all for Plaintiffs. Those we captured. But maybe there are other documents like Docket or orders that list counsel for defendants? Let's search Docket for \"Counsel for\" pattern. Step 2 earlier found 23 matches in documents, but step 4 search for \"Counsel for\" found only 3 matches in all docs, all in Complaint and two motions. So no other.\n\nThus we think we have all counsel values. But we need to confirm if any counsel for defendants is present. Search \"Counsel for the Defendant\" or \"Counsel for Defendant\" again maybe miss due to case. But step 4 search for \"Counsel for Defen\" found none. That covers \"Defen\" prefix. So likely none.\n\nThus we should stop, but must ensure we have all values: 7 extracted values. However we might need to distinguish between Plaintiff and Defendant entries; we only have Plaintiff entries. That's fine.\n\nWe must ensure we have evidence for each value. In the current state we have appended 7 values with evidence from Complaint. That was done earlier. But we need to check if any missing values: In the Complaint section we saw the 7 values. Are there also other counsel \"private counsel (Skye L. Perryman)\" etc. Yes captured. Did we include all? The list in step 8 includes 7 values. That seems correct.\n\nBut we didn't extract \"Defendant\" counsel: maybe none. So we don't need to add.\n\nThus we can stop. But we must verify that the `Type_of_Counsel` key is considered complete. It has 7 values. Are there any other documents that might contain counsel for defendants? Let's quickly search \"Counsel for Defendant\" in Docket again. But we might not need to read. But to be safe, we could perform a search again with pattern \"Counsel for Defendant\" or \"Counsel for the Defendant\" but we already saw 0 matches for \"Counsel for Defen\" which includes that phrase. So safe.\n\nThus we should stop. Ensure that the final decision JSON is correct.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All counsel entries for plaintiffs have been captured; no counsel for defendants found in the corpus.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All counsel entries for plaintiffs have been captured; no counsel for defendants found in the corpus.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4357, "completion_tokens": 690, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

All 7 values for plaintiff counsel captured. Need to check if any counsel for defendants. Search shows no matches in prior regex searches. But we might need to confirm if any counsel for defendants exists in documents. We should search for \"Counsel for Defendants\" or similar. Already did step 7, no matches. But maybe there are defendant counsel entries in other documents not searched? We have 7 docs. We searched all for \"Counsel for\". That found only plaintiff entries. So no counsel for defendants. But maybe \"Counsel for the Defendant\" or \"Counsel for Defendant\" synonyms. We could search for \"Counsel for Defendant\" or \"Counsel for the Defendant\" or \"Counsel for Defendants\". We already did \"Counsel for Defen\" and \"Counsel for Def\". Both gave none. So likely none. But we must consider if any defendant counsel is listed in docket or orders? Usually docket will list attorneys. But no \"Counsel for\" pattern. Could still be \"Counsel\" without \"for\" or \"Counsel to\". But requirement: extract type of counsel for each side. If no counsel for defendants, we set Not Applicable? Actually we should not include an entry if type of counsel not clear. That means we don't need to set \"Not Applicable\" for defendants if none. But we might need to set Not Applicable for defendants? The instructions: \"Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So if we can't find counsel for defendants, we don't add entry. But we might need to mark Not Applicable for defendants? The \"Not Applicable\" encoding is used when explicit evidence indicates not applicable (e.g., no counsel). But unclear: In this checklist, key is Type_of_Counsel. It expects multiple entries for each side. If no counsel for defendants, maybe we don't add any defendant entries. The system states: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So we only add plaintiff entries; we already have them. So we have 7 entries. That seems complete. But check if any other counsel for plaintiffs not captured? Search for \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" found all. But could be other counsel like \"Counsel for Plaintiffs: ...\". Already captured 7. Let's double-check if any other counsel for plaintiffs exist in other docs. Maybe docket includes counsel for plaintiffs. But we already captured all from Complaint. Perhaps some counsel appear in other documents not read yet. But we have captured all from Complaint. The Complaint's counsel list includes many names. We captured 7 entries. Is that all? Let's re-check the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief's counsel section. We have 7 entries. But there might be other counsel like \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" repeated. But we captured each unique group: private counsel, public interest nonprofit. Let's check if there are other entries like \"private counsel (some name)\". We captured 5 private counsel? We have 3 private counsel (Robin F. Thurston, Skye L. Perryman, Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC). Wait, we have 5? Let's list: 1) Robin F. Thurston, 2) Skye L. Perryman, 3) Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC. That's 3. But there might also be \"private counsel\" names for other individuals? Let's think: The Complaint likely lists each counsel individually. There may be \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" list that includes: \"Robin F. Thurston\", \"Skye L. Perryman\", \"Democracy Forward Foundation\", \"National Women’s Law Center\", \"Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC\", \"ACLU Foundation of RI\", \"Lawyers’ Committee for RI\". That's 7 entries. So we captured all.\n\nBut are there any other plaintiffs counsel in other documents? Maybe the Motion for Relief also lists counsel. But the Motion's counsel for plaintiffs is same group? Let's check earlier search: In Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705 and for Preliminary Injunction, we saw \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" section but only the same names? The snippet shows \"Elizabeth Theran\" (the attorney representing the plaintiffs). But that is the same as the one in the Complaint? Wait, the snippet: \"Elizabeth Theran (D.C. Bar No. 90030162) + National Women’s Law Center\" etc. That is a private counsel? Actually Elizabeth Theran is a counsel for the plaintiffs? She might be the lead counsel for the plaintiffs. But we didn't capture her. Wait, we captured \"public interest nonprofit (National Women’s Law Center)\" but not \"private counsel (Elizabeth Theran)\". But the snippet shows \"Elizabeth Theran\" with affiliation \"National Women’s Law Center\". She might be a private counsel representing the plaintiffs. But our list includes \"public interest nonprofit (National Women’s Law Center)\" as counsel. But perhaps the attorney herself is separate from the organization. The requirement: \"using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available\". So the entry \"public interest nonprofit (National Women’s Law Center)\" is for the organization. But \"Elizabeth Theran\" is an attorney affiliated with that organization. Should we include \"private counsel (Elizabeth Theran)\"? But the snippet shows \"Elizabeth Theran (D.C. Bar No. 90030162) + National Women’s Law Center\". That indicates she is a private counsel representing the plaintiffs, with affiliation to National Women’s Law Center. So we might need to capture \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Elizabeth Theran)\". Did we capture that? No. In step 8, we have 7 entries: private counsel (Robin F. Thurston), private counsel (Skye L. Perryman), public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation), public interest nonprofit (National Women’s Law Center), private counsel (Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC), public interest nonprofit (ACLU Foundation of RI), public interest nonprofit (Lawyers’ Committee for RI). We did not include \"private counsel (Elizabeth Theran)\". So we missed an entry.\n\nAlso there may be \"private counsel (Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC)\" which is a firm, not an individual. But we treat it as private counsel. Good.\n\nDo we need to capture \"private counsel (Elizabeth Theran)\"? Yes.\n\nAlso, maybe \"private counsel (some other name)\". Let's search for \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" again to see if there are other entries. But we saw the snippet that includes Elizabeth Theran. There may be additional counsel like \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" repeated with other names. We should search the Complaint again for \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" matches. We saw match 1. But there might be other matches. We should use search_document_regex for \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" across all docs. That might find multiple groups. Let's do that. Also search \"Counsel for the Plaintiffs\" etc. But the snippet already shows \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" with Elizabeth Theran. That might be separate from the Complaint's counsel list. In the Complaint, the counsel list includes names of attorneys. So we need to capture all unique counsel types across all docs. The snippet for the Motion shows \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" with Elizabeth Theran. That is an attorney. The Complaint counsel list may include the same attorney or others. But we captured from Complaint. But we didn't capture Elizabeth Theran. So we should add that.\n\nAlso, \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" may appear in other docs like Temporary Restraining Order etc. But we should search.\n\nThus we need to update the checklist with the missing entry. Use update_checklist or append_checklist. We should append new entry.\n\nBut we must ensure no duplicate entries: we currently have 7 entries. Add \"Plaintiff: private counsel (Elizabeth Theran)\". Also check if there are any other counsel for plaintiffs not captured: maybe \"private counsel (some other name)\". Let's search for \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" across all docs. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Counsel for Plaintiffs\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Counsel for Plaintiffs", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4530, "completion_tokens": 1787, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The current extracted 7 values are from plaintiff side only. We need to see if there are any counsel for defendants.

Also there could be \"Counsel for the Defendant\" or \"Counsel for the Respondent\". Search earlier didn't find. Let's examine other documents for counsel entries: Docket, orders, etc. Might not have counsel info. The complaint likely lists plaintiff counsel only; defendants may be listed elsewhere? But the complaint should list plaintiff counsel; defendants counsel may be in a separate document like \"Answer\" or \"Defendant's Motion\". Not present. The corpus includes only plaintiff documents. So maybe no defendant counsel. The instructions: \"If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'. Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So if no defendant counsel found, we don't add.

We already have 7 entries for plaintiffs captured. Search indicates no counsel for defendants found. But we might need to confirm that no counsel for defendants exists or that we captured all plaintiffs counsel. We may need to search for \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" we already did; we found matches but maybe more counsel entries beyond the 7? Let's examine: We captured 7 entries: private counsel (Robin F. Thurston), private counsel (Skye L. Perryman), public interest nonprofit (Democracy Forward Foundation), public interest nonprofit (National Women’s Law Center), private counsel (Jacobson Lawyers Group PLLC), public interest nonprofit (ACLU Foundation of RI), public interest nonprofit (Lawyers’ Committee for RI). Are there any other counsel? We saw matches in other documents: Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705 and for Preliminary Injunction had Elizabeth Theran (National Women’s Law Center). That appears to be same organization but different attorney. That might not be captured. But our entries include National Women’s Law Center already; but we didn't include Elizabeth Theran. The requirement says: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct value includes the attorney? The format: \"Plaintiff: ... (Attorney)\" So Elizabeth Theran is a distinct value: \"Plaintiff: public interest nonprofit (National Women’s Law Center)\" but we already have one entry for National Women’s Law Center with maybe a different attorney. But the value string includes attorney name, so we need separate entries for each attorney. The earlier entries were for other attorneys: Robin F. Thurston, Skye L. Perryman, etc. For National Women’s Law Center, we had \"Plaintiff: public interest nonprofit (National Women’s Law Center)\" but didn't include attorney name. Actually we had entry \"Plaintiff: public interest nonprofit (National Women’s Law Center)\" but no attorney name. But the format says include specific organizations in parentheses when available. The attorney name is not required? The examples: 'private counsel (Robin F. Thurston)'. For public interest nonprofit, the example shows organization only. So maybe we should include organization only. But we might want to include attorney names if they are distinct. But the earlier entries had attorney names for private counsel. For public interest nonprofit, the example didn't include attorney. The instruction: \"using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available (e.g., Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)).\" So for public interest nonprofit, we include organization in parentheses. Not attorney. So Elizabeth Theran is not additional unique value because same organization. So we might have captured all.\n\nWe also saw \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" matches in other documents: maybe some include other counsel names not captured: e.g., \"Elizabeth Theran\" but same org. Also maybe \"Chandra L. Khouri\" etc. That might be a different attorney but same org. But the value is still \"public interest nonprofit (National Women’s Law Center)\". So duplicates not needed.\n\nThus we likely have all counsel entries.\n\nBut we still need to verify no counsel for defendants. We did search for \"Counsel for Defendants\" and found none. Also search for \"Counsel for Def\" and \"Counsel for Defen\" had no matches. So likely none.\n\nThus we can set Not Applicable for defendants? The requirement: \"Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So we can simply not include any entry for defendants. No need to mark Not Applicable.\n\nThus we have all keys filled: Type_of_Counsel with 7 entries.\n\nWe should confirm that we've captured all plaintiff entries: we had 7. Let's double-check: earlier we had 7 entries. Are there any other counsel for plaintiffs in other documents? The search results show matches for \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" in three documents, but we captured only from Complaint. Maybe other documents have other counsel beyond those 7. Let's examine the match texts:\n\nFrom Complaint: we saw \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" section with multiple attorneys. Already captured.\n\nFrom Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705: The match shows Elizabeth Theran and National Women’s Law Center. That is same organization. So no new entry.\n\nFrom Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order: it shows same organization (National Women’s Law Center). So no new entry.\n\nThus all captured.\n\nWe might still need to re-check for \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\" in Docket? Search earlier had 3 matches across all docs. Did we capture docket? The match might include counsel for plaintiffs? We didn't capture docket. But docket may contain counsel for plaintiffs? But we didn't read docket. Let's search docket for \"Counsel for Plaintiffs\". The earlier search of all docs found 3 matches: 1 in Complaint, 1 in Plaintiffs' Motion, 1 in Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order. So docket didn't match. So okay.\n\nThus we have all counsel entries.\n\nNow we need to produce final answer: stop.\n\nBut we must ensure that the checklist is complete. The system says keys with values: 1/1. So we can stop.\n\nThus output: {\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All Type_of_Counsel entries extracted from all documents; no further counsel for defendants found.\"}<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All Type_of_Counsel entries have been extracted from the documents; no counsel for defendants identified.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All Type_of_Counsel entries have been extracted from the documents; no counsel for defendants identified.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4522, "completion_tokens": 1191, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
