Maybe the complaint was amended at some later date; but not sure.\n\nThe docket shows many docket entries, but all have 07/21/2025. No other dates.

The requirement: \"Filing_Date: The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So only the complaint's filing date matters.\n\nWe've already extracted that from complaint. However we should confirm that we have evidence. The evidence was from step 6: read_document of complaint tokens 0-2000. But we haven't actually appended? Step 7 appended. But the evidence used at that time? We didn't see the evidence snippet. We need to provide evidence. We have the snippet from step 12 for docket entry: \"COMPLAINT ( filing fee paid $ 405.00, receipt number ARIDC-2162532 ), filed by ... (Entered: 07/21/2025)\". That is evidence.\n\nWe might need to append again? But we already appended. But maybe we need to verify that we have evidence. The append_checklist action earlier probably used evidence from the complaint. But we don't have the details. We might need to do update_checklist? But the guidelines: after reading or searching, we need to append if found new values. We have already appended one. We need to ensure all values extracted. So maybe we need to confirm no other filing dates. Search docket for \"Entered:\" maybe yields multiple same date. But no other date.\n\nThus we should confirm that no other filing dates exist. Maybe search docket for \"Filed:\" etc. But the docket entries show \"Entered:\" but all same date. So we can assert that the filing date is 07/21/2025.\n\nThus we can stop.

The earlier append_checklist succeeded, but we didn't see evidence. The system may not have stored evidence. But we need to provide final entry with evidence.\n\nWe could use update_checklist to set the extracted list for Filing_Date to one entry with evidence.\n\nThus action: update_checklist for key Filing_Date with one extracted entry: value \"07/21/2025\" with evidence from docket entry snippet.\n\nWe need to provide location: maybe \"Docket page 1, docket entry 1\" or \"line 13\".

However, the Docket appears to have many entries all dated 07/21/2025. But the filing date of the lawsuit is the date the complaint was filed. That likely is 07/21/2025. But there might be other documents like Complaint may have its own filing date. We have not read the Complaint beyond 0-2000 tokens. The Complaint may contain a filing date. Also other documents like orders, motions may have filing dates, but the filing date of the lawsuit is the first filing, which is the complaint. So we should search for filing date in the Complaint. Currently partially visited 0-2000. We need to read more of Complaint to find a filing date. The search pattern used earlier didn't find matches. But maybe the date is in a different format, e.g., \"Filed: 7/21/2025\" or \"Filed 7/21/25\" or \"Filed: 07/21/2025\". Already search didn't find. But maybe it's in a header like \"Filing Date: 07/21/2025\" but earlier search didn't find. We can search again with pattern that includes \"Filed\" or \"Filing\" with optional colon and date. But search earlier didn't find. Maybe the date appears in the docket summary section, not in complaint. But we need to double-check. The complaint is 39,925 tokens; we read only first 2000. Might have filing date later. We can search for \"Filed on\" or \"Filed\" etc again. We already did pattern search for \"Entered:\" and \"Filed:\" etc. It didn't find matches in complaint. Could be that the complaint doesn't include the filing date; the docket entry shows it. The filing date is 07/21/2025. But we have only one value. But check if there are any other unique filing dates across documents. The docket shows many entries all 07/21/2025. But the complaint may have filing date but not captured. There's also a possibility of \"Filing Date: 07/21/2025\" in the docket. We already captured that. So we might be done. But we need to verify that there are no other filing dates in other documents. We can search all other documents for date patterns to see if any other filing dates appear. But the filing date is likely only the complaint date; other documents like orders are filed after, but they may have \"Filed\" dates too. But we might treat them as separate filings. The checklist item \"Filing_Date\" likely refers to the lawsuit filing date. So only one value.\n\nBut we need to check if any other documents have a \"Filed\" date that could be considered the filing date, but maybe the docket is the only source. The instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if there are multiple documents each with their own filing date, like the Complaint, Orders, etc. But the filing date for the lawsuit is the complaint. But the orders might have filing dates but those are separate filings; but the checklist might expect separate distinct values per filing. But I'd interpret that as all filing dates across all documents, not just complaint. The specification of the checklist is ambiguous. But we should not assume only one; but we should capture all distinct filing dates across documents. Let's search all documents for \"Filed\" or \"Filing\" date patterns. Search pattern already used: \"(?i)(Entered|Filed|File)[:\\s]*([0-9]{1,2}/[0-9]{1,2}/[0-9]{4})\". That found 20 matches in Docket. All of them are 07/21/2025. So only that date appears. No other date found in other documents. But we haven't searched other docs. Let's search all documents with same pattern again. But earlier search was on all documents and found 20 matches in Docket only. So no other matches. So only one distinct filing date exists: 07/21/2025. Therefore we have all values. We should update the checklist to ensure the extracted list is correct and only contains that value. But we already have 1 value. But we need to confirm that if we should set Not Applicable? No. So we can stop.\n\nBut we should double-check that no other documents have a date in different format like \"2025-07-21\". The search pattern didn't include that. But maybe a date appears as \"2025-07-21\" in other documents. We can search for that pattern. But the docket includes \"2025-07-21\" in some lines. But that is same date. We can search for \"2025-07-21\" across all docs to confirm. But it's already captured.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we need to ensure the checklist is final. We have 1 value for Filing_Date: 07/21/2025. Already appended. Should we update? Possibly no need.\n\nBut we should ensure that the value is \"07/21/2025\" with evidence from Docket. It is already appended. We should verify that no other value exists.

We need to double-check if other documents have filing dates. The docket lists many entries all with 07/21/2025. But maybe the complaint or other documents have filing date. In prior steps they searched for \"Filed on\" etc but no matches. But we need to confirm. The docket shows \"Entered: 07/21/2025\" for many entries. The complaint may have a filing date somewhere else.\n\nGiven the earlier steps: Step 6 read_document on complaint (0-2000 tokens). Step 7 append_checklist added 1 value for Filing_Date. Wait they appended 1 value for Filing_Date after reading complaint? Actually step 6 read first 2000 tokens of complaint; step 7 append_checklist added 1 value for Filing_Date: maybe from complaint's first 2000 tokens. But the subsequent search steps found no matches. But step 14 updated Filing_Date to 07/21/2025 (from Docket). So step 7 appended something else? Possibly the complaint had an earlier filing date like 07/20/2025? But step 14 replaced it with 07/21/2025. So maybe the complaint had a filing date earlier but then they updated to the docket's date. The final status says only 1 value: 07/21/2025.\n\nBut requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if there is only one distinct value in the entire corpus, then that's correct. But we must ensure no other dates exist. We should check all documents for any filing date patterns. The docket had many entries but all same date 07/21/2025. The other documents might have \"Filed: 07/21/2025\" or \"Filed on\" etc. But earlier searches didn't find. But we should verify by searching again on all documents for date patterns maybe with \"07/21/2025\" or \"07/21/2025\" or \"07/21/2025\" etc.\n\nBut we might need to read some of the unvisited documents to confirm there are no other filing dates. For completeness, we should search all documents for filing date patterns. The earlier search on all docs for pattern \"(?i)(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}|\\b\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}\\b)\" found 5 matches in Docket. That implies only docket had date patterns. So maybe that's it. But to be safe, we could search all documents again.\n\nBut the instruction: we should call one function per turn. The next action could be `search_document_regex` on all docs for date pattern again to confirm. But we might also want to read unvisited documents to see if they contain a filing date. But we could also search for \"Filed\" pattern again. But earlier searches didn't find.\n\nGiven we have 7 documents, one of them is the complaint partially visited. We should read more of it to see if it contains a filing date beyond the first 2000 tokens. The complaint is 39,925 tokens. We have only read 0-2000. There might be a filing date after that. So we should read another section, maybe tokens 2000-4000. We could choose to read tokens 2000-4000. That might reveal a filing date. According to the previous steps, they appended the filing date from the complaint. But later updated to docket's date. That suggests the complaint had a different date originally, but later they replaced it with docket's date. But maybe the complaint had \"Filed: 07/21/2025\" as well. But they replaced it with docket's. But the rule: if multiple distinct dates exist, we must capture all. But if there's only one distinct date across all docs, then that's fine.\n\nBut we need to verify that no other distinct dates exist. The docket had many entries all with 07/21/2025. So the complaint might also have 07/21/2025. If the complaint had a different date, it would be a distinct value. The earlier step 7 appended a value after reading the complaint; but later step 14 updated it to 07/21/2025. That implies the earlier value was likely the same 07/21/2025, so no change. But they updated anyway. Or maybe the earlier value was something else like 07/22/2025? But then updated to docket's date. But the final status shows only one value 07/21/2025.\n\nWe need to confirm. So we should read more of the complaint to see if any other filing date appears.\n\nThus next action: `read_document` on Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, tokens 2000-4000. That would allow us to examine for any other filing dates.\n\nAlternatively, search for \"Filed:\" across all docs again. But reading the next portion might be more efficient.\n\nThus next action: read_document doc_name: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", start_token 2000, end_token 4000.\n\nWe should ensure we don't exceed 10,000 tokens per call; we use 2000 tokens.

Currently only one date: 07/21/2025 from Docket. But maybe other documents have filing dates. We should search other documents.\n\nWe should search for \"Filed\" or \"Filing\" in other documents. Could use regex. But earlier steps attempted many searches. They found only in Docket. But maybe other documents have \"Filed 07/21/25\" etc. The complaint shows \"Filed 07/21/25\" at top. That is filing date. So we should extract that.\n\nThe complaint page tokens show \"File 07/21/25\" within the document header. The snippet: \"Document 1 Filed 07/21/25\". So extract that.\n\nAlso maybe other documents have similar. But we have coverage 39k tokens. We saw part 0-4000. That includes the header line. So we need to read more? The snippet shows \"Filed 07/21/25\".\n\nThus we need to append that value. But ensure we don't duplicate. Current extracted list only has 07/21/2025 from Docket. The complaint date is also 07/21/2025. So same value. Should we add duplicate? The requirement: extract EVERY distinct value. Distinct value: same date is same distinct value. So only one distinct date. We already have that. So no need to add duplicate. But we need to confirm if any other dates. We can search other docs for \"Filed\". Let's search all docs for pattern with year 2025 or 2024. Use regex.\n\nBut likely only 07/21/2025 is the filing date. But we should confirm no other date like 07/22/2025 etc. Search.\n\nLet's search using regex \"Filed\\s*(on|:)?\\s*(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4})\" across all docs. But earlier searches didn't find. They searched all docs for pattern, but maybe not captured due to date format \"07/21/25\" (two-digit year). The complaint shows \"07/21/25\". So we need regex for two-digit year too. Use pattern: (\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4}). So search again.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex with doc_name \"all\" pattern: \"(?i)Filed\\s*(?:on|:)?\\s*(\\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{2,4})\" and maybe for \"Filed 07/21/25\".\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)Filed\\\\s*(?:on|:)?\\\\s*(\\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{2,4})\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)Filed\\s*(?:on|:)?\\s*(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4})", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10427, "completion_tokens": 630, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But we need to extract all distinct filing dates found in any document. We have seen that the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief has \"Filed 07/21/25\" and other documents also have \"Filed 07/21/25\". Also Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705 and for Preliminary Injunction has \"Filed 08/04/25\". The Temporary Restraining Order etc have \"Filed 07/21/25\". So distinct values: 07/21/25 (July 21, 2025) and 08/04/25 (August 4, 2025). Also maybe other dates? Let's search again for filing dates in other documents. The Docket contains many entries, but the filing date for the case is 07/21/25. The motion for relief is filed 08/04/25. The motion for temporary restraining order is filed 07/21/25. The revised restraining order maybe filed same date? Let's check.\n\nWe need to find all distinct filing dates. Use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"\\bFile(d|d\\s+on)?\\s*(:)?\\s*(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4})\" maybe. But we already have many matches. We should search for \"Filed\" with date. We need to parse all documents for distinct values.\n\nWe have evidence for 07/21/25 in many documents, and 08/04/25 only in Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705 and for Preliminary Injunction.\n\nLet's confirm if any other distinct dates appear: maybe \"Filed 07/21/25\" and \"Filed 08/04/25\". Also maybe \"Filed 07/21/25\" appears. So distinct: 07/21/25 and 08/04/25. Possibly also \"Filed 07/21/25\" repeated but same value.\n\nWe need to create separate entries for each unique value with evidence.\n\nThus we need to append both dates.\n\nWe have evidence for 07/21/25 from Docket: we have snippet. We need evidence from documents: Docket snippet shows \"Entered: 07/21/2025\" but also \"File 07/21/25\". Let's find a snippet that includes \"Filed 07/21/25\" maybe from Complaint or others.\n\nWe have snippet from Complaint: \"Document 1 Filed 07/21/25\".\n\nAlso from Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705: \"Document 30 Filed 08/04/25\".\n\nSo we need evidence for both.\n\nWe also need to ensure no other distinct dates.\n\nLet's search again for \"Filed 08/04/25\". Search_document_regex on all docs pattern \"Filed 08/04/25\". Also \"Filed 07/21/25\". But we already have.\n\nWe can just use search_document_regex on all docs for pattern \"(?i)Filed\\s+(0[78]/\\d{2}/\\d{2})\" or \"Filed\\s+(0[78]/\\d{2}/\\d{2})\"? Better to search for \"Filed\\s+(\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{2,4})\" again maybe to capture both. But we already have many matches.\n\nBut we need to add second date. We should use append_checklist to add new value \"08/04/25\" with evidence from the Plaintiffs' Motion text.\n\nWe should find evidence snippet: from search results, match 1 in Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705 shows:\n\n```\nCase 1:25-cv-00342-MRD-PAS     Document 30     Filed 08/04/25     Page 1 of 8 PageID #:\n```\n\nThus we have evidence.\n\nAlso need evidence for 07/21/25 from Docket: snippet from Match 1 shows:\n\n```\n(Document 1) Filed 07/21/25\n```\n\nThus we have evidence.\n\nBut we need to check if we already appended 07/21/25. Yes, step 7 appended 1 value for Filing_Date. Which one? Likely the value from Docket. So we need to append 08/04/25.\n\nThus action: append_checklist with key Filing_Date, extracted entry for \"08/04/25\" with evidence from Plaintiffs' Motion.\n\nWe also might want to double-check if any other distinct filing dates exist. Search for \"Filed 01/...\" maybe. But given documents, only those two.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist.\n\nWe'll provide evidence: text snippet, source_document: \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief Under 5 U.S.C. 705 and for Preliminary Injunction\", location: \"Match 1 (tokens 0-112)\" or page. Provide location string like \"Page 1 of 8\".\n\nAlso for 07/21/25, we might not need to append again because already. But we could double-check that the evidence for 07/21/25 is also present.
