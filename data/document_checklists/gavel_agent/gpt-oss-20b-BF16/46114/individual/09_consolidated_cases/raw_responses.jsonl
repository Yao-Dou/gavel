We saw in the search result that the memorandum has a mention of \"Congress consolidated powers ...\", but that's not a case consolidation. The Consolidated_Cases_Noted refers to a case being consolidated with other cases. We need to find any mention of \"consolidated with\" or \"consolidated case\" that indicates a case is consolidated with other case(s). The search earlier looked for \"consolidated\" and \"consolidated with\" and found only the one mention in the memorandum about congressional consolidation, not a case.\n\nWe need to check all documents for any mention of consolidation of cases. Likely in the Complaint or other documents. Let's search across all documents for \"consolidated with\" again maybe pattern \"consolidated\" but we need the case context. Perhaps \"consolidated\" appears elsewhere. Let's do a broader search: pattern \"consolidated \" or \"consolidated case\" or \"consolidated with\". The previous search for \"consolidated with\" found none. Let's search for \"consolidated\" again but include more context maybe \"Case\" and \"consolidated\". But we can search for \"consolidated\" and then read the surrounding windows.\n\nWe need to call search_document_regex on all documents for pattern: \"consolidated\" but maybe the earlier search returned 1 match. That match was in the memorandum, but maybe there are more matches that were not captured due to context tokens? The search returned 1 total match. So likely no other mention of \"consolidated\" in any document besides that. But maybe the case number \"1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" could be part of a consolidation? The memo snippet shows \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA Document 8-1 Filed\". That is a docket entry. But no mention of consolidation.\n\nCheck other documents: \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" might mention consolidated. Let's search that doc specifically using search_document_regex with pattern \"consolidated\". But the search earlier was across all docs, but maybe the search didn't catch due to token limits? But the search function returns top_k matches per document. It returned 1 total match. So likely only that one mention.\n\nBut to be thorough, we could read the entire complaint or docket to see if consolidation is mentioned. Let's open the Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Use read_document to view tokens covering the entire document or at least key sections like \"Case\" or \"Consolidated\". But the doc is 6,049 tokens; we can read the first 10k tokens, but that's the whole doc. So we can read the entire doc. But we need to be efficient: we can read in chunks. But we can read the entire doc to confirm if there is any mention of consolidation. But we might find no mention. But the requirement is to extract all distinct values of the checklist item. If none, we need to set Not Applicable. But we need evidence that there is no consolidation. However, we can only set Not Applicable if we find explicit evidence that it's not consolidated. That might be tricky. A dismissal without prejudice might indicate no settlement, but not necessarily no consolidation. But we need to search evidence. But we can search for \"consolidated\" in the docket or other docs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" indicates no settlement, but that might not indicate consolidation. But we need \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" - if the case has been consolidated with other case(s). Typically, docket entries might indicate \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" and \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" might be consolidated with other cases. But we need evidence. Let's search the docket for \"consolidated\" pattern again. But search across all docs found only 1 match. So likely no mention.\n\nThus, the checklist item has no values, and we need to set Not Applicable. But we must provide evidence supporting that there is no consolidation. But we don't have explicit evidence that there is no consolidation. Maybe the docket entry shows \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" but no \"consolidated with\". But the fact that there is no mention of consolidation could be considered evidence. But better to find a document that explicitly says \"not consolidated\" or \"no consolidation\". But unlikely.\n\nWe might need to read the docket to confirm there is no mention. Let's search the docket for \"consolidated\" again. But the search earlier would have found it if present. But maybe the docket is not scanned properly. Let's perform search_document_regex on the docket for pattern \"consolidated\". It might return nothing. But we can call search_document_regex on \"Docket\" doc for pattern \"consolidated\". But the search already covers all docs. So it's likely not present.\n\nThus, we need to set Not Applicable. But we need evidence: maybe the docket's header shows \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" but no mention of consolidation. But we need a snippet. We can read the docket's beginning to show the case number, but not mention consolidation. But we need an explicit text that indicates no consolidation. But we could use the fact that the docket entry lists the case number, but no mention of other cases. But not explicit.\n\nAlternatively, we might need to read the notice of dismissal: \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" might mention that the case was dismissed without prejudice, implying no settlement. But not necessarily no consolidation.\n\nGiven the guidelines: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence (e.g., dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree; 'no class certification sought' → class action items Not Applicable).\"\n\nSo we need explicit text saying no consolidation. But we don't have that. So maybe we cannot set Not Applicable. We need to search for any mention of consolidation. The search found none. So the value list remains empty. But we cannot set Not Applicable. We need to continue searching.\n\nMaybe there is a consolidation mention in the \"Memorandum\" or \"Brief of Amicus Curiae\". Let's search for \"consolidated\" again but maybe with \"Case\" preceding. But the search found only the one match. So maybe there is no consolidation.\n\nThus, our best move: read the entire docket to confirm no mention. But the search already scanned all docs; but we might need to read the docket to get evidence of absence? But we cannot prove absence with one doc reading. But we can provide evidence by quoting the docket's header that lists only the case number and no mention of consolidation. But guidelines require explicit evidence that it's not consolidated. But maybe the docket entry itself indicates that the case number is the primary case and no consolidation.\n\nBut perhaps the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" indicates that the case was dismissed, so no consolidation. That might be enough. But guidelines: \"dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree\" but that is about settlements, not consolidation. But still, if the case is dismissed, it cannot be consolidated? Actually, a case can be consolidated even if dismissed? Not typical. But we might treat dismissal as evidence that there is no consolidation.\n\nHowever, we need to be cautious. The safest path: continue searching for \"consolidated\" in other docs. Maybe the \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\" or the \"Brief of Amicus Curiae\" mentions consolidation. Let's search those individually. Use search_document_regex on those docs for \"consolidated\". Let's call search_document_regex with doc_names array: [\"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\", \"Brief of Amicus Curiae ...\"]. But we can just call search_document_regex for pattern \"consolidated\" with doc_names that includes those docs. That will return matches if any.\n\nWe should also search for \"consolidated with\" again but maybe case-insensitive. But earlier we used pattern \"consolidated\" alone. Let's search again with case-insensitive. Use flags [\"IGNORECASE\"].\n\nThus, next action: search_document_regex for pattern \"consolidated\" across all docs again but with flags IGNORECASE. But we already did that? The previous search didn't specify flags. It might be default case-sensitive? The function default flags empty. So maybe it was case-sensitive. But \"consolidated\" appears all lowercase. So it's fine.\n\nBut we might need to search for \"consolidated\" with regex word boundary: \"\\bconsolidated\\b\". That would catch same. But okay.\n\nWe can also search for \"consolidated\" in the docket. But overall, we need to check all docs. Let's just call search_document_regex with doc_names of all unvisited docs: Complaint, Docket, Memorandum, Brief of Amicus, Notice of Dismissal, Plaintiff's Motion, Plaintiff's Memorandum. But we already partially visited the Plaintiff's Memorandum. But we should still search it to see if there are other matches beyond the already visited window. The search function will return top_k matches per document. But we might need to adjust context_tokens to get more context.\n\nWe might want to search for \"consolidated\" in each doc. Let's call search_document_regex with doc_names: all docs. Pattern: \"consolidated\". That could yield the same result. But we need to read the context.\n\nBut the earlier search found only the one match in the Plaintiff's Memorandum. So likely no other mention.\n\nThus, we may need to set Not Applicable. But we need evidence. We can use the docket to show that the docket shows case number and no mention of consolidation.\n\nWe can read the docket's first 200 tokens to get header. But we need to provide evidence snippet that shows only the case number and no consolidation mention. But the guidelines: \"Not Applicable encoded as a single extracted entry for that key, set via update_checklist. Provide evidence: explicit text or dispositive posture supporting Not Applicable.\"\n\nThe docket likely includes \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\". But that alone does not say no consolidation. But maybe the docket has a line \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" and no mention of consolidation. But that's not explicit.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" might say \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" and no mention of consolidation. But again, not explicit.\n\nMaybe there is a document that has \"consolidated\" but we didn't see due to context. Let's search for \"consolidated\" with word boundaries and maybe \"case\" preceding. But likely none.\n\nGiven the situation, the best action: read the docket to confirm no consolidation, but still we cannot mark Not Applicable. But we can maybe continue to search for \"consolidated\" in the docket. But the search function already looked at all docs. But maybe the docket is too large and the search didn't find due to token limit? But search_document_regex should search entire doc. But maybe the docket has 4,239 tokens, within limit. So it scanned all.\n\nThus, we can conclude that no consolidated case is mentioned. But we need evidence. We can provide evidence from the docket showing the docket entry for case number but no mention of consolidation. But is that considered explicit evidence? There's no phrase \"not consolidated\". But guidelines: \"explicit text or a dispositive posture supporting Not Applicable\". Dismissal with prejudice is dispositive. But here it's dismissal without prejudice; not dispositive.\n\nThus, maybe we cannot set Not Applicable. We need to keep the key empty until we find evidence. But the guidelines: we can keep it empty. Since we cannot prove it's not consolidated. But we might continue searching for other patterns like \"consolidated case\" or \"consolidated with\". Let's search again for \"consolidated case\" and \"consolidated with\". We'll call search_document_regex with pattern \"consolidated case\" and \"consolidated with\". But we did \"consolidated with\" earlier, found none. Let's search \"consolidated case\". Also \"consolidated with\" again. Then we can decide.\n\nThus, next action: search_document_regex for pattern \"consolidated case\" across all docs. Also maybe \"consolidated with\". But we can do separate calls. But we can only make one function call per turn. We can combine multiple patterns? The function only accepts one pattern. So we need to choose one pattern. Let's search for \"consolidated case\". That could capture \"consolidated case\" phrase. But maybe it appears as \"consolidated case\" or \"consolidated cases\". So we can search for \"consolidated case\" or \"consolidated cases\" with regex: \"consolidated (case|cases)\". That will capture both. Use flags IGNORECASE. So pattern: \"consolidated (?:case|cases)\". That will catch both singular and plural. Let's do that. We'll call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"consolidated (?:case|cases)\" flags IGNORECASE. That will find any mention of consolidation of cases.\n\nOk.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"consolidated (?:case|cases)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "consolidated (?:case|cases)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3453, "completion_tokens": 2836, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have seen one match in the Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (tokens 627-827).

We need to find any mention that the case has been consolidated with other case(s). The search didn't find any \"consolidated with\" or \"consolidated cases\". But the snippet might contain \"Congress consolidated powers\", not necessarily case consolidation.\n\nWe need to search for \"consolidated with\" again maybe case-specific. But maybe other documents contain consolidation. We should search for \"consolidated\" again but maybe broader. Could search for \"consolidated case\" or \"consolidated cases\". But we already did \"consolidated (?:case|cases)\" and found none.\n\nPerhaps the consolidation is indicated by docket entries like \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA consolidated with Case 1:25-cv-00459-ABA\". We need to search for \"consolidated with\" pattern again across all docs. It found 0. But maybe the text appears as \"consolidated case(s)\" but not exactly with \"consolidated with\".

However, the match might be part of the legal background section but not indicating case consolidation.\n\nWe need to read further in the same doc near that match to see if more context appears later. The match tokens 627-827 covers about 200 tokens. Maybe the consolidation phrase is after that. The match might be earlier. We should read more tokens after 827 to see if there's mention of consolidation. We'll read from 800-1200 maybe. But we need to confirm if there is any consolidation mention.\n\nAlternatively, other documents may contain consolidation in docket entries. For example, the Docket document might have entries like \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA consolidated with ...\" We should search in Docket for \"consolidated\" again but maybe more specific. The earlier search didn't find any. But maybe the docket document is large and the search didn't find due to token limit? But search_document_regex returns top_k matches per doc, so it should find any matches. So maybe no consolidation at all.\n\nBut the requirement is to extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So if there are none, then we would mark Not Applicable. But we need evidence supporting Not Applicable: e.g., maybe the motion dismissal indicates no consolidation. But we need explicit evidence that no consolidation exists. If we cannot find any mention of consolidation, we might set Not Applicable. But we need evidence: e.g., the docket entries show no consolidation. We could read the Docket document and confirm no consolidation. But we already searched docket for \"consolidated\" and found none. But we still could read docket to provide evidence that there is no consolidation. However, the Not Applicable rule requires explicit text or dispositive posture. The absence of text might not be enough. But we can choose to read the docket and show that it contains no consolidation entries. That could be evidence that it's Not Applicable. But we need to provide evidence text. We could quote a section of docket that lists cases but doesn't mention consolidation. But that still may not be dispositive.\n\nAlternatively, we might find consolidation entries in other documents not yet visited. For instance, \"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" might mention consolidation. We should search for \"consolidated\" again but maybe with ignoring case. Already did. But maybe the consolidation phrase is \"consolidated with the case No.\" etc. The regex \"consolidated with\" didn't find. But maybe \"consolidated\" alone might appear later but not within the snippet we saw. We should read more of the Plaintiff's Memorandum after 827 to see if there's mention of \"consolidated\" again.

That would include docket entry \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA ... Consolidated With Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" etc. Usually docket entries say \"Consolidated with Case 2:...\" or \"Consolidated with\" etc. But the snippet we saw did not show that. We should search again for \"consolidated with\" maybe we need to read further tokens beyond 1200. The document was partially visited 627-1200. We should read further, maybe from 1200-2000? Let's list remaining tokens. The doc has 7,739 tokens, so we need to read more. Let's read 1200-2000.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\",\"start_token\":1200,\"end_token\":2000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order", "start_token": 1200, "end_token": 2000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3833, "completion_tokens": 281, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have seen some mention of consolidation in the plaintiff's memorandum: \"Congress consolidated powers from several agencies\". That's not a specific case consolidation. But we need \"Any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s), including identifying information.\" The case is 1:25-cv-00458-ABA. We need to see if there is any mention of consolidation with other cases, like \"consolidated with ...\" referencing other case numbers. So we need to search across all documents for \"consolidated with\" and also maybe \"consolidated case\" etc.\n\nWe saw earlier: search for \"consolidated with\" returned 0 matches. But maybe there's a different phrase like \"consolidated as\" or \"consolidated in\" or \"consolidated with\" etc. Let's search for \"consolidated case\" or \"consolidated cases\" or \"consolidated with\". Also maybe \"consolidated in\" or \"consolidated into\". Let's try search_document_regex for pattern \"consolidated (?:with|in|into|as)\" etc. But we can do separate searches. The earlier search only had \"consolidated with\" pattern. Let's search for \"consolidated\" alone again but we already did. But the docs might have a consolidation of the case with other docket numbers. Could be in the docket or the brief. Let's search \"consolidated\" again but maybe we need to include context. Let's search for \"consolidated\" in all documents. That might return many matches. But we only have 1 match earlier. Maybe the earlier search missed some due to token range? It said 1 match in the plaintiff's memorandum. That might be the only mention of consolidation. That match was about Congress consolidating powers from agencies, not case consolidation. So likely there is no case consolidation. But we need to confirm by searching other documents. There might be a case ID with \"consolidated\" somewhere else. Let's run search_document_regex for \"consolidated\" again maybe with broader tokens? But the earlier search used default 200 context tokens. It returned 1 match. That likely captured all matches. But maybe a different pattern like \"case was consolidated\" etc. Let's search for \"consolidated case\" again - we did. 0. \"consolidated in\" - we can try. Also \"consolidated as\" etc. Let's search for \"consolidated\" with pattern \"consolidated\\s+case\" we did. Let's search with \"consolidated\\s+in\" etc. But likely no other matches.\n\nHowever there is a \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" maybe has \"consolidated\" mention? Unlikely.\n\nGiven no matches for case consolidation, we need to set the key to Not Applicable. The rule: set Not Applicable if no evidence of consolidation. But we must have supporting evidence: maybe a statement that the case was not consolidated, or a dispositive posture that indicates no consolidation. For example, a dismissal without prejudice may indicate no consolidation? But we don't know. But we can set Not Applicable if we have evidence that the case was not consolidated. Perhaps the docket might list \"consolidated with\" but we didn't find. But maybe the docket has no consolidation info; but absence of evidence is not enough. However we can use a statement like \"the case was not consolidated\" if there's explicit text. We don't have that. Let's search for \"not consolidated\" pattern.

We have some partial text.

That's not about the specific case consolidation. We need to find if the case is consolidated with others. That likely appears in docket or in complaint or in notice of dismissal. Let's search in unvisited documents for \"consolidated\" again maybe more context. We already did search overall; only one match in the Plaintiff's memorandum. That was about Congress consolidating powers. So no case consolidation.\n\nBut maybe the case number \"1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" could be consolidated? We need to search docket?

Let's search within Complaint.\n\nWe need to decide next step: search document regex on unvisited documents for pattern \"consolidated\". We did global search earlier; but maybe we need to limit to unvisited docs. But search_document_regex on all docs returned only one match. That indicates no other matches. So we can conclude there is no consolidation. But we need evidence: The search results show only one match (the Congress consolidation). That is evidence that there's no case consolidation mention. But is that enough? The search returned 1 total match in all docs: we saw that. The match text is not about case consolidation. So we can assert Not Applicable.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we may still need to read the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice to see if it says anything about consolidation. Search again for \"consolidated\" within that doc.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on that doc only: pattern \"consolidated\". That will give context if any.

We need any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s), including identifying information.

We need to search for \"consolidated\" or \"consolidated case\" maybe in other documents.\n\nWe did search pattern \"consolidated case\" and found none. Also \"consolidated with\" none. But maybe the docket lists consolidated cases. We need to search docket for \"consolidated\" etc. Could be in the docket. We have not read docket. We should search docket for \"consolidated\" with regex. Let's do search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"consolidated\". Or maybe \"consolidated case\" or \"consolidated with\". Let's search on Docket. Use search_document_regex with doc_name specific. Also maybe other documents like Complaint, Notice, Motion. Let's search on all documents but we already did some searches with pattern \"consolidated\" and \"consolidated case\" etc. It found only the match in Plaintiff's Memorandum. But maybe the docket has a different case number or consolidation. Might appear as \"Consolidated with Case No. 12345\" etc. But our earlier search didn't find. But maybe we didn't search docket because we didn't specify doc_name. We did search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"consolidated\". It found one match in Plaintiff's Memorandum. So docket didn't have any matches for \"consolidated\". So likely no consolidation of cases. But we should check other documents like Complaint, Motion, Amicus. But earlier searches on all documents found only that one match. So likely no consolidation.\n\nBut we must confirm. We might need to read the docket to see if any consolidation. But the search didn't find any; but maybe the docket text uses phrase \"consolidated case\" but we didn't search \"consolidated\" with case. Already did. So probably no consolidation. But we should set Not Applicable.\n\nWe need to provide evidence. Provide a statement that no consolidation found. We need explicit evidence: We need a text snippet that indicates not consolidated? The Not Applicable requires evidence that it's not consolidated. The guidelines: Not applicable encoded with single extracted entry \"Not Applicable\" and evidence. Evidence must be explicit or dispositive text. For Not Applicable, we need explicit text that indicates no consolidation. But we didn't find any mention of \"not consolidated\" or such. We can use the evidence that we searched all documents and found no matches, but that is not a document snippet. We need a snippet from a document that says not consolidated. But we might not have such. Alternatively, we could set the key to empty? But the key is empty initially. We need to fill value or set Not Applicable. But if no consolidation, we should mark Not Applicable. But if we can't find explicit text, maybe we should still set Not Applicable because the guideline says we require explicit text or dispositive posture. We don't have explicit text. We only know we searched and found no matches. That is not a document evidence. But maybe the docket or other documents might have no consolidation. But we can't be certain. But given that search all documents for \"consolidated\" returned only one match (the CFPB powers consolidation), we can assume no consolidation of cases. However guidelines say we must not mark Not Applicable solely because we failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence. We lack explicit text. So maybe we should not set Not Applicable. But we could leave key empty? But the extraction requires we find all distinct values. If none, we might not need to mark anything. But the system expects either values or Not Applicable. But guidelines: \"Represent Not Applicable as a single extracted entry for that key, set via update_checklist.\" But we cannot set Not Applicable without evidence. We don't have explicit evidence. But maybe we can find in the docket a line like \"This case is not consolidated\" or something. Let's search docket for \"consolidated\" again but with context. Already did. But did we search docket individually? We did search all documents and found only the match. So docket had none.\n\nMaybe the Complaint has a line like \"This case is consolidated with case X\". But we didn't find. So likely none.\n\nBut guidelines: If no consolidation, we could leave key empty? But the system might consider that incomplete. But maybe we should not set Not Applicable. The extraction process: \"If the document catalog is unknown → call list_documents.\" It's known. Next, we should search for consolidation. But we already did. But we should read the docket to confirm. Let's read docket fully. The docket is 4,239 tokens; we can read all. Let's use read_document on docket tokens 0-4239. That is within 10k tokens. Good.

The docket might have \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA Document 8-1\". But that's docket entries.\n\nWe need to search for \"consolidated\" in other documents. We did earlier searches but only found that one match. But maybe the match is in the same document. But that match is about agencies. Not a case consolidation. Need to check other documents for case consolidation.\n\nWe can search for \"consolidated case\" or \"consolidated cases\" or \"consolidated with\" across all docs. We already did \"consolidated with\" and \"consolidated (?:case|cases)\" and \"consolidated case\" and got none. But maybe \"consolidated\" appears with case number. The docket has \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\". But that's docket. Consolidated case might refer to multiple case numbers combined. Might be in the docket entries like \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA Document 8-1\". But that's not consolidation. Check the docket for something like \"consolidated with\" or \"consolidated case\". We did search all docs and got none except that one.\n\nMaybe the consolidation is in the Complaint or other pleadings. We haven't read those yet. Let's search for \"consolidated\" in the Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. We'll use search_document_regex on that doc. We can specify doc_name. We'll search pattern \"consolidated\" in that doc.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\"pattern\":\"consolidated\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "pattern": "consolidated", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10257, "completion_tokens": 450, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have one match in Plaintiff's Memorandum: line indicating \"Congress consolidated powers from several agencies and assigned them to the Bureau\". That is a consolidation statement but not a case consolidation. Consolidated cases refer to merging lawsuits. We need to identify any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s). The match found is about Congress consolidating powers; not a case consolidation. So maybe no case consolidation. But we should search other documents for \"consolidated\" again, but we have searched many. Might also look for \"consolidated case\" or \"consolidated with\" but none found. So likely there is no case consolidation. However, we might need to set Not Applicable if no consolidation. But must have evidence. We need explicit text indicating no consolidation? Some documents might say \"This case is not consolidated with any other cases.\" Did any search find \"not consolidated\"? Step 10 found none. So maybe there is no consolidation. But we should confirm with full doc maybe. We have Docket fully visited; maybe docket shows consolidation info. But we read entire docket: no consolidated match. But maybe docket shows docket entries like \"Consolidated with 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" etc. But we didn't search docket for \"consolidated with\". Step 18 searched docket for \"consolidated\" and found none. So likely no consolidation. But we need evidence. We could set Not Applicable, but we need explicit evidence. There's no explicit statement of no consolidation. But we can check if the docket includes a \"Consolidated with\" line. But search didn't find. But maybe the docket has a \"Consolidated\" in a heading or docket entry. Search didn't find. So we might need to read docket more thoroughly. But we already read all tokens. So if there is no \"consolidated\" match, there is no evidence of consolidation. But to set Not Applicable, we need a dispositive posture or explicit statement that it's not consolidated. The absence of evidence is not enough. But maybe the docket contains a line like \"This action is not consolidated with any other actions\" maybe. But search didn't catch. Could be different wording like \"No consolidation\" or \"Not consolidated\". We searched \"not consolidated\" and found none. So maybe not. But we might need to open the docket to see if there's a heading \"Consolidated\" but we would have seen. So we may need to set Not Applicable? We must be cautious: The instruction says: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence.\" So we cannot set Not Applicable unless explicit. We didn't find explicit \"not consolidated\". So we cannot set Not Applicable. But there may be no consolidation. But we might still leave empty. But the goal is to extract all distinct values. If none found, we could leave empty. That might be acceptable. But we must not mark Not Applicable incorrectly. So we can just leave empty. But we might need to attempt to read other documents to see if consolidation present. We have not yet read Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief fully. We also haven't read the Memorandum order, the Amicus brief, Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Motion for Temporary Restraining Order. These might contain consolidation statements. We should search them for \"consolidated\" again. But we already did search across all docs and found only one match in the Memorandum. That suggests no other matches. But maybe the search didn't include the other docs? Step 15 searched many docs, but not all? Step 15 searched 5 docs: Complaint, Memorandum, Brief of Amicus, Notice, Plaintiffs' Motion. So it should have searched all except the Memorandum? Wait step 15 says search on [Complaint, Memorandum, Brief, Notice, Plaintiffs' Motion]. That includes the Memorandum. So search across all these found 0 matches. So indeed no matched instances across these documents. So maybe no consolidation. But the first match in the Memorandum was found earlier in step 8/13/19. That match is not a case consolidation. So there are no case consolidations.\n\nThus we should not add anything. The extraction remains empty. But is that acceptable? The checklist requires extraction of all distinct values. If none, then the key remains empty. That may be correct. However, the system may want to set Not Applicable. But we cannot because no explicit evidence. But maybe the docket has a heading \"Consolidated\" that indicates it's consolidated? But no match. So we can leave empty.\n\nThus next action: get_checklist to confirm status? But we already know it's empty. But we might call get_checklist to verify. But the system may want us to stop? But we need to verify all keys are either filled or Not Applicable. Currently Consolidated_Cases_Noted is empty. But is that acceptable? The instructions: \"Stop when every key is either complete (all relevant values extracted) or Not Applicable.\" If none found, we have complete extraction: no values. So we can stop. But we should not set Not Applicable. So we can stop.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that we have indeed examined all docs. We have visited all docs: Docket fully visited, others partially visited. But we didn't read the Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief fully. But search covered it and found no match. But search uses regex \"consolidated\" and found none. That covers all tokens in the doc. So we can be confident no consolidation. So we can stop.\n\nThus final action: stop.

Previously they searched a lot but found only one match in Plaintiff's Memorandum. That match is about CFPA consolidation of powers, not about case consolidation. But might also be other mentions. We need to search remaining unvisited documents for \"consolidated\" or \"consolidated case\". They already searched all docs for \"consolidated\" but maybe only one match. But maybe the other documents have \"consolidated\" but not captured due to pattern? They used \"consolidated\" pattern. Could miss \"consolidated with\"? They searched. Could be \"consolidated case\" etc. But likely no consolidated case. However, we need to check if any case is consolidated with other case(s). That would be indicated by \"consolidated with\" or \"consolidated case(s)\" or maybe \"consolidated\" as part of docket story. We have docket document fully visited; they searched \"consolidated\" and found 0 matches. So likely none.\n\nWe need to check other unvisited docs: Complaint, Memorandum, Brief, Notice, Plaintiffs' Motion. We can search in those for \"consolidated\" again. They already searched all documents for \"consolidated\" and got 1 match. That suggests none else. But maybe some other pattern like \"consolidated with\" could appear. They searched for that and got no matches. So likely none.\n\nBut maybe the Consolidated_Cases_Noted key should be marked Not Applicable if no consolidation. But requirement: we should set Not Applicable only if explicit evidence that no consolidation. The docket said no matches; but is that enough? They searched all documents for \"consolidated\" and found none except the CFPA one. That CFPA one is not a case consolidation. So we need to determine if any consolidation. The evidence: docket search found 0 matches, and other searches found none. That suggests no consolidation. We can set Not Applicable with evidence: \"search_document_regex on all documents pattern 'consolidated' returned 0 matches\" but we need textual evidence. The evidence should be from a document: maybe the docket shows no mention. But we have no excerpt. We could provide evidence: \"No consolidation information found across all documents\" from step 20. But we need a verbatim snippet. We can provide text from docket: maybe \"No consolidation information found across all documents\" is not from a document. We need to provide evidence from a document. The docket may have a line \"No consolidation\" but we don't have that snippet. We might need to read the docket to confirm. But we already read entire docket. We could capture an excerpt indicating no mention. There might be a section \"Consolidation\" but empty. But we don't have snippet. We could search docket again for \"consolidated\" but we already did. We could read entire docket from start to get a snippet that says \"No consolidation\" but maybe not. But we could search for \"consolidation\" but might not find. But we need explicit evidence that consolidation not present.\n\nBetter approach: Use `search_document_regex` on all documents for \"consolidated with\" again maybe returns 0 matches. But we need evidence.\n\nThe safe path: set Not Applicable with evidence from docket: \"No consolidation information found across all documents\" is not from document. But maybe we can provide evidence from the docket's record of a docket entry that says \"No consolidation\" or something. But we don't have that snippet.\n\nAlternate: we could set Not Applicable with evidence from the docket: we could read the docket tokens (0-4239). It would be huge. But we could read a region with the docket's \"Parties\" or \"Case Number\" section; maybe it contains no consolidation. But we need to provide a snippet that indicates no consolidation.\n\nBut maybe easier: search for \"consolidated\" again using regex with flags, but we already did. But we can search for \"consolidated\" in the docket and retrieve context, maybe include \"No consolidation information found across all documents\" but likely not.\n\nBut perhaps the docket includes a line \"No other cases are consolidated with this case.\" That would be evidence. But we don't know.\n\nWe might need to search the docket for \"consolidated\". Already done. But we can ask search_document_regex on docket specifically to get a match with context. But it returned 0 matches. The function returns matches; if none, we can't get evidence. But we could still provide evidence from the docket's overall content that says \"No consolidation\" but we don't have excerpt.\n\nMaybe we should search for \"consolidation\" or \"consolidated with\" in docket with context. But if none, still no evidence. We could provide evidence from the docket that says \"Case is not consolidated with any other case\" but we don't have that snippet.\n\nThus we might need to read the docket to find a line that indicates no consolidation. But maybe the docket does not have such line. But we can still set Not Applicable with evidence that no mention found and that search was exhaustive.\n\nBut the guidelines say: \"represent Not Applicable as a single extracted entry for that key, set via update_checklist: value: 'Not Applicable', evidence: required (explicit text or a dispositive posture supporting Not Applicable)\". So we need explicit text. That text must be from a document. So we need to provide a snippet from a document that indicates no consolidation. We can read docket tokens 0-4239 and find a line about consolidation. But we don't know if exists. We could use search_document_regex on docket with pattern \"consolidation\" or \"consolidated\" but it returned none.\n\nWe could search for \"consolidated\" in docket again but maybe get 0 matches. But we could read docket again to find \"consolidated\" but it's not there. So no snippet.\n\nWe can search for \"consolidated\" in the other unvisited docs, but we already did, none.\n\nThus no explicit text. But maybe the docket itself mentions \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" and no consolidation. We could use that snippet to support Not Applicable? Not exactly.\n\nWe could interpret that no consolidation information present. But guidelines require explicit text or dispositive posture. The docket is a record; but absence of mention may not be dispositive. But maybe the docket contains a \"Consolidation\" field that is empty. But we don't have evidence.\n\nMaybe it's acceptable to set Not Applicable with the evidence that \"search_document_regex on all documents for 'consolidated' returned 0 matches\" but that is not a snippet. But we could provide evidence from the docket: \"No consolidation information found across all documents\" is from step 20, but not from a document. But it's a system statement.\n\nWe might need to read the docket again to find a line like \"No consolidation\" or \"Not consolidated\". But not sure.\n\nLet's search docket for \"consolidated\" again. But we already did. Maybe we can search for \"consolidate\" or \"consolidation\". But we did.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"consolidated\" in the docket with context and if none, we can still set Not Applicable with evidence from docket: \"The docket shows no consolidation entries.\" But we need snippet. We could read docket tokens 0-100 to get header and maybe no consolidation. But that snippet wouldn't mention consolidation.\n\nWe might use evidence from the docket's absence: we could provide the entire docket? That is too large. But we can provide a snippet that says \"Case: 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" and no mention of consolidation. That might suffice as evidence that no consolidation.\n\nBut guidelines: evidence must support the extraction. The snippet should indicate that no consolidation. But a snippet that just lists case number may not. So we need to find a line that explicitly says \"No consolidation\".\n\nMaybe we can search for \"consolidated\" pattern with DOTALL to get entire doc? But function returns matches; if none, we can't get snippet.\n\nThus we need to read the docket and find a line that indicates no consolidation. If not present, we might need to set Not Applicable but maybe guidelines allow that. It says \"represent Not Applicable only if explicit text or a dispositive posture supporting Not Applicable\". If we can't find explicit text, may not be allowed.\n\nBut the system earlier in step 20: \"stop - No consolidation information found across all documents; the Consolidated_Cases_Noted key remains legitimately empty.\" That suggests they consider key empty, not Not Applicable. But we might still set Not Applicable to indicate no consolidation. But guidelines: Not Applicable only if text indicates. But maybe we can leave empty. But we need to decide: Do we want to set Not Applicable, or leave empty? The key is currently empty. If we don't set Not Applicable, extraction incomplete? The key is empty. For completeness, we might set Not Applicable to indicate that there is none. But guidelines: We should only do that if explicit text. But we might not have. But maybe it's acceptable. The system earlier allowed empty.\n\nBut the request: \"Extract the consolidated cases from the legal documents.\" If none, we need to indicate Not Applicable. But guidelines: Not Applicable requires evidence. We might produce evidence: \"No consolidation information found across all documents\" but that's not from a doc. But we can provide evidence from docket: \"No consolidation information found across all documents\" is a statement from system. Might not be acceptable.\n\nAlternative: Provide evidence from the docket that says \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" but no mention of consolidation. But that still not explicit.\n\nWe could read the docket and find a header \"Consolidated Cases:\" and it's empty. But we don't know.\n\nGiven the constraints, I think we should set Not Applicable with evidence derived from the docket's lack of mention. We can read docket 0-50 tokens to capture header. But again not explicit.\n\nLet's check docket content: It might have a section \"Consolidated Cases: None\". But we don't know.\n\nWe could read the docket again with read_document from 0-100 tokens and provide snippet. But we don't know if it contains mention. But we can produce snippet: \"Case 1:25-cv-00458-ABA\" which may not indicate no consolidation.\n\nGiven the risk, maybe we should leave key empty. But the guidelines: extraction progress shows 0/1 filled, 1 empty. That is acceptable. But the step says we can stop. The system will accept second stop as final. So we can stop.\n\nThus likely no consolidation. So no need to set Not Applicable. We can stop. So the correct answer: call stop.\n\nReturn JSON with decision stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"No consolidation information found across all documents; Consolidated_Cases_Noted remains legitimately empty.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "No consolidation information found across all documents; Consolidated_Cases_Noted remains legitimately empty.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4076, "completion_tokens": 2281, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
