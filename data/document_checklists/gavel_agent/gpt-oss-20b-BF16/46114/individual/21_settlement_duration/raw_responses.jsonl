That might yield matches quickly.\n\nLet's try search_document_regex on the Complaint with pattern: \"(?i)settlement.*?(?:for|during|over|in|within|for a period of|for the duration of|for the period of|for the length of)\\s+\\d+\\s+(?:years?|months?|weeks?|days?)\". Provide doc_names array with Complaint. That could find matches. Let's do that.\n\nWe also include Docket? But Docket may not have settlement.\n\nWe can search on all unvisited documents: Complaint, Plaintiff's Memorandum, Plaintiffs' Motion.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on all documents but only unvisited? We can set doc_names array to include those three. That might return results. Let's do that.\n\nAlso we might need to adjust pattern to catch \"for a period of 5 years\" etc. The pattern covers that.\n\nLet's call search_document_regex with doc_names = [Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief, Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order] pattern: \"(?i)settlement.*?(?:for|during|over|in|within|for a period of|for the duration of|for the period of|for the length of)\\s+\\d+\\s+(?:years?|months?|weeks?|days?)\" flags: [\"IGNORECASE\",\"MULTILINE\",\"DOTALL\"], top_k 20, context_tokens 200.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\"Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\",\"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order\"],\"pattern\":\"(?i)settlement.*?(?:for|during|over|in|within|for a period of|for the duration of|for the period of|for the length of)\\\\s+\\\\d+\\\\s+(?:years?|months?|weeks?|days?)\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\",\"MULTILINE\",\"DOTALL\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order", "Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order"], "pattern": "(?i)settlement.*?(?:for|during|over|in|within|for a period of|for the duration of|for the period of|for the length of)\\s+\\d+\\s+(?:years?|months?|weeks?|days?)", "flags": ["IGNORECASE", "MULTILINE", "DOTALL"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4362, "completion_tokens": 1281, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have no matches yet. We need to search for settlement duration. We can search for patterns like \"settlement for a period of\" etc. Maybe there is a settlement agreement document not searched. We have 7 docs; we partially visited Memorandum (0-4000). There might be settlement statements later. We need to search for \"settlement\" pattern again but maybe the duration is in the settlement agreement documents not among these. But we might need to read further portions of Memorandum or the other documents.\n\nLet's inspect the remaining documents: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (6,049 tokens). Docket (4,239). Plaintiff's Memorandum... (7,739). Plaintiffs' Motion (678). Those are unvisited. We should search for settlement duration across all docs. We did earlier search with many patterns but found nothing. Maybe the settlement duration is within a settlement agreement document not included in the 7? But given the catalog, maybe the settlement is not in these documents. However the task might require we say Not Applicable if no settlement duration found.\n\nBut must confirm that no settlement duration exists. We need to search thoroughly. Let's search again across all documents for \"settlement\" with context. We did earlier but maybe didn't capture numeric durations. But we can search for \"settlement\" and then parse for \"years\", \"months\", etc. But earlier search for \"settlement.*?(?:years|year|months|month|weeks|week|days|day)\" returned no matches. That suggests no numeric duration in any doc. Maybe the settlement duration is not in the documents. But we still need to check the entire document, including the unvisited ones. The search did across all documents; that should have included them. So likely none. But we must be sure.\n\nWe could still read the remaining documents to confirm that no settlement duration is mentioned. But the search across all documents didn't find any matches. The search pattern \"settlement.*?(?:years|year|months|month|weeks|week|days|day)\" would catch any occurrence of settlement followed by a duration within 5 words? Actually the pattern uses \".*?\" which matches any characters (non-greedy) before the duration. That should capture any settlement followed by a duration anywhere. So if there were any numeric durations, they would have matched. There were no matches.\n\nThus there is no settlement duration in any of the documents. So the key should be marked Not Applicable. We need to set this via update_checklist with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence supporting that no settlement duration is present. We need to provide evidence: maybe from the search result of no matches, but we need text evidence. We can use the search_document_regex result from step 21 where we found no matches for \"settlement.*?no\". But that's irrelevant.\n\nWe need actual evidence snippet that says no settlement duration. We could use evidence like \"No settlement duration found in any document\" but we need to cite actual text. We could use a snippet from the search results indicating no matches? But search result didn't provide text. Another approach: read a portion of a document that contains mention of settlement but no duration. For example, the notice of voluntary dismissal includes \"Settlement\" maybe? We can read that doc again to find a settlement mention. Let's open the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice doc and find \"settlement\". It might mention \"settlement\" but no duration. But that would provide evidence that there is a settlement mention but no duration. But we need evidence to support marking Not Applicable: that there is no settlement duration. The evidence could be that the document contains settlement but no duration. But the evidence must support the Not Applicable claim. The policy says: \"If later evidence shows the item does have real values, use update_checklist to replace the Not Applicable entry with the confirmed entries.\" So we need to provide evidence that indicates there's no duration. \"No settlement duration found\" is not a text itself; we need evidence of absence. But we can provide snippet where \"settlement\" appears but no duration near it. That qualifies as evidence that duration not present. But we need to show that we looked for durations. Might be accepted.\n\nAlternatively, we can use evidence from the search that found no matches for settlement duration. But the search results didn't provide snippet. We can use the fact that the search returned zero matches. But we cannot cite that as text evidence. The policy says evidence must be \"verbatim snippet\". So we need actual text.\n\nThus we need to find a document where settlement is mentioned but no numeric duration. The Notice of Voluntary Dismissal may not mention settlement. Let's read that doc again but we already read 0-1139 tokens. Let's open again and search for \"settlement\" within that doc.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\",\"pattern\":\"settlement\",\"flags\":[],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice", "pattern": "settlement", "flags": [], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5544, "completion_tokens": 1056, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have read many docs but not found settlement durations. We need to search for patterns like \"settlement will last\", \"duration of settlement\", \"settlement period\", \"agreement will remain for\", etc. The docs include a large amicus brief, but we didn't see settlement durations. Ours might be in other documents: Docket, Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, Plaintiff's Memorandum, etc. Also maybe the Memorandum (21k tokens) may have settlement durations. We haven't read beyond 8000 tokens of the memorandum. We might need to search across all documents for patterns that include numbers and time units after settlement. We should use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern like \"(settlement|agreement).*(?:for|of|will last|duration|period|term|time).*?(\\\\d+)\\\\s*(years?|months?|weeks?|days?)\". But we risk many false positives. Another approach: search for \"settlement\" with context and then manually examine for durations. But we need to extract durations for settlement obligations, but only settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order or judgment. So we need settlement agreements between parties. That may appear in the amicus brief referencing settlement agreements with states etc. We saw references to \"Settlement\" and \"Settlement ...\". For example, the brief contains references to \"Settlement with Owner of ITT Private Loans\" etc. But we did not see durations. The brief might mention durations of the settlement obligations. We need to search for time terms near settlement. Let's search again across all docs for \"settlement\" with nearby duration words.\n\nWe should run search_document_regex across all documents with pattern that includes \"settlement\" and a duration. Use flags IGNORECASE. Pattern: \"settlement[^.]{0,200}(?:for|of|will last|duration|period|term|time).{0,200}(\\\\d+\\\\s*(?:years?|months?|weeks?|days?))\". But the regex may need to capture two groups. But search_document_regex returns context around matches. We can then read those tokens.\n\nWe should run search with pattern that captures \"settlement\" followed by up to 200 tokens, then a duration. Use pattern: \"(?i)settlement.*?(\\\\d+\\\\s*(?:years?|months?|weeks?|days?))\". But earlier we did that and found no matches. So maybe no settlement durations in docs.\n\nMaybe settlement durations appear in the \"Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice\" but we read it fully. No settlement durations. Maybe in the \"Docket\" or \"Plaintiff's Memorandum\" etc. Those documents are unvisited. We need to search there.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all unvisited documents (Docket, Plaintiff's Memorandum, Plaintiffs' Motion) for patterns. Also we might search the remaining part of the memorandum beyond 8000 tokens. Might contain settlement durations.\n\nLet's first search all documents for pattern \"settlement.*?(\\\\d+\\\\s*(?:years?|months?|weeks?|days?))\" again. The prior search on all documents returned 0 matches. So maybe no settlement durations.\n\nBut there might be durations expressed differently, e.g., \"for 1 year\", \"for 12 months\", \"for 90 days\". We might need to search for \"for (\\\\d+\\\\s*)(years?|months?|weeks?|days?)\" in context of settlement. Let's search for \"for \\\\d+\\\\s*(years?|months?|weeks?|days?)\" inside settlement context. Use pattern: \"(?i)settlement.*?for\\\\s+\\\\d+\\\\s*(?:years?|months?|weeks?|days?)\".\n\nBut earlier we tried similar patterns and found no matches. So maybe no settlement durations.\n\nCould it be that settlement durations are not present in any doc? Then we need to mark key as Not Applicable. But we should verify that no settlement durations exist. We should search thoroughly.\n\nSearch for \"settlement\" with \"over\", \"up to\", \"for a period of\", \"for the period of\", etc. Let's search for \"settlement.*?over\" etc. But maybe some settlement obligations have durations such as \"the settlement will remain in effect for 5 years\". Could be in brief. Let's search for \"settlement will last\" pattern. But earlier we used that pattern and found none.\n\nMaybe settlement durations are in the docket or other docs. Let's search docket for \"settlement\" etc. So we need to search all documents again but maybe earlier search only covered 7 docs, but we might not have included Docket and others. The initial search used all documents. It returned 0 matches. That means across all 7 docs, no settlement durations. So likely no settlement durations exist. But we should double-check by searching with different patterns.\n\nLet's search for \"settlement\" with any number and time unit in the entire corpus, not limited to settlement. We did that and found none. So no such phrase.\n\nBut maybe durations are in a different format: \"for 10 months\", \"for 90 days\", \"for 5 years\". We searched for settlement.*?(\\d+ ...). No matches. So maybe no settlement durations.\n\nThus we might conclude that no settlement durations present, so the key is Not Applicable. But we need evidence that settlement durations are not present. We need to provide a single extracted entry with value \"Not Applicable\" and evidence supporting that there is no settlement duration. How to produce evidence? We could provide evidence that no settlement duration exists by citing the search results: we could show that search for settlement durations returned zero matches across all documents. But we need evidence text. We can provide evidence from the search result that no matches found. But the search_document_regex tool returns matches, but if none, we cannot provide text. But we might use get_checklist to see no values, but not evidence.\n\nAlternatively, we could search for all settlements and then manually confirm that none have durations. We can search for \"settlement\" and read those matches to confirm no durations. The previous search for settlement gave 7 matches in the amicus brief. Those matches didn't include durations. But we should provide evidence that those matches contain no duration. We can include the snippet of each match showing that no duration appears. But that is a lot of evidence. But we need to provide evidence for Not Applicable entry. We can provide a single snippet from the search that indicates no settlement duration, but maybe that's not ideal.\n\nThe guidelines say that Not Applicable requires evidence. We could provide evidence that the settlement duration is not present by citing the search results showing that no settlement durations exist. We might need to provide a snippet from the documents showing that settlement durations are not present. But we can provide evidence such as: \"Search results for settlement durations returned no matches across all documents.\" But that's not a text snippet. We can provide evidence from the search_document_regex result that no matches found. But that is not a snippet. The evidence must be a snippet of text. We could use the fact that we did search for settlement and found no matches in any document. But we need to provide text evidence. We could use the search_document_regex result that shows zero matches: but it's not a snippet. But maybe we can search for \"settlement\" and read the matches to confirm no durations. The matches we saw earlier were just references to settlements, but didn't include durations. We can cite those snippets as evidence that no durations present. But we might need to provide at least one snippet that shows no duration.\n\nAlternatively, we could search for \"settlement\" in the docket or other docs. But if no matches, we might still need evidence. The guidelines say: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or dispositive evidence.\" So we need explicit evidence that settlement durations are not present. That could be from the docket, which might have an entry like \"Settlement Agreement Summary\" but no duration. We could read the docket to confirm. Let's search the docket for \"settlement\" to see if any mention with durations. Since docket is 4239 tokens, we can read it. But we need to find the relevant portion. We could do search_document_regex on docket for \"settlement\". That will give matches. Then we analyze if any durations present. Possibly the docket lists settlement agreements, but maybe not durations. We can read those matches.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on the docket for \"settlement\". Then read the matching snippets to confirm no durations. Then we can decide Not Applicable.\n\nWe also might search the Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and the Plaintiff's Memorandum. But maybe not needed.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex on the Docket for \"settlement\". Also include \"agreement\" maybe.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex with doc_name = \"Docket\" pattern \"settlement\".

But we didn't see the returned context. Let's do a new search with context 200. That will give us the matched snippets. Then we can evaluate if any settlement duration is present. If none, we can set Not Applicable. But we need to provide evidence that settlement not present. We can provide evidence from the search that the word \"settlement\" appears but no duration. But the search would not show durations.\n\nAlternatively, we could just read the full Brief to ensure no settlement duration. But that is large. We could read some key sections. But maybe easier to search for patterns that would match settlement durations. Since earlier search didn't find any, likely none. But we need to verify no mention of \"year\", \"month\", etc. Let's search for \"year\" near settlement. Use regex: \"settlement.*?(\\d+\\s*(years?|months?|weeks?|days?))\" again. It returned no matches. That suggests no settlement durations.\n\nThus we can set Not Applicable. But we need evidence: maybe we can provide evidence that the word \"settlement\" appears but no duration. But the evidence should be from actual text. We need an excerpt that shows no duration. We could provide a snippet of a settlement mention that doesn't include a duration. For example, the brief might say \"settlement\" but no duration. We can search for \"settlement\" context. Let's do search_document_regex on Brief with pattern \"settlement\" and get 200 context. Then we can pick one match and provide evidence that no duration is present. But we also need to show that no other settlement duration exists. Maybe we need to read the entire Brief or do search for \"year\" near settlement. But given earlier search didn't find any, it's likely none.\n\nThus we proceed: search_document_regex on Brief with pattern \"settlement\" to get context. Then we will append an entry for Not Applicable. But we need to use update_checklist to set Not Applicable. Provide evidence: the snippet that shows \"settlement\" but no duration.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Brief of Amicus Curiae States of New York and New Jersey, the District of Columbia, and the States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\",\"pattern\":\"settlement\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":10,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Brief of Amicus Curiae States of New York and New Jersey, the District of Columbia, and the States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction", "pattern": "settlement", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14481, "completion_tokens": 1201, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
