But there may be other documents with judge names: The Order/Opinion might have judge names. The complaint, memorandum, etc. But the key is presiding judge.

Should we search other documents for \"Judge \" pattern again? The earlier regex found matches for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" across all documents. We saw 5 matches but all appear to be in Docket.

But maybe the judge names appear in the \"Memorandum\" or other docs. Let's search all docs for \"Judge\" with any following capital letter.\n\nWe should do search_document_regex with pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" and doc_name=\"all\".

Should search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z].*\" maybe? But risk too generic. But we can search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]\" again. We did, zero matches.\n\nBut maybe judge names appear with middle initial included: \"Judge Matthew J. Maddox\" matches pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]\\.\"? Actually \"Matthew J.\" has two parts. The pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\\s+[A-Z][a-z]\" would match \"Judge Matthew J\" but not \"Judge Matthew J. Maddox\" because third part. So maybe we need a pattern to capture full name: \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z]\\.)?\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\"? But we only want first and last name. But we could capture \"Judge Matthew J. Maddox\" entire.\n\nWe can search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z]\\. [A-Z][a-z]+\"? But might be too strict.\n\nBut we have already captured the names.

But maybe the earlier search had limited context tokens? No, it returned 5 matches. So likely only Docket contains judge names.\n\nBut we might want to confirm that the judge names are indeed presiding judge. The Docket says \"Case Reassigned to Judge Matthew J. Maddox. Judge Adam B Abelson no longer assigned to the case.\" So Matthew J. Maddox is presiding. Adam B Abelson is former. But maybe we should include both? The requirement: \"name of the presiding judge\". That might be only current judge. But earlier extraction included both. But maybe we should only include Matthew J. Maddox. But the earlier extraction appended both. That may not be fully correct. But we can correct by update_checklist replacing the list with only Matthew J. Maddox. But the earlier extraction says \"Both values\" for \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\". But maybe they want all presiding judges over time. But unclear.\n\nWe should read more documents to confirm if any other judge names appear. Let's search in \"Memorandum\" for \"Judge\".

But earlier we did search for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" and got matches only in Docket. That implies other documents may not have \"Judge\" with a capital J. Maybe the documents use \"judge\" lowercase or \"Presiding Judge\"? We should search for \"judge\" too. But the pattern may be case-insensitive.\n\nLet's search in all documents for \"judge\" case-insensitive. Pattern: \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)\" with IGNORECASE? But that will also match \"judge\" lower-case, but we need to capture names. Let's search with pattern \"judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)\" with IGNORECASE. That may return many matches.\n\nAlternatively, search for \"Presiding Judge\" or \"Presiding judge\". But the requirement is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\" - first and last name of the presiding judge. So we just need the judge's name. It might be consistent across documents.\n\nLet's search in all documents for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" with IGNORECASE. Use search_document_regex. We'll search all docs.

Maddox and Adam B Abelson from the Docket. But are there more judge names in other documents? We need to extract all distinct values of each checklist item. The checklist only has one key: First_and_Last_name_of_Judge. We want all distinct judge names that are presiding judges in the case. We might have more judge names in other documents such as Memorandum, Complaint, etc. The Docket shows reassignments, but there may be other documents with other judge names. We should search through all documents for \"Judge \" and capture names.\n\nWe already used search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" and found matches in Docket. No matches elsewhere? But earlier step 11 found 10 matches in Docket only. That suggests maybe no judge names in other docs. But maybe the search pattern missed some names such as \"Judge Matthew J. Maddox\" etc. But we used pattern \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*\" which should catch multiple words. We got 10 matches all in Docket. That may be all judge names in the corpus. But we should double-check if other documents contain judge names. The other documents might have content referencing judge names but not starting with \"Judge \". Could be \"Signed by Judge Matthew J. Maddox\" etc. That pattern should catch. But maybe other docs have \"Judge Matthew J. Maddox\" but not at start of a line? Should still match. So likely only Docket has judge names.\n\nBut we might have missed judge names in the Memorandum (21k tokens). The search did not find matches in other docs. But we might want to search only in \"Memorandum\" for \"Judge\" pattern to confirm. But we trust previous search. But we can double-check by reading a portion of Memorandum near the top or middle. But reading 10k tokens at a time is heavy. But we can search. Use search_document_regex on \"Memorandum\" doc for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\"? But the previous search looked at all docs and found 0 matches outside Docket. That indicates likely none. But let's double-check by searching for \"Judge\" in the Memorandum. But we can do a targeted search pattern \"Judge\\s+\" on the Memorandum doc. The search_document_regex with doc_names=[\"Memorandum\"] pattern \"Judge\\s+\" would return matches.

Maddox and Adam B Abelson. We need to ensure if any more judge names exist in other documents. The docket shows both. The memorandum has Matthew J. Maddox. No other judge names. But check other documents - maybe other judge names appear in other documents? The docket includes \"Judge Matthew J. Maddox\" and \"Judge Adam B Abelson\". Also \"United States District Judge\" is generic but not a name. The memorandum shows \"Matthew J. Maddox\". The complaint and other documents might not mention judge. But we need to verify if any other judge names appear. We could search for \"Judge\" pattern across all remaining documents to ensure no other names. But the docket already captured both. Could there be \"Judge\" in memo but other names? The memo shows \"Matthew J. Maddox\" again. So likely only those two. But we need to confirm no other judge names in complaint or others. The complaint might mention \"United States District Judge\" and maybe a name but usually the judge not named. But we could search across all documents for \"Judge \\w+\" to confirm. The earlier search found matches only in Docket. It searched all documents earlier yields 10 matches. Those were all in Docket. So no other judge names. So we have all.

So it's done. The only key is extracted. So stop. But we need to confirm we haven't missed any judge names in other docs.

We have two values extracted: from Docket, likely \"Judge Matthew J. Maddox\" and \"Judge Adam B Abelson\"? Actually the earlier extraction step 8 appended 2 values for 1 key. The values likely are \"Matthew J. Maddox\" and \"Adam B Abelson\". But we need to double-check requirement: \"The name of the presiding judge (first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided). The extracted value should be formatted as '[full name]'.\"\n\nThus we need to extract the judge names; we need all distinct values. In docket we saw Judge Matthew J. Maddox and Judge Adam B Abelson. Also maybe others in other documents like Memorandum shows \"Matthew J. Maddox\". Might also be \"United States District Judge Matthew J. Maddox\". But we only need first and last names. The extracted value should be \"[full name]\". So we should extract \"Matthew J. Maddox\" and \"Adam B Abelson\"? But first and last names: \"Matthew Maddox\"? The middle initial maybe included? The requirement says first and last name if available; otherwise whatever portion is provided. So if we have \"Matthew J. Maddox\", that includes first, middle initial, last. That's acceptable. For Adam B. Abelson, we have \"Adam B Abelson\". So we should include both.\n\nWe have already appended 2 values earlier. But we need to verify completeness. Are there more judge names in other documents? Check Memorandum: shows \"Matthew J. Maddox\". Already included. Check other docs: Complaint, Brief, etc. Might contain judge names. Let's search for \"Judge\" in those docs.\n\nWe should search across all documents for \"Judge\" with a pattern capturing names.\n\nBut we saw earlier search_document_regex on all docs for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" found 10 matches. Those matches likely include names. But we might have missed names like \"Judge Matthew J. Maddox\" appears multiple times. Also \"Judge Adam B Abelson\" appears. Might also have \"Judge\" without name? But we need names. So we need to confirm if there are any other judge names.\n\nLet's search all docs for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+\" maybe capturing two or more names. Already did step 11; matches included \"Judge Matthew J. Maddox\" and \"Judge Adam B Abelson\". Might also have \"Judge Matthew J. Maddox\" appear many times. But no other judge names in docket.\n\nCheck other documents: maybe the Complaint has \"United States District Judge Matthew J. Maddox\" or similar. But likely same name. Also maybe \"Judge\" appears in the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice? But likely same.\n\nThus we probably have only those two names. But to be thorough, we should search \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" again in all docs to confirm. But we already did step 11, which did that search and found 10 matches across 7 docs, all in Docket. So no matches in other docs. So only two names.\n\nThus the checklist is complete: we have two values.\n\nBut we need to ensure the extracted values are exactly the judge names formatted as '[full name]'. So we need to store as \"Matthew J. Maddox\" and \"Adam B. Abelson\"? Wait the names from docket: \"Judge Matthew J. Maddox\" and \"Judge Adam B Abelson\". They include middle initial. The extracted value should be \"[full name]\". That likely means we should include the entire name with middle initial. So we include \"Matthew J. Maddox\" and \"Adam B. Abelson\". The format \"[full name]\" means we wrap in brackets? The instruction: \"The extracted value should be formated as '[full name]'.\"\n\nThus we need to put the extracted value string exactly like \"[Matthew J. Maddox]\"? Or maybe they mean the extracted value should be formatted as a string containing the full name, no brackets. Usually \"[full name]\" indicates placeholder, not literal brackets. In the previous step, they appended 2 values for 1 key. We need to check what value they used: The earlier append_checklist step likely had values \"Matthew J. Maddox\" and \"Adam B Abelson\" without brackets. But we don't see details. We need to ensure we add any missing values if any. But we think there are only two.\n\nThus we can call `stop` as key is complete. But we must double-check that the checklist has only that key. Yes only that key. We need to output stop with reason.\n\nThus choose action 7: stop.\n\nBut before finalizing, we must verify if the extracted values are correct. The extracted values must have evidence. We previously appended 2 values with evidence. They likely have evidence from docket matches. But we should ensure that the evidence is still there. The system's state shows 2 values appended. So done.\n\nWe need to confirm no other judge names in other docs. Search \"Judge\" in Complaint. Let's quickly search all docs again using search_document_regex for \"Judge\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\" to confirm no matches. But we already did step 11. It returned 10 matches, all in docket. So no new matches. So we are good.\n\nThus we can stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All required checklist items have been extracted with evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All required checklist items have been extracted with evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5982, "completion_tokens": 1172, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
