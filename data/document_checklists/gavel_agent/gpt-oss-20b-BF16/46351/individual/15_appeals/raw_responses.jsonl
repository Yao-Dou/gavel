We have partial data. We need to search for all appeals. The search in all documents for \"(?i)appeal\" found many matches. But we need the full content? The matches show \"Notice of Appeal\". We need to extract appeals: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nWe have documents partially read. The document \"Docket\" has matches showing \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings... by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" So parties: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. Court: US Court of Appeals? Wait docket says \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings... order ... order ... Court of International Trade\"? Actually docket shows separate entries. The docket entries show \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" It doesn't state the court explicitly but docket likely in US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit? Actually the docket is for that case. But the docket entry is in the Docket document. The docket entry likely in the same case: The case is in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The docket entry \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" would be filed with US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. But we need evidence.\n\nAlso Order (002) has notice: \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction ...\". That also indicates an appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit? But the order says \"United States Court of International Trade\" and then \"notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction ...\". That appeal would be to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, as the case is in that circuit. But we need to confirm. The order might include \"Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\" somewhere else. The partial view shows \"Order (002)\" includes \"Order (002) [Order/Opinion]\" but the snippet does not show the appeal court. The docket entry \"Notice of Appeal\" presumably had \"USCA\" abbreviation for United States Court of Appeals. There is mention earlier: \"United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\". So we should capture that.\n\nAlso the \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\" doc is a motion in the appellate court. But it's a motion. It likely is filed in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The doc's header shows \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\". So the parties: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief. Court: United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct values. So we have at least:\n\n1. Appeal: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nAlso the Notice of Appeal in the docket: same parties. That might be considered the same appeal, not distinct? But the docket entry \"Notice of Appeal\" is same parties. So we might have duplicate. Should we combine? The task says \"every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct values: duplicate identical info should not be repeated. So we should have one entry for that appeal.\n\nBut check if there are other appeals: maybe \"Notice of Appeal\" filed by \"Kristi Noem\" as defendant? There's a docket entry for \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" maybe by defendants? The docket entry shows \"Notice of Appeal\" by the defendants too? Let's search more. The search results show many matches with \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\". We need to find all. The docket entries 41 and 52 show \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" with parties. Also some docket entries might include \"Notice of Appeal\" by the defendants. Let's scan the docket matches:\n\nMatch 1 (tokens 2916-3116): shows \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\"\n\nMatch 2 (tokens 3015-3215): same content repeated.\n\nMatch 3 (tokens 3098-3298): same content repeated.\n\nMatch 4 (tokens 3537-3737) etc: More docket entries but not \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" as far as visible. Let's check token 3733-3933: there is \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\" That again same parties.\n\nThus appears only one appeal by plaintiffs.\n\nBut what about defendant appeal? In docket entry at 352? No. Search results show maybe some \"Notice of Appeal\" by \"Kristi Noem\"? Let's search manually: the docket entries list \"Notice of Appeal\" by the plaintiffs. There's also a docket entry for \"Notice of Appeal\" filed by defendant? I'm not seeing it.\n\nLet's search in other documents: maybe \"Complaint\" or \"Amended Complaint\" might mention appeal? But likely not.\n\nAlso \"Brief in Support of Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction\" might mention appeal? But we haven't read that doc. But it's a brief in the appellate court; likely no new appeal.\n\nThus we likely have only the one appeal.\n\nBut we need to verify the appellate court: The case appears to be in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This is indicated in the header of the motion doc. Also the docket entry reference \"USCA\" possibly stands for US Court of Appeals. So we need to provide evidence. We should read the header of \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\" doc to capture the parties and court.\n\nWe have partially visited tokens 0-405, 575-775. The header tokens 0-131 show the beginning. Let's read more of the doc to capture the header fully. We need to capture the parties and court.\n\nWe have already seen tokens 0-131: \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\" plus parties. That suffices.\n\nBut we need to provide evidence: text snippet, source document, location. The location could be \"Page 1 of 3\" or token ranges.\n\nWe need to read tokens 0-200 maybe. Let's read from token 0-200 to capture header. Also we might capture the parties again.\n\nLet's call read_document on \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\" from 0 to 200.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7586, "completion_tokens": 1515, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have seen some matches: in Docket, there is a \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" entries, and in Order (002) there is notice of appeal. Also in the motion, there is an appeal: the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. Also the docket entries include \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" lines. We need to extract every distinct value: format 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nWe need to gather all appeals. We should search for \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" and \"appeal\" in all documents. We already have search results. But we might need to read some parts for details: parties and court. The court is likely \"United States Court of International Trade\" or \"United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\" or maybe \"United States Court of Appeals\" for the Ninth Circuit. We need to see what the appeal is to. Let's examine the docket matches: The docket shows \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings... by ...\". But not showing the court. But the docket entries likely indicate the court. The docket entry 41 says \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" That is the parties. The docket entry also says \"Filing fee $ 605, receipt number BMTDC-3471717. (Tranel, Monica)\". But we need the court. The docket entry might be from the USCA (United States Court of Appeals). The docket listing likely indicates the court? It might show \"USCA\" earlier. The docket entries 51-52 show USCA Case Number 25-2717. So the court is US Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). So the appeal is to that. Also Order (002) shows \"Plaintiffs, ... On April 25, 2025, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to transfer this matter to the United States Court of International Trade. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction ...\". That appeal is to the United States Court of International Trade? Wait, the appellate court for the notice of appeal is likely the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, but the underlying case was transferred to the US Court of International Trade, so the appeal may be to the Ninth Circuit? Actually, the appeal is of the order transferring jurisdiction; the appeal is filed in the Ninth Circuit? The text says \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction\". That suggests the appeal is filed in the Ninth Circuit. So Parties: Plaintiffs: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief. Court: United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Also the motion to expedite briefing schedule is by the same plaintiffs, and they request a briefing schedule on the merits of their appeal. That is not an appeal itself but a motion. But the appeal is the notice of appeal.\n\nAlso there is a \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" in the docket matches 51-52. That is the same.\n\nAdditionally, there might be an appeal in the \"Docket\" entry 41 for \"Notice of Appeal\" as to \"40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings\". That might be from the same parties. So likely only one appeal.\n\nWe need to extract distinct values: maybe multiple distinct values if there are multiple appeals by different parties or to different courts. But from evidence, only one appeal.\n\nBut we should confirm from the \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\" maybe there is a mention of appeal. It says \"request an expedited briefing schedule on the merits of their appeal.\" But doesn't specify the court.\n\nBetter to read the docket entries fully to see if the court is indicated. The docket entries show \"USCA\" earlier. Let's read the docket from tokens 2916-3116 (already read). It shows the docket entry. But does it show \"USCA\"? It says \"41 | 2025-04-25 | NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. Filing fee $ 605, receipt number BMTDC-3471717. (Tranel, Monica) (Entered: 04/25/2025)\". It doesn't show the court. But earlier in the docket maybe 51 shows \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 ...\". That might be the docket numbers of the US Court of Appeals. So the court is US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nWe should confirm by reading the docket entry at tokens 51-52. Let's read tokens 3785-3985? Already read. But we can read again. Let's do a search for \"USCA\" in all documents. But maybe better to read the docket entry 51. But we already saw it. But we might need to read the docket entry 51 to capture the court. Let's read tokens 3785-3985 again but maybe more context. We'll read tokens 3700-4000.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"start_token\":3700,\"end_token\":4000}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 3700, "end_token": 4000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7852, "completion_tokens": 1151, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have seen some matches: Docket has Notice of Appeal entries. Also Order (002) has notice of appeal. Also Appellant's Motion implies appeal. We likely need to extract each distinct appeal: parties and appellate court. We need to search for \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"appeal\" contexts. We already have some from search. We probably need to read more matches in Docket beyond the ones we saw. We saw match 1-6 from Docket, but maybe more. We saw matches 1-6 earlier. We need to capture each appeal: \"Notice of Appeal filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief\" to USCA (United States Court of Appeals). Also from Order (002) we have \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction\" – need parties (Plaintiffs: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief) and appellate court (United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit? Actually order says \"United States Court of International Trade\" for transfer. Notice of appeal of transfer order, presumably to USCA? It says \"notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction\". Might be to USCA? Might be to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the appellate court of the district). But the order says \"Court of International Trade\" is the new court; the appeal might be to USCA? Needs check. The docket shows USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief. So presumably the appellate court is the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Also the docket mention \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\" which hints USCA. So we should extract that appeal.\n\nAlso the \"Appellant's Motion\" shows that plaintiffs are appealing? The motion is for expedited briefing schedule on merits of their appeal. That indicates an appeal to USCA. So we should capture \"Appeal: Plaintiffs (Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief) appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\" And \"Appeal: Plaintiffs (same) appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\" Might be duplicate. But distinct values could be same. But we need distinct values; if duplicates identical, maybe only one entry. But better to include each distinct appearance. We may have multiple distinct appeals: maybe one appeal to USCA (Ninth Circuit) and another to USCA (same). But the docket might indicate the appeal is to USCA. Might also be appeal to USCA for the Transfer order? Actually the docket says \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by...\" So it's an appeal to USCA.\n\nAlso Order (002) says \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction “as well as all prior orders and decisions that merge into that Order.” So that's the same appeal.\n\nThus we might have one unique appeal: Plaintiffs appeal to USCA.\n\nBut maybe also the defendants' motion to transfer and then appeal to USCA? No, defendants didn't appeal. There's also \"Notice of Appeal as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings\" filed by David Mountain Chief, etc. That also appears to be a notice of appeal. That is also an appeal to USCA. So that might be a distinct appeal, but same parties, same appellate court. But since parties same and court same, it's still the same appeal? Could be separate notice of appeal? But likely same case. So maybe only one appeal.\n\nBut we need to extract every distinct value. So we might have:\n\n1. Appeal: Plaintiffs (Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief) appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nThus we need to find evidence: from Appellant's Motion, Docket, Order (002). We need to gather evidence from documents.\n\nWe need to call read_document for some parts not yet read that contain the notice of appeal lines. We have parts of Docket with lines 51 and 52. Let's read from Docket tokens 5100-5200 maybe. But we already have 51 and 52 read earlier. We have evidence lines from Docket. We need to extract parties: Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief. And appellate court: United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. So we need evidence of appellate court. In the Appellant's Motion, the header \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\". So that gives appellate court. And the parties are listed at top. So we need to read those tokens. We have read tokens 0-200 of Appellant's Motion includes the header and list of plaintiffs. That includes the parties. So we can use that as evidence.\n\nWe also need evidence of appeal: \"Notice of Appeal\" lines in Docket show the parties and mention USCA Case Number. But we might also need to show that it's an appeal. So we can include the docket entry \"Notice of Appeal\" as evidence.\n\nThus we need to append a single entry for Appeal key.\n\nWe need to gather evidence: 1) from Appellant's Motion header: \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\" and the list of plaintiffs. 2) from Docket entry: \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\" 3) maybe from Order (002) that mention notice of appeal.\n\nWe have already read Appellant's Motion tokens 0-200. That includes header and plaintiffs. We have read Docket tokens 3700-4000 which includes the notice of appeal lines.\n\nThus we can append a single entry.\n\nWe should confirm we have evidence of appellate court: \"United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\" is in Appellant's Motion. That is sufficient.\n\nThus we can do append_checklist for Appeal key with one extracted value: \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\"\n\nBut need to format exactly: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' Use parties as listed: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief.\n\nThus the value: \"Appeal: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\"\n\nWe need evidence list: from Appellant's Motion tokens 0-200: the header and parties lines. Also from Docket tokens 3700-4000: the notice of appeal line. Provide each as separate evidence entries.\n\nCheck evidence format: each evidence entry: text, source_document, location. Location can be token range or page. We can give token range or page as string.\n\nWe have source documents: \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\" and \"Docket\".\n\nFor Appellant's Motion evidence: text snippet: \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\\n\\n Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief and David Mountain Chief, No. 25-2717\". We can include that.\n\nFor Docket evidence: text snippet: \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\"\n\nWe may also include Order (002) evidence: \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction\". But maybe not needed.\n\nThus we will append.\n\nWe need to not duplicate if already appended? The current status keys: 0/1. So no Appeal entries yet.

That is also appeal to the same court (United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit). So all appeals are by same parties to the same court. But we should still record each distinct value. The checklist expects distinct values; if all identical, we might only record one. But also if different parties or court, record separately.\n\nThus we need to examine Order (002) to confirm. Let's read more of Order (002) around the notice of appeal.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order (002)\",\"start_token\":70,\"end_token\":300}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (002)", "start_token": 70, "end_token": 300}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10092, "completion_tokens": 626, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have already appended one value: \"Appeal: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\" But possibly there are other appeals in other documents.\n\nWe saw search on \"notice of appeal\" matches showing Docket entries: multiple notices of appeal by same parties. Also Order (002) mentions \"notice of appeal\" by Plaintiffs. But we need unique values: parties and court.\n\nThere may be an appeal to the United States Court of International Trade? Actually the case was transferred to the U.S. Court of International Trade. But the appeal might be to the U.S. Court of International Trade? The notice of appeal was filed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The case was transferred to CIT; but the appeal is still to Ninth Circuit? The docket entries show \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\" indicating Ninth Circuit. So likely all appeals are to Ninth Circuit.\n\nBut we might have multiple distinct appeals: perhaps one by Plaintiffs, one by Defendants? Let's scan other documents.\n\nWe have not visited Complaint files. The Complaint may mention a notice of appeal? Usually complaint may mention that the case is pending, not likely. But possibly there is a Notice of Appeal by Defendants? The docket shows \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings\" by David Mountain Chief etc. That is a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nAlso there may be a notice of appeal by Defendants? Search for \"noticed of appeal\" again? Already done. But maybe there's a notice of appeal by Defendants to the U.S. Court of International Trade? Let's search in all documents for \"appeal to\" or \"appeal to\" pattern. But maybe easier: check Docket entries for \"Notice of Appeal as to\" lines. The docket entries mention \"Notice of Appeal as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings\" filed by David Mountain Chief, etc. Also \"Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\" So same parties.\n\nAlso there is a mention of \"Notice of Appeal\" in Order (002) by Plaintiffs. That likely refers to the same notice of appeal filings.\n\nThus all appeals appear to be the same: Plaintiffs appealing to the Ninth Circuit. There may be multiple filings (notice of appeal to 40, 41, etc). But the distinct value may still be the same parties and court. But we might have separate appeals? For example, \"Notice of Appeal as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings\" vs \"Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\" However both are same parties.\n\nThus only one distinct appeal value is needed.\n\nHowever we need to confirm there is no appeal by Defendants. Let's search docket for \"Defendant\" \"appeal\" maybe there is. But we can use search_document_regex for pattern \"(?i)defendant.*appeal\" on all documents. Let's do that.\n\nAlso check Order (001) and (003) maybe mention appeals. Order (001) maybe contains \"appeal\" as well. So we should search all documents for \"appeal\" again? Already did initial search, but maybe need to see other matches beyond the first 38. But we can target docket for more matches.\n\nBetter: search for \"Appeal\" in the remaining unvisited documents: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, etc. But that's large. Instead search regex across all documents for \"appeal\" again, but maybe we need to narrow to \"appeal to\" or \"appeal to the\". But we can search for \"appeal to\" pattern. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents, pattern \"(?i)appeal to\". That might capture appeals to some court. But we need to confirm.\n\nAlso we might need to read Order (001) and (003) to find additional appeals. But we can search for \"appeal\" in those docs.\n\nGiven limited time, let's search all docs for \"appeal to\" to see if any other court appears.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)appeal to\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)appeal to", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5839, "completion_tokens": 949, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We already have one value extracted: \"Appeal: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\" That covers one appeal. But there might be others. We have evidence of \"notice of appeal\" in the docket for various parties. Also Order (002) shows plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction. That is an appeal, presumably to the U.S. Court of Appeals? It might be to the U.S. Court of International Trade? No, it's a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction, likely to the appellate court. The docket shows a \"Notice of Appeal\" by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief. That seems like the same appeal. But the docket also has a \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. Also the Order (002) shows plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction. That implies an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit? Actually the docket says \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\" which is a Ninth Circuit case. So the appeal is to the Ninth Circuit. So we have one appeal.\n\nBut maybe there is also an appeal in the Complaint? Perhaps the Complaint mentions a class action? The appeal may be referencing \"notice of appeal\" of the order transferring jurisdiction. We might need to extract that. But the current extracted value includes that appeal. But the extracted value says \"Appeal: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\" That covers the parties and the appellate court. Good.\n\nIs there any other appeal? The docket also mentions \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" That is a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit? Might be the same appeal. But what about \"Notice of Appeal\" for the order transferring jurisdiction? That is also a notice of appeal by plaintiffs (the same parties). So maybe it's the same appeal.\n\nBut maybe there is a separate appeal: the docket has a \"Notice of Appeal\" in line 51? Let's examine the docket excerpt. It says: \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\" That is a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit. So the same.\n\nThus we may already have captured all appeals. But we need to check if there are any other appeals in the rest of the corpus. The Complaint might mention that they are appealing. But likely not.\n\nWe might need to read the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to confirm if there is an appeal. But maybe not. The question: \"Extract the appeals from the legal documents.\" We already have one extracted entry. But we need to extract every distinct value. If there is only one distinct appeal, we have it. But we need to verify that there are no other appeals. There might be an appeal in the \"Brief in Support of Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction\" or \"Brief in Support of Motion to Intervene by Montana Farmers Union.\" But likely not.\n\nWe should verify if the \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" mentions an appeal, but probably not. The docket shows only one appeal. The Order (002) also just repeats. So maybe it's only one.\n\nBut we might need to extract the same appeal again? No, we only need distinct values. So one is enough.\n\nBut we must ensure that the extracted value includes evidence. The previous append_checklist included evidence from the Motion and Docket. But we might need to add evidence from Order (002) to confirm the parties and court. But the current entry already includes evidence. But maybe we should update the entry to include evidence from Order (002) too? Not required but could strengthen.\n\nAlternatively, if we think there is a second appeal: maybe there is a \"Notice of Appeal\" filed by \"Kristi Noem, The United States of America, U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\" Actually the docket excerpt includes \"RESPONSE to Motion re 45 MOTION for Reconsideration Final Order Doc. 40 filed by Kristi Noem, The United States of America, U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\" That is not an appeal.\n\nThus only one appeal.\n\nThus we should stop. But we need to consider that we haven't yet included all evidence for the extracted value. The extract may need to include the parties and the appellate court. The current extracted value uses \"United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\" We have evidence from the Motion and Docket. That seems sufficient.\n\nBut we need to check if any other documents add a different appellate court. For example, \"notice of appeal\" might be to the U.S. Court of International Trade? No, that is a transfer. The appeal is to the Ninth Circuit. So no other.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut maybe we need to check if the \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" includes appeal to another court. But we haven't read it. But there is no reason to suspect. But to be safe, we could search for \"appeal\" in the remaining unvisited documents. But we already did search for \"appeal\" earlier; it found 38 matches across all documents, and we have looked at most of them. But we haven't read the \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" (19,849 tokens) or \"First Amended Complaint\" (22,696 tokens). But the search of all documents for \"(?i)appeal\" found 38 matches, and we saw that many are in the Order (001) and others. We haven't seen the matches for those complaints. But we could check the search results to see if there were matches in the Complaint. But we don't have them. We can run a search for \"appeal\" again in the remaining unvisited documents.\n\nBut the search results were found earlier. It says 38 matches across all documents. We saw matches in Docket, Order (001), Order (002), Order (003). But maybe the matches were also in the Complaint. We don't have the matches listed. We could run a new `search_document_regex` on the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief with pattern \"(?i)appeal\". That might show if there are any appeals. But we might also search all documents again but maybe we want to target the Complaint.\n\nWe should check if any other appeals exist.

Currently we have one value from motion and docket. But there might be others in other docs: Order (001), Order (003), etc. We saw notice of appeal in Docket, but maybe there are appeals to other courts (e.g., US Court of International Trade). We need to search for \"appeal to\" had 0 matches. Maybe \"appeal to\" not found because phrase may be \"appeal to the United States Court of International Trade\" etc. We saw \"Filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief\" but didn't show court. But we have \"appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction\" but not specifying court. In Order (002) we saw \"notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction\" but again no court. There might be appeals to the US Court of International Trade? That is a different court. We need to find all appeals: parties and appellate court.\n\nProbably each notice of appeal filed to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; but also maybe appeals to the US Court of International Trade (in earlier docket, the case was transferred there). The appeals might be to the Ninth Circuit for the main case, and to the US Court of International Trade for the transfer order? But the docket shows USCA case number 25-2717, which is Ninth Circuit. The transfer to the US Court of International Trade might have its own appeal? But likely the notice of appeal is to the Ninth Circuit for the main case; the transfer order was to the International Trade court; but the appeal might be from that order.\n\nThus need to find all appeals: In Docket, we saw notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction. That notice of appeal is presumably filed to the Ninth Circuit. But also the motion for preliminary injunction pending appeal is filed to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nCheck Order (003) text: seems to mention Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41) – again likely to Ninth Circuit. So all appeals are to Ninth Circuit.\n\nThus we need to extract unique entries: maybe 1. \"Appeal: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\"\n\nBut maybe there are also appeals by the defendants? The docket shows \"Notice of Appeal as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" That's same parties.\n\nBut maybe there is separate appeal by the defendants? Let's search in Order (001) for \"appeal\" again. It had 4 matches earlier. We need to read more of Order (001). Let's read tokens around 70-300? Already partial. Let's read more tokens from Order (001) around 2000? We need to identify potential appeals.\n\nWe saw search results earlier: 4 matches in Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule, 6 in Docket, 5 in Order (001). Let's read Order (001) near tokens 2000-2600 maybe. But we need to find the appeals. Let's read a section covering notice of appeal. Search \"notice of appeal\" inside Order (001).

Already 1 value extracted from Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule, 1 from Docket, total 2? Wait: earlier Step 5 append 1 value for Appeal. Step 6 search for notice of appeal found multiple matches. Step 7 read Order (002) provided bits but didn't find new appeal? But we saw earlier matches in Docket: notice of appeal. That indicates maybe we need to extract all appeals: from Docket, Order (002) and possibly others. We need to find all distinct Appeal entries.\n\nWe have from Step 5: appended 1 value for Appeal. That likely came from Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule. Let's check that text to see what value. Step 3 read 200 tokens from Appellant's Motion. The snippet not displayed, but earlier tasks may have extracted \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\". We need to check what that entry was. But we don't have its content. We need to ensure we capture all distinct appeals. We have current extracted values: 1 from Appellant's Motion, 1 from Docket. But maybe there are more in Order (001), Order (002), Order (003), etc.\n\nWe need to search for \"notice of appeal\" and \"appeal\" pattern. We already did search for \"notice of appeal\" and saw many matches. Those matches contain details: parties and court. For each match, we should extract a distinct entry. But we need to ensure no duplicates. For example, Docket match 1: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. Filing fee $ 605, receipt number BMTDC-3471717. (Tranel, Monica) (Entered: 04/25/2025)\". That indicates parties: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber; court: unclear, maybe \"U.S. Court of International Trade\"? The docket entry also says \"United States Court of International Trade\" earlier. The docket match 2: \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\" That indicates parties same, court maybe USCA? But USCA refers to U.S. Court of Appeals? USCA is abbreviation for U.S. Court of Appeals? Actually USCA could be \"United States Court of Appeals\". But context: docket entries show \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\" likely that the appeal is to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit? Actually docket entry: \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\" indicates the case number for the US Court of Appeals. So we need to capture that.\n\nAlso in Order (002) we saw a notice of appeal filed by Plaintiffs. The parties: Plaintiffs: reference to plaintiffs names: maybe \"Goddard; Rhonda Mountain; ...\". The parties are the same. The appellate court: \"United States Court of International Trade\" and then \"notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction\". That is an appeal to the U.S. Court of International Trade? Actually the court is the same as the court to which case was transferred. The notice of appeal is to the \"U.S. Court of International Trade\". So we need to capture \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\" But the parties are the plaintiffs. So we need to list the parties.\n\nAlso there might be appeals in Order (003) (notice of appeal). That snippet: \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41)\" but not explicit parties or court. But earlier docket entry shows same parties. So we need to capture that.\n\nAlso maybe in Order (001) there is a notice of appeal. The search for Docket shows 7 matches total across Docket. We need to capture all distinct appeals. Let's list them:\n\nFrom Docket:\n\nMatch 1 (tokens 2913-3113): Notice of Appeal as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings. Parties: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. Court: Not explicitly but maybe \"United States Court of International Trade\" because docket entry says \"Notice of Appeal\" and earlier docket entry says \"Court of International Trade\" in same docket. The note: \"Notice of Appeal as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" It may not state the appellate court. But the docket entry preceding \"Notice of Appeal\" shows \"Court of International Trade\" in earlier token. But we can include the appellate court as \"United States Court of International Trade\" as per docket entry.\n\nMatch 2 (tokens 3730-3930): \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\" So parties same. Court: USCA (United States Court of Appeals). We need to capture that.\n\nMatch 3 (tokens 3782-3982): similar to match 2, but maybe duplicate. But it's same parties. So we should maybe consider duplicate entries? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct values. If same parties and court repeated, we should not duplicate. But might be separate docket entries but same appeal. So it's same value. So we should count only once. But we must ensure we capture all unique appeals. So we need to capture each unique combination of parties and court. There might be two unique appeals: one to U.S. Court of International Trade and one to USCA. But also possibly an appeal to \"U.S. Court of International Trade\" from Order (002) but it's the same as the first? The parties might be Plaintiffs. But the docket entry shows same parties. So that may be the same appeal. But the docket entry indicates \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction\". That is the same as the first. So it's the same appeal. So we likely have only two distinct appeals: one to US International Trade, one to US Court of Appeals.\n\nHowever, we also have \"Appeal\" from Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule. That might be a different appeal? The parties might be the same but maybe different docket. Let's examine the content of that motion. It may mention \"Notice of Appeal\" regarding transfer of jurisdiction. But we don't have the snippet. We need to read that document to confirm parties and court. Step 3 read 200 tokens only; maybe we didn't cover the \"Notice of Appeal\" part. The motion may have a statement of appeal. Let's search within Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule for \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"appeal\". Step 8 search for \"(?i)appeal to\" found none. Step 6 search for \"(?i)notice of appeal\" found 7 matches across documents; includes some matches in Docket, Order (002), etc. It didn't find any in Appellant's Motion. But Step 3 read 200 tokens; maybe the motion contains an appeal but not captured due to limited tokens? We may need to read further.\n\nBut the current extracted values show 1 from Appellant's Motion, 1 from Docket. So that means the extraction from Appellant's Motion produced an entry. But we didn't see it. That entry might be a different appeal. Let's read more of Appellant's Motion beyond 200 tokens to find mention of appeal.\n\nWe need to identify the parties and appellate court. The motion is likely for expedited briefing schedule; maybe the parties are the same as the case. But we need the parties: likely Plaintiffs: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. But maybe the motion is filed by the same parties. The appellate court: U.S. Court of International Trade. So the entry might be identical to the Docket's first appeal. But if it's identical, it's duplicate. But the extracted values list 1 from Appellant's Motion and 1 from Docket; so they are distinct entries. So maybe the Appellant's Motion includes an appeal to a different court or to a different docket. Let's search within that document for \"court\" or \"appeal\" again. We can read more tokens.\n\nWe should read more of Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule. It's 786 tokens total. We have read 0-405 and 575-775. That covers almost all except tokens 405-575. Let's read that range.\n\nAction: read_document on Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule tokens 405-575.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\",\"start_token\":405,\"end_token\":575}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule", "start_token": 405, "end_token": 575}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5212, "completion_tokens": 1963, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Actually Step 3 read 200 tokens from the motion; Step 4 read docket 300 tokens; Step 5 appended 1 value for Appeal; likely from Docket? Maybe the docket had an appeal. But we need all distinct values. We have at least two: one from Order (002) (notice of appeal filed by Plaintiffs). Also from Docket maybe earlier. We need to check other documents for appeals: Complaint, Amended Complaint, Briefs. We need to search for \"appeal\" or \"notice of appeal\" across remaining unvisited documents. We can use search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"notice of appeal\" or \"appeal to\" or \"appeal\" again. But we need to search across unvisited docs: Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Briefs.\n\nLet's plan: search for \"appeal\" in Complaint; but we need to read relevant windows. We can use search_document_regex across the unvisited docs: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, First Amended Complaint, Brief in Support of Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction, Brief in Support of Motion to Intervene by Montana Farmers Union. Use pattern \"(?i)notice of appeal\". That might capture the notice. Also pattern \"(?i)appeal to\". Let's do search_document_regex on all documents again for \"notice of appeal\". That will return matches in all docs, but we only care about unvisited. But we can just search all again. But we may want to limit. But it's okay to search all. We'll get matches and then read. Step 6 earlier found 7 matches: 3 in Docket, 3 in Order (002), 1 in Order (003). We still need to read more: maybe there were 3 in Docket that we didn't capture? We appended one value from Order (002). But maybe the Docket has multiple appeals. Need to read Docket further to capture all. Docket is partially visited: tokens 2913-3298, 3537-4000. We need to read remaining tokens: 0-2913 and 4000-4313? Actually Docket total 4313 tokens. We have 2913-3298 and 3537-4000. So remaining: 0-2913 and 4000-4313. We can read one window. But maybe the appeals appear earlier. We'll read 0-2000 to capture early docket. Also read 4000-4313. But we need to avoid re-reading 2913-3298 and 3537-4000. We'll read 0-2913. That includes 0-2913 tokens. That is less than 10k. Let's do read_document on Docket tokens 0-2913. Then extract appeals. Also we might need to read 4000-4313: read_document Docket 4000-4313. That covers rest.\n\nAlso search for appeals in other docs. Use search_document_regex on all docs for \"notice of appeal\" again. That will return matches in Complaint, etc. We'll read those windows.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(?i)notice of appeal\". That will give matches, then we will read windows.\n\nBut we currently only have one action per turn. We need to decide. We could do search_document_regex to get matches quickly. That gives context. Then next turn we will read_document. So next action: search_document_regex.\n\nYes.\n\nWe choose search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"(?i)notice of appeal\". That will return matches.\n\nLet's produce function call.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)notice of appeal\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)notice of appeal", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3846, "completion_tokens": 897, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Actually earlier step 5 appended 1 value for Appeal. Which one? Step 5 appended 1 value. Step 12 search_document_regex found matches about notice of appeal. We have likely found more appeals. Need to extract all distinct values of Appeal. We have partial coverage: Docket has multiple notice of appeal entries. Also Order(002) includes notice of appeal. Also Order(003) includes notice of appeal. Order(001) might have some appeals. Also other documents likely have appeals. We need to systematically read more. We need to ensure all distinct values. Likely many. We need to search for \"notice of appeal\" in all documents again but we already did. But we might need to read the matches to extract parties and court. The pattern \"notice of appeal\" matches may include docket numbers, parties, court. We need to extract \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nWe need to locate each appeal. We have found some in Docket. Also Order(002) shows plaintiffs filed notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction; the court is United States Court of International Trade. Parties: Plaintiffs (names given earlier: G. M. ??? Actually parties: Plaintiffs: \"Goddard; Rhonda Mountain Chief; David Mountain Chief\" maybe. In Docket matches we saw \"by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber\". Court: U.S. Court of International Trade? Actually docket looks like the hearing set for May 1 2025, directed to transfer case to Court of International Trade. The notice of appeal is to the U.S. Court of International Trade. So we need to extract each unique appeal.\n\nWe need to read the matches to get proper parties and court names.\n\nWe should read more of Docket. We have viewed 2913-3298, 3537-4000. We might need to read the earlier part of Docket (start). But the matches were in 2913-3113, 3730-3930, 3782-3982. We may need to read around those tokens to capture full context: parties listed. Also maybe earlier docket entries before 2913? But likely the docket contains all appeals.\n\nAlso Order(002) matches show notice of appeal. Need to read around tokens 70-271 and 174-374 etc to capture parties and court. But we already read 70-857. That includes the notice of appeal and parties? It shows Plaintiffs filed notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction. Parties: Plaintiffs: maybe \"Goddard; Rhonda Mountain Chief; David Mountain Chief\" etc. We need to capture parties. The text snippet shows: \"Plaintiffs, v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security; KRISTI NOEM in her official capacity; and THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Defendants.\" Also earlier it shows names. But we need to capture the names of plaintiffs. We saw earlier names: \"Goddard; RHONDA MOUNTAIN CHIEF; and DAVID MOUNTAIN CHIEF\". So we need to extract that.\n\nAlso Order(003) has notice of appeal too. Need to read tokens 1021-1221 snippet shows \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41)\". But parties? Might be same as earlier. Need to capture.\n\nAlso Order(001) might contain appeals? We haven't seen matches. But search earlier found 38 matches; 4 in Appellant's Motion, 6 in Docket, 5 in Order (001) +3 more docs. So Order(001) had 5 matches of \"appeal\". We need to read those matches. We haven't read Order(001). We should search again for \"notice of appeal\" in Order(001). But earlier step 10 search_document_regex of Order (001) found 0 matches. But maybe pattern \"appeal\" matched 5 times. We need to read those. So we should read Order(001) token ranges around those matches. We have partial coverage of Order(001) tokens 3140-3340, 4108-4308, 4435-4646, 6185-6385. Those may contain appeals. We need to identify matches for \"appeal\" within Order(001). But we need to know token ranges. We could search again for \"appeal\" in Order(001) to get context. Let's do search_document_regex for Order(001) pattern \"(?i)appeal\". That will give matches. Then read each.\n\nAlso need to read Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief etc if they have appeals. But maybe none. But we should search for \"notice of appeal\" or \"appeal\" across all unvisited docs.\n\nWe currently have 1 value extracted. We need to gather all distinct appeals. Likely many. Best is to search for \"notice of appeal\" in all documents to get matches, then read each. But we already did search_document_regex on all docs for \"notice of appeal\" and got 7 matches. But that may not capture all, because some documents may have \"appeal\" but not \"notice of appeal\". The requirement is \"Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court.\" So we need to capture all appeals. So we should search for \"appeal\" pattern. But the earlier search found 38 matches across all documents. But we need to read many matches. We need to avoid re-reading same tokens. We should read the matches for \"appeal\" and then extract parties and court.\n\nBut reading 38 matches may be many. But we should do incremental. We can read one match at a time. We need to decide next action. The next action could be search_document_regex again to get matches for \"appeal\" in Order(001) and other documents. But we already have matches for all docs. But we need to read those contexts. We need to read the matches for Docket, Order(002), Order(003), Order(001). We also have partial coverage for Docket. So we should read the remaining matches in Docket that we haven't fully captured.\n\nLet's check Docket: we have matches 1-3. We need to read each. We have read 2913-3298 (covers match 1 partly). We have read 3537-4000 (covers matches 2-3 partly). But we need to read the specific ranges for each match to capture parties and court. We can read token ranges: match 1 tokens 2913-3113; we have seen 2913-3298 which covers it. But we should read 2913-3113 specifically to capture the text. But we have read that earlier partially. We might need to confirm parties names. The snippet shows \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" That lists parties. Court: likely \"U.S. Court of International Trade\" (CIT). So we need to capture that. But we need to confirm court. The snippet does not mention the court explicitly, but earlier docket entry mentions \"the Court of International Trade\" in earlier context. The docket entry might be about the order transferring jurisdiction to CIT. So the appeal is to CIT. We might need to capture that. But we need to find the court in the context. The match snippet didn't show court. But maybe earlier part of docket has the court. But we might need to read the Docket entry around 3030 tokens where the court is indicated. But we can approximate that the appellate court is \"United States Court of International Trade\".\n\nBut we need evidence: text snippet must include the court. The snippet we have doesn't. So we might need to read the docket entry around the transfer of jurisdiction to CIT. That may be earlier in the docket. Let's search for \"Court of International Trade\" in Docket. But we don't have a function to search across all docs for that phrase? We can use search_document_regex for Docket pattern \"Court of International Trade\". Let's do that. Then read the context. That will give the court. But we need to combine with parties from the notice of appeal snippet.\n\nBut we can also read the docket entry for the transfer and the notice of appeal in same token range maybe. The docket entry 2913-3113 might include the transfer. But we need to read 2913-3300 maybe. But we already have 2913-3298. That includes the notice of appeal. It may include earlier reference to CIT. But earlier snippet didn't show it. But maybe earlier lines before 2913 contain the court. The token range 2913-3298 might start before the notice of appeal. Let's read 2800-3300 to capture the context: but we only have 2800-3300. Let's do read_document for Docket tokens 2800-3300. That is within 10k limit. That will capture the docket entry with the court. Then we can parse parties and court.\n\nAlso we need to read Order(001) matches. Let's search for \"appeal\" in Order(001). Use search_document_regex with pattern \"(?i)appeal\" in Order (001). That will give top matches. Then read each.\n\nAlso read Order(003) matches. But we may not need to read all; maybe we can read the tokens 1021-1221 snippet we already saw. But we need evidence for parties. That snippet didn't show parties. But maybe earlier in Order(003) the parties are listed. Let's read tokens 1000-1300. That includes the snippet. Let's do that.\n\nAlso read Order(002) tokens maybe 70-271 already read. That snippet had parties. But we need evidence for court. That snippet didn't show court. But earlier part of Order(002) may mention court. Let's read tokens 0-200 maybe. But we already read 70-857. That includes the order. The snippet includes \"United States Court of International Trade\" earlier. Actually the snippet shows \"the Court granted Defendants’ motion to transfer this matter to the United States Court of International Trade.\" So that shows the court. So the appeal is to CIT. Thus evidence can be that snippet.\n\nThus we need to extract for each appeal: parties and court.\n\nWe need to identify distinct appeals. They are probably:\n\n1. From Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule: maybe an appeal? But we have only 1 value from that motion. Let's see snippet from step 3: It had \"Appellants seek relief ... Appellants ask the Court for an immediate expedited ruling...\". That was not an appeal. Wait step 3 read first 200 tokens. That snippet didn't have an appeal. The append_checklist step 5 appended 1 value for Appeal. So that must have come from the motion. But the motion did not include an appeal. Maybe step 5 appended a value found elsewhere. But we don't know.\n\nBut we need to extract all distinct appeals. Let's search for \"appeal\" across Appellant's Motion. But we have read 0-775. That contains maybe an appeal? Let's search for \"appeal\" within that text. But we can assume there might be a notice of appeal at the end. But we didn't see. But we can search again. But let's consider that there is an appeal in Appellant's Motion: maybe an appeal to the U.S. Court of International Trade. But we need evidence.\n\nBetter to search for \"appeal\" in Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule. Use search_document_regex on that doc. Then read each.\n\nAlso search for \"appeal\" in Complaint and Briefs. But many documents may have it. But we can gradually extract.\n\nGiven time, we should read next. I propose next action: search_document_regex on Order (001) for \"appeal\". Then read those matches. Then extract appeals.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Order (001)\", pattern \"(?i)appeal\". That will give top matches. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order (001)\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)appeal\",\"flags\":[],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (001)", "pattern": "(?i)appeal", "flags": [], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5233, "completion_tokens": 2621, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We need to extract all distinct values. We have only 1 so far. We need to find all appeals in the corpus. We have search results from earlier: many matches for \"appeal\" and \"notice of appeal\". We need to extract distinct values of Appeal: \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\".\n\nWe saw matches in the Docket: Notice of Appeal by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda, Jonathan, Susan. The appellate court: U.S. Court of International Trade? We need to parse. In Docket match 1: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. Filing fee $ 605, receipt number BMTDC-3471717. (Tranel, Monica) (Entered: 04/25/2025)\". It doesn't explicitly state appellate court, but likely US Court of International Trade? The docket likely indicates the appellate court. We might need to read further.\n\nAlso Order (002) shows plaintiffs filed notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction to the United States Court of International Trade. So appellate court is US Court of International Trade.\n\nAlso Order (001) matches mention of \"USCA Case Number 25-2717\". That may be US Court of Appeals? But the appeals are to US Court of International Trade. Some matches mention \"USCA\" maybe U.S. Court of Appeals? But we need to find the appellate court names.\n\nAlso there were matches in Order (001) for \"appeal\", but we didn't see any specific appellate court names. We may need to search for \"Court of International Trade\" or \"U.S. Court of International Trade\" phrase. But we only need to extract distinct Appeal items. Each Appeal item is \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\". So we need to gather all distinct parties and courts.\n\nFrom Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule: The motion says \"Appellants seek relief...\" but that's the motion. But earlier we saw in Step 3, we appended 1 value for Appeal from Appellant's Motion. That value likely was \"Appeal: Appellants appealed to ???\" Actually let's inspect the appended value. We don't have content of Append. But we need to find all distinct appeals. We have at least 1 from Appellant's Motion. Which parties? Appellants (plural). Court? Not specified.\n\nWe need to find all others: In docket, we have a notice of appeal by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. Court? Likely US Court of International Trade. In Order (002), plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction to the United States Court of International Trade. Plaintiffs parties: likely the same as above? The plaintiffs are the same parties: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber? Actually earlier the plaintiffs listed as \"Plaintiffs\" maybe the same names. So we could produce appeal: \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\" But we need to list parties.\n\nAlso Order (003) maybe has \"Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41)\". But no parties listed.\n\nAlso Order (001) maybe has notice of appeal by certain parties, but no parties listed.\n\nWe need to examine the docket to see parties for each notice of appeal. The docket match shows \"by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" So parties are these four.\n\nAlso the plaintiffs in Order (002) likely same four. So we might need to produce multiple entries: one for the parties and court. Also from the Appellant's Motion, parties: Appellants (maybe same four). But the appellate court not specified. Might need to find the appellate court for that motion. Might be US Court of International Trade? The motion is for expedited briefing schedule, but the appeal might be in the same docket? The Appellant's Motion is a pleading in the same case. The parties are the same. The appellate court is likely US Court of International Trade.\n\nWe need to gather all distinct values. Let's search for \"United States Court of International Trade\" across documents. Also \"US Court of International Trade\".\n\nAnd \"U.S. Court of Appeals\" maybe.\n\nAlso \"Court of International Trade\" appears.\n\nSearch in all documents: pattern \"Court of International Trade\". That will give matches. We'll then parse the parties. Then produce distinct appeal entries.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern \"Court of International Trade\".

Currently we have 1 value from Appellant's Motion and 1 from Docket. But maybe more appeals exist elsewhere. Need to find all distinct appeals: from various documents: Docket, Order (001), Order (002), Order (003), etc. We should search for \"notice of appeal\" or \"appeal\" string patterns. We already did regex search. But maybe there are other appeals in Complaint, Amended Complaint, etc. The complaint might mention appeals? Usually complaint may mention appellate review? Might mention \"appeal\" in context of \"with the request for appeal to the Court of International Trade\". Might also mention \"appeal\" in other documents.\n\nBut we have already appended 1 value from Appellant's Motion and 1 from Docket. But there may be more appeals from other documents such as Order (002), Order (003), etc. Let's examine the snippet from Order (002) earlier: It says \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction\". So that's an appeal. Also Order (003) has \"Plaintiffs seek reconsideration...\". That might not be an appeal. But \"notice of appeal\" is mentioned in Order (001) and other orders. Let's search for \"notice of appeal\" again across all documents. We already searched all. The results show matches in Docket, Order (002), Order (003). We have in Docket: 3 matches. In Order (002): 3 matches. In Order (003): 1 match. So we have at least 4 distinct notices of appeal. But we might have duplicate content? For each match, the parties and the court are the same: plaintiffs vs US Dept. But we need to list distinct values. They might be repeated across documents but we should only capture each unique appeal once.\n\nThe format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]'. We need to capture parties and appellate court. For each notice of appeal, parties are plaintiffs (list names). Court: United States Court of International Trade. Possibly also Court of International Trade. So we need to build entries like \"Appeal: Plaintiffs (Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief) appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\" or similar.\n\nBut we need to confirm parties from each notice. In Docket match 1 snippet: shows \"Defendants' Motion to Stay ...\", then later \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. Filing fee $ 605...\". That indicates the appeal parties: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. The court: not shown but likely the US Court of International Trade (since docket entry is for USCA case). So we can extract.\n\nBut also other matches in Docket: \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\" So same parties. So same appeal, but maybe different docket numbers. So we only need one entry.\n\nSimilarly, Order (002) match shows \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction “as well as all prior orders and decisions that merge into that Order.”\". The parties: Plaintiffs are Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief. Court: US Court of International Trade. So same.\n\nOrder (003) match: \"Plaintiffs seek reconsideration of the Court’s Order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) and Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4)(A).\" That is not a notice of appeal but a motion for reconsideration. So not an appeal. So we ignore.\n\nWe also have Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule which says \"Appellants seek relief from the immediate and ongoing harm...\". That might not include a notice of appeal. But earlier at step 5 we appended 1 value for Appeal from this document. Let's check: In that document, maybe there's a line \"Appellants file a notice of appeal...\" But we didn't read it. The value might be from earlier search. We need to read the relevant part to confirm.\n\nWe should read the Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule again near the notice of appeal. The snippet in step 11 earlier didn't include that. Likely the motion includes a notice of appeal. Let's search within that document for \"notice of appeal\".

Also appears in Docket: \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\" That indicates appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals (USCA). Also Order (002) has notice of appeal. Need to extract all distinct appeals: Parties and court.\n\nWe need to parse text for each appeal. Let's read more of Docket around the notice of appeal. We have seen some matches but need to capture all. The Docket has 3 matches of notice of appeal. We need the parties and court. For Docket, we saw \"Notice of Appeal as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" That indicates parties: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. Court likely U.S. Court of International Trade, but the notice of appeal might be to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit? Actually the notice of appeal is to the U.S. Court of International Trade? Wait, the notice of appeal is typically filed with the appellate court. In this case, the notice of appeal is of the order transferring jurisdiction to CIT; that order is in the district court. The appellate court is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or perhaps the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (USCA). But the notice of appeal was filed with USCA (the docket shows USCA case number). So the appellate court: U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (USCA).\n\nAlso Order (002) references notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction: \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction “as well as all prior orders and decisions that merge into that Order.” (Doc. 41.)\" That refers to the same notice of appeal. The parties again are Plaintiffs: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief. Court: U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (USCA). Also possibly Order (001) has notice of appeal? Let's check Order (001) matches. It had no notice of appeal, but maybe earlier. Search for \"notice of appeal\" in Order (001). Step 12 had no matches. Step 13 had matches but not \"notice of appeal\". Step 14 no mention. So Order (001) likely doesn't have notice of appeal. Order (003) might have notice of appeal? Search. Step 14 had no matches for \"notice of appeal\" in Order (003). But maybe earlier. Need to search again for \"notice of appeal\" in Order (003). Also maybe \"Notice of Appeal\" appears. Let's search again entire corpus.

Currently extracted 1 value from Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule, 1 from Docket. But likely missing others: various notice of appeal references in Docket, Order (002), Order (003), maybe others.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct appeals: each value format 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]'.\n\nWe have evidence: There are multiple notice of appeal documents with parties: likely Plaintiffs (Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief) appealed to US Court of International Trade (CIT). Also maybe other appeals: maybe order to transfer to CIT etc. Also maybe appeals to other courts? We need to search for 'appeal' lines.\n\nWe need to look at Docket's matches: match 1 shows Notice of Appeal as to 40 Terminate Deadlines ... by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. So parties: those four. Court: which court? The docket entry is in the United States District Court (likely). But the appeal is to the US Court of International Trade? Actually the notice of appeal is filed to the US Court of International Trade? Let's read context. The docket entry: it says \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,, ... by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" That docket entry is in the Docket, but the appeal is likely to the US Court of International Trade? Actually the order that was appealed was the order transferring jurisdiction to the US Court of International Trade. So the appeal is to the US Court of International Trade? Wait, the order was in the district court; the appeal is to the US Court of International Trade? The docket entry shows \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings...\". The order number 40 is the order transferring jurisdiction to the US Court of International Trade. The notice of appeal is filed to the US Court of International Trade presumably. But the docket entry is recorded in the district court docket. The parties: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. Court: US Court of International Trade.\n\nAlso Order (002) has notice of appeal: \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction 'as well as all prior orders...' (Doc. 41.)\" The parties there: Plaintiffs: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief. Court: US Court of International Trade (the order was transferred to that court). So similar.\n\nAlso Order (003) mentions \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41)\". Same parties and court.\n\nAlso maybe there is a notice of appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit? Not sure.\n\nLook at the docket entry: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" That is a notice of appeal to the US Court of International Trade.\n\nAdditionally, there may be a \"Notice of Appeal\" earlier, like \"Case 4:25-cv-00026-DLC\" etc. But we need to find all distinct appeals: maybe multiple notices for the same parties and same court but maybe different orders? However the format wants distinct values.\n\nWe probably need to extract at least these: Appeal: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\n\nAlso maybe an appeal from the US Court of International Trade to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit? Not indicated.\n\nLook at Docket: The docket match 1 tokens 2913-3113 shows the notice of appeal with parties. That likely references the same.\n\nWe also have Docket match 3 tokens 3782-3982 similar. We need to verify context if the appeal is to US Court of International Trade. The docket entry shows \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings... filing fee ...\". It does not explicitly say to which court the appeal is filed. But the order 40 was the order transferring jurisdiction to the US Court of International Trade. The appeal would be to the US Court of International Trade? Actually the order was the initial order, and the appeal is filed in the US Court of International Trade. The docket entry likely is in the district court docket but the appeal is filed to the US Court of International Trade.\n\nWe need to capture the appeal parties and court. The party list we have. The court is likely United States Court of International Trade (CIT). We need evidence snippet showing that parties and court. The snippet from Docket match 1 includes the parties but not the court. But we can combine evidence from Order (002) match 1 which says \"Plaintiffs ... filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction 'as well as all prior orders and decisions that merge into that Order.' (Doc. 41.)\" The order transferring jurisdiction to the United States Court of International Trade. So the appeal is to CIT. So we can use that.\n\nWe need to ensure no other appeals. The Docket has earlier matches? Let's check the docket match 1 tokens 2913-3113. That snippet includes the parties and the notice of appeal. It doesn't include the court, but we can reference the earlier order that transferred jurisdiction to CIT. That is in the same docket. But maybe that is enough.\n\nAlso maybe the order \"Notice of Appeal as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings\" is the same as the order \"notice of appeal\" we captured. So likely only one distinct appeal.\n\nBut we also have the \"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\" having a notice of appeal? Actually the appended value from Step 5 maybe from the motion. Let's check that: The motion maybe includes a notice of appeal? But Step 5 says appended 1 value for Appeal. So that must be from the motion. Let's locate that. The motion likely includes a notice of appeal too. But we need to combine. Let's search the motion for 'notice of appeal'. We already did and found 0 matches. So maybe the motion had the appeal but not captured. Let's search for 'notice' in motion. But Step 5 appended 1 value. We need to see what that value was. But we don't know. But we need to ensure we capture all. So we need to find all appeals: maybe there are multiple appeals: one from plaintiffs to CIT, maybe another from plaintiffs to higher court? But likely just one.\n\nBut we need to read the Docket, Order (002), Order (003) to confirm. Let's read the docket portion that references the notice of appeal. The match 1 tokens 2913-3113 shows the parties and the notice. The court is not stated, but we can use evidence from Order (002) where the order transferring jurisdiction to CIT is described. That is the order being appealed. So the appeal is to CIT.\n\nThus we need to append at least one value: \"Appeal: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\" Also maybe an appeal in the docket with parties: \"David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber\" appears again. So it's same appeal.\n\nBut maybe there are multiple appeals with same parties but different courts? Let's search for \"Court of Appeals\". There's mention of Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Order (001) references. But no notice of appeal to that court.\n\nThus just one distinct appeal.\n\nBut we must check if we already captured an appeal from the motion. That might be the same as above. So we need to ensure we have all distinct values. We have 1 from motion, 1 from docket. But those might be same. But we need to confirm if the motion's appeal is different: maybe the motion's appeal is to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit? Let's search the motion again. Search for \"appeal to\" didn't find. But maybe the motion includes \"appeal\" but not \"notice of appeal\". Let's search for \"appeal\" in motion. We did earlier and found 4 matches in the motion. But the snippet might not include the parties. Let's search the motion for \"appeal\" again in a broader context. Let's read the motion from 0-2000 maybe. But we have viewed 0-775. We need to read further. Let's read from 775-1500.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule\",\"start_token\":775,\"end_token\":1500}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule", "start_token": 775, "end_token": 1500}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10320, "completion_tokens": 1897, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have already extracted 1 value from Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule and 1 from Docket. But we need to find all distinct appeals from all documents. We have not examined the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, First Amended Complaint, Brief in Support of Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction, Brief in Support of Motion to Intervene by Montana Farmers Union. Also potentially other orders might have appeals. We need to search for \"notice of appeal\" or \"appeal\" etc. We have search results earlier but they might not have extracted all. But we need to read more tokens to capture all appeals.\n\nWe have partial coverage of many documents but not all. We need to search for \"notice of appeal\" across remaining unvisited documents: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (19,849 tokens), First Amended Complaint (22,696 tokens), Brief in Support of Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction (13,379 tokens), Brief in Support of Motion to Intervene by Montana Farmers Union (575 tokens). Also maybe Order (004) but we have coverage.\n\nWe also might need to extract appeals from Order (004) if any. We have 0-421 coverage, but not sure.\n\nWe need to find all appeals. The pattern \"notice of appeal\" appears in Docket, Order (002), Order (003). Might also appear in the Complaint documents.\n\nWe should search across all documents for \"notice of appeal\". Use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern \"(?i)notice of appeal\". That will return matches across all documents. Then we can read the matches to confirm. But we have already searched earlier and found 7 total matches. Those were in Docket, Order (002), Order (003) only. It didn't find in the other docs. But maybe there are more that weren't captured because the regex didn't match; but \"notice of appeal\" presumably appears only there. But we need to extract all appeals. We have extracted 2 values: one from Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule (the appendix? we didn't see the content). Wait earlier Step 5: append_checklist (Appeal) → successfully appended 1 value for 1 key: Appeal. That was from the Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule. We need to see what that entry was. But we don't have the text. Probably \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of International Trade.\" But we don't have evidence.\n\nWe should read the part of the Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule that contains the appeal info. Search for \"notice of appeal\" but we didn't find. Maybe the appeal info is in the docket. The docket has a \"notice of appeal\" entry. We need to extract the parties and the appellate court.\n\nWe also need to extract the appeal from the docket: \"Notice of Appeal as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings, ... by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" The appellate court: USCA? The docket entry says \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, ...\". It doesn't specify the court? The docket entry might mention \"USCA\" earlier. The docket entry shows \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\" So the appellate court: USCA (United States Court of Appeals?). The docket entry also might say \"Filed by ...\".\n\nAlso Order (002) includes notice of appeal: \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction 'as well as all prior orders...' (Doc. 41.)\" But we need the parties and court. That one presumably is also to the USCA. The appellate court is likely the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit? Actually USCA stands for United States Court of Appeals? Might be the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. But we should use the text: \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\" So parties: Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief. Court: USCA.\n\nSimilarly Order (003) includes a notice of appeal: \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41)\". Not specifying parties? Might be same parties. But we need to find the actual text.\n\nWe need to read the docket entry tokens 411-? to capture full. We have read 2913-3298, 3537-4000, but not the full entry. We should read tokens around 3000-4000 to capture the full notice of appeal entry. Let's read more tokens from Docket starting at 3000 to 3600. That will include the notice of appeal entry.

Already extracted 1 value? Wait: Current status says Keys with Values: 1/1. But we probably need all distinct values. The snapshot says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning we have 1 extracted value? But we need all distinct appeal values. The prior actions: Step 5 appended 1 value. Step 5 appended 1 value for Appeal. That was likely from Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule. We also have Docket with notice of appeal lines. But maybe not appended yet. So we need to extract all distinct appeals: from Appellant's Motion, and from Docket. There might also be in Order documents? But we need to extract every distinct value. So we need to find all instances of appeals. Already have some from Docket. We need to read more of Docket to capture all. The Docket has multiple entries for notice of appeal lines. We might need to read more tokens in Docket to see all appeals. We currently have Docket partially visited tokens 1182-1461, 1482-2004, 2913-4000. We saw some notice of appeal entries at 3000-3600 list. But there might be more earlier. We should read from Docket tokens 0-1182 to see earlier entries. Also maybe from 2004-2900. But we have 2913-4000 which covers many. We may need to read from 0-1182 to capture earliest appeals. Let's read from 0-1200. Or read 0-1000. We'll read 0-1200. Also we may need to read from 2004-2900. But maybe we can search for \"notice of appeal\" again. But we already searched; we saw 3 matches in Docket. But those may not cover all? The search returned 3 matches earlier in Docket: the 3 matches described. We saw them in the search results earlier. Those include the ones at 2913-3113, 3730-3930, 3782-3982. Also earlier match at tokens 2813-... Wait search result step 17 shows 3 matches. So there are 3 notice of appeal entries. We captured at least 1. We need to extract all. We need to read those matches to extract parties and court. The matches show parties and maybe court. For each match we have text: e.g., in match 1: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" The court likely is U.S. Court of International Trade. The text of match 1 includes \"by ...\". Also match 2: similar. The party list same? Might also include \"by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" Possibly same parties. But maybe different case numbers. We need distinct values: each appeal includes parties and court. So we have at least 3 separate appeals in Docket with same parties but maybe different cases. They are distinct? The value includes parties and court. Since the parties same, but maybe case number difference? But format requires \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\". So if same parties, we could have duplicate value. But distinct values: maybe we need separate entries for each distinct appeal. The parties same but maybe the case number is part of \"appealed to [court]\"? The format doesn't include case number. So duplicate would be same value. But we may need to list each distinct appeal instance. If identical parties and same court, we might consider it duplicate, but maybe we need separate? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct value means unique string. So same string duplicates not needed. So we have 1 distinct appeal value: \"David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to U.S. Court of International Trade.\" But maybe we also have appeal from Order documents? Let's check Order (001) or Order (002). Search earlier: Step 8 search for \"appeal to\" found none. But there may be \"appeal to\" in Order (002) maybe. Let's search again. But we can read Order (002) tokens 0-200 to see if there's appeal. But we already read 50-1092. That might contain appeal. Let's read 0-200. Also check Order (001) maybe has appeals. But we might rely on search again. Let's search for \"(?i)notice of appeal\" in Order (002). But we already saw matches. But we need to read those matches to confirm. But we know parties and court. So we can add one value. But we need to confirm that the court is indeed U.S. Court of International Trade. The Docket matches show \"Court of International Trade\" in earlier tokens? In match 1 tokens 2913-3113, we saw \"court of International Trade\" earlier. For match 1, the text includes \"court of International Trade\" earlier in the line. So evidence includes that. So we can extract.\n\nAlso there may be appeal in Order (003) or Order (002) referencing \"Notice of Appeal\". But the parties might differ. Let's search for \"Notice of Appeal\" in Order (003). But we saw match at 1021-1221; that includes \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41)\". Parties are Plaintiffs: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. So same parties. So again same value.\n\nAlso maybe other orders have appeals. But we likely have same parties and same court. So distinct value is one. But we also had Appellant's Motion for Expedited Briefing Schedule maybe includes appeal? But we appended a value from that. That value may be same parties? Let's check. We didn't read that earlier. But maybe the motion includes \"Notice of Appeal\" referencing same parties. So same value. So we only need one unique value.\n\nBut we need to verify that the parties list from Appellant's Motion is same? We didn't read that text. Let's read Appellant's Motion tokens 0-200 earlier. It might mention \"Notice of Appeal\" but didn't capture parties. Let's search within that document for \"Notice of Appeal\". Already did search and found 0 matches. So maybe the motion didn't include appeal. But Step 5 appended a value for Appeal from that motion. So maybe the motion includes \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\" maybe earlier. But we didn't capture. But we should verify. We can read more of the motion to find the appeal. But we didn't view entire doc? It was fully visited (0-786). So the motion was fully read earlier; step 5 appended 1 value. So we have 1 value.\n\nNow we need to check if there are any other appeals in other documents. Search again for \"notice of appeal\" in Complaint. Maybe not. But we haven't searched. But we might not need to search all documents; but to be thorough, we could search all documents again for \"notice of appeal\". But we already did search earlier and found 7 matches in all documents, 3 in Docket, 3 in Order (002), 1 in Order (003). So we have all matches. We have extracted from Docket. We might also need to extract from Order (002) and Order (003). But they likely same parties. But we should confirm. We already saw Order (002) match 1 includes parties list same. Order (003) match includes same parties. So no new distinct values. So we can stop with 1 value.\n\nBut we need to check if any other documents had appeal. Search for \"appeal\" in Complaint maybe. But we can search again. But we can rely on search results: 7 matches total. All found. So we have all appeals.\n\nThus the checklist item \"Appeal\" has only one unique value: \"David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to U.S. Court of International Trade.\" We need to provide evidence: text snippet, document, location. We need to gather evidence for that value from Docket or Order. We have evidence snippet from Docket match 1. Also we have snippet from Order (002). We can use any. Provide one evidence. Use Docket tokens 2913-3113 snippet: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" Also earlier part: \"court of International Trade.\" That could be same.\n\nWe need to provide location: maybe page or docket entry. Provide location string like \"Docket, entry 41\". Provide source_document: Docket.\n\nThus we need to update the checklist to contain the extracted value. Currently we have 1 value. But we need to verify if it's correct. It might be duplicate. The value already extracted might be same. But we need to confirm that the value extracted earlier matches this. But we don't know the earlier extracted value. But we can update to ensure it's correct and complete. We might want to update the checklist with the correct value and evidence.\n\nBut we cannot know what the earlier extracted value was. But we can choose to update the value to ensure correct one. Since we have evidence, we should call update_checklist for key Appeal with new extracted list (single entry). If the earlier entry had same value, update will replace with same list. That is fine.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist with key Appeal, extracted list containing one entry with evidence snippet.\n\nWe need to provide evidence array: each evidence has text, source_document, location. Provide snippet: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" And location: maybe \"Entry 41\" or \"Docket, tokens 2913-3113\".

Need to check if any other appeals exist. The search regex earlier found mention of appeals in other documents: Order (002) and Order (003) also mention notice of appeal. We may need to extract appeal details from those orders. Also maybe the complaint or amended complaint might contain appeals? The search earlier for \"notice of appeal\" in Order (001) found 0 matches. Order (002) had matches. The earlier step 17 search results included matches for Order (002) and Order (003) with notices of appeal. The extracted value only from Docket. So missing appeals from Order (002) and Order (003). Also maybe from other docs.\n\nWe need to extract all distinct appeals. So we need to read the relevant portions of Order (002) and Order (003) to capture the appeal parties and court. Also maybe Order (001) might have appeals but earlier search found 0 matches; but we might still search again for \"notice of appeal\" to confirm. But likely not.\n\nAlso check Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, but not sure.\n\nThus next action should be to read Order (002) or Order (003). Already we have Order (002) fully visited (95% coverage). We have seen the notice of appeal content in the earlier match. We need to get evidence: the parties and court. The court is U.S. Court of International Trade. The parties: Plaintiffs: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. This is similar to Docket. We should capture from Order (002). We need to read specific tokens containing the notice of appeal. We might use read_document on Order (002) for the tokens around the match. We saw tokens 71-271 with the notice of appeal. That includes the parties. We need to confirm. The earlier snippet shows \"Plaintiffs, ... on April 25, 2025, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to transfer... Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction...\". It doesn't list parties in that snippet. But earlier docket had parties. But we need to include parties. We might need to read further tokens where the notice of appeal is described with parties. The docket had parties. Order (002) may not list parties explicitly. But we can still extract the appeal parties: the plaintiffs listed maybe earlier. But the parties may be the same as docket. We could use the docket evidence. But to avoid duplication, we need to capture unique values. The docket already captured the appeal parties. But is that unique? It includes the same parties. So we might not need to add a duplicate. But we may add a separate entry for the appeal from Order (002) with same parties. But duplication is okay? The requirement: Extract EVERY distinct value. If the value is identical, it's not distinct. So we should not duplicate identical string. So we only need to extract distinct appeal strings. The docket one is \"Appeal: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to U.S. Court of International Trade.\" That matches Order (002). So no need to add.\n\nBut maybe Order (002) has a different appeal: maybe plaintiffs filed notice of appeal \"as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings...\". That's same. So duplicate.\n\nWhat about Order (003)? The notice of appeal there appears as \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41) and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal (Doc. 42).\" It doesn't list parties. So parties are same as docket. No new.\n\nThus maybe no additional appeals beyond the one extracted. But we should confirm if any other documents contain appeals: maybe Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief or the amended complaint. Could search for \"notice of appeal\" again in those. But we didn't search. Let's perform search_document_regex on the remaining unvisited docs: Complaint for Declaratory..., First Amended Complaint, Brief in Support of Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction, Brief in Support of Motion to Intervene by Montana Farmers Union. But likely they don't contain appeals.\n\nBut to be thorough, we should search one of them for \"notice of appeal\". We can search in \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". Let's do search_document_regex on that doc with pattern \"notice of appeal\". Use default top_k 5. That will give matches. If none, then no more.

Let's search for \"notice of appeal\" again in Order (001). We had earlier search results showing 5 matches. Might contain other appeals or maybe the same. Let's read a bit.\n\nWe have read tokens 3140-3527, 4108-4308, 4435-4646, 6185-6385. None may cover notice of appeal. But maybe earlier tokens 67-434? We have not read that.

But we need to confirm if there's a notice of appeal. We can search for \"notice of appeal\" again in Order (001). But we already did search and found 5 matches but didn't read them. We need to read at least one match to capture potential appeal. Let's read around token 70-300 again. We already had tokens 70-300 earlier? We did read 70-300 and saw the notice of appeal. That included the parties list: \"Pl plaintiffs, v. U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security; Kristi Noem; The United States of America, Defendants. On April 25, 2025, Court granted ... Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction...\".\n\nThus we already captured the parties. But we need to confirm that the appellate court is the United States Court of International Trade. The text says \"Court granted ... transferred to the United States Court of International Trade.\" So the appeal is to that court.\n\nThus we have at least one appeal entry: \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\" But we need to include parties: \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\" Or include parties list: \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\" The parties are Plaintiffs: list of names (maybe four names). The instruction says format as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So we need to produce a string like \"Appeal: Plaintiffs (Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief) appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\"\n\nWe should include the parties as the list of names. The parties from Docket and Order (002) same list.\n\nThus we need to append this entry. But we must ensure no duplicate. We already have one value from Docket. But the value may be same content. We need to check if the Docket value already includes parties. The earlier append step 5 appended 1 value for 1 key: Appeal. We don't know the exact content. Might be generic. But we need to ensure we have all distinct values. The Docket entry includes the parties and court. So maybe we have one value. But we need to verify if there is a second distinct appeal, perhaps from Order (001) or others. But maybe only one. But we have to extract all distinct values. If duplicate, not add.\n\nThus we should read Order (001) to see if there's another appeal. Let's search for \"notice of appeal\" in Order (001) again but we need to read context. We have matches but didn't read. Let's read the first match near tokens 70-300. That might be the same. But we can read it again to confirm. It's already read 70-300. That includes the notice. So same as before. So not a new distinct appeal.\n\nThus we probably have only one appeal. But we might need to check if any other documents have appeals. Search results earlier indicated Order (002) had notice of appeal. Order (001) had maybe some mention but likely same. But there could be other appeals in other documents like \"Order (003)\" etc. But we didn't search those. We might need to search for \"notice of appeal\" in all documents again to confirm. But we did earlier search in all documents and matched only those. But we didn't search Order (003). But earlier search on all documents for \"(?i)notice of appeal\" produced 7 matches: 3 in Docket, 3 in Order (002), 1 in Order (003). Wait earlier step 6 indicated 7 matches: 3 in Docket, 3 in Order (002), 1 in Order (003). So there is a notice of appeal in Order (003). We haven't read Order (003). We need to read that to capture any appeal.\n\nThus we need to read Order (003) around the match. We have partial view of Order (003) tokens: 78-278, 1021-1305, 1702-1919, 4063-4263, 5485-5691, 5766-5966, 6354-6554. We need to locate the match. But we don't know token numbers. We need to search again. Let's perform a search for \"(?i)notice of appeal\" on Order (003). Use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Order (003)\". Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order (003)\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)notice of appeal\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (003)", "pattern": "(?i)notice of appeal", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6542, "completion_tokens": 1486, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Currently only 1 value extracted from Docket. We need to find all other appeals in documents. Search for \"notice of appeal\" in other docs. Already did many searches. But maybe missed appeals in other documents like Order (001), Order (002), Order (003), etc. Also check other docs not yet visited: Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Briefs. Might contain appeal notices. We need to parse each.\n\nWe have current coverage: Docket partially visited with token ranges 2913-4000 covering notice of appeal entries. That might contain multiple appeals. We need to examine that region. Did Step 27 show matches: 3 matches in Docket, each with notice of appeal and parties. We saw match 1: \"41 | 2025-04-25 | NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" That's one appeal. We need to extract all distinct appeals. So we need to parse each of the 3 matches.\n\nAlso Order (002) had notice of appeal by Plaintiffs (plural). That is another appeal. Also Order (003) had notice of appeal by Plaintiffs. Also Order (001) didn't have notice of appeal? It had no matches earlier.\n\nAlso Docket had maybe multiple appeals to CIT? Let's parse.\n\nWe need to produce entries like \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\". For each distinct appeal. We need evidence.\n\nWe need to read more of Docket beyond 4000? Already have 2913-4000. That covers 3 matches at 2913-3113, 3730-3930, 3782-3982. They overlap? The second and third matches overlap. We should read that region fully to extract parties and court. The court is \"U.S. Court of International Trade\" or \"Court of International Trade\" (CIT). But we must confirm.\n\nAlso Order (002) had a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction to the United States Court of International Trade. So that appeal is to the U.S. Court of International Trade.\n\nAlso Order (003) had notice of appeal (Doc. 41) but not specifying court? Likely same CIT. We need to read.\n\nAlso there may be appeals in other docs.\n\nLet's search for \"notice of appeal\" in other docs: we already did for Order (001), Order (002), Docket, Order (003). For Order (004) maybe none. For other docs maybe none. But we can search.\n\nWe should read more token ranges for Docket beyond 4000 to see if there are more appeals. But the coverage 2913-4000 is 1000 tokens. Might include all.\n\nWe should also read Order (002) full to get parties and court. Already partially visited 50-1092 but we need to capture the parties: \"Plaintiffs\" maybe. The text: \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction “as well as all prior orders and decisions that merge into that Order.”\" So parties: Plaintiffs. The parties are likely the same as the case: \"Plaintiffs: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" But the text doesn't list them. Might be in docket. But we can record parties as \"Plaintiffs\" only? But requirement: \"appealing party/parties.\" Should include names if available. The docket gave names. For Order (002), we might not have names in the excerpt. But we could check the docket entry for the notice of appeal in Docket; that gives names. So we can use that.\n\nThus we need distinct appeals:\n\nAppeal 1: Plaintiffs (David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber) appealed to U.S. Court of International Trade. (From Docket match 1)\n\nAppeal 2: Plaintiffs (same parties?) filed notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction (to CIT). Possibly same parties. But we might treat as separate appeal? But likely same appeal. The docket might have two entries for the same appeal? In Docket, we see \"41 | 2025-04-25 | NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" That's the appeal docket entry. Then \"51 | 2025-04-29 | USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\" That seems the same appeal. So only one distinct appeal.\n\nAlso Docket has \"52 | 2025-05-02 | ORDER of USCA as to 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief.\" That's the same appeal.\n\nThus only one appeal? But maybe there are more appeals in other documents.\n\nCheck Order (003) notice of appeal. That might be same appeal? Let's read the excerpt from Order (003). It says \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41) and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal (Doc. 42).\" So same Doc. 41. So same appeal.\n\nThus maybe only one appeal. But the requirement says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" That could be just one. But we need to ensure we didn't miss other appeals, like to other courts. Search for \"appeal to\" or \"appeal court\". We did earlier and found none.\n\nThus likely only one appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to U.S. Court of International Trade.\n\nBut we need to confirm parties. The parties are the four names. We should capture evidence from Docket and Order (002) or (003) for the parties. We already have evidence from Docket match 1: includes names. Also from Order (002) we might have \"Plaintiffs\" but not names. But we can use Docket for names.\n\nThus we need to append the extracted value for Appeal: \"Appeal: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\"\n\nWe need to include evidence: from Docket, tokens 2913-3113. Provide text snippet. Also maybe from Order (002) but not necessary.\n\nWe must check if there's any other appeal in other documents like Complaint, Amended Complaint, etc. They might not have appellate actions, as those are earlier.\n\nThus we can stop after adding the value.\n\nBut we must verify that we didn't miss any.\n\nLet's search for \"U.S. Court of International Trade\" in other docs. Already many matches. But we should search for \"Court of International Trade\" in other docs. But we only need appeals.\n\nWe should search for \"notice of appeal\" again but maybe we missed matches in Order (004) or Order (001) but earlier search found 0 matches. So no.\n\nThus we can append the single value.\n\nWe need to use append_checklist with key \"Appeal\". We must include evidence array with at least one evidence record.\n\nWe need to provide text snippet: maybe \"41 | 2025-04-25 | NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" Provide location: page number or token range. We can use location: \"Docket, tokens 2913-3113\". Provide source_document: \"Docket\".\n\nAlso maybe another evidence from Order (002) or (003) but not necessary.\n\nThus final action: append_checklist.\n\nLet's craft JSON.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Appeal\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Appeal: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"41 | 2025-04-25 | NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 2913-3113\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Appeal", "extracted": [{"value": "Appeal: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to United States Court of International Trade.", "evidence": [{"text": "41 | 2025-04-25 | NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 2913-3113"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6811, "completion_tokens": 1896, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Currently we have 2 values extracted? Actually from Docket, one value. Maybe also from Order (002) there is a notice of appeal, but we haven't extracted that. Also from Order (001) maybe no appeal. Check Order (002) excerpt shows plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction. But we need \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]\". In Order (002) the parties are Plaintiffs: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. Court: United States Court of International Trade. So we need that appeal entry. Also maybe other appeals? Search in docket shows Notice of Appeal for 41 by those parties. That is same parties. Also maybe Order (003) includes notice of appeal by plaintiffs? It says \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41)\". That could be same appeal. So maybe same parties. Also maybe other appeals in other documents not visited: Complaint documents? Likely not. So we need to extract at least one more distinct appeal value: same parties but maybe different case number? But the instruction \"distinct values\" meaning each unique appeal. The same parties and same court is same value; but maybe multiple filings? Could be considered distinct if different docket entry numbers. But likely we should list one value per distinct set of parties & court. So we already have one. We need to extract second? Actually we have 2 values extracted? It says Total Values Extracted: 2. But only one listing? Maybe the second is from Order (002) but not yet appended? The earlier append shows only one value. The total values 2 maybe from earlier append? We need to confirm. Let's search for \"Notice of Appeal\" in Order (002) again to confirm parties and court. The snippet from search shows \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction\". But parties not shown; but the docket entry might include parties.

We have two values extracted: from Docket. There may be another appeal in Order (002) or Order (003). Let's examine Order (002) match 1 snippet: It says Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction. But the parties? It lists Plaintiffs: David Mountain Chief etc. Actually match 1 shows \"Plaintiffs, v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Kristi Noem...\" but next line says Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order. That indicates a notice of appeal by Plaintiffs. So the appeal is by Plaintiffs (David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber) to the United States Court of International Trade. However that's same as Docket? The Docket shows notice of appeal by those same parties. But Order (002) might also mention the same appeal but maybe the parties are the same. But we might capture two distinct entries? We need distinct values. If identical, we shouldn't duplicate.\n\nBut Order (002) may also have another appeal: maybe the defendants? Let's search for \"notice of appeal\" in Order (002) context: It has match 1 and 2 but they are same. It mentions the same plaintiffs. So no new distinct value.\n\nCheck Order (003) match 1: It says Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41). But no parties listed explicitly. Might need to capture but parties likely same? But we may not have explicit parties; we can still capture: \"Appeal: Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to United States Court of International Trade.\" But that doesn't mention parties. The requirement: \"[parties] appealed to [court].\" If parties unknown, we might still capture but incomplete. But maybe we can extract from Order (003) match 1: \"Plaintiffs\" as parties. Provide evidence snippet. That would be distinct from the Docket value? Actually Docket value lists specific parties: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. Order (003) only says Plaintiffs. That's a different value. But is that distinct? It might be considered distinct because parties differ. So we should add this.\n\nBut maybe the parties are same but not explicitly listed. The Docket already captured specific parties. Order (003) doesn't list them. But we might still record \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\" That's still a distinct value.\n\nAlso Order (002) match 1 includes \"Plaintiffs, v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Kristi Noem...\" but that is the case. The notice of appeal is filed by Plaintiffs. So similar to Docket. But parties same. So we might skip duplication.\n\nNow check Docket: already captured. Also Order (002) contains \"Plaintiffs' notice of appeal\" but same parties.\n\nThus we have 2 distinct entries: one with parties list, one generic \"Plaintiffs\".\n\nWe need to append the second one.\n\nThus next action: append_checklist to add the second value for Appeal.\n\nWe need evidence: snippet from Order (003) match 1 tokens 1021-1221. Provide text snippet: \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41)\". Also mention the court: The snippet doesn't mention court but context earlier: \"United States Court of International Trade\" from earlier context? The snippet maybe includes that earlier. But we can include evidence that the appeal is to the United States Court of International Trade based on earlier context? In Order (003) snippet: \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41)\". It might not mention the court, but we can infer from earlier lines: \"United States Court of International Trade\" appears earlier in document. But we should find evidence of the court. Let's search within Order (003) for \"United States Court of International Trade\". The snippet earlier maybe before match 1? In match 1, preceding context includes \"United States, its agencies, or its officers ...\". Not sure.

So we need to search the remaining unvisited docs.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on remaining unvisited docs for \"(?i)notice of appeal\" maybe also \"appeal\". But we want to find any appeals. Could search all documents, but that might produce many matches, but fine. But we should limit to unvisited docs. We can search all docs; we'll get matches in Docket etc again but we already have. But we might get new matches in other docs.\n\nAlternatively, we could search specifically in Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. Let's do search_document_regex on \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" for \"(?i)notice of appeal\".

Order (002) also maybe. Order (003) has mention of appeal filed by plaintiffs. Also maybe the Docket has multiple appeals? The earlier extraction appended 1 value, but there were 2 values extracted from Docket. We need to ensure all appeals in corpus.\n\nWe need to search remaining documents for \"notice of appeal\" in other docs: Complaint, Amended Complaint, Briefs. But earlier search on those found none. But might be \"Appeal to\" or \"Appeal\" patterns. Let's search for \"appeal\" in remaining unvisited docs: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, First Amended Complaint, Briefs. Likely they may mention appeal in a brief. Let's search with regex \"notice of appeal\" or \"appeal\" in those docs.\n\nWe'll search all remaining unvisited docs for \"notice of appeal\".

That might find if any.\n\nBut earlier step 23 searched those and found none. So likely no notice of appeal in those docs. But maybe there are appeals in Order (001) or Order (004). We saw Order (001) matches for \"appeal\" patterns earlier but no notice of appeal. But maybe there is an appeal in Order (001) that is not a notice. Let's search for \"appeal\" in Order (001) maybe earlier. But we saw pattern for \"appeal\" found 5 matches. We didn't read those tokens. Need to read unviewed ranges in Order (001) to capture appeal details. We have viewed ranges 67-434, 2889-3089, 3140-3527, 4108-4308, 4435-4646, 6185-6385. Unviewed ranges: 0-66, 435-2888, 3528-4107, 4647-6184, 6386-6989. We should read portions that contain appeal texts. We saw earlier 5 matches for \"appeal\" but not read.\n\nAlso Order (004) maybe has appeal? Not sure. But we can search for \"notice of appeal\" in Order (004) maybe.\n\nAlso Order (003) may have appeal mention: In step 28 we saw mention of Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41). But that was added value? The extracted value from Docket includes Appeal by David Mountain Chief, etc. That was from Docket. But Order (003) also has notice of appeal. We haven't extracted that. We need to extract appeal from Order (003) as well. That is a separate value.\n\nAlso Order (002) had notice of appeal mentioned but appended value already? We didn't extract? The earlier append included only Docket values. We need to include Order (002) and Order (003) appeals.\n\nWe need to extract all appeals: from Docket, Order (002), Order (003), maybe Order (001). Let's search Order (002) for \"notice of appeal\" matches. We saw 3 matches earlier but didn't read. We should read relevant tokens.\n\nAlso Order (003) we saw tokens 1021-1221 had notice of appeal. We should read that portion.\n\nAlso Order (001) we need to read token ranges where appeals appear. Let's search for \"notice of appeal\" in Order (001) again: step 21, 24, 25, 26, 27 etc. Step 25 found 3 matches in Order (002). Step 26 found 5 matches in Order (001) for \"appeal\". But we didn't read. Let's read those.\n\nThus next action: read_document on Order (001) covering unviewed tokens near matches. We need to find the token positions of those matches. We don't have them. Let's search for \"notice of appeal\" in Order (001) again using search_document_regex to get matches context. That will give us positions.\n\nSo we should call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Order (001)\" pattern \"(?i)notice of appeal\". That will give us matches and token ranges.

They say 2 values extracted. But earlier they had 1 value appended? Step 29 appended 1 value; step 20 updated with 1 value? They now have 2 values. But maybe need to confirm if any more appeals exist. The search results from earlier indicated multiple matches, but maybe only those two. Need to ensure all distinct appeals extracted. We might need to search remaining documents not fully visited: Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Brief, etc. But earlier searches for \"notice of appeal\" found none in those docs. So likely no appeals there. But we should verify if any appeals in other documents like Order (001), Order (003), etc. We already searched Order (001) and 002 and 003 for notice of appeal and got matches but those were already included? Not sure. The extracted values maybe include appeals from Docket only. But maybe Order (001) or others mention appeals. Let's inspect Order (001) for \"appeal\" tokens. They have partial coverage. We might need to read more of Order (001) to confirm if any appeal. Search results earlier: Step 13: search in Order (001) pattern \"(?i)appeal\" found 5 matches in Order (001).

All keys? Only Appeal. They have 2 values extracted from Docket. But maybe there are more appeals in other documents? We need extract all distinct values. We saw Order (002) and Order (003) mention notices of appeal. Those are appeals. We need to extract each distinct value: \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of International Trade.\" Also maybe \"Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\"? Let's see. In Order (002) text: \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction ... (Doc. 41)\". That is an appeal to the US Court of International Trade? The order mentions transfer to US Court of International Trade. The appeal is likely to that court. Also Order (003) mentions \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41)\". So same appeal. Also Docket likely has appeals.\n\nWe need to search for \"appeal\" in Docket to find all. The catalog shows Docket partially visited with tokens 1182-1461, 1482-2004, 2913-4000. We need to read more of Docket to find other appeals mentions. Also maybe there are appeals by defendants to Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit? Let's search Docket for \"Court of Appeals\". Use search_document_regex on Docket for \"(?i)court of appeals\". Also search \"appeal to\" etc. They already did some searches but maybe not all.\n\nWe need to gather all distinct appeals. Let's search Docket for \"notice of appeal\" already done? They did search on all documents for notice of appeal but maybe not Docket view? They did search on all documents many times, but the results show matches in Docket but not the details. The search results maybe not returned the context? We need to read those matches. Could use search_document_regex on Docket to get matches. They previously did search_document_regex on all documents for notice of appeal, but returned only matches for Order (002) and Order (003). So maybe Docket didn't have matches? But earlier they did search on all documents for \"(?i)appeal\" and found 38 matches: 4 in Appellant's Motion, 6 in Docket, 5 in Order (001)+3 more docs. So Docket has 6 matches. Those matches likely include appeals. We need to read those Docket portions.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Docket for \"(?i)appeal\" maybe to get matches. But we already have Docket partially visited but not the specific matches. We can search Docket with pattern \"(?i)notice of appeal\" or \"(?i)appeal of\" or \"appeal to\" to get the matches. Let's search Docket for \"(?i)notice of appeal\".\n\nWe'll do search_document_regex on Docket with pattern \"(?i)notice of appeal\". That will give top matches with context. Then we can read the matches to extract appeals.\n\nAlso we should search Docket for \"(?i)appeal to\" maybe. But we can also search for \"(?i)appeal\" to get all matches.

We already have 2 values from Docket. But we also have other documents that may contain appeals: Order (002) and Order (003), maybe others. We have read Order (002) fully (100% coverage). In Order (002) we saw a notice of appeal statement: \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction 'as well as all prior orders and decisions that merge into that Order.'\" That is a notice of appeal but not specifying the parties? The parties are Plaintiffs: Susan Webber; Jonathan St. Goddard; Rhonda Mountain Chief; David Mountain Chief. That appears in the header of Order (002). The parties are listed at top. The court is United States Court of International Trade. So we can extract Appeal: Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of International Trade. But check if there is a formal appeal? The document is an Order, not an appeal itself. But the notice of appeal in the Order references a notice of appeal in Doc. 41. That notice of appeal is likely filed separately. But the text we have includes the notice of appeal reference. We can extract that appeal. But the format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So we need parties and court.\n\nWe should also review Order (003). We have partial coverage but not full. In Order (003) we saw: \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41) and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal (Doc. 42).\" So same Doc. 41 is a notice of appeal. The parties are same: Susan Webber; Jonathan St. Goddard; Rhonda Mountain Chief; David Mountain Chief. The court is United States Court of International Trade (I think). We need to confirm the court. In Order (003) we saw \"sent via UPS to the U.S. Court of International Trade.\" Also earlier in Order (003) we saw \"U.S. Court of International Trade\" in context. So we can extract that appeal.\n\nWe also have Docket entries that show the notice of appeal and the parties. Those were in Docket: two values. But we likely have duplicate values: same parties and same court. But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" Distinct values means unique combinations of parties and court. The parties appear the same across all, but we have separate docket entries for each? The Docket had two entries? Let's inspect: In Docket, we saw in Match 1: 41 | 2025-04-25 | NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. That's the notice of appeal. In Match 2: USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief. That is similar but with USCA Case Number. In Match 3: ORDER of USCA as to 41 Notice of Appeal, filed by Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber, David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief. So multiple docket entries referencing same notice of appeal. But they are same parties. So the value should be same. So distinct value: \"David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\" But that might appear multiple times. We should only record one unique value. But the instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we just need one unique value. But if there were multiple distinct appeals with different parties or courts, we'd include each. But here we have one unique combination. But we already have two values from Docket, but they are duplicates. We should combine to unique. But the system might have appended 2 values earlier. We need to check current extracted list: \"Appeal: 2 values (2 from Docket)\". That suggests we appended two values from Docket. But maybe they are the same? We need to dedupe? The checklists might allow duplicates but we should avoid duplicates. The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value\". So if duplicates, we should only keep one. So we need to update the checklist to replace the extracted list with a single unique value. That means we need update_checklist to replace Appeal with one entry: \"Appeal: Susan Webber, Jonathan St. Goddard, Rhonda Mountain Chief, David Mountain Chief appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\" But we should confirm that the parties are exactly that order? In the docket entry, order lists: by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. In Order (002), header shows: SUSAN WEBBER; JONATHAN ST.  CV 25–26–GF–DLC GODDARD; RHONDA MOUNTAIN CHIEF; and DAVID MOUNTAIN CHIEF. So order may differ. But the value can list parties in any order? Probably keep same as provided? Could list all four parties separated by commas. The format: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' We'll list parties in the order they appear in docket entry: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber. Or maybe better to list all four as \"David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber\". That matches docket entry.\n\nWhere is the court? It is United States Court of International Trade. That appears in Order (002) and Order (003) and docket. So we can extract that.\n\nWe also need to provide evidence: we need to cite text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe have evidence from Docket: the match text. We could use that. Also maybe from Order (002). But we probably need at least one snippet. For each value we must provide evidence. So we need to provide at least one snippet of the text that includes the parties and the court. The snippet could be from Order (002) or Order (003) or Docket. Let's choose the Docket match snippet that shows parties and likely the court? The docket snippet didn't show the court explicitly. But the docket entry: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" That doesn't show the court. The docket entry itself doesn't mention the court. But the docket is part of the case docket, so the court is implied as United States Court of International Trade? But we might want to provide evidence that the appeal is to U.S. Court of International Trade. That evidence could be from Order (002) where it says \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction …\" and earlier it says \"On April 25, 2025, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to transfer this matter to the United States Court of International Trade.\" That indicates the appellate court. So we can use that snippet. Also Order (003) snippet includes \"sent via UPS to the U.S. Court of International Trade.\" So we can use that.\n\nThus we want to produce a single value: 'Appeal: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to United States Court of International Trade.'\n\nWe need evidence: Provide text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe can use snippet from Order (002) that includes the parties and the court:\n\nFrom Order (002) snippet: \n\"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction “as well as all prior orders and decisions that merge into that Order.” (Doc. 41.)\" That doesn't have the parties. But the header lists the parties. We can use header snippet: \"SUSAN WEBBER; JONATHAN ST.  CV 25–26–GF–DLC GODDARD; RHONDA MOUNTAIN CHIEF; and DAVID MOUNTAIN CHIEF,\" and later \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the order transferring jurisdiction...\" That covers both parties and the notice of appeal. The court is in earlier lines: \"On April 25, 2025, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to transfer this matter to the United States Court of International Trade.\" So we need to combine those? We could provide two evidence snippets: one for parties and one for court. The evidence array can have multiple entries.\n\nAlso we can use snippet from Order (003): \"Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. 41) and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal (Doc. 42). ... sent via UPS to the U.S. Court of International Trade.\" That shows the court.\n\nThus we can provide evidence array with two entries: one from Order (002) header and notice of appeal; one from Order (003) showing the court.\n\nWe should also include location info: e.g., Order (002) page 1, tokens 0-? or the snippet location. We might specify \"Page 1\" or token range. The requirement: location (e.g., page, section, docket entry; include token offsets if available). We can give \"Page 1\" for Order (002) and \"Page 3\" for Order (003) or just token ranges. Let's use token ranges from the read_document. For Order (002), we have tokens 0-1092, with header presumably early. So we can say \"tokens 0-200\" for header. For Order (003), we can say \"tokens 1021-1305\" or \"tokens 1021-1305\" includes the mention of \"Notice of Appeal\" and \"U.S. Court of International Trade\". Actually the snippet in Step 35 shows tokens 1021-1305. We'll use that.\n\nThus we will update the checklist with one value. Use update_checklist.\n\nWe need to include extracted array with one object: extracted: list of one object: evidence list of two evidence items.\n\nWe must ensure we include the value string exactly: \"Appeal: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\"\n\nCheck formatting: The requirement: 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So we include 'Appeal: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to United States Court of International Trade.'\n\nNow produce update_checklist patch for key \"Appeal\".\n\nThus final answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.update_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Appeal\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Appeal: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"SUSAN WEBBER; JONATHAN ST.

We have extracted one appeal value from Order (002) and Order (003). But we might have other appeals in other documents: Docket, Complaint, etc. The step 36 read Order(002) gave appeal. Step 37 updated. We have only 1 value. But maybe there are more appeals in Docket or other documents. We saw earlier search for \"appeal\" found matches in Appellant's Motion, Docket, Order. We haven't read Docket fully. The docket likely contains docket entries with notices of appeal. Also maybe in Complaint documents there is an appeal. The step 1-35 search indicated many matches. So we need to read relevant sections of Docket to find appeals. Also potentially in other documents.\n\nWe should search for \"notice of appeal\" in Docket to get context. The docket is partially visited, but not fully. We need to locate appeals within Docket: the docket entries include \"Notice of Appeal\" etc. Let's search Docket for \"notice of appeal\" pattern. The earlier search found 3 matches in Docket. We need to read those parts. Let's use search_document_regex on Docket for \"notice of appeal\" with context. Then read the specific token ranges. The search results likely include token ranges. We need to read those ranges to extract appeals.\n\nAlso also search for \"appeal to\" maybe. But earlier search found none. So just \"notice of appeal\".\n\nAlso check if there are appeals in other documents: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief may have an appeal? But likely not. The docket might have docket entries referencing appeal of earlier orders. So we need to extract.\n\nWe should perform search_document_regex for Docket pattern \"notice of appeal\". Use context_tokens maybe 200. Then read those token ranges. Let's proceed.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Docket\"],\"pattern\":\"(?i)notice of appeal\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Docket"], "pattern": "(?i)notice of appeal", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5868, "completion_tokens": 429, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The last action was Step 41: search_document_regex in Docket. We saw matches for \"notice of appeal\" in Docket that include text with \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings,,, Order,,, Order Vacating,,, Terminate Motions,, by David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber.\" That's presumably the same appeal already extracted, but we should confirm if there are additional appeals beyond the one we have extracted. The extracted Appeal value we have: \"Appeal: David Mountain Chief, Rhonda Mountain Chief, Jonathan St. Goddard, Susan Webber appealed to United States Court of International Trade.\" So we need to ensure we have all distinct appeals. The Docket matches show \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" but not necessarily the appellate court? The snippet shows the parties but not the court. But we may find the appellate court in other documents like the docket entries themselves. The docket entries show \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal\" which might include the appellate court. But the extracted appeal from Order (002) and Order (003) already mention the appellate court \"United States Court of International Trade.\" That might be the only appeal.\n\nWe need to check if there are appeals from other parties or to other courts. Possibly \"notice of appeal\" from other documents like Order (004) or others. But we need to search for \"notice of appeal\" in other documents that haven't been fully visited: Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Briefs, etc. But no earlier steps indicated those have no notices. The search_document_regex earlier found 38 matches across all docs. And many of those matches were in Order (001), (002), (003). We also saw 4 matches in Appellant's Motion. But we have read that and appended one value. So likely only one appeal.\n\nBut we need to be certain: maybe there are multiple appeals from the same parties but different order? The extracted value covers parties and appellate court. We saw multiple docket entries: 41 Notice of Appeal filed by those parties. But maybe there are appeals for other orders? The docket entries show \"Notice of Appeal as to 40 Terminate Deadlines and Hearings\" which is the same appeal. The docket also has \"Notice of Appeal\" for other orders? The snippet shows the same parties. So likely only one.\n\nWe need to determine if we need to update the checklist or just stop. We already have an Appeal value. We also note that the \"Empty Keys\" count is 0/1 - meaning 1 key (Appeal) is empty? Actually, the status says \"Empty Keys: 0/1\" which means no empty keys? That seems contradictory: It shows 1 key with values. \"Empty Keys: 0/1\" maybe means 0 empty keys out of 1 total? So all keys are filled. So we should stop.\n\nBut we need to confirm if the extracted value is complete: Do we need to include the docket entry info? The checklist definition: \"Appeal: Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court. The extracted value should be formated as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\"\n\nWe have that format. But maybe we need to include all distinct appeals: we have one appeal. We should ensure it's complete; maybe there is an appeal in Order (004) or other documents. Let's search for \"notice of appeal\" in Order (004). But we saw earlier that Order (004) had 458 tokens, partially visited 0-421. That snippet might include \"Notice of Appeal\" but we didn't see. Let's search again.\n\nWe could do a search_document_regex on Order (004) for \"(?i)notice of appeal\". But we can also search in the remaining docs: Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Briefs. But earlier searches had found 0 matches in those docs. The prior search steps included many search_document_regex on other docs and found no matches (like Step 23, 32, 33). So likely no other appeals.\n\nThus we have all appeals. The last step 41 found docket entries that are same appeal. So we can stop.\n\nBut before stopping, we should confirm that the checklist currently has one value. The status says \"Appeal: 1 value\". So we have one value. That should satisfy the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we should stop.\n\nThus we should call \"stop\" with decision.\n\nBut we need to check if there's any other appeal not captured. The docket has matches for \"Notice of Appeal\" but we already extracted that. The docket entries mention \"USCA Case Number 25-2717 and Time Schedule Order for 41 Notice of Appeal\" which is the same. So no new.\n\nThus we should stop.\n\nWe need to output JSON with decision: \"stop\" and reason.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All distinct Appeal entries have been extracted and no additional appeals are present in the corpus.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All distinct Appeal entries have been extracted and no additional appeals are present in the corpus.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5431, "completion_tokens": 1094, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
