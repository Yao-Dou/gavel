It contains Filing Date: \"Filed 04/04/25\". We also have parties: Plaintiffs Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard; Defendants: U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, United States of America. Also maybe more? The complaint includes attorneys: \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard\". Also attorneys for defendants? Not shown yet. But we need Type_of_Counsel: category of legal representation for each party. We may need to identify the counsel type for each. The complaint mentions \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard\". That implies private counsel? Also maybe the defendants have counsel? Not given yet. Might need to search docket or other documents.\n\nClass_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: The complaint says Plaintiffs proceed as class? It says \"Plaintiffs\" but we need designation. It might be \"Class Action\" if they filed as a class. In the complaint, it doesn't specify class action language. Might be individual plaintiffs. We need to search for \"class action\" or \"class\" within the complaint. It might not be present.\n\nWe need to search for \"class action\" or \"class\" pattern. Use regex search. Also maybe \"Class Action\" phrase. Let's search in all documents.\n\nAlso we need Type_of_Counsel: we need to identify the category for each party. For plaintiffs, they have private counsel (Tranelfirm). For defendants, maybe they have government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice). We need to find references. In the complaint, we may not see defendant counsel. Could be in docket or orders. We might need to read docket or other documents.\n\nLet's first fill Filing_Date. We have evidence. So we should append that.\n\nAlso fill Who_are_the_Parties: we have parties. We need to list each: Plaintiff: Susan Webber, Plaintiff: Jonathan St. Goddard; Defendant: U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Defendant: Kristi Noem; Defendant: United States of America. Also maybe more: The complaint indicates \"U.S. Department of Homeland Security\" and \"the United States of America\" and \"Kristi Noem\" as defendants. Also maybe \"U.S. Department of Homeland Security\" includes the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem. So categories: Defendant: U.S. Department of Homeland Security (government counsel). Defendant: Kristi Noem (public official). Defendant: United States of America (government). But we just need description: \"Defendant: [description]\".\n\nWe also need Type_of_Counsel: For plaintiffs: private counsel (Tranelfirm). For defendants: government counsel (likely U.S. Department of Justice). We need evidence. The complaint shows \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard\" – that indicates private counsel. For defendants, we need to see if the complaint includes \"Counsel for Defendants\" lines. Not in the snippet. But maybe later in the complaint. We might need to read more of the complaint to find defendant counsel. Search for \"Counsel for Defendants\" or \"Attorney for Defendants\". Let's search.\n\nAlso for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: Need to determine if it's a class action. Search for \"class action\" or \"class\" or \"class representative\".

The snippet includes Filing_Date line: \"Filed 04/04/25\". Also includes parties, plaintiff names, defendants. Also type of counsel? It lists \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard\". That indicates private counsel? Also \"Monica J. Tranel\" from Tranelfirm. Possibly counsel for plaintiffs. Also mention \"Kristi Noem\" etc. Also type of counsel for defendants - not explicitly states. But we can capture.\n\nWe need to extract 4 items:\n\n- Filing_Date: date first filed. We have \"Filed 04/04/25\". That is the filing date. Provide evidence snippet.\n\n- Who_are_the_Parties: descriptions of each party, identifying plaintiffs and defendants and capacities. For each party we need value like \"Plaintiff: Susan Webber\" etc. The snippet lists \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard\". Also \"Plaintiffs: Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard\". Also \"Defendants: U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, United States of America.\" So we should extract each party with role.\n\n- Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: designation. The complaint states \"Plaintiffs, vs.\" but no \"class action\" phrase. So likely individual plaintiffs. We need brief description of individuals. The snippet includes \"Plaintiff Susan Webber is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation and an elected representative of the Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations of Montana.\" Also \"Plaintiff Jonathan St. Goddard is a rancher...\" So we can classify as Individual, described as ... Each separate entry? The requirement: value should formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'. So maybe one entry summarizing both? But we can have multiple entries? The definition: \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: A designation of whether plaintiffs proceed as a class action or as individual plaintiffs (with a brief description of the individuals when applicable). The extracted value should be formated as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\"\n\nThus we might have one entry: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation and elected representative of Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations of Montana; rancher on Blackfeet Nation.\" That includes both individuals. So one entry.\n\n- Type_of_Counsel: category of legal representation for each party (private counsel, public defender, public interest org, government counsel). We need to identify counsel types. For plaintiffs: \"Monica J. Tranel, TRANEL LAW FIRM, P.C.\" So private counsel. Also \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard\" indicates they are represented by private counsel from Tranelfirm. For defendants: \"Kristi Noem\" - likely government counsel? Usually defendants are represented by government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice). But not explicitly stated. Might not appear in snippet. We might need to search for \"defendants counsel\" or \"Counsel for Defendants\". Might be in other documents. But we can tentatively set type for plaintiffs as private counsel. For defendants maybe government counsel. But need evidence.\n\nWe should read more of the complaint to capture the parties and counsel. We already have some. We need to ensure we capture all parties and counsel types.\n\nThus next action: read more of the complaint beyond token 10000 to capture later parts where defendants' counsel may be listed. The complaint is 19,849 tokens, we read 0-10000. We should read remaining tokens 10000-20000 maybe.

Defendants: U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, United States of America. Also maybe \"U.S. Department of Homeland Security\" etc. So need to list each party with description. Format: 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'. Use descriptions from text: e.g., \"Plaintiff Susan Webber is an enrolled member...\" etc. We can give brief.\n\nClass_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: It seems plaintiffs are individual, not class action. The text says \"Plaintiffs proceed as individual plaintiffs\" or \"Class Action\"? We need to check: There's no class action designation. So likely \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as...\" We can provide description: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard, enrolled members of Blackfeet Nation.\" Evidence.\n\nType_of_Counsel: Identify legal representation categories. Plaintiffs' counsel: \"Monica J. Tranel, TRANEL LAW FIRM, P.C.\" That is private counsel. Defendants' counsel: not specified in complaint. Might not have evidence. But maybe there is mention of legal services? Not in complaint. So we only have plaintiffs' counsel as private counsel. So Type_of_Counsel: \"Plaintiffs: Private Counsel (Monica J.

For defendants: \"Defendants: U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, United States of America\". Also \"Kristi Noem is Secretary of DHS\". Provide description.\n\nWhere to get description: For plaintiff Susan Webber: \"Plaintiff Susan Webber is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation and an elected representative of the Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations of Montana\". For Jonathan St. Goddard: \"Plaintiff Jonathan St. Goddard is a rancher on the Blackfeet Nation\". For defendant Kristi Noem: \"Defendant Kristi Noem is the Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security\". For US Dept of Homeland Security: \"Defendant the United States Department of Homeland Security is a cabinet agency\". For United States of America: \"Defendant the United States of America is responsible for the exercise of the executive action\".\n\nWe need to extract each as separate entry.\n\nClass_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard, enrolled members of Blackfeet Nation\". Provide evidence snippet: maybe \"Plaintiffs bring this Complaint against...\" and \"Plaintiffs challenge...\". Provide location: maybe \"Page 1\".\n\nType_of_Counsel: \"Plaintiffs: Private Counsel (Monica J. Tranel, Tranel Law Firm, P.C.)\". Evidence: \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard\". Also earlier \"Monica J. Tranel\" etc. Provide location: \"Page 1\".\n\nWe must ensure each extracted entry has evidence array. Provide single evidence entry per item.\n\nLet's craft JSON patch.\n\nWe need to call append_checklist with patch array containing items for each key.\n\nWe'll include:\n\n- key: \"Filing_Date\" extracted: value: \"04/04/25\" evidence: text snippet.\n\n- key: \"Who_are_the_Parties\" extracted: array of entries: each with value: \"Plaintiff: Susan Webber, enrolled member of Blackfeet Nation, elected representative of Blackfeet and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nations of Montana.\" etc.\n\n- key: \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" extracted: one entry.\n\n- key: \"Type_of_Counsel\" extracted: one entry.\n\nWe need to ensure we provide all distinct values.\n\nNow produce append_checklist call.\n\nWe need to include the path of evidence: source_document: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". location: maybe \"Page 1\".\n\nFor parties descriptions, we might use \"Page 1\" or \"Page 3\".

We extracted 5 entries: Plaintiff Susan Webber, Plaintiff Jonathan St. Goddard, Defendant Kristi Noem, Defendant DHS, Defendant USA. Are there any other parties? In the complaint, the defendants include \"U.S. Department of Homeland Security\" and \"United States of America\" and \"Kristi Noem\". Also \"United States of America\" maybe as separate. Others like \"U.S. Department of Homeland Security\" appears as defendant. Also \"Kristi Noem\" is a defendant. We have those. Also \"United States of America\". Did we miss \"United States of America\" as a defendant? Yes we included. So all parties.\n\n- Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: We set one entry: Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard, enrolled members. Is there any indication of Class Action? The complaint states \"Plaintiffs\" but not a class action. There's no mention of class certification. So Individual is correct. Is the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" key expecting \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\"? Yes.\n\n- Type_of_Counsel: We have plaintiffs private counsel. Are there any other counsel? Perhaps the defendants have counsel, but not in the complaint? The complaint lists \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard\". No mention of defendant counsel. So we only have plaintiffs counsel. So we included \"Plaintiffs: Private Counsel (Monica J. Tranel, Tranel Law Firm, P.C.)\".\n\nThus all checklist items are filled. No Not Applicable. So we should stop.\n\nBut check if any of the keys might require multiple values for Type_of_Counsel? Could be defendant counsel if listed in other documents. But not necessary to fill all. The requirement is to extract all distinct values of each checklist item that directly matches the definition. For Type_of_Counsel, we have only plaintiffs counsel. That's all. There might be no defendant counsel in the documents. So okay.\n\nThus we can stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items fully extracted with evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All checklist items fully extracted with evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 24863, "completion_tokens": 613, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The prior steps show that all 4 checklist items have been extracted. However we must verify that extraction is correct and comprehensive. The system says we may stop again. But we need to confirm that all items are truly extracted.\n\nChecklist items:\n\n- Filing_Date\n- Who_are_the_Parties\n- Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\n- Type_of_Counsel\n\nWe have extracted:\n\nFiling_Date: \"04/04/25\" from Complaint, evidence at page 1.\n\nWho_are_the_Parties: 5 entries: Plaintiff Susan Webber, Plaintiff Jonathan St. Goddard, Defendant Kristi Noem, Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Defendant United States of America. All with evidence.\n\nClass_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard, enrolled members of the Blackfeet Nation.\" Evidence from complaint page 1.\n\nType_of_Counsel: \"Plaintiffs: Private Counsel (Monica J. Tranel, Tranel Law Firm, P.C.)\". Evidence from complaint page 1.\n\nThe document also has a \"First Amended Complaint\" which might also contain the same info. But extraction is from Complaint. It's acceptable. The question: \"Extract all 4 checklist items from the legal case documents as completely as possible.\" We need to ensure we capture all distinct values across all documents. But maybe some documents contain additional values. For example, the \"First Amended Complaint\" could have additional defendants? But likely same. But to be thorough, we should check if other documents contain distinct values not captured.\n\nCheck \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" for other parties? Might list same parties but maybe additional. But we should inspect. But given the high token length, we might need to read this doc partially. But we may also run a search for \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" patterns. However, the current extraction might be incomplete if there are other parties listed in the first amended complaint or in other documents (e.g., docket). But the docket might list the same parties. The Type_of_Counsel might also be in other documents, maybe with other counsel (like government counsel). But not sure.\n\nThe system expects us to confirm completeness. We might want to search in the \"First Amended Complaint\" for \"Defendant\" and \"Plaintiff\" to see if any new parties appear.\n\nAlso \"Type_of_Counsel\" might have multiple counsel entries: plaintiff counsel, defendant counsel, maybe public interest organization counsel. We only captured plaintiff counsel. But perhaps the first amended complaint lists defendant counsel too. But not needed? The checklist is \"Type_of_Counsel: The category of legal representation for each party\". So we might need to list for each party: plaintiff counsel, defendant counsel categories. We only captured plaintiff counsel. We need to check others.\n\nThus we need to verify if other parties have counsel.\n\nLet's search the first amended complaint for \"Attorneys\" or \"Counsel\". We could search for \"Counsel\" or \"Attorney\". Or search for \"Defendant\" to see if new defendant counsel. But we should search for \"Defendant\" and capture any new names.\n\nAlso check docket for maybe additional parties? Maybe docket lists \"Defendant: Department of Homeland Security\" etc. But likely same.\n\nThus best next step: search the \"First Amended Complaint\" for \"Defendant\" to see if any new entries. But there might be many tokens. Instead, we can search for \"Defendant\" using search_document_regex across that doc only.\n\nAlternatively, search for \"Attorney\" across all documents to find counsel. But we need to capture categories. The \"Type_of_Counsel\" might be \"Plaintiff: Private Counsel\" and maybe \"Defendant: Government Counsel\" etc.\n\nLet's search for \"Attorney\" or \"Counsel\" in the first amended complaint. Use search_document_regex on doc \"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". Pattern could be \"Attorney[s]* for [Pp]laintiff[s]*\". But easier: search for \"Attorney\" and get context.\n\nAlso we might search for \"Counsel\" pattern. Let's proceed with a search: doc_names: [\"First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\"], pattern: \"Attorney[s]*\", flags: IGNORECASE.\n\nAlso we might search for \"Defendant\" pattern to see if new defendants. But we already captured.\n\nAlso \"Type_of_Counsel\" might include government counsel. That likely appears in the complaint too: \"Defendants' counsel: ...\". But we didn't capture. The complaint's header might list \"Defendants: United States Department of Homeland Security and United States of America\". But counsel likely listed after the parties. But the snippet we saw earlier didn't show defendant counsel. Might be in the question: \"Attorneys for Plaintiffs Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard\" likely earlier. The defendant counsel may also be listed: \"Counsel for defendants: ...\". But we didn't capture.\n\nThus to ensure completeness, we need to extract defendant counsel as well. Let's search for \"Counsel\" and \"Attorney\" and \"Defendants\" in the complaint.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex across the complaint only, pattern: \"Counsel\". But we need to capture context. The search_document_regex returns top_k matches with context.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\",\n  \"pattern\": \"Counsel\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 10,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "pattern": "Counsel", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 10, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14574, "completion_tokens": 1205, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
