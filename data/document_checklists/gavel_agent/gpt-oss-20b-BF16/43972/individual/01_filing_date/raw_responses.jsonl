Currently we have one filing date: 08/17/22 from Complaint and Docket. But there may be other filing dates in other documents, e.g., orders, motions etc. We need to find all distinct filing dates in any document. Filing date refers to the date the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court. That is the filing date of the complaint. There may be other filing dates for other documents like motions filed later, but Filing_Date key likely refers to the lawsuit's filing date. So only the initial filing date is needed. We have it. But we should check if any other documents include a filing date for the lawsuit. For example, docket entries might have date of complaint and other filings. But the filing date of the lawsuit is 08/17/22. Should we include other filing dates? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if any document contains the same filing date, we should extract it. But we already extracted 08/17/22. If other documents contain different filing dates (maybe a re-filed complaint?), we would need to add them. Let's search for \"Filed\" or \"Filing\" in other documents. But the docket already shows the initial filing. But other documents might contain \"Filed\" with different dates for other documents, but those are not the filing date of the lawsuit. We need to be careful: the filing date of the lawsuit is the date the complaint was filed. All other documents are later. But the instruction didn't restrict to only the complaint; it says \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So we only need that date. Even if other documents mention \"Filed\" dates, they are not the lawsuit filing date. So we only need that one date. It's already extracted. Are there other possible dates? The complaint shows \"Filed 08/17/22\". The docket also 08/17/22. No other documents likely mention a different filing date. So we are done. But we need to verify that no other documents mention a different filing date; but we can be confident. However, to be safe, we could search for \"Filed\" in unvisited documents. But that may produce many matches. But the instruction: we have to extract all distinct filing dates. If there's only one, we are done. But we should double-check that the docket's first entry is the complaint; we saw \"1 | 2022-08-17 | COMPLAINT ...\". That's the filing date. There's also \"14 | 2022-08-26 | UNOPPOSED MOTION ...\". That's a later filing. But not the lawsuit filing date. So we have the correct one.\n\nThus we can stop. But we need to ensure we haven't missed any other filing date. The docket might have a \"Filing Fee\" for other documents, but not the lawsuit filing. So we can stop.\n\nBut the instructions: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either complete or Not Applicable.\" We have one key, Filing_Date, which we have extracted. The key has one value, 08/17/22. But we must ensure that we have all distinct values. If we think there are no other distinct filing dates, we are done. To be thorough, we can search for \"Filed\" in unvisited docs. But that could be many. But we could search for \"2022-08-17\" or \"08/17/22\" across all docs. But we already saw those. But maybe some document has a different filing date, e.g., 08/18/22 if the complaint was filed again? Unlikely. Let's quickly search in the docket again for \"2022-08-17\" occurrences. Already found. For other docs, we can search for \"Filed\" pattern. But the docket is the only one with filing dates. The rest are orders, motions etc. They likely contain \"Filed\" but not the lawsuit filing date. The requirement is to extract \"the filing date of the lawsuit\". We have that.

The user (the system) has already extracted Filing_Date from Complaint and Docket, with value \"08/17/22\" (two sources). But the requirement says: Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. We should check if any other documents contain filing dates. The Filing_Date is the date lawsuit first filed. The Complaint's filing date is 08/17/22. Docket also has entries; but the filing date is the first filing date. Possibly other documents might have \"Filed\" date but those are subsequent filings. We need to find all distinct filing dates across the corpus. There might be multiple filings: e.g., additional filings or amendments. But the filing date should be the first date the lawsuit was filed. But the instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if multiple documents mention filing dates, we need to capture each distinct date. But we must differentiate: Some documents may mention other dates like \"Filed 10/15/22\" etc. But they might be later filings, not the initial filing date. However, the checklist item is \"Filing_Date\" for the lawsuit first filed/initiated. So if a document contains a later filing date, that might not be the filing date. But the instruction says \"extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" This could be ambiguous: The filing date should be the date lawsuit first filed. So we should only include that date. But the user earlier extracted 08/17/22 from Complaint and Docket. The system says \"All distinct filing dates for the lawsuit have been extracted; the filing date 08/17/22 is present in the Complaint and Docket.\" But that may be incomplete if there are other documents that also mention the same date, but that's the same value; distinct values: only one. So we might be done.\n\nBut we need to check if any other documents mention 08/17/22 as filing date. The docket entries show entries on 2022-08-17, 2022-08-26, etc. Some other documents may mention the initial filing date. The Complaint has \"Filed 08/17/22\". Other documents may have \"Filed 08/17/22\" or \"Filed 08/17/2022\". But we only need the distinct value. So maybe 08/17/22 is the only distinct date.\n\nWe need to confirm that no other document contains a different filing date. Possibly there are multiple complaints? But the docket shows only one complaint at 08/17/22. So likely only one distinct date.\n\nThus the extraction is complete. We can call stop. The prior stop was premature but now we think it's correct. So we can stop.\n\nBut check if any other document may mention a different date. The docket entries show multiple entries, but only the complaint is the filing. The docket entry 1 shows \"2022-08-17\". That's the filing date. No other date is earlier.
