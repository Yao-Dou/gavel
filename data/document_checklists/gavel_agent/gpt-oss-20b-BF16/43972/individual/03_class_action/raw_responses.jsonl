So we would extract \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [Andrew H. Warren, State Attorney]\". Need evidence. We saw in complaint snippet \"I, Andrew H.

Actually the snippet included \"Page 6 of 28\" in the earlier read, but the content snippet after that is not page 6. The \"I, Andrew H. Warren\" snippet is after page 6? Actually the complaint read included pages 1-28 lines. The snippet \"I, Andrew H. Warren, state as follows:\" appears after page 6? The snippet printed earlier includes \"Page 6 of 28\" line then \"Case 4:22-cv-00302-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 08/17/22   Page 6 of 28\" then other content lines. But the snippet after that is \"I, Andrew H. Warren, state as follows:\" maybe on page 7?

We can get checklist to see current. But we already know. But maybe we can set a final update to confirm no others. But we need to be careful: we should not set Not Applicable. We have a value. So we shouldn't update.\n\nBut the instructions: \"Stop only when every key is either complete: all relevant values present\". So we need to be confident there are no other values. We could search all documents again for \"class action\" or \"Plaintiffs\" maybe \"Plaintiffs:\" but we did earlier and found 0. But we might want to search for \"class action\" again but maybe we need to search for \"class action\" but earlier we did and got 0. So we can be confident.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut we must be careful: The checklist item expects distinct values. We have only one. So we are done.\n\nThus we should issue stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All documents have been searched for class action indicators; only one distinct value (individual plaintiff) was found and appended.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All documents have been searched for class action indicators; only one distinct value (individual plaintiff) was found and appended.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4056, "completion_tokens": 1809, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The last step was \"stop\" after Step 11. The system says we can either stop again or continue. The user task is to extract class action status from legal documents. The prior steps found only one value: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Andrew H. Warren, State Attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit\" from Complaint. But there may be other documents like Docket or opinions that might indicate class action or individual. The user wants \"extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document\". So we need to ensure that we check all documents for class action status. We need to search remaining unvisited documents. Since we didn't find any other matches in the Complaint, but there might be in other documents.\n\nThus we should continue to search for class action status in other documents. We might use search_document_regex on all remaining unvisited documents for patterns like \"class action\", \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", \"Plaintiffs: Individual\", \"class action\" etc. But step 5 and 6 already did search on all documents for class action and didn't find matches. However, maybe the regex didn't capture some variations. The pattern used was \"(?i)class action\" which should match \"class action\" case-insensitive. That didn't find any matches. But maybe the phrase is \"class action\" or \"Class action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" etc. Step 5 and 6 used pattern \"class action\" and \"(?i)class action\". That should match all. But step 6 also used \"(?i)Plaintiffs:\" pattern. That didn't find matches. But maybe the phrase \"Class action\" appears in a docket or order. But the search didn't find any matches. But maybe the docket contains \"class action\" but the regex didn't find because of tokenization? But likely the docket uses \"class action\" phrase. The search didn't find any.\n\nBut the system may have found only 0 matches because maybe the docket uses a different phrase like \"class action\" with a hyphen or \"class-action\"? But the regex \"class action\" won't match \"class-action\". We could search for \"class[- ]action\" or \"class action\" with optional hyphen. Also \"Class Action\" might appear. Let's search for \"class[- ]action\" with IGNORECASE. Also search for \"Class Action\" maybe. Also search for \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" or \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". Also search for \"Plaintiffs:\".\n\nWe should search all unvisited documents for the pattern \"class[- ]action\". Also maybe \"class action\" appears in docket. Let's do search_document_regex on all unvisited docs for pattern \"(?i)class[- ]action\". That might find matches. Also search for \"class action\" again? Already did. But maybe we need to search docket for \"class action\" phrase. Perhaps the search returned 0 matches because the docket is large and maybe the engine didn't return? But likely the docket contains. Let's try again.\n\nWe should call search_document_regex on \"Docket\" only with pattern \"(?i)class[- ]action\". Also maybe \"class action\" appears as \"class-action\". Also \"class action\" might appear in docket entry. Let's do search_document_regex on Docket: pattern \"(?i)class[- ]action\". Also search for \"class action\" again? We can search for \"class action\" and \"class-action\" and \"class action\". Let's do pattern \"(?i)class[\\s-]action\". That should capture both. Let's search in all unvisited docs. Use doc_name=\"Docket\" or doc_names? We can just search in Docket. Use pattern \"(?i)class[\\s-]action\". That might find matches. Also for completeness, search \"Plaintiffs: Individual\" maybe. But we already have that. Let's search docket for \"Plaintiffs:\".\n\nBut the system says we can do only one action per turn. We can do search_document_regex on Docket for pattern \"(?i)class[\\s-]action\". That will give us matches. If we find none, we could search for \"class action\" again. But maybe the docket uses \"class-action\" phrase. Let's do that.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on Docket with pattern \"(?i)class[\\s-]action\". Use top_k maybe 5. That is one action.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Docket\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)class[\\\\s-]action\",\"flags\":[],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "(?i)class[\\s-]action", "flags": [], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4071, "completion_tokens": 977, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have list of documents, many unvisited. Complaint already had individual plaintiffs. We need to search other documents for class action indicators. The prior search regex on all documents found none; but maybe search pattern not enough? Might need to search \"Plaintiffs: Class\" etc. But maybe there is a dismissal order or motion that indicates class action. The key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". We need all distinct values. Likely some documents may mention \"class action\" as status (e.g., \"the plaintiffs proceed as a class action\"). So we need to search other documents for \"class action\" or \"class action\" phrase. But prior search did not find matches. But maybe the text uses \"class action\" but pattern not found due to capitalization or hyphen? They used pattern \"(?i)class action\" and \"(?i)class[\\s-]action\". No matches. So maybe there is no class action. But might be a dismissal order that says \"class action was dismissed\" or \"no class action\". But still an indicator. But no matches. So likely only individual plaintiffs.\n\nBut we must check if there is \"class action\" in any documents. Maybe \"Class Action\" appears but not captured due to multi-line? The regex search probably returns matches. But maybe the text uses \"class action\" in a different language? Probably not.\n\nThus, we might set Not Applicable? Wait, the key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". If only one distinct value (individual) found, we have that. Not Applicable indicates no such status; but we have value.\n\nThus we are done: all keys filled: 1/1. But check if there could be multiple distinct values across documents. For instance, some documents might have class action status and others individual, but we only found individual. If there were multiple, we would need multiple entries. But we didn't find any.\n\nWe must verify that we have captured all distinct values. But we might need to confirm that no other docs mention \"class action\" or \"class action\" phrase. The search didn't find any. So we can stop.\n\nThus return stop decision.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All documents have been searched and only one distinct value (individual plaintiffs) was found for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs; no additional class action status values exist.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All documents have been searched and only one distinct value (individual plaintiffs) was found for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs; no additional class action status values exist.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3897, "completion_tokens": 515, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
