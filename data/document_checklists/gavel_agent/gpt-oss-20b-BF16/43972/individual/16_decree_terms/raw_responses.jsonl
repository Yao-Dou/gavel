We have some matches: \"It is hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the opinion issued on this date in this appeal is entered as the judgment of this Court.\" That's a decree. Also many \"ORDER. Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the motion for leave to appear pro hac vice... is GRANTED.\" Those are orders, but do they constitute decree terms? They are court orders (decrees). We need substantive obligations ordered by the court: consent decrees, stipulated judgments, injunctions. These are orders that impose obligations. So we should capture the terms: \"the motion for leave to appear pro hac vice ... is GRANTED.\" That is an order granting leave, but it imposes an obligation? It orders to grant. Might be considered part of the decree.\n\nBut also possibly other orders like \"ORDER Dismissing the State-Law Claim...\" etc. Those would have terms. We need to search for \"ORDER\" lines with \"GRANTED\" or \"DENIED\" etc. We should search for \"ORDER.\" with \"is ORDERED that\" pattern we already did. Those represent orders. The pattern shows \"ORDER. Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the motion for leave to appear pro hac vice, ECF No. X, is GRANTED.\" So the decree term is \"the motion for leave to appear pro hac vice, ECF No. X, is GRANTED.\" That is a substantive obligation: to grant leave.\n\nAlso the docket entry \"It is hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the opinion issued on this date in this appeal is entered as the judgment of this Court.\" That is a decree term: the opinion is entered as judgment.\n\nThus we need to extract these distinct values.\n\nWe need to gather evidence: text snippet, source_document, location. We have text snippets from search_document_regex with tokens ranges. We can use those as evidence.\n\nWe must decide to append or update. Since we haven't extracted any yet, we can append. But we must ensure we capture all distinct values. There are many matches in Docket: many orders for leave to appear. We need to extract each distinct value: each specific \"ECF No.\" I think each is a separate decree term. We must extract all from Docket 10 matches. The pattern shows 10 matches: each with different ECF No. 20, 19, 21, 28, 29, 39, 44, 49, 50, etc. We have to list each.\n\nAlso we have the \"It is hereby ordered...\" entry. That is another distinct value.\n\nThus total distinct values: 10 orders for leave to appear, plus the judgment entry.\n\nCheck if there are other orders with substantive obligations: maybe other documents like \"Order on the Merits\" etc. But currently we only have evidence from Docket. Might be more in other documents, but we can search for \"ORDER. Accordingly, it is ORDERED that\" again within other docs. But we can focus on Docket.\n\nWe need to do append_checklist with key Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, each extracted value and evidence. Provide evidence as array: text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe need location: could be token offsets or page numbers. The snippet shows tokens but not page. We can use token range as location: e.g., \"tokens 3739-3939\". The snippet has the line. We'll include that.\n\nWe should include each entry separately. Let's craft.\n\nWe have 10 entries from Docket token ranges:\n\n1. tokens 3739-3939: \"ORDER. Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the motion for leave to appear prohac vice, ECF No. 20, is GRANTED.\" Actually snippet shows \"ECF No. 20, is GRANTED.\" Include that.\n\n2. tokens 3829-4029: \"ORDER. Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the motion for leave to appear prohac vice, ECF No. 19, is GRANTED.\"\n\n3. tokens 3916-4116: \"ORDER.

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the motion for leave to appear pro hac vice, ECF No. 50, is GRANTED.\"\n\n10. tokens 9236-9436: Not sure the snippet shows something else; it shows \"MOTION to Appear Pro Hac Vice by Alexandra P. Swain...\". But maybe there is also an order. The snippet may not show the order. We need to check the snippet: It shows lines 79-81, but the snippet may include \"ORDER.\" earlier. But we didn't see the order. We might skip if not present. But we have 10 matches; maybe the 10th is a match but not the order. Let's examine snippet: \"79 | 2022-10-14 | MOTION to Appear Pro Hac Vice by Alexandra P. Swain...\". That is not an order. But search pattern included \"ordered that[^.]*\", so maybe it matched something else. The snippet likely includes an order but truncated. Might need to read the region to confirm. But we can include only the 9 entries that clearly include \"ORDER. Accordingly, it is ORDERED that ... is GRANTED.\" For the 10th, we might need to further read to confirm.\n\nAlso we have the \"It is hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the opinion issued on this date in this appeal is entered as the judgment of this Court.\" That appears in Docket tokens 25154-25366. We have that snippet. We'll extract that as well.\n\nThus we will produce append_checklist with entries: 10? Actually 9 orders + 1 judgment = 10 entries.\n\nWe need to ensure we provide evidence for each: text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe have the token ranges for each snippet. We'll use those.\n\nWe need to provide text exactly as snippet? Provide verbatim snippet: we can use the snippet lines.\n\nLet's extract each snippet from the search results:\n\nFor 3739-3939: snippet shows tokens 3739-3939: \n```\n33 | 2022-09-06 | ORDER.

Need to find all substantive obligations ordered by the court. We already captured the orders in Docket for motions. But there might be other orders like \"Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim\" etc. We need to search across all documents for \"ordered that\", \"it is ordered\", \"it is hereby ordered\", \"decree\", \"decreed\", etc. We have earlier search for \"ordered that\", \"It is hereby ordered\", \"decree\". But perhaps other terms like \"It is ordered that the court shall…\" etc. Might be in other orders. Let's search for \"ordered that\" again but maybe include all documents. Already we searched all documents, found 10 matches in Docket only. But maybe other orders have \"ordered that\" but matches were not captured due to limited token range? The search returned 10 matches total across all docs, all in Docket. So maybe other documents don't contain \"ordered that\". But \"It is hereby ordered\" also only found in Docket. \"decree\" search found 3 matches: two in Pleading and one in Docket. So likely the only decree terms in corpus are those we captured in Docket. However, there might be other orders like \"Order on the Merits\" etc. Might contain \"It is ordered that\" or \"It is hereby ordered\". But search didn't find them. Could be due to token range not searched? The search_document_regex should search all documents, but maybe the pattern didn't match due to variations. Let's search for \"decreed\" maybe? But we only need significant terms of decrees: the substantive obligations ordered by the court. The orders in Docket we captured are mostly orders granting motions; they are substantive obligations: the motion is granted. That's a decree. Also we captured \"opinion issued ... entered as judgment\". That is also a decree. So we have 10 values.\n\nBut maybe there are other orders like \"Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim, Denying the Motion to Dismiss the Federal Claim, and Denying a Preliminary Injunction\" that might have \"It is ordered that\" etc. We didn't search there. But search didn't find matches in that doc. But maybe the pattern \"ordered that\" didn't match because punctuation or line breaks? Should search for \"ordered\".

But are there other significant decree terms? The task: \"Extract the decree terms from the legal documents.\" Must extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. So we need to scan all documents for orders that contain decree terms. Currently we only captured 10 from Docket. But there may be other orders like \"ORDER OF DISMISSAL\" etc. We need to ensure we capture all decree terms that are substantive obligations ordered by court. Could be in other orders: e.g., \"ORDER of Dismissal\" might contain terms, but not decree? The definition: substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders. So any court order that imposes obligations, e.g., \"ORDER OF DISMISSAL\" may not impose obligations. But \"ORDER OF DISMISSAL\" may not be a substantive obligation, but it's a decree of dismissal. But still a court order, but not an obligation? It orders dismissal; but is that a substantive obligation? It's a decision. Might be considered a decree. But likely we only need the terms that are substantive obligations. In the Docket we captured terms like \"the motion for leave to appear prohac vice, ECF No. 20, is GRANTED\" which is an order granting a motion. Those are obligations? The grant of leave to appear pro hac vice is an order granting a motion; it's an obligation? It's a court order. The definition says \"The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders.\" So grant of leave to appear is a substantive order? It's a decision. But maybe included. But we should consider other orders like \"ORDER OF DISMISSAL\" etc. But we might need to extract those terms as well? The checklist says \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" - maybe all decree terms, not just grant of leave. The prior steps have extracted 10 values only from Docket. But there might be other orders in the corpus, like \"Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim, Denying the Motion to Dismiss the Federal Claim, and Denying a Preliminary Injunction\" – that might contain terms like \"The court denies the motion to dismiss the federal claim\" etc. Those are significant decree terms. So we need to search other documents for \"ORDER.\" or \"ORDERED that\" etc. We could search \"ORDERED that\" again but we already did. But that search only captured matches in Docket. However other documents might contain \"ORDERED that\" as well. We need to search all documents. The search earlier used pattern \"ORDERED that\" and returned 10 matches, all in Docket. But maybe other documents have other patterns like \"it is hereby ordered\" etc. We should search for \"it is hereby ordered\" again? Already step 4 found 1 match in Docket. But maybe other orders have \"ordered that\" but not captured due to regex differences? We used pattern \"ORDERED\\s+that\". That may miss \"ORDERED that\" with line breaks. But we might need to search for \"ORDERED that\" or \"ordered that\" case-insensitive. Use regex with IGNORECASE and DOTALL. Also search for \"ORDER\" statements. But we may need to capture orders like \"ORDER OF DISMISSAL\" which likely don't have \"ORDERED that\" but still a court order. However the term \"decree\" might refer to \"decree\" used in orders like \"The court decrees that ...\". So we need to search for \"decree that\" or \"decreed that\" etc. But the definition: we need to extract the substantive obligations ordered by court. We can use \"ORDERED that\" as a good indicator. But also \"IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\" etc. We might need to search for \"ORDERED that\" and \"IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\" pattern. We already got all from Docket. But maybe other documents have \"ORDERED that\" but not captured because regex didn't match due to line breaks or different formatting. Let's search again with more flexible regex: \"ordered\\s+that\" with IGNORECASE and DOTALL. Also maybe \"ordered that\" is used without line breaks.

The checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" which are substantive obligations ordered by the court. We have many orders granting leave to appear pro hac vice. Are those considered \"terms of decrees\"? In the context, the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" likely includes any substantive obligations ordered by the court, e.g., the order that the opinion is entered as judgment. Also maybe other decrees like \"order on the merits\" or \"order denying motions\" etc. But the prior extraction only extracted the 10 leave to appear orders and the opinion entry. But there may be other decrees in other documents that are substantive obligations, e.g., orders denying motions, orders compelling discovery, etc. The definition says \"This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders. Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court. Extract each term as a separate value.\"\n\nSo we need to search for other \"ordered that\" statements that impose obligations. Also \"It is hereby ordered\" etc. Also maybe \"It is hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the opinion issued on this date in this appeal is entered as the judgment of this Court.\" That's already extracted. There may be other \"ordered\" statements like \"It is hereby ordered, and the court orders that the parties comply with ...\". We should search for pattern \"ORDERED that\" or \"It is hereby ordered\" across all documents. Already search was done across all documents and found 10 matches, all in Docket. But maybe some matches were missed because the regex didn't capture all. But search is case-insensitive? The search used pattern \"ordered that\" with default flags? It used \"ordered that\" pattern maybe case-sensitive? It didn't specify flags, default empty. So case-sensitive. They might have words \"ORDERED that\" all uppercase? They might be uppercase. The matches found probably include all tokens that match exactly \"ordered that\". But there may be \"ORDERED that\" in other documents not captured because search didn't include them or maybe not matched due to case. We might want to search with IGNORECASE to catch all. Also \"ORDERED that\" might appear in other documents like \"Order on the Merits\" etc. Let's search again with IGNORECASE and maybe pattern \"ordered that|It is hereby ordered\". But we need to capture entire clause.\n\nWe also need to capture any substantive obligations in \"Order Denying Motions to Intervene\" etc. Those are orders that deny motions - may not impose obligations. But they are orders. But the term \"significant terms of decrees\" probably refers to substantive obligations like \"the court orders that the parties comply with X\" or \"the court orders that the judgment is entered\" etc. The leave to appear orders are not obligations; they grant permission. Are they considered \"significant terms of decrees\"? The prior extraction included them; maybe the instructions allow them. So we should also search other documents for \"ORDERED that\" clauses, and also \"It is hereby ordered\" and perhaps \"It is hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed that\". Also \"ORDERED that the parties\" etc.\n\nAlso check \"Order on the Merits\" etc. Could contain \"ORDERED that\" statements. Let's search across all documents for \"ORDERED that\" with IGNORECASE. Also search for \"It is hereby ordered\". Then read those matches to extract.\n\nLet's perform search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\", pattern=\"ORDERED that|It is hereby ordered\" flags=IGNORECASE.

Already did searches across all docs and found matches only in Docket. However some other documents may have \"ordered that\" but not captured due to search pattern? The search was done for \"ordered that\" and \"It is hereby ordered\" and \"ORDERED that\". The results show only Docket. But maybe other documents have \"ORDERED\" but not captured due to case sensitivity? We used flags unspecified (default). The regex pattern \"ordered that\" may be case-insensitive? We didn't set IGNORECASE. But pattern \"ordered that\" will match exact case; but many documents may have \"ORDERED that\". In search results, we saw \"ORDERED that\" matches. So likely all decree terms are in Docket. However, check if other documents have \"decree\" or \"decree\" pattern. Search for \"decree\" earlier found 3 matches: 2 in the Pleading and 1 in Docket. Those were not decrees but maybe part of motions. We might need to check if there are any other decrees, e.g., \"decree\" in Order to File Discovery Requests etc. But likely not. The \"Opinion of the Court\" might contain a decree? But it's an opinion, not a decree. The \"Initial Scheduling Order\" etc. But we need only substantive obligations ordered by court: consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions. The docket entries of motions granted are orders. Are these considered \"decrees\"? They are orders. The question: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders. Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court.\" So each order that imposes a duty or obligation. The docket entries for motions granted are orders that grant motions; they are orders. Should we extract those? The previous extraction did. But are there other orders that impose obligations? The \"order to file discovery requests\" etc. Might be included. But are they in the docket? For each order, there might be a docket entry. But the docket entries list many orders. But we have only read parts of Docket. We haven't read other parts of Docket beyond 2000 tokens etc. But we saw matches only in the parts we scanned. However, there might be other orders in other parts of Docket that impose obligations, like \"ORDER Dismissing the State-Law Claim, Denying the Motion to Dismiss the Federal Claim, and Denying a Preliminary Injunction\" etc. Those are orders, but not necessarily obligations? They are orders to deny motions; those are obligations to the parties to proceed? But maybe not substantive obligations.\n\nThe Docket shows many orders; we may need to extract all \"ordered that\" statements that impose obligations. The previous extraction captured 10 orders, which are \"the motion for leave to appear pro hac vice, ECF No. X, is GRANTED\" which are orders granting motions. Are there other \"ordered that\" statements that are obligations? Eg \"ordered that the opinion issued on this date ... entered as the judgment of this Court\" is a decree. Also maybe \"ordered that the clerk ...?\" but likely not.\n\nLet's search again in Docket for \"ORDER.\" lines that include \"ordered that\". Already captured. But maybe there are other \"ORDER\" lines with \"ordered that\" after the ones we saw. Did we capture all? The search for \"ordered that\" returned 10 matches in Docket. That covers all found. So likely no other orders that impose obligations in Docket. But there may be other documents: e.g., \"Opinion of the Court\" may contain \"It is hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the opinion ...\". But we didn't search for that pattern in other documents. Let's search for \"decreed that\" across all docs. Or search for \"decreed\" pattern. Use search_document_regex across all docs for \"decreed that\".<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"decreed that\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "decreed that", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12954, "completion_tokens": 995, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But the requirement: extract all significant terms of decrees. The Docket includes 10 terms. But there may be other decree terms in other documents (e.g., Opinions of the Court). The key may require all terms of decrees in all documents. We need to find all decree terms. Likely the opinions contain orders, judgments. We need to search for \"decree\" or \"ordered that\" etc in other documents. There are many unvisited documents. We need to find all decree terms across the corpus. The initial extraction used Docket only. But other documents may have other decrees. We should search all documents for \"ordered that\" or \"decreed that\" etc. We already did search on all documents for \"ordered that\" and \"decreed that\" but only found matches in Docket. However we haven't searched all other documents. The search results only returned matches for Docket because other docs may not contain those patterns. But decree terms could be in opinions like \"Opinion of the Court\" or \"Order Compelling Discovery\". Those are orders, but may contain \"ordered that\" phrases. We should search all documents for \"ordered that\" again? Already done, only Docket. But maybe \"ordered\" without \"that\" could be present. But we need terms of decrees, i.e., substantive obligations ordered by court. That may be in \"Order Compelling Discovery\" etc. Let's do search_document_regex on all documents for \"ordered that\" again? But we saw only Docket. Let's search for \"ordered\" perhaps.

There is only one key: Significant_Terms_of_Decrees. We have 10 values extracted from Docket. But requirement: extract all distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. We have only 10 from Docket. But there might be more terms in other documents (e.g., orders, opinions). We should search for other decrees or orders. The key includes \"decree terms\" substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are court orders. We need to find all such terms across all documents. We have seen only Docket entries: orders granted for motion to appear pro hac vice. Those are orders but not substantive obligations like a decree. They are orders granting motions. Are those \"significant terms of decrees\"? They are orders, but likely not substantive obligations? However the checklist may consider any order that includes substantive terms, like \"ordered that\" statements. The Docket entries are \"ORDERED that the motion for leave to appear pro hac vice is GRANTED\". That is a substantive order. We have 10 such entries. But other documents might contain \"ordered that\" statements with substantive obligations, like \"ordered that the parties pay $X\", \"ordered that the defendant must comply with X\". We haven't searched them yet.\n\nWe should search for \"ordered that\" or \"It is hereby ordered\" patterns across all other documents. Already step 14 did search for \"ORDERED that|It is hereby ordered\" across all docs and found 10 matches all in Docket. So there are no other matches. But step 13 searched in a subset of docs and found 0. Step 14 across all docs found only Docket matches. So likely all orders with \"ordered that\" are in Docket. But there might be decree terms that don't use \"ordered that\" but still are orders with substantive obligations. For example, \"It is hereby ordered that the parties shall...\" Could be but we didn't find. There may be other patterns like \"The court orders that\" or \"The court hereby orders\" or \"The court orders the following\". We might search for \"court orders\" but that might be too broad. But we can search for \"orders that\" maybe.\n\nHowever the checklist item specifically: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees: The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders. Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless expressly incorporated into the order.\" So we need to identify any consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions. These could appear in orders like \"The court orders that the parties ...\", \"The court enters a consent decree that ...\", \"The court orders that the defendant shall ...\". They might appear in other documents like \"Opinion of the Court\" or \"Order\" documents. We haven't searched them.\n\nIn the document catalog, many orders exist: \"Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim, Denying the Motion to Dismiss the Federal Claim, and Denying a Preliminary Injunction\" etc. They might contain substantive obligations. However those orders are likely not \"consent decrees\" but \"orders\" with orders to dismiss. We need to check if they contain substantive obligations beyond dismissal. Maybe not. The check may still want them.\n\nBut we need to extract all distinct values of this item. That means each unique term (like \"The motion for leave to appear pro hac vice is GRANTED.\") Already extracted 10. But if there are other substantive orders in other docs, we need to add them.\n\nWe should search for patterns like \"the court orders that\" or \"the court hereby orders that\" across other documents. Let's search for \"court orders that\" or \"court hereby orders that\". But could be many false positives. But we can search for \"court orders that\" across all docs.\n\nAlso we might search for \"ordered that\" again but we already did. But maybe there is \"ordered that\" in other docs that were not found due to search restrictions? Step 14 searched all docs and found 10 matches all in Docket. So maybe no other.\n\nLet's also search for \"orders that\" or \"order that\" patterns. Use regex \"ordered that\" may catch \"ordered that\" exactly. But other docs may use \"orders that\" or \"orders the\" etc.\n\nWe could search for \"orders that\" maybe. But we need to ensure we don't include irrelevant.\n\nMaybe we should search for \"ordered that\" but with case-insensitivity and multiline. Already done. So likely only Docket matches.\n\nBut there might be \"Order No. X\" in other docs with terms like \"the court orders that the parties pay $...\". But search didn't catch because pattern may not include \"ordered that\". We could search for \"order that\" or \"orders that\". But we risk including many. But we can narrow to \"court orders that\" or \"court hereby orders that\". Let's search for \"court orders that\" across all docs.\n\nAlternatively, we can search for \"consent decree\" or \"stated\" but not.\n\nI think only Docket has substantive decree terms. So we might stop. But check if the check requires all distinct values. We have 10 values from Docket. Are those all? Let's confirm that there are no other orders with substantive terms in other documents. We can search for \"ordered that\" again but maybe we missed due to case-insensitivity? Step 14 used pattern \"ORDERED that|It is hereby ordered\" with flags? They didn't specify flags. But we can assume default case-sensitive? They didn't set IGNORECASE. So maybe some matches were missed because not uppercase. But the text may be uppercase. But many orders might be lowercase. We can search again with IGNORECASE.\n\nLet's do search_document_regex across all docs for pattern \"ordered that\" with IGNORECASE. That might pick up more. Also \"It is hereby ordered\" with IGNORECASE. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n  \"pattern\": \"(?i)ordered that|it is hereby ordered\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 20,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)ordered that|it is hereby ordered", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11584, "completion_tokens": 1322, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have extracted 10 values for Significant_Terms_of_Decrees from Docket. Are there more? We need to check other documents for decrees: e.g., Opinion of the Court, Order on Merits, etc. Possibly there are orders that contain \"ordered that\" or \"decreed that\". We have not extracted from those. We need to search for \"ordered that\" in those documents. We have already searched all documents for \"ordered that\" and found only in Docket. But maybe other decisions have \"decreed that\" or \"ordered that\" but not captured by regex? Let's examine: Step 12 search for \"decreed that\" found only in Docket. Step 13 search for \"ordered that\" across 13 documents (subset) returned 0 matches. Step 14 and 15 same.\n\nHowever, maybe some documents contain \"It is hereby ordered\" or \"It is hereby decreed\". But search did not find. Could be that there are orders that are not using \"ordered that\" but use \"It is hereby ordered\" or \"decreed that\" but regex didn't match due to case? They used case-insensitive? Step 15 used pattern \"(?i)ordered that|it is hereby ordered\" so it should catch. But still only Docket.\n\nThus likely all significant terms of decrees are captured from Docket. Are there any \"decree\" terms in other documents that are not court orders? But the requirement says include consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders. If any other documents contain such orders, they'd have \"ordered that\" etc. So likely none.\n\nThus the checklist key is complete with 10 values.\n\nWe must ensure that no other relevant values exist. We should double-check if any of the other documents contain \"decree\" or \"decreed that\" but maybe not captured. We could search specifically for \"decree\" across all documents to see if any other matches. But previous search for \"decree\" found only 3 matches in Docket and in motion documents. Those were not likely orders. Let's check the matches: they were in Defendant's Consolidated Motion and Response, and Docket. But those are not orders. So likely no more.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut let's double-check that the 10 values from Docket are indeed all distinct terms. Could be there are other decree terms in the docket beyond the 10 we captured? Let's see the docket matches: 12 matches in Docket for \"ordered that\" but the appended 10 values earlier maybe included only 10 of them; maybe there were 12? Let's check: Step 7 appended 10 values for the key. Step 11 found 12 matches. But maybe some matches didn't contain substantive obligations? But the appended 10 might be correct. We should verify if any other matches contain substantive obligations that were omitted. Let's review the match list from Step 11: there were 12 matches. We need to check each match to see if they contain a substantive obligation.\n\nList of matches (from Step 11):\n\nMatch 1: tokens 3739-3939 – about motion for leave to appear pro hac vice, granted. That's a substantive obligation? The order is granting motion. That might be considered a decree term: \"the motion for leave to appear pro hac vice, ECF No. 20, is GRANTED.\" That is a substantive obligation. So that's one.\n\nMatch 2: tokens 3829-4029 – similar for ECF No. 19.\n\nMatch 3: tokens 3916-4116 – also for ECF No. 21.\n\nMatch 4: tokens 4006-4206 – also for ECF No. 28.\n\nMatch 5: tokens 4153-4353 – also for ECF No. 29.\n\nMatch 6: tokens 4673-4873 – also for ECF No. 39.\n\nMatch 7: tokens 5926-6126 – also for ECF No. 44.\n\nMatch 8: tokens 6058-6258 – also for ECF No. 49.\n\nMatch 9: tokens 6190-6390 – also for ECF No. 50.\n\nMatch 10: tokens 9236-9436 – not sure what it contains; maybe also a motion for leave to appear pro hac vice, granted.\n\nMatch 11: tokens 10205-10405 – about a minute entry, a ruling that motion is granted.\n\nMatch 12: tokens 25154-25354 – about the order withholding issuance of the mandate is vacated, and opinion entered as judgment.\n\nThus there are 12 substantive obligations. The appended 10 values might have omitted two. Which ones? Let's check the appended values count: 10. We need to confirm which ones were appended. We don't have that list. But likely the appended 10 might have omitted the last two matches: maybe match 11 and 12? Or omitted match 10? Actually match 10 likely about \"It is ORDERED that the motion for leave to appear pro hac vice\" etc. That could be one. Also match 11 maybe a ruling, and match 12 a vacated order and opinion entered as judgment. Those might have been omitted.\n\nThus we need to ensure we extracted all distinct value terms. We should read the missing token ranges to confirm.\n\nWe have visited token ranges: 0-2000, 3739-4353, 4673-4873, 5926-6390, 9236-9436, 10205-10405, 25154-25366. The ranges covering matches 1-5 (3739-4353 covers 1-5), 6 (4673-4873), 7-9 (5926-6390), 10 (9236-9436), 11 (10205-10405), 12 (25154-25366). All matches covered. So we have read all relevant text. But the appended 10 values may have missed two. We need to check matches 11 and 12.\n\nLet's read the content for match 11 and 12 again: we saw text above in Step 11.\n\nMatch 11 token 10205-10405 snippet:\n\n```\n/2022 02:00 PM before JUDGE ROBERT L HINKLE.

Might be part of docket entries. It may not contain \"ordered that\". But maybe the order is earlier. But we have not captured it. Wait, the snippet shows docket entries, not the order. The order might be earlier tokens not included. But the match 10 was for \"ordered that\" pattern? Wait match 10 tokens 9236-9436: we saw snippet but not \"ordered that\". Perhaps the snippet includes \"ORDER\" earlier but truncated. Let's re-open match 10: We saw earlier in Step 11 match 10 tokens 9236-9436, but the snippet we saw is maybe from earlier part of docket. Actually the snippet we saw includes \"ZPATRICK\" etc. But might not have the order. But the match was for \"ordered that|It is hereby ordered\". Wait the snippet shows no \"ordered that\". So maybe it was match 10 for \"ordered that\" in a different context? Let's check: The snippet shows docket lines 79,80,81 but no \"ordered that\". So maybe the match 10 is not relevant for decree terms.\n\nBut we saw earlier that match 1-5 and 6-9 are all motions for leave to appear pro hac vice, granted. Those are decree terms. The 10th match might be some other order that was not captured. But we need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe match 10 is not a decree term; but we need to include all distinct values. We need to list all 12? Let's check matches 1-5, 6-9: that's 8 matches. Add match 10 maybe 1 match, match 11, match 12: total 10? Wait, 1-5 =5, 6 =1, 7-9=3 => total 9 so far. Add match 10 =1 => 10. Add match 11 =1 => 11. Add match 12 =1 => 12. So total 12 distinct obligations. But earlier appended 10 values, so two missing: match 10 maybe omitted? But match 10 might not be a decree term. Let's check the snippet again: It has docket entries for motions, but no \"ordered that\". So maybe match 10 is irrelevant.\n\nLet's re-evaluate: The match 10 tokens 9236-9436 snippet: It shows docket entries but no \"ordered that\". But the search pattern was \"(?i)ordered that|it is hereby ordered\". So match 10 must contain that pattern. But the snippet displayed didn't show \"ordered that\". Maybe the snippet is truncated or the match includes earlier token containing \"ordered that\" but not captured in snippet due to context. We might need to read a bit earlier or later to see the actual order. Since we have read tokens 9236-9436, which covers the snippet. But maybe the \"ordered that\" is in tokens before 9236 or after 9436. But we didn't read that.

The task is to extract all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. We need to ensure we have captured all decree terms across all documents. We used Docket only so far. There may be other documents with orders or decrees where \"ordered that\" or \"decreed that\" etc. We might have missed other documents. Also we might need to confirm no other documents contain orders. The catalog shows many documents. We should search for \"ordered that\" or \"decreed that\" across all docs. Already did search_document_regex with pattern \"(?i)ordered that|it is hereby ordered\" and found 12 matches all in Docket. But there may be other orders like \"ORDER. Accordingly, it is ORDERED that...\" etc. But those are motions decisions, not necessarily decrees? However, a \"decree\" is a court order. The requirement: \"The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders.\" So we need all such substantive obligations. The matches we found are mostly orders granting leave to appear pro hac vice, etc. Those are substantive obligations? They are orders granting motions, but not necessarily substantive obligations of the parties? They are obligations: the court orders the motion is granted, so the parties must comply. That may count. But the earlier 10 values extracted may include all such out of Docket. But maybe other documents contain other orders, e.g., Order on the Merits, Order on Depositions, etc. These may contain substantive obligations. We need to search those documents for \"ordered that\" or \"decreed that\" or \"it is hereby ordered\" etc. We haven't read them. The document catalog shows many orders. We need to find all matches. We should do a search on all documents for pattern \"ordered that\" or \"decreed that\" or \"it is hereby ordered\". We already searched for \"ordered that|it is hereby ordered\" on all documents and found 12 matches all in Docket. That may mean other documents have no such patterns. But maybe other patterns like \"the court orders\" or \"the court hereby orders\" or \"the court orders that\" etc. Could also be \"the court orders that\" or \"the court orders\" etc. Let's search for \"the court orders\" or \"court orders that\" etc. Also \"the court orders\" with regex maybe.

But there might be a consent decree document not identified; maybe \"Exhibit 1 - Executive Order\" but that's a separate. But the \"Exhibit 1 - Executive Order\" is a government order, not a court decree.\n\nWe need to ensure we captured all relevant substantive obligations. Let's search for \"ordered that\" again but maybe some docs not captured due to case sensitivity or formatting. We used case-insensitive. So likely captured all.

But are there other decrees in other documents? We need all distinct decree terms. Decree terms are substantive obligations ordered by the court. We have terms like \"motion for leave to appear pro hac vice, ECF No. 20, is GRANTED.\" That is an order; but are these considered decree terms? The term is \"granted\" of leave to appear. That's a court order; but the checklist wants substantive obligations ordered by the court. The order to grant leave is a decree term. So we captured those 10 entries. However, there might be other decrees in other documents, e.g., in the Order on the Merits, or the Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim, etc. Also maybe in the \"Opinion of the Court\" there are orders. But we haven't searched those.\n\nWe should search for \"ordered that\" or \"it is hereby ordered\" across other documents. Already searched all documents for \"ordered that\" and found only in Docket. But maybe there are other forms like \"the court orders\" or \"the order is\" etc. We should search for \"order that\" or \"order the\" etc. But the earlier search for \"(?i)the court orders\" found 0. But maybe terms like \"the court orders\" do not appear. Might be \"the court orders that\" etc. We need to search for \"orders that\". But we need to extract all decree terms. There might be \"the court orders that the parties shall...\" etc. Let's search for \"orders that\" or \"order that\" across documents. Use search_document_regex. Also check for \"decree that\". But earlier search for \"decree\" found 3 matches: 2 in the motion document and 1 in docket. But maybe other documents contain \"decree\" in non-court context? The search found 3 matches overall. But we might need to check if those matches include decree terms beyond the docket. Let's inspect those matches. They were from the motion document and docket. We haven't read the motion document. Let's read the motion document around the matched region. We need to identify the 2 matches from the motion document. We need to read that portion.\n\nSo next step: search_document_regex on the \"Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law, and Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" for \"decree\" pattern. Or we can read the entire document to capture any orders. But we should be efficient. Let's search for \"ordered that\" in that document again, but we did earlier for all documents. It returned only matched in docket. So likely no \"ordered that\" in that document. But maybe the motion document contains an order in a different pattern like \"the court orders\" or \"the order is\" etc. Let's search for \"orders\" maybe. But we need to capture all substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees, stipulated judgments, injunctions, etc. For each such decree, we need to capture the term.\n\nWe have only 10 terms from docket.

Currently we have 10 from Docket. But likely other documents contain more. We need to search for \"ordered that\" etc. But we have many matches. We should search for \"decree\" or \"decreed\" in other documents. We already searched all documents for \"decree\" earlier and found 3 matches. Those were in Docket and the other two probably in other docs? Actually step 8 found 3 matches: 2 in Defendant's Consolidated Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law, and Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction, 1 in Docket. Wait \"decree\" in a pleading? That might be a mis- pattern. But those might not be court orders.\n\nWe need to extract terms of decrees: substantive obligations ordered by the court. The docket \"ordered that\" includes many orders granting motions, but are those obligations? They are orders granting motions, not necessarily substantive obligations? The specification says substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders. So \"ordered that\" might not be substantive obligations but orders to grant motions. The 10 values extracted earlier may not be correct. They might be the 10 \"ordered that\" lines from docket. But those are orders granting motions, not substantive obligations. But the task says \"extract the decree terms\" from legal documents. The 10 values likely are the 10 \"ordered that\" lines, but maybe they are not the correct items.\n\nWe need to review the documents that contain decrees: order documents, opinions, maybe the \"Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim, Denying the Motion to Dismiss the Federal Claim, and Denying a Preliminary Injunction\" might contain substantive obligations like \"the court orders that the defendant pay X\" etc. We need to search for \"orders that\" but we did search. But we need to parse those order documents for substantive obligations.\n\nAlso \"Order Denying the Motion for § 1292(b) Certification\" might contain \"the court orders that\" lines.\n\nThus we need to read those orders. The catalog shows partial coverage. Let's read the Order Denying the Motion for § 1292(b) Certification, maybe from tokens 306-506 we saw part but not full. We need the entire order. Let's search in that doc for \"order\" or \"orders\". The doc is 1,182 tokens. Let's read entire doc tokens 0-1182. That may include multiple orders.\n\nAlso the \"Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim, Denying the Motion to Dismiss the Federal Claim, and Denying a Preliminary Injunction\" is 11,197 tokens; we only saw 6900-7100. We need to read the entire doc.\n\nAlso other order docs: Initial Scheduling Order, Order Compelling Discovery, Order Denying Motions to Intervene, Order on Depositions of the Governor and Chief of Staff, Order on the Merits, Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses, Pretrial Order, etc. They may contain substantive obligations.\n\nAlso opinion of the court may include terms.\n\nThus we need to systematically search for \"orders that\" or \"ordered that\" within each order document.\n\nMaybe easier: search all documents for \"orders that\" pattern. Already did search and found only 2 matches across all docs. But maybe we need \"ordered that\" pattern. That earlier gave 12 matches in Docket only. But maybe other orders have \"ordered that\" but the search didn't find because of case or formatting. We could search for \"ORDERED that\" with case-insensitive, but we did with uppercase? We had pattern \"ORDERED that|It is hereby ordered\". That found only in Docket. So maybe other orders don't use that phrase.\n\nMaybe they use \"the court orders that\". We searched for \"orders? that\" pattern and got only 2 matches: one in Order Denying the Motion for § 1292(b) Certification, one in Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim, etc. The match example did not show the \"orders that\" phrase, but the snippet might contain other text.\n\nThus we need to read those docs fully to extract any substantive obligations.\n\nGiven time we can focus on those two orders.

That's under 10k tokens. Let's read entire doc.\n\nAlso Order Denying Motions to Intervene: we saw 340-540; that likely contains items 1-3. But maybe more beyond 540? The doc length 605 tokens; 340-540 covers 200 tokens; maybe rest 0-339 and 541-605. Let's read entire doc.\n\nOrder Dismissing State-Law Claim etc: length 11,197 tokens. We saw 6900-7100 and 10959-11159. Need to read entire doc to capture all items. That's >10k tokens, so we need to read in chunks of <=10k. We can read 0-11000 first chunk, then 11000-11159? Wait 11,197 tokens, so we can read 0-11000 and 11000-11197. That's two calls.\n\nAlso Order on Depositions: length 983 tokens; we saw 519-719; need rest. Read entire.\n\nOrder on the Merits: length 21,027; we saw 20791-20991; need rest. But 21k >10k, need multiple chunks. We'll read 0-10000, 10000-20000, 20000-21027 etc.\n\nPretrial Order: length 617; we saw 364-564; need rest. Read entire.\n\nAlso Initial Scheduling Order: length 932; we saw 72-272; need rest. Read entire.\n\nAlso there may be other orders not yet seen: \"Order\" (153 tokens). Could contain a term maybe. Also \"Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses\" (203 tokens). Also maybe \"Defendant's Motion for Protective Order\" etc. But these are \"Pleading / Motion / Brief\" not orders. We only need decree terms: only orders, not motions. But orders can be in \"Order\" document. We should read those.\n\nAlso there may be other orders in the unvisited \"Opinion of the Court (001)\" and \"(002)\". Those not orders but opinions; they might have \"IT IS ORDERED\" too. But they are opinions, which are orders. Yes opinions contain orders. We need to read those too. But they are long. But we can search for \"IT IS ORDERED\" pattern in those docs. That may produce many matches. But we can read them in chunks.\n\nWe need to ensure capture all distinct terms. There may be duplicate terms across documents; we need unique values.\n\nWe should compile list of all terms from all relevant orders.\n\nGiven complexity, maybe we should search for \"IT IS ORDERED:\" across all documents and read each match context to get items. But we already have many matches from step 22. But some documents not visited. We could search again with regex on all docs to see matches beyond those we saw. Step 22 found 8 matches across documents; each match is in a document. But some documents not visited might have matches too. Let's search again with pattern \"IT IS ORDERED:\" across all documents to capture all matches; we may get more matches. Then we can read each match's context to extract terms.\n\nBut step 22 already gave matches for 8 documents: Initial Scheduling Order, Order Compelling Discovery, Order Denying Motions to Intervene, Order Denying §1292(b) Certification, Order Dismissing state-law claim, Order on Depositions, Order on the Merits, Pretrial Order. Are there any other orders with \"IT IS ORDERED:\"? Might be \"Order\" (153 tokens) maybe also contains \"IT IS ORDERED:\"? Let's check. Search again.\n\nAlso \"Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses\" might contain \"IT IS ORDERED:\".\n\nAlso \"Order\" (153 tokens) maybe similar.\n\nAlso \"Order Compelling Discovery\" we already covered.\n\nWe should search again for \"IT IS ORDERED:\" across all documents to see any missing. Also maybe \"IT IS ORDERED:\" appears in \"Order Denying the Motion for § 1292(b) Certification\" but we already included.\n\nLet's do a search.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"IT IS ORDERED:\",\"flags\":[],\"top_k\":20,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "IT IS ORDERED:", "flags": [], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13364, "completion_tokens": 1279, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But the checklist item \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" may include terms from other orders too, not just Docket. We need all distinct terms. We have only 10 from Docket, but other orders may contain terms like \"grant\", \"deny\", \"order to compel\", etc. We should capture all significant terms of decrees across all documents. We need to search for \"IT IS ORDERED:\" sections across all documents. Many orders have \"IT IS ORDERED:\" and may contain substantive obligations. We need to extract each \"ordered that\" clause or \"IT IS ORDERED:\" line with subsequent obligations.\n\nWe already have 10 from Docket. But we might have missed orders like \"Order Compelling Discovery\" has \"IT IS ORDERED: 1. The motion to compel, ECF No. 81, is granted in part. 2. The defendant must produce all documents ...\". These are significant terms. Also \"Order Denying Motions to Intervene\" \"IT IS ORDERED: 1. Mr. Huminski’s motion for leave to intervene, ECF No. 9, is denied. ...\". \"Order Denying the Motion for § 1292(b) Certification\" has \"IT IS ORDERED: The motion for a § 1292(b) certification, ECF No. 60, is denied.\" \"Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim...\" includes \"IT IS ORDERED: 1. The motion for a preliminary injunction, ECF No. 3, is denied. 2. The motion to dismiss, ECF No. 30, is granted in part and denied in part.\" \"Order on Depositions...\" \"IT IS ORDERED: 1. The Governor’s motion, ECF No. 91, for a protective order ... is granted in part by consent.\" \"Order on the Merits\" \"IT IS ORDERED: The clerk must enter judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58 stating ...\". \"Pretrial Order\" \"IT IS ORDERED: 1. The trial remains set ... 2. The attorneys ... 3. The motions to quash subpoenas ... 4. The motion to bar the plaintiff from calling the defendant as a witness, ...\". Also Initial Scheduling Order \"IT IS ORDERED: 1. The parties’ proposed preliminary-injunction schedule, ECF No. 10, is adopted. 2. The deadline ...\".\n\nThus we have many more terms. The earlier step 7 appended 10 values from Docket. But we need to add all distinct terms across all documents. So we need to read or search each order to extract the terms.\n\nWe have partial coverage of many orders: we have seen the \"IT IS ORDERED:\" sections for each order via search results. But we haven't extracted terms from those orders. We should perform `append_checklist` to add terms from these orders.\n\nWe need to add each distinct term as a separate value. We must provide evidence for each. We can batch multiple entries in one append_checklist call.\n\nWe should carefully list each term. Let's enumerate each order and list the ordered obligations.\n\nFrom Docket: 10 terms already captured. We don't need to re-add.\n\nFrom Initial Scheduling Order: Terms:\n1. The parties’ proposed preliminary-injunction schedule, ECF No. 10, is adopted.\n2. The deadline for the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(f) attorney conference is September 23, 2022.\n\nFrom Order Compelling Discovery:\n1. The motion to compel, ECF No. 81, is granted in part.\n2. The defendant must produce all documents described in production requests 1, 2, 3, and 4, modified as follows: (a) Documents created on or after August 17, 2022—the date when this lawsuit was filed—need [text truncated]. We need to capture the full clause: \"The defendant must produce all documents described in production requests 1, 2, 3, and 4, modified as follows: (a) Documents created on or after August 17, 2022—the date when this lawsuit was filed—need [something].\"\n\nWe need to read the full text for that clause. We have the match snippet but truncated. We may need to read more tokens around 678-878 to capture full text. We can call read_document for that range but we already have 678-878. It might include full clause. But snippet may be incomplete. We should read a larger range, maybe 678-1100. Let's read tokens 678-1100.\n\nAlso Order Denying Motions to Intervene: Terms:\n1. Mr. Huminski’s motion for leave to intervene, ECF No. 9, is denied.\n2. Mr. LoRusso’s “amended complaint,” ECF No. 12, is deemed a motion for leave to intervene. The motion is denied.\nWe might also include that notice of appearance, ECF No. 25, and affidavit, ECF No. 26, are struck.\n\nAlso Order Denying the Motion for § 1292(b) Certification: Term:\n1. The motion for a § 1292(b) certification, ECF No. 60, is denied.\n\nOrder Dismissing the State-Law Claim, Denying the Motion to Dismiss the Federal Claim, and Denying a Preliminary Injunction: Terms:\n1. The motion for a preliminary injunction, ECF No. 3, is denied.\n2. The motion to dismiss, ECF No. 30, is granted in part and denied in part. (Also state-law claim dismissed; federal claim not dismissed, but the clause says \"The state-law claim is dismissed without prejudice based on the Eleventh Amendment. The federal claim is not dismissed.\" Might be separate terms? We could treat each distinct obligation: \"The state-law claim is dismissed without prejudice based on the Eleventh Amendment.\" and \"The federal claim is not dismissed.\" But \"not dismissed\" is a negative. But it's a term. We should capture both.\n\nOrder on Depositions of the Governor and Chief of Staff: Terms:\n1. The Governor’s motion, ECF No. 91, for a protective order barring depositions of the Governor and Mr. Uthmeier is granted in part by consent.\n2. By November 3, 2022, the Governor must file a notice stating whether he waives the right to [something]. We need full clause.\n\nOrder on the Merits: Terms:\n1. The clerk must enter judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58 stating, “The plaintiff Andrew H. Warren’s claims against the defendant Ron DeSantis arising under state law are dismissed without prejudice based on the Eleventh Amendment. Mr. Warren’s claims against Mr. DeSantis arising under federal law are dismissed on the merits with prejudice.” The clerk must close the file.\n\nPretrial Order: Terms:\n1. The trial remains set for Tuesday, November 29, 2022, at 9:00 a.m.\n2. The attorneys, members of their staffs, and named parties may bring laptops, electronic tablets, cellular telephones, and other electronic devices into the courtroom.\n3. The motions to quash subpoenas, ECF Nos. 119 and 129, are denied as moot.\n4. The motion to bar the plaintiff from calling the defendant as a witness, [missing clause]. We need the full clause.\n\nWe also might have other orders not visited: \"Opinion of the Court (001)\" etc. These might contain \"IT IS ORDERED:\" sections. But we haven't visited them. We need to search all documents again for \"IT IS ORDERED:\" which we did and got 8 matches. That includes all orders we considered. So likely we captured all orders. But we still haven't extracted terms from some orders.\n\nThus we need to read the content of each order to capture the obligations. We have some partial coverage. We'll need to read the full range for each order. We have partially visited tokens for each order. For example, Order Compelling Discovery we saw 678-878. Might need more beyond 878 to capture entire \"The defendant must produce...\" clause. Let's read 678-1100.\n\nSimilarly, Order Denying Motions to Intervene we saw 340-540. Might need beyond 540 to capture full clause or notice of appearance etc. But we saw some part. We'll read 340-700.\n\nOrder Dismissing the State-Law Claim we saw 10959-11159. Might need beyond 11159 to capture \"The state-law claim is dismissed...\" etc. Let's read 10959-11250.\n\nOrder on Depositions we saw 519-719. Might need beyond 719 to capture full clause. Let's read 519-900.\n\nOrder on the Merits we saw 20791-20991. Might need beyond 20991 to capture rest. Let's read 20791-21050.\n\nPretrial Order we saw 364-564. Might need beyond 564 to capture clause. Let's read 364-800.\n\nAlso Initial Scheduling Order we saw 72-272. Might need beyond 272 to capture second clause. Let's read 72-400.\n\nThus we will issue multiple read_document calls. But we can only do one per turn. We need to choose one. We should pick the next document that hasn't been fully read. E.g., Initial Scheduling Order. Let's read 72-400 to capture both terms.\n\nThus next action: read_document for Initial Scheduling Order tokens 72-400.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Initial Scheduling Order\",\"start_token\":72,\"end_token\":400}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Initial Scheduling Order", "start_token": 72, "end_token": 400}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14081, "completion_tokens": 2033, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But we need to ensure that we have captured all distinct values across all documents. Are there more decrees? The search earlier found 10 matches in Docket, and we appended those. But maybe other documents contain decrees. Let's check other documents: Order Compelling Discovery etc. They may have orders, but \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" refers to substantive obligations ordered by the court, i.e., decrees. Those could be in other Order documents like Order Denying etc. But the earlier extraction only used Docket's 10 order lines. The other orders also contain \"IT IS ORDERED:\" with other orders, e.g., Order Compelling Discovery has order items 1 and 2. Those are substantive obligations but maybe not \"decrees\"? They are orders. Terms of decrees could include actions like \"the motion to compel is granted in part\" etc. That is a substantive order. Are these considered \"significant terms of decrees\"? Likely yes. We need to extract all such terms from all documents. So we need to read more documents to capture these terms.\n\nWe have some orders partially visited. We've seen Order Compelling Discovery: only read tokens 678-878 containing \"IT IS ORDERED:\" and two items. We need to read the rest of that order to see if there are more items. Also Order Denying Motions to Intervene: we saw part with items 1-3. There might be more. Order Denying the Motion for § 1292(b) Certification: fully visited, we saw it had only one order: denial. That's a term. Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim: partially visited, we saw items 1-2. Might have more. Order on Depositions: partially visited, saw items 1-2. Order on the Merits: partially visited, saw item 1. Pretrial Order: partially visited, saw items 1-4 maybe incomplete. Initial Scheduling Order we read 3 items; good.\n\nWe need to extract all significant terms of decrees from all documents. That includes all \"IT IS ORDERED:\" items across these orders. So we need to read those documents fully to capture all items.\n\nWe currently have 10 values from Docket. We need to add more from other orders. Let's compile plan:\n\n- For each order document (Order Compelling Discovery, Order Denying Motions to Intervene, Order Denying § 1292(b) Certification (already captured 1), Order Dismissing..., Order on Depositions, Order on the Merits, Pretrial Order, Initial Scheduling Order (already captured 3 items). Also maybe other orders like \"Order to File Discovery Requests\" etc. But those are small.\n\n- We need to read entire documents or at least all segments with \"IT IS ORDERED:\" and capture items.\n\nBetter to search for \"IT IS ORDERED:\" across all documents and then read each match area. But we've already seen the matches. But we still need to read the full content of each order to ensure we capture all items. For some orders, we only saw part of the matches. For example, Order Compelling Discovery had 1 match but we only read 678-878 which includes items 1-2, but maybe there are no more items. It might have only those two. But we need to confirm.\n\nSimilarly, Order Denying Motions to Intervene: we saw items 1-3, likely all. But we should confirm no more beyond token 540. Might be more later? Document is 605 tokens; we saw only 340-540 portion; maybe items beyond 540? But we didn't read 540-605. Let's read that part.\n\nOrder Denying § 1292(b) Certification: fully visited, contains only the denial; we should add that as a term.\n\nOrder Dismissing: partially visited; we saw items 1-2. Might have more beyond 11159. We need to read rest of that doc.\n\nOrder on Depositions: partially visited; we saw items 1-2. Might have more beyond 719.\n\nOrder on the Merits: partially visited; we saw item 1. Might have more beyond 20991.\n\nPretrial Order: partially visited; we saw items 1-4 but maybe incomplete. Let's read rest.\n\nAlso maybe there are other orders like \"Order Denying the Motion for § 1292(b) Certification\" already done. \"Order Compelling Discovery\" we read 678-878. That entire doc may only include items 1-2. But confirm.\n\nAlso \"Order Denying the Motion for § 1292(b) Certification\" we captured 1.\n\nWe also need to consider the Docket had 10 items. Might we have missed any other orders in Docket? We saw 10 items. Possibly all.\n\nThus total values likely >10. Let's count: Docket 10, Initial Scheduling Order 3, Order Compelling Discovery 2, Order Denying Motions to Intervene 3, Order Denying § 1292(b) Certification 1, Order Dismissing 2, Order on Depositions 2, Order on the Merits 1, Pretrial Order 4. Total 10+3+2+3+1+2+2+1+4 = 28. We need to extract all 28.\n\nWe must read documents for each. But we can batch multiple reads? We can read each document separately. But we might need to use read_document for each.\n\nWe need to avoid re-reading already visited ranges. For each doc:\n\n- Order Compelling Discovery: visited 678-878. The doc is 1606 tokens. We should read tokens 0-678 and 878-1606 to capture any other content. But likely no other order items beyond 878. The order items are within 678-878. So no need to read rest for terms. But might have preamble before 678. But order items are within 678-878. So we can skip reading rest, but maybe there are order items earlier? Unlikely, but could be. But to be safe, read the whole doc? But 1606 tokens <10k, fine. Let's read entire doc tokens 0-1606.\n\n- Order Denying Motions to Intervene: visited 340-540. Doc 605 tokens, so read 0-605.\n\n- Order Denying § 1292(b) Certification: fully visited. No need.\n\n- Order Dismissing: partially visited 10959-11159. Doc length 11197 tokens. We need to read entire doc or at least the rest beyond 11159. We should read 0-10959 and 11159-11197. But we might just read entire doc tokens 0-11197. That's 11197 tokens <10k. Good.\n\n- Order on Depositions: partially visited 519-719. Doc 983 tokens. Read 0-983.\n\n- Order on the Merits: partially visited 20791-20991. Doc 21027 tokens. Read 0-21027.\n\n- Pretrial Order: partially visited 364-564. Doc 617 tokens. Read 0-617.\n\n- Initial Scheduling Order: partially visited 72-400. Doc 932 tokens. We need rest 400-932. Read 400-932.\n\n- Docket: partially visited tokens 0-2000, 3737-4353, 4671-4873, 5924-6390, 9200-9500, 10203-10405, 25154-25366. Docket is 25547 tokens. We have many tokens but not all. But we only saw 10 items from Docket. There might be more items beyond 25366. We need to read the rest tokens 25366-25547. But maybe Docket has only those 10 items. But let's read rest to confirm no more.\n\nBut reading entire Docket is 25547 tokens >10k? Actually 25547 >10k, so can't read entire in one call. We can read remaining tokens in chunks. But we can also read 25366-25547 (~181 tokens). And maybe earlier sections 2000-3737? We have 0-2000 and 3737-4353, but not 2000-3737. That might contain more items. We need to read 2000-3737. Also 4353-4671? We have 4671-4873, so need 4353-4671. Also 4873-5924? We have 5924-6390, so missing 4873-5924. Also 6390-9200 missing. Also 10405-25154 missing. That's a lot. But we may not need all, but maybe there are more items. But we only saw 10 items from Docket. Could there be more? Docket likely contains many docket entries; each docket entry may have \"IT IS ORDERED:\" lines. The 10 we captured may be all. But not sure. But given the docket entries list many orders maybe only those 10. But for completeness, maybe we should read the rest of Docket to ensure no other 'IT IS ORDERED:' lines. But reading all may exceed token limit, but we can read in segments.\n\nGiven the time, we might risk missing items if we don't read all Docket. But we can search for \"IT IS ORDERED:\" again but we already did; it found only 8 matches in the Docket (the 10 earlier?). Wait earlier search found 8 matches in Docket. But then we appended 10 values for the key. That suggests we had 10 'IT IS ORDERED:' items. So maybe the 8 matches were earlier but later we appended 10? Actually Step 7 appended 10 values from Docket. Steps 21-24 search also found items but still 8 matches. But that was after reading more tokens maybe. But maybe the docket has exactly 10 items.\n\nThus we may not need to read more Docket. Good.\n\nNow we need to read the other orders.\n\nWe already read Initial Scheduling Order 0-400. But we didn't read 400-932. That may have more items? The order had only 3 items. Likely no more beyond 400. But we can skip.\n\nNow we should read Order Compelling Discovery, Order Denying Motions to Intervene, Order Dismissing, Order on Depositions, Order on the Merits, Pretrial Order. Let's read those.\n\nAlso we need to append the terms for each order to the checklist.\n\nWe need to ensure not to duplicate items. Already appended Docket items. We need to append new ones.\n\nThus next action: read one of the orders. We can read Order Compelling Discovery. Then append its terms.\n\nWe should use read_document on Order Compelling Discovery tokens 0-1606. Then append.\n\nLet's choose that.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Order Compelling Discovery\",\"start_token\":0,\"end_token\":1606}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Compelling Discovery", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1606}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13338, "completion_tokens": 2351, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But there may be more from other documents: other orders may contain significant terms. We need to extract all distinct values of Significant_Terms_of_Decrees from any document. Currently we have 10 from Docket. We need to check other orders: Initial Scheduling Order has some terms: \"adopted\" schedule, deadline for conference. But that's not a decree term? It's an order. But terms: \"The parties’ proposed preliminary-injunction schedule, ECF No. 10, is adopted.\" That's a court order. It imposes schedule. So it's a term. Also deadlines. So need to extract those terms too.\n\nAlso Order Compelling Discovery has many terms: motion to compel granted in part; defendant must produce documents; deadlines etc. These are terms.\n\nOrder Denying Motions to Intervene: orders denial of motions, but that's a term? The order includes \"Mr. Huminski’s motion for leave to intervene denied.\" That's a term (court order). Also other orders: Order Denying the Motion for § 1292(b) Certification: denial. Order Dismissing State-Law Claim: multiple terms: motion for preliminary injunction denied; motion to dismiss granted in part and denied in part; state-law claim dismissed etc. Order on Depositions: order granting protective order; order requiring Governor to file notice. Order on the Merits: judgment under FCPC 58; claims dismissed. Pretrial Order: trial remains set; attorneys may bring devices; motions to quash denied; motion to bar plaintiff to call defendant denied? Let's read. Also there may be orders in the other documents not yet visited. But we likely need to extract all terms from all orders. We have partially visited others; we need to read remaining parts.\n\nWe have partially visited some orders; we need to read unviewed sections to capture all terms. Let's list orders and coverage:\n\n- Docket: partially visited; but we already extracted 10 from Docket. But there may be more beyond token 2000? The coverage shows many ranges but maybe not all. Might need to read more tokens of Docket to find other \"ordered that\" statements. But we only saw 10 earlier. Maybe that's all. We can search again for \"ordered that\" in Docket. Already did search. But maybe more after 2000? We saw 10 matches earlier. But maybe some after 2000? The search returned 10 matches in Docket. So likely all.\n\n- Initial Scheduling Order: only 1 match; we saw 2 items in the order. Should extract those 2 terms. We need to read entire order to confirm if there are more?

The task: Extract the decree terms from legal documents. The checklist item: Significant_Terms_of_Decrees. Currently 10 values extracted from Docket. But there may be more terms in other documents. We need to extract all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. Must include each term as separate value with evidence. The current extraction has 10 values from Docket. But we must ensure completeness: search other documents for \"ordered that\" etc. We saw Step 24: search_document_regex on all documents pattern \"IT IS ORDERED:\" found 8 matches across multiple orders. Those orders include some terms. But they might have also \"ordered that\" patterns. The initial 10 values likely came from Docket's \"ordered that\" matches. But other orders may contain additional decree terms: e.g., Order Compelling Discovery, Order Denying Motions to Intervene, Order Denying the Motion for § 1292(b) Certification, Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim..., Order on Depositions of Governor, Order on the Merits, Pretrial Order. Each of these includes ordered terms (e.g., \"IT IS ORDERED: 1. ...\"). These are likely also significant terms of decrees. The initial extraction may have only captured Docket's 10 terms, but we need to capture all from all orders.\n\nThus we need to read or search these orders to extract terms. We have partially visited some: Order Compelling Discovery fully visited; we saw the ordered section: 1. motion to compel granted; 2. defendant must produce all documents described...; 3. ...; 4. deadlines; 5. attorneys must continue; 6. information ...; 7. ... etc. We need to extract each clause as a separate value. The evidence for each should be the verbatim snippet and location. The snippet is the clause itself. For each value, we need to capture text of the clause. For example: \"1. The motion to compel, ECF No. 81, is granted in part.\" We'll record that.\n\nBut we must also consider the other orders. For each order, we have partially visited but not fully. We might need to read the entire document to capture all \"IT IS ORDERED:\" clauses. But we have the matches from step 24 providing the matched text for each order, including the clause text. For example, Order Compelling Discovery match shows the clause list. We can use that evidence. For each order, we can extract the numbered list items.\n\nThus we can use the existing evidence from step 24. But need to confirm that the matched snippet includes all clauses. The snippet for Order Compelling Discovery covers items 1-7. Yes. For Order Denying Motions to Intervene, snippet contains 1-3. For Order Denying the §1292(b) Certification snippet contains 1. The motion denied. For Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim snippet contains items 1-2. For Order on Depositions snippet contains 1-2. For Order on the Merits snippet contains a single clause with the judgment. For Pretrial Order snippet contains items 1-4 (maybe more). Good.\n\nHowever, we might need to ensure we didn't miss any other orders with \"ordered that\" that were not captured by \"IT IS ORDERED:\" pattern. But step 24 shows 8 matches for \"IT IS ORDERED:\" across many orders. These likely cover all orders. The other orders may have \"ordered that\" but not \"IT IS ORDERED:\". Step 18 had matches for \"orders? that\" for two orders: Order Denying the Motion for § 1292(b) Certification and Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim. But those we already captured. The \"ordered that\" pattern is similar to \"It is ordered\" but maybe some orders use \"ordered that\". But the search results show only those 8 matches. So we likely captured all orders.\n\nThus we need to append all these clause values to the checklist. Currently we have 10 values from Docket. We need to add the ones from other orders. Let's count: Order Compelling Discovery has items 1-7 = 7 values. Order Denying Motions to Intervene has items 1-3 = 3. Order Denying §1292(b) Certification has 1 value. Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim has 2 values. Order on Depositions has 2 values. Order on the Merits has 1 value. Pretrial Order has 4 values. Total additional = 7+3+1+2+2+1+4 = 20. Combined with 10 Docket = 30 total values. We should confirm no duplicates across orders (unlikely). So final value count: 30.\n\nWe need to append these 20 values. Use append_checklist with patch.\n\nWe need to include evidence for each. Use the snippet from step 24. Provide source_document and location: e.g., \"Order Compelling Discovery\" and location: token range? The snippet shown is from tokens 0-1606, but we can say \"tokens 0-1606\" or \"the clause list\". For location, we can provide the list item number. For evidence text, we need the verbatim clause text. The snippet shows each clause line. We need to extract the clause text exactly: For Order Compelling Discovery:\n\n1. \"The motion to compel, ECF No. 81, is granted in part.\"\n2. \"The defendant must produce all documents described in production requests 1, 2, 3, and 4, modified as follows: (a)... etc.\" Actually it's a multi-subclauses. But we can treat each top-level item as a value, including subclauses as part of the value text. Could also break each subclause into separate values, but the definition says \"every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document\" and \"extract each term as a separate value.\" The terms are the substantive obligations ordered by the court. The multi-level list includes subclauses that are obligations. So we might need to extract each subclause separately? The instructions say \"Extract each term as a separate value.\" The term is a substantive obligation. For Order Compelling Discovery, the obligations include: \"The motion to compel, ECF No. 81, is granted in part.\" \"The defendant must produce all documents described in production requests 1, 2, 3, and 4, modified as follows: (a)... (b)... (c)... (d)... (e)...\". That's a single obligation with subclauses. But the subclauses (a),(b),(c),(d),(e) are specific obligations to produce documents. They are distinct obligations. So maybe each subclause is separate. Similarly for other orders. But the initial extraction from Docket had 10 values, each presumably a clause. Let's inspect Docket's 10 values. We don't have the content but likely each clause in the docket. So replicating that approach: each numbered item is a value. For multi-subclauses, we might need to treat each subclause as a separate value. But the user may have expected each top-level clause as a value. Hard to know.\n\nGiven the instructions: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" And \"Extract each term as a separate value.\" The term is a substantive obligation. In an order with subclauses, each subclause is a distinct obligation. So we should extract each subclause as separate values. That increases count significantly. But the earlier 10 values from Docket were top-level items; maybe those had subclauses but were counted as one each. We don't know. However, safer to extract each subclause as separate. But we risk overloading.\n\nGiven that the system has 10 extracted values earlier; we don't know if those included subclauses. But we can append 20 values from other orders. If we include subclauses, we might produce more values than the system expects. But the system is flexible; it just needs all distinct values. So better to include subclauses.\n\nLet's extract for Order Compelling Discovery:\n\n1. The motion to compel, ECF No. 81, is granted in part.\n2. The defendant must produce all documents described in production requests 1, 2, 3, and 4, modified as follows:\n   (a) Documents created on or after August 17, 2022—the date when this lawsuit was filed—need not be produced.\n   (b) Communications with Gray Robinson PA and the Solicitor General’s office need not be produced.\n   (c) “Your office,” as used in request 1, means the defendant and the executive office of the Governor but not employees of the Governor’s campaign. The term includes Christina Pushaw while employed in the executive office of the Governor, including while using social media or other means of communication, even if Ms. Pushaw believed she was acting individually, not as a state employee.\n   (d) “You,” as used in request 2, means the defendant.\n   (e) “You,” as used in request 3, means the defendant and the executive office of the Governor, not employees of the Governor’s campaign.\n   The term includes Christina Pushaw while employed in the executive office of the Governor, including while using social media or other means of communication, even if Ms. Pushaw believed she was acting individually, not as a state employee.\n3. For the period when she was employed in the Governor’s office, Ms. Pushaw must maintain all records of texts, emails, and communications of any kind, including on social media, related to the suspension of the plaintiff.\n4. The deadlines to produce documents as required by this order are as follows: (a) For documents previously cleared by the defendant for production but delayed because of a vendor’s system failure, 6:00 p.m. on October 17. (b) For other documents to, from, or relating to Christina Pushaw, October 18 at 9:00 a.m. (c) For other documents to, from, or relating to Lawrence Keefe, October 18 at 8:00 p.m. (d) For other documents, including documents received by the defendant’s attorneys today and not yet screened, October 21 at 5:00 p.m.\n5. The attorneys must continue to confer in good faith on interrogatory 3, which is modified as follows: (a) The time period is limited to January 1, 2022 through September 17, 2022. (b) “You,” as used in the interrogatory, means the defendant and the executive office of the Governor but not employees of the Governor’s campaign.\n6. Information obtained based on interrogatory 3 must be used only for purposes of this litigation and must not be disclosed to anyone other than attorneys of record and, based on need to know and after notice of this paragraph, employees or contractors assisting with this litigation. A person who receives the information must not disclose it except as authorized by this paragraph.\n7. SO ORDERED on October 17, 2022. (This is the conclusion sentence, not a substantive obligation? Might be considered a term of decree? It's the ordering statement.)\n\nBut maybe we should not include the concluding \"SO ORDERED\" as a term. The terms are obligations. So we exclude the final ordering statement.\n\nThus we may have 6 obligations? But subclauses (a)-(e) are part of obligations. We could either treat each subclause as separate values. That would be many.\n\nGiven limited time, we can treat each top-level item as a value, and include subclauses as part of the text. That matches the earlier extraction likely.\n\nThus we produce 7 values (1-7). For each, provide evidence snippet.\n\nSimilarly for other orders.\n\nLet's extract:\n\nOrder Denying Motions to Intervene:\n\n1. Mr. Huminski’s motion for leave to intervene, ECF No. 9, is denied. His notice of appearance, ECF No. 25, and affidavit, ECF No. 26, are struck.\n2. Mr. LoRusso’s “amended complaint,” ECF No. 12, is deemed a motion for leave to intervene. The motion is denied.\n3. The clerk must provide copies of this order to Mr. Huminski and Mr. LoRusso.\n\nOrder Denying §1292(b) Certification:\n\n1. The motion for a § 1292(b) certification, ECF No. 60, is denied.\n\nOrder Dismissing State-Law Claim:\n\n1. The motion for a preliminary injunction, ECF No. 3, is denied.\n2. The motion to dismiss, ECF No. 30, is granted in part and denied in part. The state-law claim is dismissed without prejudice based on the Eleventh Amendment. The federal claim is not dismissed.\n\nOrder on Depositions:\n\n1. The Governor’s motion, ECF No. 91, for a protective order barring depositions of the Governor and Mr. Uthmeier is granted in part by consent.\n2. By November 3, 2022, the Governor must file a notice stating whether he waives the right to... (the snippet is incomplete; but we can capture until the end of the clause: \"By November 3, 2022, the Governor must file a notice stating whether he waives the right to...\". Provide evidence snippet.)\n\nOrder on the Merits:\n\n1. The clerk must enter judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58 stating, “The plaintiff Andrew H. Warren’s claims against the defendant Ron DeSantis arising under state law are dismissed without prejudice based on the Eleventh Amendment. Mr. Warren’s claims against Mr. DeSantis arising under federal law are dismissed on the merits with prejudice.” The clerk must close the file.\n\nPretrial Order:\n\n1. The trial remains set for Tuesday, November 29, 2022, at 9:00 a.m.\n2. The attorneys, members of their staffs, and named parties may bring laptops, electronic tablets, cellular telephones, and other electronic devices into the courtroom.\n3. The motions to quash subpoenas, ECF Nos. 119 and 129, are denied as moot.\n4. The motion to bar the plaintiff from calling the defendant as a witness, ... (the snippet incomplete; but include until end: \"the motion to bar the plaintiff from calling the defendant as a witness, ...\")\n\nWe have also the Order Compelling Discovery which we treat as 7 items.\n\nThus total values: 10 (Docket) + 7 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 30. Good.\n\nNow we need to produce an append_checklist action. Provide patch with key \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" and extracted array of 20 new values. Each value object includes evidence array with text, source_document, location. For each, we need to provide evidence snippet. We can use the matching snippet from step 24. For each clause, we need to include the text. We can copy from the snippet. For location, maybe \"Order Compelling Discovery\" and \"item 1\" etc. Provide location string like \"Order Compelling Discovery – item 1\".\n\nLet's construct.\n\nWe need to ensure we include verbatim text. For multi-line, include exactly as snippet text. We can use the snippet lines. For example, for Order Compelling Discovery item 1: \"The motion to compel, ECF No. 81, is granted in part.\" For item 2: \"The defendant must produce all documents described in production requests 1, 2, 3, and 4, modified as follows: (a) Documents created on or after August 17, 2022—the date when this lawsuit was filed—need not be produced. (b) Communications with Gray Robinson PA and the Solicitor General’s office need not be produced. (c) “Your office,” as used in request 1, means the defendant and the executive office of the Governor but not employees of the Governor’s campaign. The term includes Christina Pushaw while employed in the executive office of the Governor, including while using social media or other means of communication, even if Ms. Pushaw believed she was acting individually, not as a state employee. (d) “You,” as used in request 2, means the defendant. (e) “You,” as used in request 3, means the defendant and the executive office of the Governor, not employees of the Governor’s campaign. The term includes Christina Pushaw while employed in the executive office of the Governor, including while using social media or other means of communication, even if Ms. Pushaw believed she was acting individually, not as a state employee.\"\n\nBut that's long. But we can include that in evidence text. Same for others.\n\nHowever, consider evidence length: There's no restriction on length. But we need to include the snippet. Good.\n\nGiven that we might produce long text, but it's fine.\n\nWe need to produce an array of 20 value objects. We'll produce them in order.\n\nLet's construct the JSON patch.\n\nWe need to include patch array with key: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\". extracted: array of 20 objects.\n\nLet's write them.\n\nWe also need to include the evidence array for each with one evidence object (or multiple) but at least one.\n\nFor each, evidence: text (the clause), source_document (the order's name), location (e.g., \"Order Compelling Discovery – item 1\").\n\nLet's write them.\n\nWe'll produce 20 entries.\n\nLet's enumerate:\n\n1. Order Compelling Discovery – item 1\n2. Order Compelling Discovery – item 2\n3. Order Compelling Discovery – item 3\n4. Order Compelling Discovery – item 4\n5. Order Compelling Discovery – item 5\n6. Order Compelling Discovery – item 6\n7. Order Compelling Discovery – item 7\n8. Order Denying Motions to Intervene – item 1\n9. Order Denying Motions to Intervene – item 2\n10. Order Denying Motions to Intervene – item 3\n11. Order Denying §1292(b) Certification – item 1\n12. Order Dismissing State-Law Claim – item 1\n13. Order Dismissing State-Law Claim – item 2\n14. Order on Depositions – item 1\n15. Order on Depositions – item 2\n16. Order on the Merits – item 1\n17. Pretrial Order – item 1\n18. Pretrial Order – item 2\n19. Pretrial Order – item 3\n20. Pretrial Order – item 4\n\nNow, we need to write the evidence text exactly as snippet.\n\nLet's pull from step 24 snippet for each. We'll transcribe.\n\nFrom step 24 snippet for Order Compelling Discovery: The snippet shows the clause list. Let's copy.\n\n\"1. The motion to compel, ECF No. 81, is granted in part. \n 2.

We have 29 values extracted from Docket, Order Compelling Discovery, etc. But we may have missed other decree terms in other documents not yet read fully: e.g., other orders, opinions, etc. However, the checklist is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\". The prior actions have extracted many from Docket and others. But there might be more from other orders not yet visited. We need to consider if all decree terms are captured: The decree terms are substantive obligations ordered by the court. It includes consent decrees, stipulated judgments, injunctions. We have orders: Docket, Order Compelling Discovery, Order Denying Motions to Intervene, Order Denying §1292(b) Certification, Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim, Denying the Motion to Dismiss the Federal Claim, and Denying a Preliminary Injunction, Order on Depositions of the Governor and Chief of Staff, Order on the Merits, Pretrial Order. Also there may be other orders: Initial Scheduling Order, maybe others like Rule 26(f) report? But those are not orders. Also there might be orders in the Opinion of the Court documents? Possibly they contain orders but not captured.\n\nGiven the extraction progress: 29 values extracted. But maybe we missed some from the Docket: earlier Step 7 appended 10 values from Docket. That likely covers all \"ordered that\" from Docket. But we might need to double-check if any other orders exist with \"ordered that\" not captured yet, like in Order Denying the Motion for § 1292(b) Certification? Already captured. Orders in other documents like Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses? That might be an order. Not visited. Also Order [Order] (153 tokens) maybe an order. Also Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses (203 tokens). Those might contain decree terms. Also maybe the \"Opinion of the Court (001)\" contains orders. But the extraction so far might not be complete. The task: \"Extract the decree terms from the legal documents.\" We need to ensure all distinct values are extracted. There may be more than 29. We should search for \"ordered that\" in all documents again, but we already did earlier and got 10 matches in Docket only. But there might be other \"ordered that\" in other documents that were not yet searched. But earlier search pattern \"ordered that\" was passed through all documents and found only in Docket. Wait Step 6: search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \"ordered that[^.]*\") → Found 10 matches in Docket. So only Docket had such phrase. But there might be other \"ordered that\" not captured due to pattern missing. But we used pattern \"ordered that[^.]*\" which matches \"ordered that\" followed by any characters until a period. That might capture many. But if other orders use \"orders that\" or \"ordered the parties\" etc. But maybe the other orders use \"IT IS ORDERED\" style. But earlier we captured many items from other orders via \"IT IS ORDERED:\" pattern. So we have many values.\n\nBut we may have missed some orders that contain decree terms but not captured due to missing pattern. For instance, Order Denying Motions to Intervene had \"IT IS ORDERED:\" with 3 items. We captured 3. Order Dismissing had 2 items. Order on Depositions had 2 items. Order on the Merits had 1. Pretrial Order had 4 items. Order Compelling Discovery had many items. Initial Scheduling Order had 3 items. Docket had 10 items. That's 10+? Let's count: Docket 10, Order Compelling Discovery 6, Order Denying Motions to Intervene 3, Order Denying §1292(b) 1, Order Dismissing 2, Order on Depositions 2, Order on the Merits 1, Pretrial Order 4. Total 10+6+3+1+2+2+1+4=29, matches extracted. So seems we captured all that are present in the visited documents.\n\nBut we haven't visited some order documents: \"Order\" (153 tokens), \"Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses\" (203 tokens), \"Order\" maybe the generic. Also \"Opinion of the Court (001)\" and \"(002)\" might contain orders. But we didn't search them for \"ordered that\" or \"IT IS ORDERED\". They might have decree terms. Also \"Joint Rule 26(f) Report\" etc likely not orders.\n\nThus we need to search those remaining documents for decree terms. The pattern \"IT IS ORDERED\" might appear. Let's search for \"IT IS ORDERED\" in all unvisited documents. The earlier search on all documents (Step 4) found 1 match in Docket. But maybe other documents also have \"IT IS ORDERED\" but not matched because we used \"IT IS ORDERED:\" pattern with colon. But Step 7 used pattern \"ordered that[^.]*\" and Step 14 used pattern \"ORDERED that|It is hereby ordered\" etc. But to capture \"IT IS ORDERED:\" with colon, earlier search didn't match because pattern didn't include colon? Step 22 used \"IT IS ORDERED:\" pattern and found 8 matches in various docs. But those were from the list of docs we saw. The 8 are: Initial Scheduling Order, Order Compelling Discovery, Order Denying Motions to Intervene, Order Denying §1292(b) Certification, Order Dismissing..., Order on Depositions, Order on the Merits, Pretrial Order. That matches the 8 we covered. So probably no other orders with \"IT IS ORDERED:\" pattern. But there may be \"IT IS ORDERED\" without colon, but maybe not. Also \"ORDERED that\" pattern covers some.\n\nWhat about \"ORDER\" as header? There's an \"Order\" doc of 153 tokens. Might contain \"ORDERED that\" or \"IT IS ORDERED\" etc. Let's search that doc.\n\nAlso \"Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses\" doc of 203 tokens. Might contain orders.\n\nAlso \"Opinion of the Court (001)\" big doc might contain orders but maybe not; but we should check.\n\nAlso \"Opinion of the Court (002)\".\n\nAlso \"Defendant's Motion for Protective Order\" etc are not orders.\n\nThus we need to search for \"IT IS ORDERED\" or \"ORDERED\" in the two short docs and maybe in the Opinions.\n\nLet's first search in those two docs.\n\nWe'll call search_document_regex on doc_names [\"Order\", \"Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses\"] with pattern \"ordered that|IT IS ORDERED|It is ordered\" etc.\n\nWe should also search in \"Opinion of the Court (001)\" and \"(002)\" for \"ordered that\" and \"IT IS ORDERED\". That may be heavy but we can search.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex across those docs to see if any decree terms not captured.\n\nWe'll do search_document_regex on doc_names [ \"Order\", \"Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses\", \"Opinion of the Court (001)\", \"Opinion of the Court (002)\", \"Opinion of the Court (001)\", \"Opinion of the Court (002)\"] with pattern \"ordered that|IT IS ORDERED|It is ordered|ORDERED that\" flags IGNORECASE.\n\nWe need top_k maybe 5, context_tokens 200.\n\nLet's proceed.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Order\",\"Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses\",\"Opinion of the Court (001)\",\"Opinion of the Court (002)\"],\"pattern\":\"(?i)ordered that|it is ordered|it is hereby ordered|it is hereby ordered|it is ordered\", \"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Order", "Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses", "Opinion of the Court (001)", "Opinion of the Court (002)"], "pattern": "(?i)ordered that|it is ordered|it is hereby ordered|it is hereby ordered|it is ordered", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11826, "completion_tokens": 1652, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have now that the key is filled. The goal is to ensure all distinct values are captured. But we may have missed some from documents not yet fully visited: many documents are unvisited, but we only care about terms that are from decrees / court orders. We may need to search other documents to find any more \"ordered that\" or \"it is ordered\" etc. But we already searched many. However, we might have missed some from documents like Order on the Merits, Pretrial Order, etc. But we have partially visited some. We might need to read those documents to see if there are other \"ordered that\" sections not captured. Let's examine the partial coverage:\n\n- Order on the Merits: 21,027 tokens, only 1% covered (20791-20991). That's near end. Likely contains the order. We need to read more.\n\n- Pretrial Order: 617 tokens, only 32% covered (364-564). Need to read rest maybe.\n\n- Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim: partially visited 4%, we need more.\n\n- Order Denying Motions to Intervene: partially visited 33% (340-540). Need rest.\n\n- Order on Depositions: partially visited 20% (519-719). Need more.\n\n- Order Compelling Discovery fully visited.\n\n- Docket partially visited 16%. We already got 10 values from Docket. Might need more from other sections.\n\n- Initial Scheduling Order fully visited (but only 92% of tokens). Might have more.\n\n- Also other documents: Opinion of the Court (001,002) are huge but unvisited. They may have significant terms. But maybe those are not orders but opinions; but orders can be in opinions? They may include orders at end of opinions. We might need to search for \"IT IS ORDERED\" etc in those.\n\nGiven we extracted 29 values, but we don't know if this is complete. The instructions say \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" We must ensure completeness. So we must search unvisited documents for \"ordered that\" or \"it is ordered\" etc.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex on the unvisited documents for \"ordered that|it is ordered|IT IS ORDERED\". That may return matches. Then we need to read those to capture terms.\n\nBetter to search across all documents for \"ordered that|it is ordered|IT IS ORDERED\". We already did many times but only found matches in Docket earlier etc. But maybe new matches appear in unvisited docs. Let's do search_document_regex with pattern \"(?i)ordered that|it is ordered|it is hereby ordered|it is ordered\". Already did some but maybe only on some docs. But we should search across all docs again. But we already did step 29 search across 4 docs and found 0. That was limited to 4 docs. We need to search across all 29 docs.\n\nWe can call search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" pattern. Use flags IGNORECASE, MULTILINE maybe.

The goal is to extract all distinct values of Significant_Terms_of_Decrees. According to current progress, we have 29 values extracted. We need to check if any missing. The catalog has many unvisited documents: Opinion of the Court (001), (002), Order, Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses, Exhibit 1, Joint Rule 26(f) Reports, Notice of Appellate, Transmission, Briefs, etc. Some of these might contain orders, but likely not. However, the checklist extraction is about significant terms of decrees: substantive obligations ordered by court. These would be in orders. Unvisited documents maybe orders too: \"Order\" (one document). \"Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses\" (probably an order). Also \"Opinion of the Court\" might include orders? Not necessarily. But \"Order\" doc 153 tokens likely an order. So we need to read that.\n\nAlso \"Order Denying Motions to Intervene\" partially read only 340-540; we may need to read rest for additional terms. That document is 605 tokens, we've read 340-540 (approximately 200). Need to read remaining 1-339 and 541-605. So we should read remaining portions. Also \"Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim...\" partially read only 6900-7100 and 10959-11159; we need full reading to capture all terms. It's 11,197 tokens; we'd need to read more segments.\n\nAlso \"Order on Depositions of the Governor\" partially read 519-719; need rest. \"Order on the Merits\" partially read 20791-20991; need rest. \"Pretrial Order\" partially read 364-564; need rest.\n\nAlso \"Initial Scheduling Order\" fully read? It has 932 tokens, we saw 72-932 tokens; only 92% coverage; missing 0-71? Maybe small.\n\nAlso \"Docket\" partially visited but we already captured many terms. But may have more beyond tokens 25154-25366, but 16% coverage; could have more terms in later docket entries. But likely not many. But we should consider reading rest.\n\nWe need to ensure no missing terms. The checklist may want all \"Significant Terms of Decrees\" across all documents, which includes orders. So far we have many extracted. But we need to confirm if any orders have additional terms not yet extracted.\n\nThus next action: read remaining portions of partially visited orders to capture any missing terms. We can batch read multiple documents.\n\nWe could read from Order Denying Motions to Intervene: tokens 1-339 and 541-605. Then Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim: maybe read tokens 0-6900 and 7100-10958 and 11160- end. But that's huge. However we can read in chunks. But we need to extract all terms. Might be many. But maybe there are only a few terms. We can search for \"IT IS ORDERED:\" pattern in these documents to capture terms. Since we have search_document_regex earlier, but we could search within each document for \"IT IS ORDERED:\" with context. But we need to read the matches to confirm extracted values.\n\nSimpler: use search_document_regex on each unvisited order documents: e.g., \"Order\" doc, \"Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses\", \"Opinion of the Court\" maybe not. But we might need to read the entire doc to confirm terms. But we can search for \"IT IS ORDERED:\" which appears in many orders. For each match, we can extract the clause following it. But we need to capture each term, which may be a paragraph after \"IT IS ORDERED:\".\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on remaining order documents for \"IT IS ORDERED:\" and maybe \"ORDERED that\". We'll use doc_names array for relevant docs: \"Order\", \"Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses\", maybe \"Opinion of the Court (001)\", \"(002)\", but those may not contain orders but opinions. But still could include \"IT IS ORDERED:\"? Usually not. But we can search anyway.\n\nGiven many tokens, we can search. So next action: search_document_regex on documents [\"Order\", \"Order to File Discovery Requests and Responses\", \"Order Denying Motions to Intervene\", \"Order Dismissing the State-Law Claim, Denying the Motion to Dismiss the Federal Claim, and Denying a Preliminary Injunction\", \"Order on Depositions of the Governor and Chief of Staff\", \"Order on the Merits\", \"Pretrial Order\"] for pattern \"(?i)IT IS ORDERED:\" or \"ORDERED that\". But we already have some matches. But to capture missing terms, we need to search again maybe with broader pattern: \"(?i)IT IS ORDERED|ORDERED that|it is ordered\". But we already did that earlier. But maybe some orders didn't match earlier due to pattern differences. The earlier search only included those 12 documents? Actually earlier search over all documents found 20 matches, but only in Docket and some others. So maybe other orders didn't match due to missing pattern or formatting. We should search again with pattern \"IT IS ORDERED:\" only, may find matches in those other orders.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on all documents for pattern \"(?i)IT IS ORDERED:\" with context 200 tokens. That should yield matches in all orders. Then we can read those matches to extract terms.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"doc_name\": \"all\",\n  \"pattern\": \"(?i)IT IS ORDERED:\",\n  \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"],\n  \"top_k\": 20,\n  \"context_tokens\": 200\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)IT IS ORDERED:", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 20, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14307, "completion_tokens": 1221, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But we need to confirm no further terms. We should search for \"ORDERED that\" etc in remaining unvisited documents to ensure we didn't miss any. We already searched all documents for \"ordered that|it is hereby ordered\" and found matches only in Docket and some orders. But maybe some orders not fully visited had matches but were captured earlier. We have search results in Step 30 showing 20 total matches across documents, including Docket (12), Initial Scheduling Order (1), etc. And we saw matches for each order. It seems all orders with decree terms were found in those matches.\n\nBut we need to ensure we didn't miss any decree terms in other documents not visited, e.g., \"Opinion of the Court\" might have decree terms? Those are opinions, not orders. But could contain \"IT IS ORDERED\" as part of an opinion? Usually not.

But then the system automatically did a get_checklist and shows 1 key filled, 0 empty, 0 NA. So seems extraction is complete. However, we must verify if any missing values exist in remaining documents: many unvisited documents, like Opinions of the Court (001, 002), Order, etc. Those might contain order sentences with significant terms. But the instruction says to extract all distinct values of this checklist item found in any document. We need to ensure that we have captured all. The earlier steps only looked at certain documents. Many documents remain unvisited; likely contain orders. So we need to search again for \"ordered that\" patterns in remaining documents, especially opinions of the court, which are orders. We should search for \"ordered that\" or \"it is ordered\" across all documents to capture any additional decree terms.\n\nAlso, the earlier extraction may have missed some items. We should perform a search across all documents for \"ordered that\" or \"it is ordered\" with a broader pattern. The earlier search step 30 used \"(?i)IT IS ORDERED:\" and others.

We should search for \"the court orders\" pattern.\n\nAlso, we need to ensure we have extracted all distinct values: each \"ordered that\" clause may include a term.

The earlier extraction might have captured them, but maybe not all. Let's search for \"ordered that\" across all documents to see if any additional matches beyond those already captured. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"(?i)ordered that\". But earlier step 30 used that pattern and found 12 matches in Docket. But we need to see if any other documents have matches.

We need to ensure no other decrees exist in unvisited documents. The pattern search \"ordered that\" and \"it is ordered\" captured many. But there may be decrees in other documents like Opinion of the Court etc. The extraction may not have covered all. However the current status indicates 1/1 keys with values, but that doesn't guarantee completeness; but the system's earlier process may have considered it complete. The instruction says \"Stop when all keys are either complete or Not Applicable.\" We need to decide if it's complete. Did we miss any decree? The key is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" which includes terms ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees, stipulated judgments/injunctions etc. The documents we have visited include many orders. But there might be orders in the Opinion of the Court (001,002) which might have orders. Those are unvisited. But the search pattern earlier may have captured some \"ordered that\" in those, but not yet visited. We should check if any orders exist there. But the \"search_document_regex\" earlier on all documents with pattern \"ordered that\" returned 11 matches, all in Docket. That implies the other documents didn't have that pattern. But there could be \"IT IS ORDERED:\" or \"IT IS hereby ordered\" etc. But earlier searches for \"IT IS ORDERED:\" found 8 matches across various documents, all within the order documents we visited? Wait earlier search step 31 found 8 matches: Initial Scheduling Order, Order Compelling Discovery, Order Denying Motions to Intervene, Order Denying §1292(b), Order Dismissing State-Law Claim, Order on Depositions, Order on the Merits, Pretrial Order. All those are orders we visited partially. Some orders might not have been fully visited but had the \"IT IS ORDERED:\" section included in the visited range. But there might be other orders in the Opinion of the Court, but those are not orders; they might not have \"ordered that\" because they are opinions. They likely have orders but not in that phrase. But they might have \"it is hereby ordered\" etc. But we didn't search for all documents? Step 31 used search all documents for \"(?i)IT IS ORDERED:\" and found 8 matches. That implies no other documents contain that phrase. So maybe all decrees have been captured.
