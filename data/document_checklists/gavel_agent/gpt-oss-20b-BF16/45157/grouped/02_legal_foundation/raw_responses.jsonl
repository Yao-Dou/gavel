We have list_documents already, so catalog known. Next, we need to extract the three checklist items. The best approach: search for \"Cause of Action\" or \"claims\" in Complaint documents. Likely the complaint contains cause of action statements. So we can use search_document_regex targeting \"Cause of Action\" or \"Claims\" or \"Cause(s) of Action\" etc.\n\nWe should search across the documents, but maybe start with the Complaint documents. Let's search for \"Cause of Action\" in the first complaint. Use search_document_regex on doc_names [\"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\"] with pattern \"Cause of Action\". But sometimes phrased \"Cause(s) of Action:\" or \"Cause(s) of Action\" etc. Let's do a more general pattern: \"(?i)cause of action\". Let's search across all documents to find matches. Use search_document_regex with doc_name=\"all\" and pattern \"(?i)cause of action\". That should return context. Then we can read the relevant window to capture actual causes.\n\nAlso need Statutory basis: maybe in the complaint under \"Statutory Basis\" or \"Statutory Basis for Claims\". Could search for \"Statutory Basis\". Also \"Constitutional\" etc. But we can also extract from the same complaint.\n\nRemedy sought: likely in the complaint as well: \"Remedy Sought\" or \"We seek relief\". Search for \"Remedy\" or \"relief\" or \"injunctive relief\". We'll search for \"Remedy\" or \"Relief\" but maybe too broad. But we can search for \"Remedy\" in complaint.\n\nLet's search for \"Cause of Action\" first.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)cause of action\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "(?i)cause of action", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3050, "completion_tokens": 405, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

We have partial matches of cause of action. We need to read more of the complaint; we need to capture all cause of action statements, each with its cause, and statutory basis. Also remedy sought likely in the complaint: \"injunctive and declaratory relief sought\" etc. The search results show the cause of action text but not the remedy. We need to read additional parts of complaint, maybe earlier sections, like \"REMEDIES\" or \"WHEREFORE\". So we should read the complaint in more detail.\n\nWe must avoid re-reading already viewed ranges. The partial coverage shows 15890-16090, etc. We need to read the rest of the complaint. We can read next unviewed ranges. Since we already have 5% coverage, we need to read more. Let's read the beginning of the complaint for the remedy. Likely at the top or near the end. We'll read from token 0 to maybe 5000? But we need to keep within 10k. Let's read a large chunk from start to maybe token 5000 to capture the \"Wherefore\" section. But we need the remedy. The remedy is likely near the end. But we can read from token 15000 to 17000? We already looked at 15890-17138. But we might need the \"WHEREFORE\" section near end. Let's inspect the document after token 17000 onwards.\n\nBetter to search for \"WHEREFORE\" or \"WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs pray\" pattern. Use search_document_regex on the complaint for \"WHEREFOR\". That will give us the remedy section. And we also need cause of action list and statutory basis. We already have cause of action and statutory basis from the search. But we need to extract all distinct cause of action entries, each with its statutory basis. From the search matches, we see 5 cause of action entries, each with the same statutory basis 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment. But we need to capture all distinct cause of action - maybe the same text repeated but we need to include each as separate entries? The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition.\" So if the cause of action repeats same text, maybe treat as one distinct value? But the cause of action might be the same across five cause of action. The legal claim is \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\". So maybe we only need one value? But the cause of action includes the parties too? Actually cause of action is the legal claim asserted. The parties are separate. So the cause of action is \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\". There may be other causes like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" for all. So we might list one value. However the text shows 5 cause of action, but each is same claim. Possibly we just list that claim once. But being thorough we might list each separately but with same value. The instruction: \"When multiple values exist for a checklist item, create separate extracted entries for each value.\" If the same value repeats, it's not multiple distinct values. So one entry is enough.\n\nBut we also need remedy sought: likely \"injunctive and declaratory relief\". Also maybe \"damages\" etc. We should confirm.\n\nLet's search for \"injunctive\" or \"declaratory\" or \"remedy\" or \"WHEREFOR\" in the complaint. We'll use search_document_regex on the complaint for \"injunctive\" pattern.\n\nAlso we might need to read the entire complaint to ensure no other remedy. But let's search.\n\nWe will call search_document_regex on \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" doc name with pattern \"(?i)injunctive|declaratory|remedy|WHEREFOR\". But better separate.\n\nLet's do search for \"WHEREFOR\" across all documents. But we know this doc is a complaint, likely has \"WHEREFOR\". So search in that doc.\n\nWe'll do search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" and pattern \"(?i)WHEREFOR\". That will give top matches with context.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\"pattern\":\"(?i)WHEREFOR\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "pattern": "(?i)WHEREFOR", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5519, "completion_tokens": 964, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Need to extract Cause_of_Action, Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case, Remedy_Sought. We have seen cause of action sections in complaint. We need to extract distinct values. For each cause of action, include the text? The definition: The legal claim(s) asserted—the theory of liability or right to relief. So each cause of action should be captured: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" etc. Need the claim: \"Deprivation of rights secured by the United States Constitution under the Eighth Amendment\" maybe. The text shows cause of action with claim. Let's read more to capture remedy sought section. Remedy sought is likely in WHEREFOR section: A. Declare that suit maintainable as a class action, B. Adjudge and declare that the acts, omissions... So remedy sought includes declaratory relief, injunctive relief. Need to capture each remedy. So we should read more of the complaint near WHEREFOR. We already have tokens 17389-17589 of that match. But we may need more context to extract remedy types. Let's read more near that region, maybe before 17389. The view covers 17389-17589. That is enough to capture remedy. But we need to confirm remedy list fully. Let's read further maybe 17590-17890. We'll read more. Also need cause of action: the text shows \"First Cause of Action (All Prisoner Plaintiffs... 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment)\". So cause of action: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" maybe but also the claim is \"deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution under Eighth Amendment\". We could treat \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" as statutory or constitutional basis. But cause of action could be \"Deprivation of rights ... under the Eighth Amendment\". We need to identify distinct values. For cause of action, we might extract each cause described: e.g., \"First Cause of Action\", \"Second Cause of Action\", etc. But the definition: The legal claim(s) asserted—the theory of liability or right to relief. So each cause of action might be a claim: \"Deprivation of rights secured by the United States Constitution under the Eighth Amendment\" repeated. Might be same claim repeated for different classes. So we need distinct values: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\". That appears multiple times. But maybe also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" repeated but it's same. So we should include once? But we could include each occurrence? The instruction: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item\". So we should extract unique. So cause_of_action unique values: maybe \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" (the statutory basis) and maybe \"Deprivation of rights secured by the United States Constitution under the Eighth Amendment\" as claim? But maybe the cause of action is the claim: \"Deprivation of rights ... under the Eighth Amendment\". Also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" is statutory basis. So cause_of_action might be \"Deprivation of rights secured by the United States Constitution under the Eighth Amendment\" (the claim). We'll capture that.\n\nStatutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case: distinct values: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"Eighth Amendment\". Also maybe \"United States Constitution\" but that is included. So we can capture \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"Eighth Amendment\".\n\nRemedy_Sought: distinct values: \"Declaratory judgment\" (A), \"injunctive relief\" (maybe B). The text: \"A. Declare that the suit is maintainable as a class action...\" (Declaratory relief). \"B. Adjudge and declare that the acts, omissions, policies, and practices...\" maybe injunctive relief. So remedy: \"Declaratory judgment\" and \"Injunctive relief\". Also maybe \"adjudicate\" indicates declaratory relief as well. So we capture those.\n\nThus actions: read more of the complaint near remedy. Also capture cause of action sections maybe earlier; we already have tokens 15890-16090 etc containing cause of action text. We should read those with read_document to capture evidence for cause_of_action and statutory basis. But we already have those tokens in partial view. We need to extract from them. But we didn't yet append. So we need to first read the full token ranges to capture evidence. We have partial view but we can read them again? Actually we have already seen matches but we need to extract evidence from the text. We can use search_document_regex to find patterns like \"First Cause of Action\" and capture context.\n\nWe may do search_document_regex on the complaint for pattern: \"(?i)First Cause of Action\". That will return matches with context. We can then read those matches and extract evidence.\n\nAlternatively, we could read the entire document window from token 15890 to 17590 covering all cause and remedy sections. But that's about 1700 tokens (<10000). So we can read 15890-17590. That covers all relevant sections. Then we can parse. But we need to be careful not to exceed 10000 tokens. 15890-17590 is 1700, okay. So we can read that range. Then we will have evidence for all items. So next action: read_document on Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief from 15890 to 17590. Then after that we will append. So we will call read_document.\n\nLet's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.read_document <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\"start_token\":15890,\"end_token\":17590}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "start_token": 15890, "end_token": 17590}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5817, "completion_tokens": 1249, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

Need extract Cause_of_Action, Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case, Remedy_Sought. We already have some patterns for causes: each cause of action title and basis. In the complaint, for each cause we have a line like (42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment). So we need to extract cause of action titles: \"First Cause of Action\", \"Second Cause of Action\", etc. Also maybe the actual claim text under each cause. The definition: \"The legal claim(s) asserted—the theory of liability or right to relief\". That could be the title or the claim description. Usually the claim is the paragraph describing. But we can include the cause title and the claim description. The snapshot shows matches but no full description extracted. We need to read more to get the cause descriptions. We have read up to token 17590. We saw up to the prayer. We may need to read earlier parts before 15890 to capture the cause titles and the claim text. Also need to extract Statutory or Constitutional Basis: the statutes cited per cause. Those are in parentheses after each cause. Already captured. We need to extract Remedy_Sought: from the prayer: \"A. Declare that the suit is maintainable as a class action pursuant to FRCP 23(a) and 23(b)(1) and (2); B. Adjudge and declare that the acts, omissions, policies, and practices of Defendants, and their ...\" It ends incomplete. Likely more text beyond token 17590. We need to read beyond 17590 to capture entire remedies. Let's find remaining part of prayer. We should read from 17590 to maybe 20000. That is within 10k tokens. We'll read from 17590 to 20000.

We have read a portion of the Complaint. We can extract Cause of Action items: there are five cause of action paragraphs each with a description and statutory basis. There's mention of 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment. Also remedy sought: in the prayer for relief section: A: declare class action maintainable; B: adjudge and declare acts, etc. Also earlier we saw \"injunctive and declaratory relief sought\" etc. Also \"Remedy Sought\" likely includes injunctive relief, declaratory relief, damages etc.\n\nWe need to append all extracted values. Use append_checklist. We must provide evidence for each.\n\nWe have evidence from the read_document text: tokens 15890-18595. So we can refer to that doc. Also remedy items could be extracted from the \"WHEREFOR\" section as well.\n\nWe need to capture multiple values for each key. For Cause_of_Action, we have five causes, each with its own description. For Statutory basis, each cause references 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment. So each cause has same statutory basis. Could list each separately or combine? The requirement: extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition. So for Statutory basis, we have one distinct value: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\". But if multiple causes each have same, we can just list once. But maybe repeated cause-of-action values: we need each distinct value of Cause_of_Action. For each cause, we might capture the description: e.g., \"All Prisoner Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class v. Defendants Carr, Hoy, Roberts, Hepp and Pushich (42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment)\". But the Cause_of_Action is the legal claim(s) asserted—the theory of liability or right to relief. That is basically the claim: \"Violation of the Eighth Amendment, 42 U.S.C. § 1983\" etc. So maybe we can capture each cause's claim: \"Violation of the Eighth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983\" which is same.\n\nBut to be thorough, we could capture each cause as a separate entry: \"Class Action Complaint: First Cause of Action - All Prisoner Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class v. Defendants Carr, Hoy, Roberts, Hepp and Pushich (42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment)\" etc. That seems fine.\n\nRemedy_Sought: The prayer includes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. So we should capture each as separate entries. Also earlier mention of injunctive and declaratory relief sought. So remedy sought includes injunctive relief, declaratory relief, damages (compensatory, punitive), attorney fees, costs, etc. We can extract each separate.\n\nWe need to provide evidence text and location. We can cite relevant snippets. We have the text from read_document. We need to specify source_document: \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\". location: maybe \"Page 36-38\" etc. But we can provide token offsets or page numbers. Use tokens as we have. For instance \"tokens 15890-18595\" covers entire read.\n\nBut we need to also capture content from earlier part of document for remedy: The \"WHEREFOR\" section at tokens 17389-17589 includes the prayer. We have that content in the read_document. Also we have the full remedy list in the subsequent read. So we can use that.\n\nWe need to gather evidence for each remedy. Provide snippet. For example:\n\n\"A. Declare that the suit is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(1) and (2).\"\n\n\"B. Adjudge and declare that the acts, omissions, policies, and practices of Defendants...\"\n\n\"C. Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants...\"\n\n\"D. Order Defendants and their agents ... to develop and implement ...\"\n\n\"E. Award Plaintiffs the costs of this suit, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and other applicable law;\"\n\n\"F. Retain jurisdiction...\"\n\n\"G. Award compensatory damages...\"\n\n\"H. Award punitive damages...\"\n\n\"I. Award reasonable attorneys’ fees...\"\n\n\"J. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.\"\n\nAlso earlier: \"injunctive and declaratory relief sought\" snippet.\n\nAlso maybe \"damages\" in remedy. We can include all. So for Remedy_Sought, each bullet will be separate entry.\n\nSimilarly for Cause_of_Action: each cause of action bullet.\n\nAlso for Statutory basis: one entry.\n\nWe need to do append_checklist with patch for each key.\n\nWe must provide evidence array. For each extracted entry, provide text snippet, source_document, location.\n\nWe need to ensure no duplicates.\n\nWe should read the read_document already. But we also maybe need to read earlier part for cause-of-action bullet. But we already have that in read_document. So we can use evidence from that. For each cause-of-action, we can use snippet that includes \"First Cause of Action\" etc.\n\nWe might want to include the specific parties and defendants but not necessary. But we can capture the claim itself: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" as statutory basis.\n\nHowever, we might also want to capture the cause-of-action: \"Violation of the Eighth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983\" as cause. Let's extract each cause's description: e.g., \"First Cause of Action: (All Prisoner Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class v. Defendants Carr, Hoy, Roberts, Hepp and Pushich) (42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment)\". That is the claim.\n\nWe could also extract that \"Second Cause of Action: (Plaintiffs Anderson, Korkowski, ... etc) (42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment)\". So each cause-of-action entry is a claim.\n\nThus, we will have 5 cause-of-action entries, 1 statutory basis entry, and many remedy entries.\n\nWe need to ensure each remedy entry has evidence snippet. We can provide snippet for each bullet.\n\nWe need to include the location. We can use \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" and maybe page numbers or token ranges. For simplicity, we can use token offsets as we have. For each bullet, we can assign approximate token ranges, but we might not have exact tokens. We can approximate.\n\nAlternatively, we can use \"Location: Page 38 of 41\" etc.\n\nWe can use the snippet from read_document. For example, for remedy \"A. Declare that the suit is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(1) and (2).\" This snippet appears in read_document: \"A. Declare that the suit is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(1) and (2);\" But we can provide the snippet from read_document output.\n\nSimilarly for B etc.\n\nAlso we have earlier snippet for \"injunctive and declaratory relief sought\". That snippet is: \"Roberts. The injunctive and declaratory relief sought is appropriate and will apply to all members of the subclass.\" We can include that as a remedy.\n\nWe also have \"Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants...\" etc.\n\nThus, we need to produce a single append_checklist call with patch containing 3 keys: Cause_of_Action, Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case, Remedy_Sought. Each key has extracted array entries with evidence.\n\nWe need to ensure each entry has evidence array with at least one evidence object.\n\nLet's gather snippets:\n\nFrom read_document tokens 15890-18595:\n\nSnippet for First Cause: \n\"First Cause of Action \n(All Prisoner Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class v. Defendants Carr, Hoy, Roberts, Hepp and Pushich) \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment)\"\n\nSimilarly for Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth.\n\nStatutory basis: each cause shows same, so we can extract just one entry: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\".\n\nRemedy: We have:\n\n- \"Roberts. The injunctive and declaratory relief sought is appropriate and will apply to all members of the subclass.\" (from earlier snippet).\n\n- The prayer list: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Provide each bullet.\n\nWe need to pull the text for each bullet. The read_document snippet at 17590-18595 includes those. But we have mostly A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Let's capture each.\n\nFrom snippet: \n\"A. Declare that the suit is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(1) and (2);\"\n\n\"B. Adjudge and declare that the acts, omissions, policies, and practices of Defendants, and their ...\"\n\n\"C. Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants, their agents, employees, officials, and all persons acting in concert with them under color of state law, from subjecting prisoner Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class to the illegal and unconstitutional conditions, acts, omissions, policies, and practices set forth above.\"\n\n\"D. Order Defendants and their agents, employees, officials, and all persons acting in concert with them under color of state law, to develop and implement, as soon as practical, a plan to eliminate the substantial risk of serious harm that prisoner Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class suffer due to Defendants’ inadequate medical, mental health, and dental care, and due to Defendants’ isolation policies. Defendants’ plan shall include at a minimum the following: ...\"\n\n\"E. Award Plaintiffs the costs of this suit, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and other applicable law;\"\n\n\"F. Retain jurisdiction of this case until Defendants have fully complied with the orders of this Court, and there is a reasonable assurance that Defendants will continue to comply in the future absent continuing jurisdiction;\"\n\n\"G. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined for all physical, psychological, mental, and emotional injuries, as well as loss of liberty, sustained by Plaintiffs and the class as a result of the policies and practices alleged herein;\"\n\n\"H. Award punitive damages;\"\n\n\"I. Award reasonable attorneys’ fees, together with the costs of this action; and\"\n\n\"J. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.\"\n\nAlso earlier snippet \"injunctive and declaratory relief sought\". So we could include that as separate remedy.\n\nAlso maybe \"damages\" part: \"Award compensatory damages...\". Also \"punitive damages\", \"attorney fees\".\n\nThus, remedy entries count maybe 12 or so.\n\nWe must provide evidence for each.\n\nWe could include location token range, but we don't have exact token numbers. We can approximate using the read_document context: e.g., tokens 15890-18595. We can provide location as \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief, pages 36-41\".\n\nBetter to provide token offsets for each snippet: But we don't have exact token offsets for each bullet. We can approximate: For each bullet, we can provide location as \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief, near tokens 17590-18595\" or \"Page 38 of 41\".\n\nBut we can just provide location as \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief, pages 38-41\". It's fine.\n\nWe need to produce JSON.\n\nLet's compose the append_checklist call.\n\nWe need patch array: each patch object with key and extracted array.\n\nFor Cause_of_Action, extracted array of 5 entries. For each, evidence array with one evidence: text snippet and location.\n\nStatutory basis: 1 entry.\n\nRemedy_Sought: many entries: injunctive relief, declaratory relief, class action maintainability, adjudge and declare, preliminary injunct, order for plan, award costs, retain jurisdiction, award compensatory damages, award punitive damages, award attorney fees, award other relief. Also maybe \"injunctive and declaratory relief sought\" earlier snippet.\n\nSo maybe 12 entries.\n\nLet's compose.\n\nWe need to be careful: each extracted entry must have \"value\" string.\n\nFor Cause_of_Action entries, the value could be \"First Cause of Action: All Prisoner Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class v. Defendants Carr, Hoy, Roberts, Hepp and Pushich (42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment)\". Similarly for others.\n\nFor Statutory basis: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\".\n\nFor Remedy_Sought: e.g., \"Injunctive and declaratory relief sought\" etc.\n\nLet's build evidence snippets from the read_document text.\n\nWe have the snippet for injunctive and declaratory relief sought: \"Roberts. The injunctive and declaratory relief sought is appropriate and will apply to all members of the subclass.\" We'll use that.\n\nFor A: \"Declare that the suit is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(1) and (2);\" etc.\n\nFor B: \"Adjudge and declare that the acts, omissions, policies, and practices of Defendants, and their agents...\" but the snippet truncated. We'll use the snippet: \"Adjudge and declare that the acts, omissions, policies, and practices of Defendants, and their\" etc. Actually the snippet shows: \"B. Adjudge and declare that the acts, omissions, policies, and practices of Defendants, and their\" but truncated. We can use that snippet.\n\nFor C: \"Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants, their agents, employees, officials, and all persons acting in concert with them under color of state law, from subjecting prisoner Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class to the illegal and unconstitutional conditions, acts, omissions, policies, and practices set forth above.\"\n\nFor D: \"Order Defendants and their agents, employees, officials, and all persons acting in concert with them under color of state law, to develop and implement, as soon as practical, a plan to eliminate the substantial risk of serious harm that prisoner Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class suffer due to Defendants’ inadequate medical, mental health, and dental care, and due to Defendants’ isolation policies. Defendants’ plan shall include at a minimum the following: ...\"\n\nFor E: \"Award Plaintiffs the costs of this suit, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and other applicable law;\"\n\nFor F: \"Retain jurisdiction of this case until Defendants have fully complied with the orders of this Court, and there is a reasonable assurance that Defendants will continue to comply in the future absent continuing jurisdiction;\"\n\nFor G: \"Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined for all physical, psychological, mental, and emotional injuries, as well as loss of liberty, sustained by Plaintiffs and the class as a result of the policies and practices alleged herein;\"\n\nFor H: \"Award punitive damages;\"\n\nFor I: \"Award reasonable attorneys’ fees, together with the costs of this action; and\"\n\nFor J: \"Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.\"\n\nAlso maybe \"injunctive relief\" considered part of remedy. We already have injunctive and declaratory relief sought snippet. But we might also include \"injunctive relief\" specific: \"Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants...\" etc. So that's covered.\n\nThus, we have 12 remedy entries.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nLet's construct patch:\n\n```\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Cause_of_Action\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        { \"value\": \"First Cause of Action: All Prisoner Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class v.

But check if any other documents may contain other values that need to be extracted. They need to extract all distinct values that directly match each item definition. We have from the complaint: 5 cause of action, 1 statutory basis, 11 remedies. But maybe some other documents contain additional causes etc. For example, the First Amended Complaint may have different cause statements. But the extracted values might duplicate. But need to ensure no missing. Also the \"Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case\" might include multiple statutes per cause. The complaint lists each cause with (42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment). But maybe there are other bases like Eighth Amendment, but maybe also mention of Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment in the Remedy_Sought section. But the basis is same. But maybe the complaint includes other statutes like 42 U.S.C. § 1988, etc. But those are used for fees, not basis. Basis is only for claims. So likely 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment. But is there any other basis? The complaint also references \"Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(1) and (2)\" but that is procedural, not statutory basis. So fine.\n\nBut maybe the First Amended Complaint may have a different cause of action list. But we already captured 5 cause of actions. It's likely same list. But check if the First Amended Complaint includes any other distinct cause of action beyond those 5. The snippet shows all 5, same as complaint. So duplication not needed.\n\nBut maybe other documents have other remedies sought that are not in complaint. For example, Orders may specify remedies granted. But those are not \"remedy sought\" by plaintiffs. The requirement is to extract the relief sought from the complaint. So we have from the complaint.\n\nThus we have completed extraction.\n\nWe need to double-check that we didn't miss any remedy. The appendix lists 11 remedies: Injunctive & declaratory relief; Declare class action; Adjudge; Enjoin; Order plan; Award costs; Retain jurisdiction; Award compensatory damages; Award punitive damages; Award attorneys fees; Award other relief.\n\nMaybe there is also \"Award such other and further relief\" - yes included.\n\nSo 11 remedies.\n\nBut the complaint's remedy list at page 38 includes the A-J items. And earlier at page 36 had injunctive and declaratory relief. That counts as separate? The remedy list includes \"injunctive and declaratory relief\" as separate? Actually the remedy list includes \"A. Declare that the suit is maintainable...\" etc. The earlier statement \"injunctive and declaratory relief sought\" is separate. So 11.\n\nThus all extracted.\n\nNow check if any other documents include additional causes or remedies that are distinct. We might search for \"Cause of Action\" in First Amended Complaint. Already have same 5. But maybe the First Amended Complaint includes a \"First Cause of Action\" with same content. So no new.\n\nThus we can stop.\n\nBut before stopping, we should verify that all keys are filled, no missing. The current status indicates 3/3 keys filled. So we can stop.

But since we already captured all from complaint, but maybe the amended complaint adds new cause or remedy. We should verify.\n\nThe earlier extraction includes 5 causes, each same basis 42 USC 1983; Eighth Amendment. Remedy list 11 items.\n\nCheck if other documents might include additional claims or remedies. The docket may contain summary. But likely not.\n\nWe should confirm that all distinct values in all documents are captured. The document catalog shows many documents unvisited. But likely only complaint contains claims and remedies. Other documents are orders, motions, etc. They might reference remedies but not new ones. The cause of action may also be in amended complaint; but it's same. But we might want to check if the amended complaint includes any different remedy or claim? Could be same.\n\nWe should search for \"cause of action\" in First Amended complaint. But we didn't read it fully. But we could search for \"WHEREFOR\" or \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" to see if any new remedies.\n\nBut the system likely expects us to stop if satisfied. However, we have not verified that the amended complaint didn't add new remedy or cause. But the extraction of all 5 causes and remedies likely covers all. But to be safe, we might search the amended complaint for \"cause of action\" to confirm no new. But we already did search earlier: Step 2 search on all documents for pattern \"(?i)cause of action\" found 10 matches: 5 in Complaint, 5 in First Amended Complaint. That indicates that the amended complaint also has 5 causes. So likely same. But could be additional remedy items at end? The \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in amended complaint may differ.\n\nWe can search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" in amended complaint. But we haven't opened it. Might be similar. But to be thorough, we could search for \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" or \"WHEREFOR\" in the amended complaint. But we can also read that portion. Let's read a portion around 16049-17021 (already partially visited). We saw the first part. But maybe the end of the amended complaint includes more remedies. Let's read tokens 17021-18000 maybe. But the complaint length is 18,810 tokens. We have partially visited up to 17310. We need to read rest: 17310-18000. That is about 700 tokens.

The current status says 3/3 keys filled, 0 empty, 0 Not Applicable, 17 values total. But we saw 11 Remedy_Sought, 5 Cause_of_Action, 1 Statutory... That sums 17. So all values are extracted. But we should double-check if there could be more values in First Amended Complaint. The reading of First Amended Complaint (tokens 17310-18000) shows additional remedy items A-J similar to earlier. But those are same as previously extracted? The earlier Remedy_Sought had items A-J. Those appear again. But maybe there are additional items beyond J? The snippet cut off at D. Not full. But we likely already captured all Remedy_Sought from first complaint. However, maybe First Amended Complaint contains additional Remedy_Sought items beyond those 11? The snippet shows A through D, but maybe more after D? We didn't get full. But the earlier Remedy_Sought list had 11 items A-J. Those likely appear in both complaints. But there might be additional items in the amendment not in original? We need to check.\n\nThe earlier read on Class Action Complaint covered the entire remedy list up to J. The First Amended Complaint may also have similar remedy list, maybe same items. But could have additional or modified. We need to read more of First Amended Complaint beyond D to see if there are more items. Since the snippet ended at \"to eliminate the substantial risk of serious harm that prisoner Plaintiffs and\". So we need to read more tokens beyond 18000 to see if the list continues beyond D. Also earlier remedy items A-J ended at J. The snippet shows A through D; maybe continues E-J. So we should read more of the First Amended Complaint to capture any extra Remedy_Sought values. Possibly same as original. But to be safe, we should read further to confirm there are no additional distinct remedy items.\n\nThus next action: read_document First Amended Class Action Complaint, range 18000-20000 maybe. That would cover rest of remedy list.\n\nCheck token counts: First Amended Complaint 18,810 tokens. We have read 16049-16249,16271-16471,16558-16758,16821-17021,17110-18000.

But maybe there are additional distinct values in other documents like amended complaint might have additional causes of action or remedies. The step 9-10 show reading of amended complaint. We saw some remedies but not all.\n\nWe need to extract all checklist items from the legal case documents. We have 12 documents. We have partially visited complaint and amended complaint. We likely need to check other documents for additional causes of action, statutory basis, remedies. The complaint had 5 cause of action lines (same content repeated). The amended complaint might have similar but maybe additional causes? The text snippet shows some causes: \"Plaintiffs and the classes they represent have no adequate remedy at law...\" There's maybe causes of action lines earlier. We haven't seen them.\n\nAlso some documents like Docket, Orders, etc. Could include relief or statutory basis statements, but not cause of action usually. But maybe the answer or motion might have claims too.\n\nWe need to ensure completeness. We have 5 causes in complaint. But maybe the amended complaint might have additional cause of action lines not yet captured. The given snippet: Not seeing \"Cause of Action\" headings. But there is \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" but not cause of action. However there is \"WHEREFORE\" and \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" with list of relief. The claim might be similar to complaint. But maybe includes new cause of action? We need to search for \"Cause of Action\" in amended complaint. Also check for \"Statutory\" or \"Constitutional\" basis. Also \"Remedy Sought\" might include additional items beyond those 11, but we have same list? The snippet shows same list of relief items.\n\nWe currently extracted 11 remedies from complaint. The amended complaint may have same list; but maybe additional items.\n\nAlso other documents might contain claims: For example, Defendants' Answer may have allegations of affirmative defenses, but not causes of action. Motions may have arguments but not claims.\n\nThus likely all causes of action are in complaint. We might need to double-check if the amended complaint includes additional cause(s). Let's search for \"Cause of Action\" in all documents. Since we have not searched the amended complaint fully. Use search_document_regex on \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\" for \"(?i)cause of action\". Also maybe \"claim\" or \"allegation\".\n\nWe should also search for \"Statutory\" or \"Constitutional\". But we already extracted 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment. The amended complaint may mention \"Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause\" etc. That might be part of statutory basis? Actually constitutional: Eighth Amendment. So maybe we should add that as separate statutory/constitutional basis? The earlier extraction had only 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment. The amended complaint mentions \"Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment\". That might be extra. But it's same jurisdiction. But maybe we need to include separately? The definition: governing statute(s) or constitutional provision(s) underlying the claims, including specific clauses and amendments when constitutional. So we should include the clause. So we should add \"Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment\" as a separate value. That may be considered distinct. So need to append that.\n\nAlso maybe there is also \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" again. Could be repeated but same. But we already have it.\n\nRemedy sought: The amended complaint lists the same 11 items. But maybe there is also \"PRAYER FOR RELIEF\" includes \"no adequate remedy at law...\" but that may not be a specific remedy. But the list includes same items A-J. So no new.\n\nThus we need to update checklist to add the clause. And also maybe confirm if any other documents mention any other causes of action? Let's search for \"Cause of Action\" in all docs. Also search for \"Statutory\" maybe.\n\nWe need to call search_document_regex on \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\" for \"cause of action\". Also maybe search across all documents for \"Cruel and Unusual\" to capture constitutional clause. Use regex \"(?i)Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause\".\n\nAlso maybe search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" again. But we already have.\n\nBetter: search all documents for \"Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause\" to verify evidence. Could also search for \"Eighth Amendment\" to confirm.\n\nOk next action: search_document_regex on \"First Amended Class Action Complaint\" for \"Cruel and Unusual\". Then we can append that.\n\nAlternatively, we could search across all for \"Cruel and Unusual\" to capture all occurrences. Let's do that.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex with doc_name=\"First Amended Class Action Complaint\" pattern \"(?i)Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause\". Also maybe we need the clause's exact text. The snippet: \"under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment\". So we can capture that.\n\nAlso maybe we need to capture \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" again? But we already have.\n\nThus call search_document_regex.\n\nAfter reading search results, we will append that value to Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case.\n\nAlso we might check if any other documents have new causes of action. Search across all for \"Cause of Action\" might reveal other claims. Let's search across all documents for \"(?i)Cause of Action\". That might find in other documents like \"Defendants' Answer\" maybe. But likely not.\n\nGiven we want to be thorough, do that.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex on doc_names=all, pattern \"(?i)Cause of Action\". But we might get many results. But we only need to see if any new distinct values beyond those five. The complaint had 5. The amended complaint maybe repeats same content but maybe includes \"Isolation Subclass\" as a subclass of cause? But likely same. But we should confirm.\n\nOk choose to search for \"Cause of Action\" across all docs. That will return matches with context. Then we can parse.\n\nThus next action: search_document_regex for all docs pattern \"(?i)Cause of Action\".

So other documents had no matches, but maybe there are other relevant items in other documents not yet searched. But we are told earlier that Step 7 stop because all items fully extracted with evidence from Complaint. But that may be incomplete if other documents contain additional distinct values. We need to confirm completeness. We must examine other documents for possible additional Cause_of_Action, Statutory basis, remedy. Perhaps other documents like Defendants' Answer might contain additional claims or rebuttals but not new claims. But for extraction, we only need to extract from documents in corpus any distinct values. We should search other documents for these categories. Possibly the \"USCA Mandate\" or \"Decision and Order\" might have more basis or remedies. But those are orders, not claims. The statutory basis may be stated again. But if duplicate, not new distinct values. But maybe some documents contain additional remedies like \"injunctive relief\" etc. But duplicates not needed. But we need to ensure we didn't miss any distinct values.\n\nWe should check the \"Docket\" for any additional cause of action statements? Docket usually lists case details, not claims. But maybe the docket includes \"claim: constitutional rights\" etc. But we need distinct values that match definitions. Docket may list \"Claims: 42 USC § 1983, Eighth Amendment.\" We should search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" pattern across all docs. Or search for \"Eighth Amendment\" as well.\n\nWe might need to search all documents for \"Cause of Action\" again? Already done. But maybe other docs contain \"Remedy sought\" like \"judgment for relief\" etc. But we already captured 11 remedies from Complaint. But maybe other documents have additional remedies like \"statutory damages\" etc. But duplicates not needed. But if distinct, need to extract.\n\nTo be safe, we can search all documents for \"Remedy\" or \"relief\" patterns. But the step 11 search already found matches in only the two complaints. So likely no other documents contain these patterns. But let's confirm by searching for \"Remedy\" in all 12 docs. That might show e.g., \"Remedy for relief\" in other docs like \"Order\" or \"Decision.\" But could be redundant.\n\nGiven the instructions: \"If the document catalog is unknown → call list_documents.\" It is known. We need to decide next action. Since we think all keys are filled, we can stop. But we should be cautious: we must ensure no missing values. The summary says 17 values extracted: 5 Cause_of_Action, 1 Statutory, 11 Remedy. But earlier it said 5 values for Cause_of_Action: maybe 5 distinct causes? That matches the five cause of action listed. Statutory: 1 value (42 USC 1983; Eighth Amendment). Remedy: 11 values (likely various reliefs listed).\n\nWe should check if maybe there are other statutory basis items like \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" for attorney fees. That was in remedy, not basis. So basis only 42 USC 1983 and Eighth Amendment. That's correct.\n\nBut is there any mention of \"42 U.S.C. § 1988\" in the basis? No.\n\nThus maybe all items captured.\n\nBut we need to confirm no missing values in other documents. Let's search all documents for \"Cause of Action\" again? Already did. Only those in the two complaints. So no missing.\n\nSearch all docs for \"remedy\" may yield duplicates. But no new items.\n\nThus we can stop. But we must provide decision JSON.
