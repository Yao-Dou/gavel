We have some evidence from Docket entries: Notice of Appeal, USCA Mandate, etc. We need format 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court]'. We need to capture parties and court. In Docket, we see \"Notice of Appeal as to 52 Order ... by All Plaintiffs\". Also \"USCA Case Number 24-2086 re: 55 Notice of Appeal\". The USCA Mandate shows parties: Plaintiffs - Appellants: SKI, et al. Appellees: Wisconsin Department of Corrections, et al. Court: United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Also docket shows \"Notice of Appeal as to 52 Order on Motion for Partial Summary Judgment... by All Plaintiffs\". So parties: All Plaintiffs; court: US Court of Appeals. Also mention of \"USCA Case Number 24-2086\". So we should produce entries:\n\n- Appeal: All Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\n- Appeal: Plaintiffs - Appellants (SKI, et al.) appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\n\nAlso maybe \"All Plaintiffs\" referencing same parties. But we could have duplicate if same parties? We can list separate unique values: one with \"All Plaintiffs\", one with \"Plaintiffs - Appellants (SKI, et al.)\". Might be considered distinct parties. Use evidence from Docket and USCA Mandate.\n\nWe need to read document to confirm parties. Docket already partially read; we have tokens 4187-4716 which include the relevant lines. We saw match 1 includes \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 52 Order on Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,,, Order on Motion to Strike,, by All Plaintiffs.\" and match 5 includes \"USCA Case Number 24-2086 re: 55 Notice of Appeal\" etc. We need to read those tokens? We already have.\n\nWe also need evidence for second entry: parties and court. USCA Mandate tokens 0-136, 183-488, 525-725 show parties and court. So we will use those.\n\nThus next action: read_document for USCA Mandate to capture parties and court? We already have coverage 84% but maybe need more detail. But we have enough evidence. Might still need to confirm \"United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\" appears. It appears in tokens 0-136: \"UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\". Also parties: \"SKI, et al., Plaintiffs - Appellants\" and \"WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, et al., Defendants - Appellees\". So we have evidence.\n\nThus we can do append_checklist with two entries. Use evidence from Docket (for All Plaintiffs) and USCA Mandate (for SKI, et al.). Ensure include token offsets? We can include location as page or token range. Use the snippet text. Provide source_document names.\n\nThus next call: append_checklist with patch for key \"Appeal\". Provide two extracted entries.\n\nLet's craft evidence:\n\nFor All Plaintiffs entry: text snippet: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 52 Order on Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,,, Order on Motion to Strike,, by All Plaintiffs.\" source_document: Docket. location: maybe \"page 55\" or token range? We can say \"tokens 4187-4230\" approximate. For court: \"United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\" – might not appear in that snippet but we know from context. Could include separate evidence? But we need evidence for entire value. We can include the snippet from USCA Mandate for court. But for clarity, we can include two evidence items: one for parties, one for court. But evidence array can contain multiple items. So for first entry: evidence list contains two: parties snippet from Docket, court snippet from USCA Mandate.\n\nSimilarly second entry: parties snippet from USCA Mandate, court snippet same.\n\nThus we create evidence arrays accordingly.\n\nNow craft function call.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.append_checklist <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Appeal\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Appeal: All Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 52 Order on Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,,, Order on Motion to Strike,, by All Plaintiffs.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 4187-4230\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"text\": \"UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\",\n              \"source_document\": \"USCA Mandate\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-136\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Appeal: Plaintiffs - Appellants (SKI, et al.) appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"SKI, et al.,\\n                          Plaintiffs - Appellants\",\n              \"source_document\": \"USCA Mandate\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 525-575\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"text\": \"UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\",\n              \"source_document\": \"USCA Mandate\",\n              \"location\": \"tokens 0-136\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Appeal", "extracted": [{"value": "Appeal: All Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.", "evidence": [{"text": "NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 52 Order on Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,,, Order on Motion to Strike,, by All Plaintiffs.", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 4187-4230"}, {"text": "UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT", "source_document": "USCA Mandate", "location": "tokens 0-136"}]}, {"value": "Appeal: Plaintiffs - Appellants (SKI, et al.) appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.", "evidence": [{"text": "SKI, et al.,\n                          Plaintiffs - Appellants", "source_document": "USCA Mandate", "location": "tokens 525-575"}, {"text": "UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT", "source_document": "USCA Mandate", "location": "tokens 0-136"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7113, "completion_tokens": 1200, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

That's captured.\n\nBut also there might be an appeal to US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit from the Defendant? But likely same.\n\nCheck 'Decision and Order (002)' maybe contains mention of \"appeal\" to a different court? The search matches didn't include \"appealed to\" but only \"appeal\" words.

We have 2 values found. But maybe more appeals exist in other documents. We should search for \"Notice of Appeal\" or \"appeal\" etc. We already searched for \"appeal\". That found many matches but not fully read entire documents. We need to ensure we capture all appeals. There could be appeals in other documents like \"Class Action Complaint\" etc. But the \"appeal\" usually occurs in docket entries or orders. We might need to read more of the Docket beyond 4187-4716 tokens. Also read other documents like \"Decision and Order (001)\", \"Order\", etc. Also \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\" maybe has appeal info. Let's search for \"appeal\" again but focusing on other documents.\n\nWe can use search_document_regex with doc_names specifying unvisited documents. But the search already scanned all documents for \"appeal\" and found 13 matches across all documents. Those matches might include all appeals. But we should confirm if any other documents contain \"appeal\" that was not captured? The search shows 13 matches across all documents, but maybe there are more in the unvisited documents but not matched due to pattern? The pattern \"appeal\" could match many contexts, but maybe some appeals are expressed differently. But likely all appeals are captured in docket entries and USCA Mandate. But we might double-check \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\" for \"appeal\" - maybe not. Let's search within that document for \"appeal\" again with context. But we have already searched all documents. The search returned 13 matches; none were in the unvisited documents? We can't be sure. Let's list which documents had matches. The search results show all matches within Docket and USCA Mandate, plus some maybe in other docs like \"Decision and Order (002)\" etc. But the matches list includes tokens 1692-1892 etc from Decision and Order (002). But those matches didn't contain \"appeal\" as a phrase? They had \"exhaust\" etc. But the regex \"appeal\" matched words \"appeal\" in those contexts. But those matches may not be relevant to actual appeals. But they might contain \"appeal\" as part of \"appeal\" phrase like \"exhaust\". But we might need to read those matches to confirm if they contain actual appeals.\n\nBut we already extracted 2 appeals: one from Docket: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 52 Order... by All Plaintiffs.\" and from USCA Mandate: \"SKI, et al., Plaintiffs - Appellants\".\n\nBut there may be other appeals such as \"Appeal: All Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\" That covers one. But maybe other parties appealed: e.g., \"All Plaintiffs\" is the same. But maybe \"defendants\" appealed? Not likely.\n\nBut we might need to extract \"Appeal: All Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\" That's one. And \"Appeal: Plaintiffs - Appellants (SKI, et al.) appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\" That's second.\n\nBut maybe there's also \"Appeal: ... 'Appeal' as to 52 Order...\" The same.\n\nBut maybe there is also a \"Appeal: ... 'Appealing parties'..\"? The docket entry might indicate \"All Plaintiffs\". So we already have that. But maybe there is also a separate \"Appeal by ...\".\n\nLet's search again for \"All Plaintiffs\" in docket. We might confirm. But we have already evidence.\n\nBut we need to ensure we captured all appeals. Let's search for \"appeal\" in the unvisited documents to see if any new appeals. Use search_document_regex with pattern \"appeal\" but restrict to unvisited docs. But the earlier search covered all docs; but maybe we need to confirm that we didn't miss a match in unvisited docs because the pattern may have missed some. But the search results show 13 matches. Let's check which documents had tokens for those matches. The first 4 matches were in Decision and Order (002). The next 5 matches were in Docket. The next 4 matches were in USCA Mandate. No matches in other documents. So likely all appeals are captured in those 3 documents.\n\nBut we might have missed \"appeal to\" pattern. Search for \"appeal to\" returned 0. But we already have \"appealed to\" inside the USCA Mandate maybe not present. But the \"appeal to\" phrase might appear elsewhere. But we can search for \"appealed to\" too. But might not be needed.\n\nNow, we need to confirm whether the docket entry \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 52 Order on Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,,, Order on Motion to Strike,, by All Plaintiffs.\" includes the appellate court. It mentions \"US Court of Appeals\" but not explicitly in that snippet. But the evidence from USCA Mandate gives the court name. So we can combine. But we need separate entries for each unique appeal. We have two unique appeals: one from Docket referencing \"All Plaintiffs\" but the appellate court is \"United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\". The other from USCA Mandate referencing \"SKI, et al.\" but same appellate court. But maybe they are the same appeal? The docket entry lists \"All Plaintiffs\" and the USCA Mandate lists \"SKI, et al., Plaintiffs - Appellants\". They refer to same parties. So do we need separate entries? The requirement says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So distinct values: the value string may be same or different? The value string is formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So each distinct parties string. \"All Plaintiffs\" and \"SKI, et al.\" are distinct. So we need two entries.\n\nBut we need to provide evidence for each. We already have evidence for both. But we need to ensure that the evidence covers the parties and court. For \"All Plaintiffs\" we need the parties from the docket entry: \"All Plaintiffs\" and the court from USCA Mandate. Provide evidence. For \"SKI, et al.\" we need parties from USCA Mandate and court from same. Provide evidence.\n\nBut we might also have \"All Plaintiffs\" appears also in the docket entry as \"All Plaintiffs\". The docket entry does not include the court but the USCA Mandate includes the court. So we can combine evidence from both documents.\n\nThus we need to add two entries to the checklist. But we already appended 2 entries earlier. Wait, Step 4 appended 1 key: Appeal with 2 values. It appended 2 values. So we have 2 values already. So maybe we are done? But the status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning Appeal has 2 values. So it's complete? But we must confirm no other appeals exist. Let's search for \"appeal\" in \"Decision and Order (001)\" maybe it contains a different appeal. But the search earlier included all docs and didn't find matches in that. But maybe the search missed due to \"appeal\" not matching? But we used regex \"appeal\" which should match. But maybe \"Decision and Order (001)\" contains \"appeal\" but the regex didn't capture? But the search returned 0 matches in that doc. So likely no.\n\nBut we might still need to confirm if \"Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal\" contains \"appeal\" or references to appeals. But search didn't find matches.\n\nThus the checklist is complete. But we need to re-validate: Are there any other appeals like \"Appeal to USC Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\" in other docs? Already captured.\n\nBut maybe there is also an appeal by \"All Plaintiffs\" to a different court like \"Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\" but not present.\n\nGiven the data, we likely have all appeals.\n\nBut we must still decide to stop. However, we need to ensure the checklist values are properly formatted exactly as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' Did we include that format? In earlier append, we had \"Appeal: All Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\" That matches. And \"Appeal: Plaintiffs - Appellants (SKI, et al.) appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\" But that format is \"Appeal: Plaintiffs - Appellants (SKI, et al.) appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\" That matches pattern. So we have 2 entries.\n\nWe should check if the parties string should include \"Plaintiffs - Appellants\" as part? The instruction says \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\" So we can include \"All Plaintiffs\" or \"SKI, et al.\" as parties. The earlier entries had \"Plaintiffs - Appellants (SKI, et al.)\" which includes extra text. Might be okay. But we can keep as is.\n\nBut we need to ensure that we didn't miss any other appeals. Let's search for \"appeal\" in \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" maybe there is some \"Appeal\" clause. But the search earlier didn't find matches. But to be safe, we can search for \"appeal\" again but with doc_names for the unvisited docs to double-check. Use search_document_regex with doc_names list. But the earlier search already scanned all docs. But maybe the regex didn't pick up \"Appeal\" with capital A? We used lower-case search \"appeal\" with default case-insensitive? But we didn't set IGNORECASE. But if not set, regex might be case-sensitive. The search result earlier had 13 matches, but maybe some uppercase \"Appeal\" didn't match because pattern is case-sensitive. In the earlier search for \"appeal\" we got 13 matches; but there may be uppercase \"Appeal\" in docs that were not matched because pattern was not IGNORECASE. But we used default flags, which is empty. So it is case-sensitive. So we might have missed uppercase \"Appeal\" entries. The docket entry had \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\" uppercase. That might not be matched because pattern \"appeal\" lower-case doesn't match uppercase \"APPEAL\". But the search result did find matches at token ranges 4187-4387 etc. Those matches included \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\". So the regex matched uppercase \"APPEAL\" because maybe regex is case-insensitive by default? Or maybe pattern \"appeal\" matched \"APPEAL\" because of default behavior of regex in the tool? The tool's flags default empty. It might be case-sensitive. But the result shows matches at token 4187-4387 that included \"NOTICE OF APPEAL\". So it matched uppercase. So maybe the tool's regex is case-insensitive by default. Or pattern matched case-insensitive. So no issue.\n\nThus proceed to stop.\n\nBut before stopping, we should ensure that the checklist contains the two values as extracted entries. The current extracted list for Appeal has 2 values. Let's confirm that no duplicates. We already appended. The status shows 2 values. So it's complete.\n\nThus we can stop.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All appeal entries have been extracted with supporting evidence.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All appeal entries have been extracted with supporting evidence.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10378, "completion_tokens": 2425, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But maybe there are appeals in the Complaint with different phrasing. Let's search for \"appeal\" again. The previous search included all documents; it returned 13 matches. But maybe some matches overlapped with the same documents. The unvisited documents might have no \"appeal\" words. Let's confirm by doing a search for \"appeal\" again with context. But maybe the search results didn't include all documents due to token limits? The search function returns up to 20 matches per document and context tokens up to 1000. It should have scanned all documents. So likely no more appeals. But we need to double-check if any of the other documents contain appeals like \"appeal to the Seventh Circuit\" etc. Could be in the class action complaint or amended complaint. But the search found only 13 matches across 12 documents; these were in Decision and Order 002, Docket, USCA Mandate. So no other appeals. So the extraction is likely complete.\n\nBut we must ensure we have all distinct appeal values. The current extracted values: 2 values: one from Docket: \"Appeal: All Plaintiffs appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\" Another from USCA Mandate: \"Appeal: Plaintiffs - Appellants (SKI, et al.) appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\" Actually Step 4 appended 2 values. But I think there might be duplication: both refer to same appeal. But we need to extract each distinct value; if they are duplicates, we should only keep one. The requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document. Create separate entries for each unique value.\" So if the same appeal is repeated in multiple documents, we should only have one entry. So we need to deduplicate. But we already have two entries that are essentially the same. But we might need to check if there is a difference: the first says \"All Plaintiffs\", second says \"Plaintiffs - Appellants (SKI, et al.)\". They are similar but slightly different phrasing. Are they considered distinct values? The value is a string that includes the parties. They differ in wording. The problem says distinct values found in any document. So if two documents produce slightly different wording, should we consider them distinct? Usually we need to capture each distinct value. But the meaning might be the same. But we can treat them as distinct strings. But we might want to consolidate duplicates. The guidelines for update_checklist: replace the entire extracted list for specified keys or set Not Applicable. We want to ensure the final list contains all unique values. We currently have 2 values. But we might want to confirm if the second value is indeed distinct. Let's re-examine the evidence: The first value comes from Docket tokens 4187-4230: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 52 Order on Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,,, Order on Motion to Strike,, by All Plaintiffs.\" The second value comes from USCA Mandate tokens 525-575: \"SKI, et al., Plaintiffs - Appellants\". These are two different sources but refer to same appeal. The question: Are they distinct? They mention parties, but both refer to Plaintiffs. The first says \"All Plaintiffs\", second says \"SKI, et al.\" So they are different textual representations, but content is same. The guidelines don't specify deduplication, but \"distinct value\" likely means distinct textual string. So we keep both. But we might consider merging. But to be safe, we keep both.\n\nWe must confirm we didn't miss any other appeals. The search didn't find any. So we can stop. But we need to ensure we have not marked any other keys as empty. The only key is Appeal. It's filled with 2 values. That meets the requirement.\n\nThus the correct next action is to stop.\n\nReturn JSON with decision stop.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{\"decision\":\"stop\",\"reason\":\"All appeals identified and extracted; no additional appearances found in remaining documents.\"}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "All appeals identified and extracted; no additional appearances found in remaining documents.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6502, "completion_tokens": 1083, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}
