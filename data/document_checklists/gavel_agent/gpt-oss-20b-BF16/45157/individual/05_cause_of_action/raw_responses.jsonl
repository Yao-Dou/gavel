The check: The search for \"ADA\" found none for cause of action; but there might be \"Title II of the ADA\" which is not found. But the instructions: \"Do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments or statutory rights), remedies, procedural doctrines, etc.\" So \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" includes a constitutional amendment; but that is part of the cause of action? The example includes both; the cause of action is \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\". So it includes the amendment.

But there might be other cause of action sections that use a different cause such as \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" repeated.

But the Docket may have case summary. But maybe not.\n\nThus, we likely have only one cause of action. But we need to confirm no other unique cause of action appears.\n\nLet's search for \"42 U.S.C. §\" across all documents. But we already did search for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". That found many matches. But maybe there are others like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" is the only. But we might check for \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" alone, but that's same. Ok.\n\nWe could search for \"42 U.S.C. §\" pattern with any number. But we might find others like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" only. But for thoroughness, we could search for \"42 U.S.C. §\" to see if there are other numbers. But maybe not.\n\nAlso \"Title II\" could be cause of action, but search found none. So likely only 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment.\n\nBut to be safe, we should search for \"Section\" or \"§\" to see other. But we can do a regex search for \"§\". But that could be many. But we can limit to \"§\" plus space digits. Let's search for \"§\" pattern: \"§ \\d+\".\n\nWe'll search in all documents for pattern \"§ \\d+\" with IGNORECASE. That might return many matches. But we can limit to top_k 1? But we need to see all distinct. We can search for all matches and then parse. But we need to extract all distinct cause of actions. But the search may return matches in the cause of action sections. But there could be other sections like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" only.\n\nBetter approach: Since we already have a unique value, we can conclude it's the only one. But we need to be sure no other cause of action appears. Let's search for \"42 U.S.C.\" pattern: We already did. Maybe other statutes like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" repeated. There may be \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" only.\n\nBut we might also have \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" repeated; but we need unique. So we can stop.\n\nBut the checklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to check all documents. We currently only have partial coverage of the two complaints. There may be other documents like orders or motions that also include cause of action statements. But those are not likely. But could be in the 'Defendants' Answer' which might list cause of action. But the answer may not list cause of action. But maybe it does.\n\nWe could search for \"Cause of Action\" pattern across all documents. That might return matches. But we already did search for \"cause of action\" and got many matches from the complaints. But maybe other documents also have \"Cause of Action\" headings. But likely not.\n\nThus, we probably extracted all distinct cause of action, but we need to confirm no other unique ones exist. For safety, we can search for \"§\" pattern to capture any other statutory references. But we might get many. But we can parse to find unique ones. But the time is limited.\n\nGiven the steps, we can do a search for \"42 U.S.C. §\" again but maybe with regex capturing the entire phrase. We can then collect unique values. But we already have one.\n\nThus, we can stop. But the system may expect that we set the checklist to complete. But we need to ensure that the checklist has all values. There is only one. We appended it earlier. There's no not applicable. So we can stop.\n\nBut we need to be certain that no other distinct cause of action appears. The search for \"ADA\" found none. The search for \"Title II\" found none. The search for \"42 U.S.C. §\" found many, but all same. The search for \"cause of action\" found only those sections.

But maybe we haven't captured all distinct causes of action. We need to check the documents. We saw matches for \"ADA\" and \"Title II\" but those didn't have matches. The cause of action likely includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"ADA\" maybe Title II of ADA. But we didn't extract those. We need to read more to find all cause of action statements. The search_document_regex for \"cause of action\" found 10 matches: 5 in Class Action Complaint, 5 in First Amended. That likely includes the cause of action statement paragraphs. We might need to extract each distinct cause. Likely there are multiple causes: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, ADA Title II, maybe others like FTCA? We need to inspect the relevant sections.\n\nWe need to read the cause of action sections. Let's read a window around the matches in the Class Action Complaint. We have tokens 2335-2590 already partially visited. That might contain part of the cause of action. But maybe the cause of action is earlier, maybe around 2000 tokens. We need to locate the cause of action. We can use search_document_regex for \"cause of action\" to get context. But we already did that and got matches but no evidence to extract. Let's call search_document_regex again but maybe with pattern \"cause of action\" on all documents, but we already did. But we need the text of the matches. The earlier step gave only matching tokens snippet but not full. The search_document_regex returns context tokens but not the full text? It likely returns context. We can call again to get matches for \"cause of action\" in Class Action Complaint. But we need to supply pattern for each doc. We can call search_document_regex with doc_name = \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\" and pattern \"cause of action\". Also similarly for the Amended Complaint. That will give us context. Then we can read the full window around each match to extract full cause of action paragraphs. But maybe the cause of action is phrased as \"We bring this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Title II of the ADA\". We need to capture each distinct cause: 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA.

We can batch. Let's do search_document_regex with doc_names array. Use pattern \"cause of action\" and flags IGNORECASE maybe. Provide context_tokens 200. That will return snippet context. Then we can parse. We'll then append each distinct cause.\n\nThus action: search_document_regex.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_names\":[\"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\",\"First Amended Class Action Complaint\"],\"pattern\":\"cause of action\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief", "First Amended Class Action Complaint"], "pattern": "cause of action", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4378, "completion_tokens": 705, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

But the requirement: extract every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\n\nFrom step 10 search results, we see many matches with \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" repeated. Also \"Eighth Amendment\" but that's underlying right, not cause of action. So the only cause of action present is 42 U.S.C. § 1983 repeated. Also maybe \"ADA\" or \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" but they didn't find matches. But earlier step 5 search for ADA matches found 4 matches. Those presumably contain \"Title II\" or \"ADA\". But the search didn't find Title II matches. But maybe cause of action includes \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\". That was not found in the search. But maybe the cause of action lists \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Title II of the ADA\" etc. But step 10 match shows only 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment. So maybe the only cause of action is 42 U.S.C. § 1983. But step 5 search for ADA found 4 matches; maybe those show \"Title II of the ADA\" as cause of action. But step 10 didn't capture those matches because maybe the search pattern for cause of action didn't capture ADA. But we need to extract distinct causes of action. So we need to search for \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" again. Step 9 found 0 matches. Step 5 search for ADA found 4 matches. Let's examine step 5 results: It says search_document_regex on all documents (pattern: \"ADA\") found 4 matches: 2 in Class Action Complaint ... 2 in First Amended Class Action Complaint. But we didn't see the actual matches. They may include \"Title II\" or \"Title II of the ADA\". But step 6 search for \"Title II\" found 0 matches. So maybe the cause of action includes \"Title II of the ADA\" but not matched by Title II search due to formatting differences (maybe \"Title II\" appears but not captured because of case or punctuation). Or maybe the cause of action includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and \"Title II of the ADA\" but the search didn't capture Title II due to different formatting like \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" or \"Title II of the ADA\". Step 9 search for the full phrase found 0 matches. So maybe the cause of action is only 42 U.S.C. § 1983. But check the \"ADA\" matches to confirm if Title II appears. Let's search again for \"Title II\" with IGNORECASE maybe? But step 6 didn't find any. Could be that the text uses \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" but our search pattern \"Title II\" didn't match because of line breaks or punctuation. Let's search again with regex pattern that covers \"Title II\" maybe including \"Title II\" or \"Title II of\" or \"Title II of the\". We could search for \"Title II\" with IGNORECASE. But step 6 didn't find any. Maybe the cause of action includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and also \"Title II\" but not captured because of case? But Title II uppercase, so IGNORECASE not needed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cause of action list includes \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" but we need to extract each distinct cause of action. Should we include both 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Title II? The instructions: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens). Do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments or statutory rights), remedies, or procedural doctrines.\" So Title II is a cause of action. So we need to extract Title II if present.\n\nBut not found. Let's search for \"Title II of the Americans\" maybe. Search again across all documents for \"Title II of the Americans\" or \"Title II of the ADA\". Use regex. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.search_document_regex <|constrain|>json<|message|>{\"doc_name\":\"all\",\"pattern\":\"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\",\"flags\":[\"IGNORECASE\"],\"top_k\":5,\"context_tokens\":200}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "all", "pattern": "Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 5856, "completion_tokens": 978, "model": "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16"}}

The prior steps show only 1 value was appended, but we need all distinct values. The search results show that cause of action pattern matched many times, but all seem to be 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment. There might be other causes of action, e.g., Title II of ADA? But earlier searches for ADA and Title II found matches but not cause of action? Actually search for ADA found 4 matches, but we didn't extract cause of action for ADA. But the cause of action may be \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" for each cause. Are there other causes? Maybe 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment appears consistently, but maybe also \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" as cause of action? But earlier search for Title II gave no matches. However, search for ADA found 4 matches; maybe those contain \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" as cause. But they didn't find Title II pattern. Could be that the cause of action is still 42 U.S.C. § 1983. But the requirement: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So we need to find all distinct causes. The current extracted list has 1 value: 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment. But maybe there are multiple causes like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" repeated, but it's same value, so only one distinct. But maybe there are other causes such as \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" or \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Fifth Amendment\"? But the excerpt shows only Eighth Amendment. The search for ADA found 4 matches, but maybe those are part of the same cause? Could be \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" but not seen. Let's search again for \"Title II\" pattern in all documents. Already did and no matches. So maybe only 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is the cause. But step 7 said stop: All distinct Cause_of_Action values have been identified and extracted. So they think it's done. But we have only 1 value. But we need to verify if there are other causes present in other documents like \"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\" or \"Defendants' Answer\" etc. They might have additional causes. We should search for \"cause of action\" again but maybe in other documents not fully visited. But we already searched all documents and found 10 matches, all from the two complaints. So maybe no other cause. But there may be cause of action like \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Title II\" inside the ADA sections. But not found. So maybe only one distinct cause: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\". But is that considered a single cause of action or two? The pattern \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" includes both the statute and the constitutional amendment. The instruction says: \"The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens). Do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments or statutory rights), remedies, or procedural doctrines.\" So the cause of action should be the vehicle, e.g., \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". The Eighth Amendment is an underlying right, not a vehicle. So we should only extract \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". So the current extracted value is wrong; they appended \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\". That is not correct; we need to correct. So we need to update the checklist for Cause_of_Action to set the correct value \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" (and maybe Title II of the ADA if present). But we need to confirm if Title II of the ADA appears. The search for ADA gave 4 matches; maybe those contain \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" as cause. Let's examine one of those matches; we didn't see the excerpt. Let's search again for \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" in all docs, result was 0. But maybe the text uses \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" but we didn't match due to formatting. Let's search for \"Title II of the American\" maybe. Or \"Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\" is the phrase. But we didn't find. Let's search for \"Title II\" again but maybe the regex pattern didn't find due to formatting. Let's search for \"Title II\" with IGNORECASE. But step 6 found no matches. So likely no Title II cause.\n\nSo we need to update the checklist with a correct single entry \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" and evidence from the text. We have evidence from the excerpt: \"First Cause of Action (All Prisoner Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class v. Defendants Carr, Hoy, Roberts, Hepp and Pushich) (42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment)\". We need to extract only the vehicle: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\". Provide evidence snippet: that part. Also location: Document name and maybe page. The snippet captured tokens 15890-16090 etc. Provide evidence. So we need to use update_checklist to replace the existing extracted list for Cause_of_Action with the correct value.\n\nBut we also need to consider deduplication: only one distinct value. So update with one entry. Provide evidence: the text snippet shows \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\". We can quote \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" from that snippet.\n\nThus next action: update_checklist for Cause_of_Action with extracted list containing one entry \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" with evidence.\n\nLet's craft the JSON for update_checklist.\n\nCheck evidence format: evidence array with objects: text, source_document, location. location can be page number or token range. We have token range 15890-16090 for match 1. Provide location: maybe \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief, tokens 15890-16090\". That is fine.\n\nBut we need to ensure we include the snippet: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\". We'll take the part \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\" from that snippet. Provide text: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\" maybe. But we only need the part we extracted. Provide the full snippet to show evidence.\n\nThus patch: key: \"Cause_of_Action\", extracted: [ { value: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983\", evidence: [ { text: \"42 U.S.C. § 1983; Eighth Amendment\", source_document: \"Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\", location: \"tokens 15890-16090\" } ] } ].\n\nWe must use update_checklist.

Need to check if there is any cause of action that is e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, maybe also 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is mentioned as award, not cause. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e? That was in answer.

That evidence snippet is present. So we have at least one evidence.\n\nBut maybe we need to provide evidence from both documents to cover duplicates? But duplicates are same value.
