The Snapshot mentions that the Document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. So, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of documents. That's the first step before I can read any documents or search them. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't available yet.

The user needs the filing date extracted from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nFirst, looking at the current status: all documents are unvisited (marked with ○ Unvisited). There are 11 documents, and the Filing_Date key is empty. The task is to extract every distinct value, so I need to find where the filing date might be mentioned.\n\nThe main documents to check would probably be the Complaints, since those are the initial filings. The \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" and \"Amended Class Action Complaint...\" are the most likely places. The Docket might also have the filing date, as dockets usually list the initial filing date.\n\nSince the documents are unvisited, I should start by reading one of the Complaints. The first one listed is \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" with 75k tokens. But maybe the Docket is a better place to start because dockets often have the filing date prominently listed. However, the Docket is 21k tokens, which is manageable.\n\nWait, the problem says to read a targeted window of up to 10k tokens. The Docket might have the date near the top. So maybe using search_document_regex to look for a date pattern would be efficient. The regex could be something like \\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4} or similar, since dates in legal docs are often in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nBut the user mentioned using search_document_regex when the target is patternable. Filing dates are usually in a specific format. So using a regex to search for dates makes sense. Let me check the available tools. The search_document_regex function can search all documents with a pattern.\n\nWait, the Docket document is likely to have the filing date. But maybe the Complaint itself has the date. However, the Docket is a standard place for such information. Let me think: in court dockets, the first entry is usually the filing date. So the Docket might be the best place to look first.\n\nSo, to save time, instead of reading the entire Complaint, use search_document_regex on all documents to find date patterns. But the pattern should be specific enough. The pattern could be something like \\b\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\\b. But maybe the date is written out as \"Filed: January 1, 2023\" or similar. So perhaps a more general regex, but the instructions say to use precise patterns tied to document structure.\n\nWait, the user's example mentions \"Case No.\", \"Filed:\", so maybe looking for \"Filed:\" followed by a date. So the regex could be \"Filed:\\s*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\" or similar. Let's go with that. So the pattern would be \"Filed:\\s*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\".\n\nUsing search_document_regex with this pattern on all documents (doc_name='all') would find where \"Filed:\" is followed by a date. That should give the filing date. Then, after getting the matches, I can read the context to confirm.\n\nSo the next action should be search_document_regex with pattern \"Filed:\\s*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\" to find potential filing dates. That's efficient rather than reading each document's entire text.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"Filed:\\\\s*\\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{4}\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "Filed:\\s*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3495, "completion_tokens": 822, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot with recent actions and current status.\n\nFirst, looking at the recent actions: Step 1 was list_documents, which found 11 documents. Step 2 was a search_document_regex on all documents with the pattern \"Filed:\\s*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\". The search found 5 matches in the Docket document. The matches have dates like 6/20/2025, 8/12/2025, etc. But wait, the requirement is to extract the filing date when the lawsuit was first filed. The matches from the search are in the Docket entries, which might be event dates, not the original filing date.\n\nThe Docket document is partially visited with tokens 4672-4872, 8694-8894, etc. The matches found are from the Docket, but the actual filing date might be in the Complaint documents. The current status shows that Filing_Date is empty, and the Docket has some dates but they might not be the original filing date.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Filing_Date: The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So the first filing date. The search pattern was \"Filed:\\s*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\", which might be looking for dates in the \"Filed:\" field, but the examples in the matches show \"Date Filed: 6/20/2025\" in Match 2. But that's the date the entry was filed, not the original lawsuit filing. The original filing date should be in the Complaint or the initial pleadings.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" and \"Amended Class Action Complaint\" are likely to contain the original filing date. The Docket is a log of events, so the first entry there might be the filing date. But in the Docket matches, the earliest date mentioned is 6/20/2025 (Match 2), but the actual filing might be earlier. Wait, the first match in the Docket has a date of 6/9/2025 (Minute Entry), but the \"Date Filed\" in Match 2 is 6/20/2025. Wait, the pattern search found \"Date Filed: 6/20/2025\" in Match 2. But the Complaint documents are unvisited. The original filing date is probably in the Complaint, which would have the date when the complaint was filed.\n\nThe user's recent action was a regex search on all documents, but the regex pattern \"Filed:\\s*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\" might not be the right pattern for the complaint. The complaint might have a \"Filed\" date in a different format, like \"Filed: June 20, 2025\" or similar. The regex used is for MM/DD/YYYY, which might be present in the Docket entries, but the actual complaint might have the date in a different format.\n\nWait, the Docket's Match 2 says \"(Date Filed: 6/20/2025)\", so that's a possible candidate. But the task is to find the lawsuit's first filing date. If the Complaint is the first document filed, then the date in the Complaint would be the filing date. However, the regex search was done on all documents, and the Docket has entries with \"Date Filed\", but the Complaint itself might have the filing date.\n\nLooking at the document list, the Complaint documents (both original and amended) are unvisited. The Docket is partially visited. The current status shows that Filing_Date is empty, so we need to find where the actual filing date is.\n\nThe regex search found 5 matches in Docket, but those might not be the original filing date. For example, the Docket entry on 6/20/2025 is a \"Date Filed\" for that entry, but the original complaint was filed earlier. The first entry in the Docket should be the filing date. Let's check the Docket's first entry. The first match in Docket is tokens 4672-4872: \"2025-06-09 | Minute Entry... (Date Filed: 6/20/2025)\" Wait, no, the first match (Match 1) has \"2025-06-09\" as the date of the minute entry, not the filing date. The filing date in Match 2 is 6/20/2025. But maybe the initial complaint was filed on 6/20/2025. However, the Complaint document might have the exact filing date.\n\nWait, the Complaint document is titled \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" – the first filing. So the date on that document would be the filing date. The regex search might not have found it because the pattern used was for \"Filed:\" followed by a date, but the Complaint might have \"Filed on [date]\" or similar.\n\nSince the Docket has \"Date Filed\" entries, but the actual filing date should be the date the complaint was filed, which might be in the Complaint document. The Docket entries are after the filing, so the first Docket entry's \"Date Filed\" would be the filing date. Wait, in legal terms, the Docket entry for the complaint would list the filing date. For example, the complaint is filed on a certain date, and the Docket entry shows that date. So if the first Docket entry is for the complaint, then its \"Date Filed\" is the filing date.\n\nLooking at the matches, Match 2 says \"(Date Filed: 6/20/2025)\". But the Docket entry on 6/20/2025 is for a motion hearing, so the filing date for the complaint might be earlier. Wait, the \"Date Filed\" in the Docket entry is the date the document (the motion) was filed, not the complaint. The complaint itself would have its own filing date.\n\nWait, the user's regex search pattern was \"Filed:\\s*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\", which might not match the actual complaint's date. The complaint document likely has a \"Filed\" date. Since the Complaint documents are unvisited, the next logical step is to read the Complaint document to find the filing date.\n\nThe available documents include two Complaints: \"Class Action Complaint\" and \"Amended Class Action Complaint\". The original complaint should have the filing date. The Amended Complaint would have a different filing date.\n\nThe current status shows that Filing_Date is empty. The regex search found dates in the Docket, but those are for other entries, not the original complaint. So the correct action is to read the original Complaint document to find the filing date.\n\nThe document \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" [Complaint] is unvisited (○ Unvisited). So the next action should be to read that document. Since it's unvisited, we need to read the entire document or a relevant section. But the document is 75,105 tokens, so we can't read it all at once. But the filing date is likely in the header or the beginning. So we should read the first part of the document.\n\nThe function to use is read_document. The start_token should be 0, and end_token should be 10,000 to read the first 10k tokens. That's within the limit. So the next action is to call read_document on the Complaint document with start_token 0 and end_token 10000.\n\nWait, but the user's recent actions already did a search on all documents, but the regex might not have found the correct pattern in the Complaint. So reading the Complaint document is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is read_document for the Complaint document, starting at 0, ending at 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4753, "completion_tokens": 1816, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs the Filing_Date extracted from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: Step 1 was list_documents, found 11 docs. Step 2 was search_document_regex with \"Filed:\\s*\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}\" across all docs, found 5 matches in the Docket document. Step 3 was read_document on the Class Action Complaint (tokens 0-10000), which shows \"Filed 06/04/25\" on the first page.\n\nWait, in the Complaint document, the header says \"Filed 06/04/25\". That's June 4, 2025. The regex search in the Docket found matches like \"Date Filed: 6/20/2025\" and \"Filed on 8/12/2025\". So the Filing_Date should be June 4, 2025, from the Complaint.\n\nBut the user wants every distinct value. The Complaint shows 06/04/25, which is 2025-06-04. The Docket matches have 6/20/2025 and 8/12/2025. Wait, but the Complaint is the first filing, so the Filing_Date should be the date on the complaint. The Docket entries are later filings (like motions), so they shouldn't be considered the initial filing date.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So the initial filing is the complaint. The Complaint document has \"Filed 06/04/25\", so that's the Filing_Date.\n\nThe regex search in Docket found other dates, but those are for subsequent filings (like motions), not the initial complaint. So the correct value is 06/04/25 from the Complaint.\n\nIn the read_document of the Complaint (tokens 0-10000), the first line says \"Filed 06/04/25\". So that's the evidence. The document name is \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", and the location is the header (page 1, token 0-10000).\n\nNow, the current status shows 0 values extracted. So I need to use append_checklist to add this value. The value is \"06/04/25\", but the evidence should be the exact text. The text says \"Filed 06/04/25\", so the extracted value should be \"06/04/25\" (assuming the format is MM/DD/YY as in the document).\n\nWait, the document says \"Filed 06/04/25\", which is June 4, 2025. The checklist item probably expects a standard date format. But the instruction says to extract the value as it appears. So the value is \"06/04/25\", but maybe it should be converted to YYYY-MM-DD? However, the example in the Docket uses \"6/20/2025\", so the format varies. But the task says \"extract EVERY distinct value\", so we should take it as is.\n\nWait, the Complaint says \"Filed 06/04/25\", and the Docket has \"Date Filed: 6/20/2025\". But the initial filing is the complaint's date. So the correct value is \"06/04/25\" from the complaint.\n\nNow, the next step is to append this to the checklist. So the action should be append_checklist with the key \"Filing_Date\", value \"06/04/25\", and evidence from the Complaint document, location \"Page 1 (tokens 0-10000)\".\n\nWait, the document's header says \"Case 3:25-cv-04737     Document 1     Filed 06/04/25     Page 1 of 107\", so the exact text is \"Filed 06/04/25\". The evidence should include that text snippet.\n\nSo the extracted entry would have value \"06/04/25\", evidence text \"Filed 06/04/25\", source_document \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location \"Page 1\".\n\nBut the user's task is to extract the filing date, so this is the only value. The Docket's dates are for later filings, not the initial complaint.

The document catalog shows 11 documents, with the Complaint partially visited (13% coverage) and the Docket partially visited (5% coverage). The other documents are unvisited.\n\nThe recent action was appending Filing_Date from the Complaint. Now I need to check if there are more values to extract. The Docket had some matches in the regex search, like \"Date Filed: 6/20/2025\" and \"Filed on 8/12/2025\". But those might be for later filings (like motions), not the initial complaint filing.\n\nWait, the initial complaint's filing date is clearly stated as \"Filed 06/04/25\" on Page 1. The other dates in the Docket entries are for subsequent filings (e.g., motions filed later), not the original lawsuit filing. So those don't count for Filing_Date, which is specifically the first filing date.\n\nThe instructions say to extract \"EVERY distinct value\" of the checklist item found in any document. But Filing_Date is defined as the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed, so only the initial complaint filing counts. The Docket entries showing later dates are for motions or other filings, not the original complaint.\n\nThe user's step 3 read the Complaint document (tokens 0-10000) and found the filing date. The Docket document had matches, but those are for other documents. The regex search found matches in the Docket, but those are for entries like \"Date Filed: 6/20/2025\" which refers to when a motion was filed, not the case's initial filing.\n\nSo the only relevant value is \"06/04/25\" from the Complaint. The Docket entries don't provide the initial filing date. The other documents (Amended Complaint, Orders, Motions) might have their own filing dates, but those are not the initial case filing date. The checklist item is specifically for the lawsuit's first filing.\n\nThe current status shows 1 value extracted, which matches what was found. The other documents are unvisited, but since they're not the initial complaint, they probably don't contain the filing date. For example, an Amended Complaint would have a later filing date, not the original.\n\nI should verify if the Docket document's \"Date Filed\" entries could be misinterpreted. Looking at the Docket matches:\n- Match 2: \"Date Filed: 6/20/2025\" (this is for a minute entry, not the case filing)\n- Match 5: \"Filed on 8/12/2025\" (for a document, not the case)\n\nThe case filing is already captured in the Complaint's metadata. The Docket's \"Date Filed\" refers to when that specific docket entry was filed, not the case.\n\nSo there are no additional distinct values for Filing_Date. The only value is \"06/04/25\" from the Complaint. The checklist item is complete with one value.\n\nThe system says to stop when all keys are filled or Not Applicable. Here, Filing_Date has one value, so it's complete. The status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to stop, as there are no more values to extract and the checklist is complete.\n\nI need to output a JSON with \"decision\": \"stop\" and a brief reason.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"Filing_Date extracted from Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (06/04/25) is the sole valid value for initial case filing date.

The first match was \"Date Filed: 6/20/2025\" and others had dates like \"Filed on 8/12/2025\". But the user only extracted the value from the Complaint document.\n\nThe checklist definition says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if there are multiple filing dates in different documents, they all need to be extracted.\n\nLooking at the Docket matches:\n- Match 1: \"Date Filed: 6/20/2025\" (from the Minute Entry)\n- Match 2: \"Date Filed: 6/20/2025\" (from the Minute Entry)\n- Match 3: no specific date mentioned in the snippet\n- Match 4: no specific date\n- Match 5: \"Filed on 8/12/2025\" (from the Harvard Termination Letter)\n\nSo there are two distinct dates: 6/20/2025 and 8/12/2025. But the user only extracted 06/04/25 from the Complaint. The Complaint's filing date is the initial filing, but the Docket entries might have subsequent filing dates for other documents (like motions).\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So only the initial filing date matters, not subsequent filings. The Complaint document clearly states \"Filed 06/04/25\" on Page 1, which is the initial filing.\n\nThe Docket entries are for events after the initial filing, like motions. For example, the Minute Entry says \"Filed on 6/20/2025\" for a motion, not the initial lawsuit filing. So those are not the Filing_Date we're looking for.\n\nThe user's Step 4 correctly extracted \"06/04/25\" from the Complaint as the initial filing date. The other dates in the Docket are for later filings (like motions), not the original lawsuit filing.\n\nThe system's automatic checklist review shows Filing_Date is filled with 1 value. The user's Step 5 called stop, but the system says \"stop attempt 1/2\" and asks for another decision.\n\nWait, but the system says \"All checklist items completed\" in Step 5. However, the Docket has a match for \"Date Filed: 6/20/2025\" but that's not the initial filing—it's a later document.

The other dates are for motions filed later, so they don't count as the lawsuit's initial filing date.\n\nTherefore, there's only one valid value for Filing_Date: 06/04/25.\n\nBut let me double-check the Complaint.

That's clearly the initial filing date.\n\nThe Docket entries have \"Date Filed\" but for subsequent entries, like the Minute Entry for June 20, 2025, which is a status conference, not the initial filing.\n\nSo the extraction is complete.
