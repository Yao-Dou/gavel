The available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So the first step should be to list the documents to see what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known yet. \n\nLooking at the tools provided, `list_documents` is the right function to use here. It will return all documents with their metadata. Without knowing what documents exist, I can't proceed to read or search them. So the next action must be to call `list_documents` to get the list of available documents. There's no point in trying to read or search without knowing what documents are present. The other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing the document names, which we don't have yet. So the correct first step is definitely `list_documents`.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3111, "completion_tokens": 257, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all appeal information from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Appeal\", which should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where to look. The available documents include complaints, dockets, orders, motions, etc. Appeals are usually mentioned in the complaint, motions, or docket entries. The Docket document might have the most straightforward info about appeals, since dockets list court actions.\n\nLooking at the documents, the Docket [Docket] is 21,991 tokens and unvisited. That's a good candidate to start with because dockets often list appeals. The other documents like the complaints might mention appeals, but the docket is more likely to have the official appeal details.\n\nI should use `read_document` on the Docket to check for any appeal references. Since it's unvisited, I'll read the entire document. Wait, but the maximum token range per read is 10,000 tokens. The Docket is 21,991 tokens, so I can't read it all at once. I need to split it into chunks. But the instructions say to read up to 10,000 tokens per call. So I'll start with the first 10,000 tokens.\n\nWait, the user's current step is to choose the next action. The previous action was list_documents, which found 11 documents. Now, the next step is to read a document. The Docket is a good target. Let's go with `read_document` on the Docket, starting from token 0 to 10,000.\n\nI should make sure not to read the whole document in one go. So first read tokens 0-10,000. Then, if needed, read the next chunk. But for now, the first action is to read the Docket's first 10k tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3515, "completion_tokens": 461, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the \"Appeal\" checklist item from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot of the current state, and the checklist item \"Appeal\" is empty. The available documents include the Docket, which was partially read (tokens 0-10000), and other documents that haven't been visited yet.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the Docket document has any mention of an appeal. The Docket entries from the recent action (Step 2) show that the case is ongoing, with motions for TRO, class certification, and a preliminary injunction. The last entry in the Docket snippet (entry 57) mentions a Notice of Appearance, but nothing about an appeal. The Order on June 23, 2025 (entries 54-56) grants a preliminary injunction and class certification, but no appeal is mentioned there.\n\nSince the Docket was partially read (only up to token 10,000), maybe there's more information beyond that. But the current view is tokens 0-10000. The Docket has 21,991 tokens, so there's more to read. However, the problem is that the checklist item \"Appeal\" hasn't been found yet. The user's instruction says to extract every distinct value of the checklist item, and the format should be \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nLooking at the documents listed, the Docket is the most likely place to find an appeal, but the current reading hasn't shown any. The other documents like \"Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal Relief Requested by August 4, 2025\" (which is a document name) might contain the appeal information. Wait, the document name itself mentions \"Pending Appeal,\" so that's a strong candidate. But the document is marked as unvisited (○ Unvisited). So maybe the next step is to read that specific document.\n\nWait, the available documents include \"Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal Relief Requested by August 4, 2025\" [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 54,042 tokens - ○ Unvisited. Since the document name has \"Pending Appeal,\" it's highly probable that this document contains the appeal information. So instead of reading more of the Docket (which we already partially read and didn't find anything), it's better to read this specific document.\n\nThe next action should be to read_document on that specific document. The document name is \"Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal Relief Requested by August 4, 2025\". So the doc_name is \"Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal Relief Requested by August 4, 2025\". Since it's unvisited, start from token 0 to 10,000 (max allowed). The token count is 54k, so reading the first 10k tokens is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for \"appeal\" in that document. But the document name already hints at it, so reading the document directly makes sense. The user's decision policy says to choose read_document when a specific document is likely to contain the target value. So the next action should be read_document on that motion document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal Relief Requested by August 4, 2025\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal Relief Requested by August 4, 2025", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13708, "completion_tokens": 753, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The snapshot shows that this document contains the phrase \"On Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California\" and the case number \"No. 25-4249\" in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nFrom the document excerpt, I can see:\n- The case is \"NEETA THAKUR, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellees, V. DONALD J.

The appealing parties are the defendants (Trump et al.) who are now \"Defendants-Appellants\" in the appellate court. The appellate court is the Ninth Circuit.\n\nSo I can extract this as: \"Appeal: DONALD J.

The document states \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\" and \"Defendants-Appellants\" so that's solid evidence.\n\nThe document has been partially read (only 19% coverage), but the relevant information is in the header/first page which we've already read (tokens 0-10000).

The user is asking me to extract all checklist items related to \"Appeal\" from legal documents. The checklist item is defined as: \"Appeal: Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court. The extracted value should be formated as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\"\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted one value from the \"Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal Relief Requested by August 4, 2025\" document. The extracted value is \"Appeal: DONALD J. TRUMP, et al. appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\" The evidence comes from the case header on page 1 of that document.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other appeals mentioned in the remaining documents. The current state shows:\n- 1 key with 1 value (Appeal)\n- 0 empty keys\n- 0 Not Applicable\n- 11 documents total\n\nThe documents that are unvisited (○ Unvisited) include:\n- Amended Class Action Complaint\n- Class Action Complaint\n- Order\n- Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n- Order Re National Science Foundation's Suspension of Grants\n- Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n- Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\n- NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction\n- Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\n\nI should check if any of these unvisited documents mention an appeal. The key here is to look for any mention of \"appeal\" or \"appellate court\" in the unvisited documents.\n\nThe most promising document would be the \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification\" since it's an order that might reference any appeals. But since the previous extraction already found an appeal in the Motion for Partial Stay document, which is a document specifically about an appeal, it's possible that this is the only appeal mentioned.\n\nWait, the Motion for Partial Stay is the document where the appeal is being requested, so it's the primary document for the appeal. The other documents are likely related to the underlying case, not the appeal itself.\n\nI should check if any other documents explicitly mention an appeal. For example, the \"Order\" or \"Amended Class Action Complaint\" might reference an appeal, but given the context, it's unlikely.\n\nThe current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning all checklist items are filled (since there's only one item: Appeal). The user's task is to extract every distinct value of the checklist item \"Appeal\", and they've found one value.\n\nWait, the checklist item is singular: \"Appeal\". So there's only one checklist key to fill. They've extracted one value for it, and the status shows it's complete.\n\nBut let me double-check the documents. The \"Motion for Partial Stay\" is the document where the appeal is being filed, so that's where the appeal information comes from. The other documents are either the complaint, motions related to the district court, or orders from the district court. None of those should mention an appeal because the appeal hasn't happened yet—the district court order was just granted, and now the appeal is being filed.\n\nThe \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" is a district court order, so no appeal yet. The appeal would be filed after that order.\n\nSince the only document that mentions an appeal is the Motion for Partial Stay, and they've already extracted that, there are no other appeals to extract.\n\nThe current status shows \"Total Values Extracted: 1\" and \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning they've extracted all possible values for the Appeal item. The checklist has only one item, so it's complete.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop, because all applicable checklist items are fully extracted.\n\nWait, but the instructions say to stop only when every checklist key is either complete or Not Applicable. Here, the key is complete with one value, so it's done.\n\nThe user has already used `append_checklist` to add the value, and the status shows it's complete. So the next action should be to stop.\n\nI need to confirm there are no other appeals. Let's look at the document names again. The \"Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal\" is the only one that mentions \"Appeal\" in the title, so that's the only place to find appeal information.\n\nThe other documents like \"Class Action Complaint\" or \"Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\" are all part of the district court proceedings, not the appeal.
