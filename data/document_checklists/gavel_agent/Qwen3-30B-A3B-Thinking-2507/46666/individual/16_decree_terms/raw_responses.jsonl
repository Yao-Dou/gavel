The user needs me to extract all significant terms of decrees from the provided documents. The checklist item is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", which refers to the substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available documents. The snapshot shows 11 documents, all unvisited (marked with ○). The key is empty, so I need to find where these terms might be located. The Order documents (like \"Order\" and \"Order Granting Motion...\") are the most likely places to find court-ordered terms. The \"Order\" document is 11,595 tokens, which is under the 10k limit for a single read, so reading the whole thing might be feasible. But wait, the maximum per read is 10k tokens, and this is 11,595, so I can't read the entire document in one go. Hmm, but maybe the relevant terms are in the beginning. Alternatively, using a regex search might be better to find specific terms.\n\nLooking at the checklist definition, the terms are the court-ordered obligations. So patterns like \"the Court ORDERS that\" or \"the following terms\" might be useful. But the user mentioned to use regex for patternable targets. Let me think of a regex pattern. Maybe something like \"ORDERED\" or \"ORDER\" followed by the terms. But the exact wording might vary. The key is to find where the court lists the terms. \n\nWait, the \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" document is 39k tokens, which is too big. But maybe the actual decree terms are in the order part. Alternatively, the \"Order\" document (11k tokens) might have the main decree. But since it's 11,595 tokens, which is over 10k, I can't read the whole thing. So I should split it into parts. But the system says to read only unvisited tokens. Since it's unvisited, I need to read a window. Maybe start from the beginning. The first 10k tokens would cover the initial part. But the problem is, the document might have the terms later. However, court orders usually have the terms in the body, so maybe the first part has them.\n\nAlternatively, use a regex search to find \"ORDER\" or \"DECREED\" to locate sections where the terms are listed. The regex tool can search for patterns like \"ORDER(?:S|ED)?\\s+that\" or similar. Let's consider using search_document_regex with a pattern like \"ORDER.*?that\" to find the clauses where the court orders something. The context tokens can be set to 200 to get surrounding text.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say to use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable. Since the terms are likely introduced with phrases like \"the Court orders that...\", using a regex to find \"ORDER\" or \"ORDERS\" followed by the terms makes sense. So the next step should be to use search_document_regex on all documents, but maybe start with the Order documents first. However, the tool allows searching all documents. But to be efficient, maybe search all documents with a pattern like \"ORDER\\s+that\" to find the relevant sections.\n\nBut the pattern should be precise. Let's go with \"ORDER\\s+that\" as a starting point. The flags can be set to ignore case. So the parameters would be pattern: \"ORDER\\\\s+that\", doc_name: \"all\", top_k: 5, context_tokens: 200. That should find the most relevant matches across all documents.\n\nWait, the available documents include \"Order\" and \"Order Granting Motion...\", which are the most likely candidates. But the regex might find matches in other documents too, like motions that reference the order. However, the key is to extract terms ordered by the court, so the actual order documents are primary. But searching all documents with the regex could help locate the sections.\n\nSo the next action should be to call search_document_regex with the pattern \"ORDER\\\\s+that\" to find where the court orders specific terms. This will give me the context to then read the specific parts if needed. Since the documents are unvisited, this search might efficiently point to the relevant sections without having to read through all tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"ORDER\\\\s+that\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200, \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "ORDER\\s+that", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200, "flags": ["IGNORECASE"]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3570, "completion_tokens": 978, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is trying to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from legal documents. The checklist item requires all distinct values of substantive court-ordered obligations, like consent decrees or stipulated judgments.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: they did a search for \"ORDER\\s+that\" across all 11 documents and found two matches. One in \"Motion for Partial Stay...\" and another in \"Order Granting Motion...\". But the matches they found don't actually contain the decree terms. The first match is just a case citation reference, and the second is part of a court's reasoning about standing, not the actual decree terms.\n\nThe current status shows 0 values extracted for the only checklist key. The documents that have been partially read (the two with matches) haven't provided the actual decree terms. The other documents are unvisited, so they might contain the relevant info.\n\nThe next logical step is to read more of the documents where the \"ORDER\" pattern was found, because the matches were in those documents but the actual decree terms might be elsewhere in them. The \"Order Granting Motion...\" document was partially read from tokens 26549-26749, but the decree terms are likely in the main order section, which might be earlier or later. Since the viewed tokens are only a small part (1% coverage), I should read a larger window of that document to find the actual decree terms.\n\nThe other document, \"Motion for Partial Stay...\", had a match at 39962-40162, but that was in the middle of a case citation. The decree terms probably aren't in that motion, but maybe the order document has them. So focusing on the \"Order Granting Motion...\" document makes sense.\n\nThe user should call read_document on that order document, starting from the beginning since they only viewed a small part. The document is 39,147 tokens, and they've viewed 26549-26749 (200 tokens). So the next read should start from 0 or a bit before, but since they haven't read much, reading from the start would be efficient. Wait, but the viewed tokens are 26549-26749, which is in the middle. So the unviewed parts are from 0-26549 and 26749 onward. To cover the entire document, they should read the beginning first. But since the match was at 26549, maybe the decree terms are before that. So reading from 0 to 26549 would cover the part before the match. But the document might have the order at the beginning. So it's better to read a larger range starting from the beginning.\n\nThe maximum read is 10,000 tokens. So starting from 0 to 10,000 tokens. But the viewed tokens start at 26549, so the beginning (0-26549) hasn't been read. Wait, no: the viewed tokens are 26549-26749, which is a small window in the middle. So the parts before 26549 and after 26749 are unvisited. To cover the start of the document, which is likely where the order is, read from 0 to 10,000. That's within the 10k limit. So the next action should be read_document on \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification\" with start_token 0 and end_token 10000.\n\nThat way, they can get the beginning of the document where the actual decree terms would be listed. The previous search found a match in the middle, but the decree terms are probably in the main order text, which is usually at the top.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4166, "completion_tokens": 883, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot with the current status, documents, and recent actions.\n\nFirst, I need to check what's been done so far. The recent actions include a `list_documents` which found 11 documents, then a `search_document_regex` on all documents with pattern \"ORDER\\s+that\", which found two matches. Then a `read_document` on the \"Order Granting Motion...\" from tokens 0-10000.\n\nLooking at the read document content, the text provided is the beginning of the order. The key part for the checklist item would be the actual terms ordered by the court. The checklist definition says to extract substantive obligations ordered by the court, like consent decrees or stipulated judgments.\n\nIn the provided text, the order is granting a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification. The \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" would be the specific terms of the injunction. Let me scan the text for any explicit terms.\n\nLooking through the document, the order says: \"The Court grants preliminary injunctive relief on a classwide basis as to both classes, for the reasons explained in the remainder of the order.\" But the actual terms aren't listed here. The text provided is only up to page 18, and the significant terms might be in the later sections.\n\nWait, the document is read from tokens 0-10000, but the order's main terms might be in the \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION\" section, which is mentioned in the table of contents on page 5. The user's read document only covers up to page 18, but the text provided stops at page 17-18. The actual terms might be in the \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION\" section, which isn't covered in the current read.\n\nThe current read (0-10000 tokens) is only the first part of the document. The document has 39,147 tokens, so 10,000 tokens is about 25% as per the status (Viewed tokens: 0-10000, 26549-26749). The 26549-26749 tokens were from the regex search, which was a match in the text but not the actual decree terms.\n\nThe regex search found a match in the document, but the text provided in the search result was a snippet from the case background, not the decree terms. The actual decree terms are likely in the \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION\" section, which hasn't been read yet.\n\nSo, the next step is to read more of the document to find the specific terms. The document is partially visited, so I should read the next unvisited token range. The current viewed tokens are 0-10000 and 26549-26749. The next unvisited range would be 10000-26549, but since the maximum per read is 10,000 tokens, I can read 10000-20000 first, then 20000-26549 if needed.\n\nWait, the document is 39,147 tokens. The next unvisited range after 0-10000 would be 10000-20000. So the correct action is to call `read_document` for the same document, Order Granting Motion..., with start_token 10000 and end_token 20000. That's within the 10k token limit.\n\nI should not use `search_document_regex` again because the pattern \"ORDER\\s+that\" was already used and didn't yield the decree terms. The actual terms are likely in the body of the order, so reading the next token range is better.\n\nSo the next action should be `read_document` for Order Granting Motion... from 10000 to 20000 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 20000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 20000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14695, "completion_tokens": 938, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is about substantive obligations ordered by the court, like consent decrees or stipulated judgments. The key is to extract each term as a separate value with evidence.\n\nLooking at the current status, all keys are empty. The main document they've partially read is \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification\" up to tokens 20000. The previous steps involved a regex search for \"ORDER that\" which found two matches, but those were in the motion document and the order. The order document's first 20k tokens were read.\n\nIn the read_document output (tokens 0-20000), I need to find where the court ordered specific terms. The document is an order granting a preliminary injunction. The injunction terms should be in the order section. Let me scan through the text.\n\nIn the document, under \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION\" on page 60, there's a section that lists the injunction terms. Let me check the provided text. Wait, the read_document output ends at token 20000, which is around page 32. The \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION\" might be later. Wait, the text provided shows the document goes up to page 33. Let me look for \"injunction\" or \"terms\" in the text.\n\nIn the text, there's a part under \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION\" but the exact content isn't fully shown in the provided tokens. Wait, the last part of the read_document is \"iv\" on page 33, so maybe the injunction terms are in that section. However, the user's provided text for the read_document (tokens 10000-20000) ends with \"iv\" and the content before that is about final agency action. The actual injunction terms might be in the \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION\" section, which might be after the current read range.\n\nWait, the document's table of contents lists \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION\" starting on page 60. The read_document was from tokens 0-20000, which covers up to page 33 as per the document's page numbers. So the actual injunction terms (IV) are probably in the later tokens, beyond 20000. The user has read up to 20000 tokens, but the document is 39k tokens. So the SCOPE section is likely in the remaining tokens (20000-39147). \n\nBut the current action history shows they've read tokens 0-20000. The next step is to read more tokens to get to the SCOPE section. The available documents include the order document as partially visited (viewed 0-20000, 26549-26749). So the next logical step is to read the remaining tokens from 20000 onwards to find the injunction terms.\n\nWait, the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" is the checklist item. The court order would have specific terms in the injunction. For example, the order might say \"Defendants shall not terminate any grants without a reasoned explanation\" or similar. I need to find those exact terms.\n\nIn the provided text, there's a mention of \"the Court grants preliminary injunctive relief on a classwide basis as to both classes, for the reasons explained in the remainder of the order.\" The \"remainder\" would include the scope of the injunction. So the actual terms are in the \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION\" section, which hasn't been read yet.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to read the document from token 20000 to 30000 (or up to 39147) to get the injunction terms. Since the maximum per read is 10k tokens, reading 20000-30000 would be the next step. The document's total is 39147 tokens, so 20k-30k is within the limit.\n\nAlternatively, check if the regex search can find the terms directly. But the user already did a regex for \"ORDER that\" which found matches in the motion document and the order. The order's token 26549-26749 was a match, but that was in the text about the Perkins case, not the injunction terms. So the regex might not be the best here; better to read the document where the order's terms are stated.\n\nSo the correct action is to read_document on the order document from tokens 20000 to 30000 to get the scope of the injunction section.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification\", \"start_token\": 20000, \"end_token\": 30000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification", "start_token": 20000, "end_token": 30000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 25155, "completion_tokens": 1095, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Wait, the document is 39,147 tokens total, so 0-30000 is 30k tokens, leaving 9k tokens unread.\n\nBut the user's latest read was tokens 20000-30000. The previous reads were 0-10000 and 10000-20000, so together 0-30000. The document has 39,147 tokens, so 30k is 77% coverage as per the catalog.\n\nNow, looking at the text they've read, the court order includes the grant of preliminary injunction. The specific terms of the injunction would be in the order. For example, the court might say \"the defendants are enjoined from terminating grants without reasoned explanation\" or similar.\n\nIn the text, there's a part where it says \"the Court grants preliminary injunctive relief on a classwide basis as to both classes, for the reasons explained in the remainder of the order.\" Then later, in section IV, \"SCOPE OF INJUNCTION\", which is where the actual terms would be. However, the text provided cuts off before that section.\n\nWait, looking at the text they've read (tokens 20000-30000), the last part is about irreparable harm.

But the text they provided ends at page 48, which is part of the irreparable harm section. So the actual decree terms might be in the next section.\n\nBut since they've read up to 30k tokens, which is 77% of the document, maybe the scope of injunction is in the part they've read. Let me check the text again.\n\nIn the document, after the \"B. Irreparable Harm\" section, there's \"C. Balance of the Harms and Public Interest\" (page 48), then \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION\" (page 60). Wait, the text provided ends at page 48, so the scope section is later. The user's read was up to tokens 30000, which is page 48. The document's page numbers go up to 62, so the scope section (page 60) is still unread.\n\nWait, the tokens 0-30000 would cover up to page 48, but the actual scope of injunction is on page 60. So the user hasn't read that part yet. Therefore, they need to read more of the document to find the decree terms.\n\nBut the user has already read 30k tokens, and the document is 39k tokens, so the remaining is 9k tokens. They should read the next token range to get to the scope section.\n\nThe next token range would be 30000-39147. But since the maximum per read is 10k tokens, they can read 30000-40000, but the document is only 39147 tokens, so 30000-39147.\n\nWait, the catalog says the document has 39,147 tokens, so the next read should be 30000-39147. But since the user's previous read was up to 30000, they need to read the remaining part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the decree terms are mentioned earlier in the document. Let me check the text again.\n\nIn the order, when the court grants the preliminary injunction, it might state the terms. For example, in the \"I. BACKGROUND\" section, but that's about the background. The actual injunction terms would be in the \"IV.

Since the text provided stops before that section, the user needs to read further.\n\nSo the next step is to read the next token range: 30000-39147 (since the document ends at 39147). But the maximum allowed is 10k tokens, so 30000-40000, but since the document is 39147, it's 30000-39147.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call read_document for \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification\" with start_token 30000 and end_token 39147.\n\nWait, the user's recent actions show they read up to 30000, so the next read should start at 30000.

In addition, Plaintiffs have shown a significant likelihood of future unlawful terminations to the certified classes pursuant to the same policies at issue. (See Section II.A.2.iii.) As described in the Section I, Agency Defendants describe their grant termination processes as ongoing, and the Administration has allegedly declared its intention to 'go after' the UC System financially through its grants. Accordingly, the Court will order on a prospective basis that future grant terminations meeting the required criteria are likewise vacated upon issuance, and may not be given effect.\"\n\nSo the significant terms here are:\n1. \"Agency Defendants' grant terminations as to the Form Termination Class and the Equity Termination Class are set aside and vacated.\"\n2. \"barring the Agency Defendants from giving effect to the vacated terminations and restoring the status quo.\"\n3. \"future grant terminations meeting the required criteria are likewise vacated upon issuance, and may not be given effect.\"\n\nThese are the court-ordered terms. Each is a distinct obligation. I need to extract each as a separate value with evidence.\n\nThe evidence should be the exact text from the document. The document is \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification\" and the relevant part is in the \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION\" section.\n\nSo the extracted values would be:\n- \"Agency Defendants' grant terminations as to the Form Termination Class and the Equity Termination Class are set aside and vacated.\"\n- \"barring the Agency Defendants from giving effect to the vacated terminations and restoring the status quo.\"\n- \"future grant terminations meeting the required criteria are likewise vacated upon issuance, and may not be given effect.\"\n\nEach needs to have the evidence with source document, location, and verbatim text.\n\nSince the document has been fully read, I can now append these values to the checklist. I'll use append_checklist because these are new entries and the document is fully visited, so I don't need to read it again.\n\nI need to make sure each entry has the evidence. Let me structure the evidence for each:\n\n1. For \"set aside and vacated\": \n   - text: \"Agency Defendants' grant terminations as to the Form Termination Class and the Equity Termination Class are set aside and vacated.\"\n   - source_document: \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification\"\n   - location: \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION, page 60\"\n\n2. For \"barring from giving effect\":\n   - text: \"barring the Agency Defendants from giving effect to the vacated terminations and restoring the status quo.\"\n   - source_document: same as above\n   - location: \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION, page 60\"\n\n3. For \"future grant terminations vacated\":\n   - text: \"future grant terminations meeting the required criteria are likewise vacated upon issuance, and may not be given effect.\"\n   - source_document: same\n   - location: \"IV. SCOPE OF INJUNCTION, page 60\"\n\nI should check if there are more terms, but from the text provided, these seem to be the main ones. The document mentions \"vacated\" multiple times, but the specific phrases are the key terms.\n\nSo the next action is to append these three values to the checklist. Since the document is fully visited, I don't need to read it again. The previous steps already read the entire document, so I can proceed with append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Agency Defendants' grant terminations as to the Form Termination Class and the Equity Termination Class are set aside and vacated.\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Agency Defendants' grant terminations as to the Form Termination Class and the Equity Termination Class are set aside and vacated.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Provisional Class Certification\",\n                \"location\": \"IV.
