The system says to use list_documents if the catalog is unknown. Here, the available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet,\" so I should call list_documents first. That's the only action possible here because there's nothing to read or search without documents. I can't read a document that doesn't exist, so list_documents is the right choice to get the catalog started.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3145, "completion_tokens": 167, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the judge's name from the provided documents. The checklist item is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\", and they want every distinct value with evidence.\n\nFirst, I should check the current status. The snapshot shows 11 documents, all unvisited. The checklist key is empty, so I need to find where the judge's name might be. Typically, in legal documents, the judge's name appears in the order or opinion documents, maybe in the docket.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Docket\" and \"Order\" files are the most likely places. The Docket often lists court proceedings, including the judge's name. The \"Order\" documents might have the judge's name in the header or signature.\n\nSince all documents are unvisited, I should start by checking the Docket first because it's a common place for judge names. The Docket is 21,991 tokens, which is more than 10k, but I can read the first 10k tokens to see if the judge's name is there. Wait, the system says not to read more than 10k tokens per call. The Docket is 21k, so I can read the first 10k tokens (start 0, end 10000) to check for the name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a regex search to find patterns like \"Judge [A-Z]+ [A-Z]+\". But the instructions say to use search_document_regex when the target is patternable. The pattern for a judge's name might be something like \"Judge\\s+\\w+\\s+\\w+\" or similar. Let me think: the example given in the problem says \"Case No.\", \"Filed:\", so maybe a regex for \"Judge\" followed by names.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\", so the value should be the full name. The regex could be looking for \"Judge\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+)\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+)\" but maybe simpler. However, the user might not have a specific pattern, so maybe it's better to read the Docket first since it's a standard document.\n\nBut the system says to avoid rereading, but since all are unvisited, starting with the Docket makes sense. The Docket is listed as [Docket], which is probably the court docket that lists the judge. So, I'll use read_document on the Docket, first 10k tokens.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows \"Docket\" as unvisited. So, the next step is to read a part of it. Since it's 21k tokens, reading the first 10k tokens (0-10000) is the way to go. That's within the 10k limit. So the action should be read_document with doc_name \"Docket\", start_token 0, end_token 10000.\n\nWait, the user's recent action was list_documents, which found 11 docs. Now, the next step is to choose one action. The available actions are to read_document or search_document_regex. Since the Docket is likely to have the judge's name, reading it is the direct approach. So, the correct action here is read_document on the Docket for the first 10k tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3549, "completion_tokens": 753, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 3, "run_id": "bde1450d-68e9-4b62-ab12-ffc3daf93f72", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T07:15:14.946466-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's see. The task is to extract the judge's name from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\". From the provided documents, I need to find where the judge's name is mentioned.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 2 was a `read_document` on Docket (tokens 0-10000). The Docket document shows several entries. Let me check for mentions of the judge.\n\nIn entry 4, it says \"Case assigned to Judge Rita F. Lin.\" Then in entry 19, \"ORDER by Judge Rita F. Lin granting 5 Motion for Pro Hac Vice...\". Entry 20 mentions \"ORDER SETTING STATUS CONFERENCE. Signed by Judge Rita F. Lin...\". Entry 28 has \"Minute Entry for proceedings held by Zoom before Judge Rita F. Lin...\". Entry 32 is \"DISCOVERY ORDER. Signed by Judge Rita F. Lin...\". Entry 45: \"ORDER... Signed by Judge Rita F. Lin...\". Entry 49: \"NOTICE OF QUESTIONS FOR HEARING. Signed by Judge Rita F. Lin...\". Entry 50: \"Minute Entry for proceedings held before Judge Rita F. Lin...\". Entry 54: \"ORDER by Judge Rita F. Lin granting 7 Motion for Preliminary Injunction...\". Entry 55: \"Preliminary Injunction Order. Signed by Judge Rita F. Lin...\". Entry 56: \"CASE MANAGEMENT SCHEDULING ORDER... Signed by Judge Rita F. Lin...\".\n\nSo the judge's name is consistently \"Rita F. Lin\" in all these entries. The checklist requires the first and last name, formatted as '[full name]'. Here, it's Rita F. Lin. The middle initial is included, so the full name would be Rita F. Lin. The problem says not to include Supreme Court Justices, which this isn't, so it's valid.\n\nNow, I need to extract this value with evidence. Each entry where the judge's name appears can be a separate evidence, but since it's the same name, it's one value. The evidence should include the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nThe document read was Docket (tokens 0-10000), and the relevant parts are in entries 4, 19, 20, etc. The location can be the specific document entries (like entry 4, 19, etc.) or the token range. Since the Docket is a list, the location might be the entry numbers. But the instructions say to use location like page, section, or token offsets. In the Docket, the entries are listed with numbers (e.g., \"4 | 2025-06-05 | Case assigned to Judge Rita F. Lin...\"), so the location could be \"Docket Entry 4\", \"Docket Entry 19\", etc. However, the evidence requires location as \"e.g., page, section, docket entry; include token offsets if available.\" The Docket entries are in the document, so maybe \"Docket Entry 4\" is sufficient, but since the tokens read were 0-10000, and the entries are part of that, perhaps specifying the entry number is acceptable.\n\nThe extracted value is \"Rita F. Lin\", and the evidence should have multiple entries (each entry where it appears), but the checklist item can have multiple values, but here it's the same value. Wait, the requirement says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\", so if it's the same name multiple times, it's still one distinct value. So we need to add one entry with \"Rita F. Lin\" and include multiple evidence snippets (from different entries) to support it.\n\nBut the `append_checklist` allows adding multiple evidence entries for the same value. Wait, no: each evidence entry is part of the extracted value. So for the key \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\", the extracted list should have one entry (since it's the same name), and that entry should have multiple evidence items (each from different parts of the document).\n\nWait, no. The value is \"Rita F. Lin\", and each evidence is a supporting text. So the extracted value is \"Rita F. Lin\", and the evidence array includes multiple instances (e.g., from Docket Entry 4, Entry 19, etc.). So the value is the same, but evidence is multiple.\n\nLooking at the evidence structure: each evidence entry has \"text\", \"source_document\", \"location\". So for each occurrence, we can have a separate evidence entry, but the value is the same. Wait, no. The extracted value is a list of values. Each value in the list has its own evidence. But since the value is the same, we should have one value entry with multiple evidence items.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So if the value is the same, it's one entry. But the evidence can have multiple supporting texts. So for the value \"Rita F. Lin\", the evidence array should include multiple entries (e.g., from different parts of the document).\n\nYes, the evidence is an array of objects, each with text, source_doc, location. So for the same value, multiple evidence items.\n\nSo for \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\", the extracted list will have one entry with value \"Rita F. Lin\", and the evidence array will have multiple entries (e.g., from Docket Entry 4, 19, etc.).\n\nNow, the next action is to append this to the checklist. Since the value was found in the Docket document, we should use `append_checklist` with the patch.\n\nThe Docket document is the source, tokens 0-10000 (already read), so the location for evidence would be \"Docket Entry 4\", \"Docket Entry 19\", etc. But the exact token locations might be better. However, the Docket is presented as a list with numbered entries, so the location can be specified as \"Docket Entry 4\" or similar.\n\nIn the provided text, entry 4 is \"Case assigned to Judge Rita F. Lin.\" So the text would be \"Case assigned to Judge Rita F. Lin.\" from entry 4. Similarly, entry 19 is \"ORDER by Judge Rita F. Lin granting...\".\n\nSo evidence entries would be:\n\n- text: \"Case assigned to Judge Rita F. Lin.\", source_document: \"Docket\", location: \"Docket Entry 4\"\n- text: \"ORDER by Judge Rita F. Lin granting 5 Motion for Pro Hac Vice...\", source_document: \"Docket\", location: \"Docket Entry 19\"\n- etc.\n\nBut since the Docket is the document, and the entries are numbered, using \"Docket Entry X\" as location is acceptable.\n\nNow, the checklist key \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\" is empty, so we need to append the value. The value should be \"Rita F. Lin\" (formatted as [full name], which it is).\n\nSo the next action is to call `append_checklist` with the patch for this key, including the value and multiple evidence entries.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\", and here it's one distinct value, so one entry in the extracted list. Each evidence entry is part of that one value's evidence.\n\nSo the patch should have key \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\", extracted array with one item: evidence array (with multiple evidence objects), value \"Rita F. Lin\".\n\nNow, need to make sure the evidence is correctly cited. Let's pick at least two examples to confirm.\n\nFrom the Docket text:\n\n- Entry 4: \"Case assigned to Judge Rita F. Lin.\"\n- Entry 19: \"ORDER by Judge Rita F. Lin granting 5 Motion for Pro Hac Vice...\"\n\nSo two evidence entries. Let's include those.\n\nThe source_document is \"Docket\" as per the catalog.\n\nLocation: \"Docket Entry 4\" and \"Docket Entry 19\".\n\nSo the evidence array would have two items.\n\nNow, check if the value is correctly formatted. The requirement says \"formatted as '[full name].'\", so \"Rita F. Lin\" is correct. The middle initial is included, which is acceptable since the source includes it.\n\nSo the action is to append the checklist with the value and evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"First_and_Last_name_of_Judge\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Rita F.

So they've already appended the value \"Rita F.

The available documents include other files like Complaint, Order/Opinion, etc., but the user needs to check if there's any other mention of the judge's name in those documents.\n\nWait, the task is to extract EVERY distinct value. So far, only Rita F. Lin has been found. But maybe there are other judges mentioned in other documents? However, the case seems to be assigned to Judge Rita F. Lin, as per the Docket entry 4. The other documents like the Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction (entry 54) also mentions her. So maybe she's the only judge involved.\n\nBut the system's policy says to check all documents. The Docket document was partially read (0-10000 tokens, 45% coverage). The other documents are unvisited. However, the checklist item is about the judge's name, which is likely mentioned in the Docket and the court orders. Since the Docket already has multiple mentions, maybe the other documents don't have additional judge names. But to be thorough, should I check another document?\n\nWait, the user's current step is Step 4, and the recent actions show that they've already appended the value. The current status says all keys are filled (1/1). So maybe they're done. But the system requires checking if all applicable values are extracted. The problem is, the Docket entry 4 says \"Case assigned to Judge Rita F. Lin,\" and subsequent entries confirm her name. The other documents might not have additional judges. For example, the Order/Opinion documents would likely be signed by her as well, but since the Docket already has her name, maybe it's redundant.\n\nBut the instructions say to extract EVERY distinct value. If there's only one judge, then \"Rita F. Lin\" is the only value. The user has already appended it. The current status shows 1 value, and the key is filled. So maybe it's time to stop.\n\nWait, the checklist summary says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. The stop criteria require that every checklist key is either complete or Not Applicable. Since there's only one key and it's complete, the next step should be to stop.\n\nBut the user's recent action was append_checklist, and the system says to stop when all keys are filled. So the correct action here is to stop. The reason is that the judge's name has been extracted from the Docket, and no other judge names are present in the documents. The other documents might not have additional entries for the judge's name, and the existing evidence is sufficient.\n\nWait, but the Docket was only partially read (45% coverage). The tokens 0-10000 were read, but the Docket has 21,991 tokens. Could there be more mentions of the judge in the remaining tokens? For example, maybe later entries in the Docket mention her again. But the user's previous action was to append the value based on the text read. The evidence from entries 4 and 19 are sufficient. The checklist requires all distinct values, and since it's the same name, it's only one value. So even if there are more mentions, it's the same value, so no need to add duplicates.\n\nThe system's policy says to extract every distinct value, so duplicates don't count. Therefore, \"Rita F. Lin\" is the only value. Since the key is already filled with one value (and the system shows 1/1), the correct action is to stop.\n\nSo the next action should be to stop with the reason that all checklist items are fully extracted.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items fully extracted.
