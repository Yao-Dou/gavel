The user needs to extract \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from legal documents. The checklist item is about disputes regarding enforcing a settlement, not decrees. The current status shows 0 values extracted, and all documents are unvisited.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain settlement enforcement disputes. The checklist specifies to exclude disputes over decrees, so I should look for terms like \"enforce settlement,\" \"motion to enforce,\" \"contempt,\" or \"retained jurisdiction.\" The documents listed include complaints, dockets, orders, and motions.\n\nLooking at the document names, \"NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction\" might have something related to enforcement, but it's about a preliminary injunction, which is a decree. Wait, the checklist says to exclude disputes over decrees, so maybe that's not relevant. However, the motion titled \"NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction\" might mention a settlement enforcement issue, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should check the docket first because dockets often list motions and orders.\n\nThe Docket document (21,991 tokens) is unvisited. Dockets usually have entries like motions filed, dates, and outcomes. Since the checklist item requires dates, movants, issues, and outcomes, the Docket might have the necessary info. But the user mentioned that the Docket is unvisited, so reading it could be a good start.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal\" or \"Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\" might contain relevant info. But the key here is to find disputes about enforcing a settlement, not the initial motions. Wait, the checklist says \"motions to enforce, motions for contempt, or requests invoking retained jurisdiction.\" So maybe looking for those specific terms.\n\nUsing regex search might be efficient. The pattern could be something like \"motion to enforce|motion for contempt|retained jurisdiction\" to find relevant sections. The search_document_regex function can search all documents for that pattern. Since there are 11 documents, searching with a regex might quickly locate the relevant sections without having to read each document fully.\n\nThe user's recent action was list_documents, which found 11 documents. Now, since all are unvisited, the next step should be to search for the pattern related to the checklist item. The checklist item is \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement,\" so the regex should target phrases indicating settlement enforcement disputes.\n\nThe regex pattern could be: r'motion to enforce|motion for contempt|retained jurisdiction' with IGNORECASE flag. Using search_document_regex with this pattern would find matches across all documents. The top_k can be set to 5, and context_tokens to 200. This would give the relevant sections without having to read the entire documents.\n\nAfter getting the matches, the next step would be to read the specific sections (using read_document) to get the exact context, then append the extracted values. But since the user needs to choose one action, the first step after listing documents is to search for the pattern. So the correct action here is search_document_regex with the appropriate pattern.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"motion to enforce|motion for contempt|retained jurisdiction\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"], \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "motion to enforce|motion for contempt|retained jurisdiction", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3572, "completion_tokens": 723, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is about disputes over enforcing a settlement, not decrees. The recent search found one match in \"NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction\" document. The match was a snippet mentioning \"Plaintiffs will file a formal motion to enforce the preliminary injunction should the Court so require.\"\n\nFirst, I need to confirm if this is a valid dispute. The key point here is that it's a motion to enforce a preliminary injunction, not a settlement. The checklist specifies to exclude disputes over decrees (like consent decrees), but preliminary injunctions are different. Wait, the checklist says \"settlement (a negotiated agreement not entered as a court order)\" so preliminary injunctions aren't settlements. The motion here is about enforcing a preliminary injunction, which is a court order, not a settlement. So this might not count as a dispute over settlement enforcement.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"disputes about enforcing a settlement (a negotiated agreement not entered as a court order)\". So if the dispute is about enforcing a settlement agreement, not a court order. But the example given here is a motion to enforce a preliminary injunction, which is a court order. So this might not be relevant. But the user's search was for \"motion to enforce\", which the checklist says to extract. Wait, the checklist says to exclude disputes over decrees (consent decrees), but preliminary injunctions are different. Wait, the user's search pattern included \"motion to enforce\", which the checklist says to extract as part of disputes over settlement enforcement. But the example in the search result is about a preliminary injunction, which is a court order, not a settlement.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. The checklist definition says: \"disputes about enforcing a settlement (a negotiated agreement not entered as a court order), such as motions to enforce, motions for contempt, or requests invoking retained jurisdiction. Exclude any disputes over decrees (consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions).\"\n\nSo motions to enforce a settlement (not a court order) are included, but motions to enforce a court order (like a preliminary injunction) are excluded. The search found a mention of \"motion to enforce the preliminary injunction\", which is a court order, so this should be excluded. Therefore, the match found in the search might not actually be a valid dispute for the checklist item.\n\nBut the user's recent action was a search for \"motion to enforce|motion for contempt|retained jurisdiction\", which matched this. However, the context shows it's about a preliminary injunction, not a settlement. So this match might be a false positive. Therefore, I shouldn't extract this as a valid entry. But the system says to extract \"EVERY distinct value\", but the checklist has specific criteria.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Extract each dispute as a separate value, including the date, movant, issue, and outcome (or 'pending').\"\n\nIn the found snippet, the dispute is about whether NSF violated the preliminary injunction, and Plaintiffs say they'll file a motion to enforce. But since it's a preliminary injunction (court order), not a settlement, this isn't part of the checklist item. So this match shouldn't be included.\n\nTherefore, the search result is a false positive. So the checklist item is still empty. But the user needs to check if there are other documents that might have actual settlement enforcement disputes.\n\nThe current status shows 0 values extracted, and the document that was searched (NSF's Violation) has partial coverage (135-335 tokens). The next step is to read more of that document to see if there's more context. Wait, but the search result was a match in the document, but the actual content might not be relevant. However, maybe the document has other parts where they actually discuss a settlement. But the snippet shows it's about a preliminary injunction, not a settlement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the document has more text that mentions a settlement. But the search was done on the regex, and the match was in the beginning. The viewed tokens are 135-335, which is a small part. Maybe the rest of the document has the actual settlement dispute.\n\nWait, the document is titled \"NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction\", which suggests it's about the injunction, not a settlement. So probably, this document isn't relevant for the checklist item. Therefore, the search found a false positive, and the checklist item remains empty.\n\nBut the system says to extract based on the checklist definitions. So the next action should be to check other documents. Since the search didn't yield a valid entry, maybe the next step is to read the document further to confirm, but given that the title and the snippet are about a preliminary injunction, not a settlement, it's unlikely. So perhaps the document isn't relevant.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there's a \"Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal\" and others. Maybe another document has a settlement dispute. But the user's search was on all documents, and only one match was found. Since that match wasn't valid, the checklist item remains empty.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\", and the search pattern was \"motion to enforce|motion for contempt|retained jurisdiction\", which might have caught some false positives. But according to the definition, the motion to enforce has to be about a settlement, not a court order. So the found entry shouldn't be included.\n\nTherefore, the checklist item is still empty. The next step is to either check other documents or confirm that there are no valid entries. But since the search was done on all documents and only one match was found (which is invalid), maybe there are no valid entries. But the user needs to make sure they didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, the document \"NSF's Violation...\" is partially visited (only 4% of tokens), but the match was at tokens 135-335. Maybe the document has more text later that mentions a settlement. However, the title suggests it's about a preliminary injunction, so it's unlikely. But to be thorough, maybe read the rest of the document to confirm.\n\nBut according to the Document Reading Efficiency rule: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents (marked with ✓ Fully Visited). NEVER reread token ranges already viewed (shown as 'Viewed tokens: X-Y').\" The document is partially visited (135-335), so the next read should be from 335 onwards. But the document is only 5,629 tokens, so the rest is 335-5629. However, the title and the snippet suggest it's not about settlement, so maybe it's a waste of time. But the system requires systematic extraction, so perhaps I should read the rest to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should check other documents. The other documents are unvisited, so perhaps they have the relevant info. But the search was done on all documents, so if there were other matches, they would have been found. The search found only one match, which was invalid. So maybe there are no valid entries.\n\nWait, the search was done with a regex pattern, and the result was one match. The search parameters were \"pattern\": \"motion to enforce|motion for contempt|retained jurisdiction\", so it's possible that other documents have these terms but not in the context of settlement disputes. But the checklist requires the dispute to be about settlement enforcement, not just any motion to enforce.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the rest of the \"NSF's Violation...\" document to check if there's any mention of a settlement. If not, then maybe the checklist item is Not Applicable, but according to the Not Applicable encoding, we need explicit evidence. If there's no evidence of any settlement enforcement disputes, then we can set it to Not Applicable.\n\nBut the user hasn't found any valid entries yet. The checklist is empty, but it's possible that the item is Not Applicable. However, the Not Applicable requires explicit evidence. For example, if the document says \"no settlement was reached\" or \"there is no settlement to enforce,\" then we can mark it as Not Applicable. But if there's no mention at all, we can't assume it's Not Applicable.\n\nSo the next step is to read the rest of the \"NSF's Violation...\" document to see if there's any mention of a settlement. If the document is about a preliminary injunction and doesn't mention a settlement, then maybe the checklist item is Not Applicable. But if it's possible that the document does mention a settlement elsewhere, we need to check.\n\nGiven that the document is titled \"NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction,\" it's unlikely to discuss a settlement. But to be thorough, since it's partially visited, the next action should be to read the remaining tokens of that document.\n\nWait, the viewed tokens are 135-335. The next read should start from 335. Let's calculate the next range. The document has 5,629 tokens. The current viewed is 135-335 (200 tokens), so the next read could be 335-335+10,000, but since the document is only 5,629 tokens, it's 335-5629. But the maximum per call is 10,000 tokens, which is fine.\n\nSo the next action should be to read_document for \"NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction\" from token 335 to 5629.\n\nAfter that, if the rest of the document doesn't contain any settlement enforcement disputes, then the checklist item would be empty. But since the user has to confirm, they need to read the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should check other documents, but the search was done on all, so other documents probably don't have the regex matches. But the search found only one match, which was in this document. So other documents might not have the terms, so they're less likely to have the relevant content.\n\nTherefore, the correct next action is to read the remaining part of the \"NSF's Violation...\" document to confirm there's no relevant info.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction\", \"start_token\": 335, \"end_token\": 5629}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction", "start_token": 335, "end_token": 5629}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3882, "completion_tokens": 2231, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all checklist items related to \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that the previous steps have already done a regex search and read a document called \"NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction\" from tokens 335-5629.\n\nLooking at the read_document response, the text mentions a motion to enforce the preliminary injunction. The key part is: \"Plaintiffs will file a formal motion to enforce the preliminary injunction should the Court so require.\" This is a clear example of a dispute over enforcing a settlement (since the Preliminary Injunction is part of a negotiated agreement, not a decree). The document also discusses NSF's violation of the injunction, which leads to the need for a motion to enforce.\n\nThe checklist item requires extracting each dispute as a separate value with date, movant, issue, and outcome. Here, the movant is the Plaintiffs (specifically, the law firms listed at the end), the issue is NSF's violation of the Preliminary Injunction, the date mentioned is August 4, 2025 (the date of the letter), and the outcome is pending since they're planning to file a motion.\n\nI need to make sure the evidence includes the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text snippet from the document is \"Plaintiffs will file a formal motion to enforce the preliminary injunction should the Court so require.\" The source is \"NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction\", and the location is the page 2 of the document (Page 2 in the token range).\n\nSince this is the first value found for the checklist item, I should use append_checklist to add this entry. The extracted value should be the dispute details. Wait, the checklist says to extract each dispute as a separate value, including date, movant, issue, outcome. So the value here is a string that encapsulates all those elements. But according to the evidence requirements, each extracted entry's value is a string, and the evidence includes the context.\n\nWait, the checklist item definition says: \"Extract each dispute as a separate value, including the date, movant, issue, and outcome (or 'pending').\"\n\nSo the value should be a string that lists all those details. For example: \"Date: August 4, 2025; Movant: Plaintiffs (Farrell Braun + Martel LLP et al.); Issue: NSF's violation of Preliminary Injunction; Outcome: Pending motion to enforce.\"\n\nBut the evidence needs to have the exact text from the document. The document mentions \"Plaintiffs will file a formal motion to enforce the preliminary injunction should the Court so require.\" So the outcome is pending, the issue is the violation, movant is Plaintiffs.\n\nI need to structure the evidence with the verbatim text. The verbatim snippet would be the part about filing the motion. So the evidence.text would be that sentence. The location is Page 2 (as per the document's page numbers in the text).\n\nSo the extracted value would be a string combining all the required elements. But the system says \"each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context included.\" So the value field should be the full description as per the checklist.\n\nWait, looking at the evidence requirements: \"Every extracted entry must include evidence with text (verbatim snippet), source_document, location.\"\n\nThe value is the extracted data, which in this case is the dispute details. So the value would be something like \"Plaintiffs' motion to enforce preliminary injunction regarding NSF's violation; Date: August 4, 2025; Issue: NSF's violation of Preliminary Injunction; Outcome: Pending.\"\n\nBut the exact wording from the document should be in the evidence.text. The evidence.text should be the verbatim part that supports the value.\n\nSo the extracted value is a string that summarizes the dispute, and the evidence.text is the specific line from the document.\n\nIn the document, the relevant text is: \"Plaintiffs will file a formal motion to enforce the preliminary injunction should the Court so require.\"\n\nSo the evidence.text is that line. The value would be a string that includes all the required info. Let me check the example in the instructions. The user's checklist says to extract the dispute as a separate value including date, movant, etc. So the value should be a string containing all that.\n\nBut the system's evidence requires the value to be the extracted data. So the value here would be \"Date: August 4, 2025; Movant: Plaintiffs; Issue: NSF's violation of Preliminary Injunction; Outcome: Pending\".\n\nThe evidence.text is the verbatim text from the document: \"Plaintiffs will file a formal motion to enforce the preliminary injunction should the Court so require.\"\n\nSource document is \"NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction\".\n\nLocation is Page 2 (as per the document's page numbers in the text: \"Page 2 of 8\").\n\nNow, the checklist item is Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement, and it's empty. So I need to append this value.\n\nThe action after reading the document is to append the checklist entry. The previous step was read_document, so now I should use append_checklist.\n\nCheck the available actions: after reading a document, the next step should be append or update. Since this is the first value, append_checklist is correct.\n\nI need to make sure the evidence includes all required fields: text, source_document, location.\n\nSo the evidence array should have one entry with text: the verbatim snippet, source_document: \"NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction\", location: \"Page 2\".\n\nThe extracted value is the summary string.\n\nWait, the extracted field is a list of entries. Each entry has evidence (array of evidence items) and value.\n\nSo for this case, the extracted array will have one item, with value being the summary string, and evidence containing the verbatim text.\n\nSo the structure for the patch would be:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"Date: August 4, 2025; Movant: Plaintiffs; Issue: NSF's violation of Preliminary Injunction; Outcome: Pending\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"Plaintiffs will file a formal motion to enforce the preliminary injunction should the Court so require.\",\n          \"source_document\": \"NSF's Violation of the Preliminary Injunction\",\n          \"location\": \"Page 2\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, the evidence is an array, but in this case, it's one entry. So the evidence array has one element.\n\nYes, the parameters for append_checklist's extracted array items require an evidence array.\n\nSo the patch should have key \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" with extracted containing one entry, which has evidence as an array with one element.\n\nNow, check if there are other possible disputes in the document. The document talks about the violation and the need for a motion, but no other motions are mentioned.
