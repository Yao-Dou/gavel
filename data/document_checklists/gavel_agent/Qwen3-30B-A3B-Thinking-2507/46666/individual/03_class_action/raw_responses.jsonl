The checklist item \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" is empty, and there are no documents available.\n\nHmm, the task requires extracting values from documents, but the system shows \"No documents discovered yet.\" So the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The user can't read or search documents if there are none. The correct action here is to call list_documents. That's the only option when the catalog is unknown. The other actions like read_document or search_document_regex need existing documents, which aren't present. So the next step is definitely to use list_documents to get the document catalog.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3141, "completion_tokens": 179, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" checklist item from the legal documents. The current status shows that this key is empty, and there are 11 unvisited documents.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document is most likely to contain the relevant information. The checklist item is about whether the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs. So, documents like the Complaints, Motions for Class Certification, and Orders related to class certification would be good candidates.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" and \"Amended Class Action Complaint\" are probably the most relevant. These are the initial filings where the nature of the action would be stated. The \"Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification\" would also be a strong candidate.\n\nBut since the user mentioned \"extract EVERY distinct value,\" I should check the most likely documents first. The Complaints are the starting point, so maybe the main complaint documents will have the designation. The \"Class Action Complaint\" title itself suggests it's a class action, but I need to confirm from the text.\n\nThe next step is to read a document. Since the Complaints are the most relevant, I should pick one. The \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" is listed first, so I'll start with that. It's 75,105 tokens, but I can read a portion of it. The system says to read up to 10,000 tokens at a time, so I'll start from the beginning.\n\nWait, the document is unvisited, so I need to use read_document. The parameters require start_token and end_token. Since it's unvisited, start_token is 0, and end_token should be 10,000. But the document is 75k tokens, so reading the first 10k tokens makes sense.\n\nI should call read_document on the \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" document with start_token 0 and end_token 10000. That's the first step to get the initial text to check for the class action status.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3545, "completion_tokens": 519, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" checklist item from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that the current status has 0 values extracted for this key, and it's empty.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they already read the first 10,000 tokens of the \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" document. The text they provided from that read includes the complaint's title, which says \"CLASS ACTION\" multiple times. For example, in the header on page 1, it says \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\" and on page 2, it's reiterated. Also, in paragraph 20, it states \"NEETA THAKUR, KEN ALEX, NELL GREEN NYLEN, ROBERT HIRST, CHRISTINE PHILLIOU, and JEDDA FOREMAN, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR...\"\n\nThe checklist item requires the value to be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'. Since the document clearly states \"CLASS ACTION\" in the title and in the plaintiff description, the extracted value should be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\".\n\nNow, I need to check if there's any evidence in the text. The exact phrases are present, so the evidence would be the quoted text from the document. The source document is \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", and the location is the document's title and the plaintiff listing on page 2.\n\nSince the user just read the first 10,000 tokens and found the relevant info, the next step is to append this value to the checklist. The action should be `append_checklist` with the extracted value, including the evidence. The checklist key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". The evidence should include the verbatim text, source document, and location.\n\nWait, the instructions say that `append_checklist` adds new entries. Since this is the first value found, we need to append it. The evidence needs to have the text, source document, and location. The text can be the specific line where \"CLASS ACTION\" appears. For example, the title on page 1: \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\" and the plaintiff description on page 2: \"NEETA THAKUR, KEN ALEX, NELL GREEN NYLEN, ROBERT HIRST, CHRISTINE PHILLIOU, and JEDDA FOREMAN, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR...\".\n\nBut the evidence should be a verbatim snippet. Let's pick one clear instance. The page 2 line: \"NEETA THAKUR, KEN ALEX, NELL GREEN NYLEN, ROBERT HIRST, CHRISTINE PHILLIOU, and JEDDA FOREMAN, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR...\".\n\nSo the evidence text would be that line. The source document is \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", and the location is \"Page 2, Plaintiffs' description\".\n\nNow, the function call should be `append_checklist` with the patch containing the key and the extracted value with evidence. The value should be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". The extracted array will have one entry with that value and the evidence.\n\nDouble-checking the Not Applicable encoding: since the document clearly states it's a class action, we don't need to set Not Applicable here. So the correct action is `append_checklist`.\n\nWait, the user's recent action was a read_document, and now they need to process that to append the checklist. The next action after reading should be to append the found values. So the correct tool call is `append_checklist` with the value.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"NEETA THAKUR, KEN ALEX, NELL GREEN NYLEN, ROBERT HIRST, CHRISTINE PHILLIOU, and JEDDA FOREMAN, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,  CLASS ACTION \\nCOMPLAINT FOR\", \"source_document\": \"Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 2, Plaintiffs' description\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Class Action", "evidence": [{"text": "NEETA THAKUR, KEN ALEX, NELL GREEN NYLEN, ROBERT HIRST, CHRISTINE PHILLIOU, and JEDDA FOREMAN, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,  CLASS ACTION \nCOMPLAINT FOR", "source_document": "Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 2, Plaintiffs' description"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14746, "completion_tokens": 1008, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which needs to be formatted as either 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted one value from the Class Action Complaint. The evidence shows \"CLASS ACTION\" in the complaint's title on page 2. So they have \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" as the value. The checklist summary shows that one key is filled with one value, and there are no empty or Not Applicable keys. But wait, the user mentioned there are 11 documents, and only one has been partially read.\n\nWait, the task says to extract EVERY distinct value. The current extraction only has one value. But maybe there are more documents that might have different information. However, the checklist item is about whether it's a class action or individual plaintiffs. The complaint they read clearly states it's a class action. But maybe other documents, like the Amended Complaint or motions, might confirm this or provide additional details.\n\nBut the user's recent action was to append the checklist with the value from the first document. The current status shows 1 key filled, 0 empty, 0 Not Applicable. The next step is to check if there are more documents that might have the same or different values. However, the checklist definition says to extract every distinct value. Since the first document already states it's a class action, maybe all other documents will confirm this, so no new values. But the system requires checking all documents to ensure all values are extracted.\n\nWait, the user has 11 documents. The first one (Class Action Complaint) is partially read (13% covered). They read up to token 10,000, but the document has 75k tokens. The evidence they found was on page 2, which is early in the document, so maybe the rest of the document doesn't have more info on the class action status. But they should check if other documents have the same or different info.\n\nHowever, the checklist item is about the status of the plaintiffs. The complaint itself is the primary document stating it's a class action. Other documents like motions or orders might reference it, but they probably don't change the status. For example, the Motion for Class Certification would likely confirm it's a class action, but since the complaint already states it, appending the same value again isn't necessary. The requirement is to extract every distinct value, so if all documents say it's a class action, there's only one value.\n\nWait, but the user's previous action was to append the value from the complaint. The checklist now shows one value. To confirm if there are more, maybe they should check other documents. But the problem is that the other documents are unvisited. However, the system says not to reread visited documents, but this is the first read. The complaint was partially read, but the key info was found early on. The next step might be to check if other documents have the same info, but since the checklist item is about the status, which is established in the complaint, maybe no other documents are needed.\n\nWait, the user's goal is to extract all applicable checklist items. The checklist has only one item: Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs. The current status shows it's filled with one value. The next step is to see if there's any other value. But since the complaint says \"CLASS ACTION\" and it's a class action complaint, it's unlikely there's an individual plaintiffs entry. So the value is already extracted.\n\nBut the system says to stop when all keys are filled or Not Applicable. Here, the key is filled, so they should stop. Wait, but the user has other documents unvisited. However, the checklist item is about the status, which is defined by the complaint. Other documents might not add new values. For example, the Amended Complaint might still say it's a class action, so appending the same value again isn't needed. The requirement is to extract every distinct value, so if it's the same, it's not a new distinct value.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"EVERY distinct value\". So if all documents have \"Class Action\", then only one value is needed. Since the first document already provided it, and the others are likely the same, there's no need to read more. But the system might require verifying that no other values exist. However, the user's current status shows that the key is filled, and there are no empty keys. So maybe it's time to stop.\n\nBut the system's stop criteria say: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either Complete or Not Applicable.\" Here, the key is complete (has the value), so they should stop. The previous step was to append the checklist, which was successful. Now, since all keys (only one) are filled, the next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning all keys are filled. So the correct action is to stop. The user shouldn't read more documents because there's no need. The evidence is already there from the first document. The other documents might not have different information, and the system's efficiency rule says not to reread documents, but in this case, they haven't read others, but since the key is already filled, there's no need to read more.\n\nWait, but the user's recent action was append_checklist, which added the value.
