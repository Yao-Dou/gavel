The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet. So, the next move is definitely to call list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3104, "completion_tokens": 204, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and currently, it's empty with 0 values extracted.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain case numbers. The documents listed include Complaint, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Orders, and various motions. Case numbers are often found in the Docket, which usually lists related cases. The Docket document [Docket] is 5,146 tokens and unvisited, so that's a prime candidate.\n\nLooking at the document catalog, the Docket is a standard place where related cases would be mentioned, like \"Related to Case No. XYZ\". So, reading the Docket document makes sense here. The user should start with the Docket because it's the most probable source for case numbers.\n\nThe other documents might have case numbers too, but the Docket is the most direct. The Complaint might reference other cases, but the Docket is more likely to have a list. So, the next step is to read the Docket document. Since it's unvisited, start from token 0 to the end. The maximum token range per read is 10,000, and the Docket is 5,146 tokens, so reading the whole thing is safe.\n\nI should use read_document for the Docket. The parameters would be doc_name \"Docket\", start_token 0, end_token 5146. That way, we get the entire document to check for case codes.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 5146}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 5146}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3393, "completion_tokens": 381, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number from the legal documents. So far, they've done Step 1 (list_documents) and Step 2 (read_document on Docket from tokens 0-5146). The Docket document was fully read, and in that read, there's an entry at number 2: \"NOTICE OF RELATED CASE by All Plaintiffs. Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999.\"\n\nSo the case code here is 25-cv-00999. That's a distinct value. The task is to extract every distinct value, so I need to make sure there aren't others. But the Docket was fully visited, and the other documents are unvisited. Wait, but the Docket already has the case number mentioned. The checklist item is to extract related cases listed by their case numbers. The Docket entry says \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999.\" So that's the value.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other instances in other documents. But the current status shows that the Docket is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), and the other documents are unvisited. However, the Docket already provided the case number. The next step is to confirm that this is the only one. But according to the recent actions, the Docket was read, and the entry was found. So the extracted value should be 25-cv-00999 with evidence from the Docket document.\n\nThe checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and the value is \"25-cv-00999\". The evidence should include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text is \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999.\" The source document is Docket, and the location is the entry at number 2 in the Docket.\n\nSince the Docket was fully read, and this value was found, I should use append_checklist to add this entry. The checklist key is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and the extracted value is [\"25-cv-00999\"] with the evidence as specified.\n\nWait, the problem says \"extract EVERY distinct value\". So if there's only one, then that's it. The current status shows 0 values extracted, so this is the first one. The next action after reading the Docket would be to append this value. The recent action was reading the Docket, so the next step is to append the checklist entry.\n\nThe tool to use here is append_checklist because it's adding a new entry. The evidence needs to be properly formatted with text, source_document, and location. The location can be the Docket entry number (2) as per the document's structure.\n\nSo the parameters for append_checklist would be a patch with key \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" and extracted array containing one entry with evidence. The value is \"25-cv-00999\".\n\nLet me make sure there are no other case numbers in the Docket. Scanning through the Docket entries again: entry 2 says 25-cv-00999. The other entries mention case numbers like 25-cv-1266 in the Memorandum Opinion (entry 27), but that's in a different document. Since the Docket is fully read, and only entry 2 has the related case, that's the only one from the Docket. The other documents haven't been read yet, but the checklist might require checking all documents. Wait, but the Docket entry specifically says \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999\", so that's the value to extract. The other case numbers (like 25-cv-1266) might be in other documents, but the task is to extract from all documents. However, since the Docket has one, and the other documents are unvisited, but the current action is to process the Docket first. Wait, the user's recent actions have already read the Docket, and found the case number. So the next step is to append that value. The other documents might have more, but the next step after reading Docket is to append the found value.\n\nSo the correct action now is to use append_checklist with the found value. The evidence should be the text snippet from the Docket, source document \"Docket\", and location \"Entry 2\" (or maybe \"Docket entry 2\" as per the numbering in the document).\n\nWait, in the Docket read, the entries are numbered 1-31. Entry 2 is the one with \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999\". So location can be \"Docket entry 2\" or \"Line 2\" or something. The problem says \"location: e.g., page, section, docket entry\". Since it's a docket, the entry number is appropriate.\n\nSo the evidence location would be \"Docket entry 2\".\n\nTherefore, the append_checklist should have:\n\nkey: \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\"\n\nextracted: [\n  {\n    value: \"25-cv-00999\",\n    evidence: [\n      {\n        text: \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999.\",\n        source_document: \"Docket\",\n        location: \"Docket entry 2\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nWait, the evidence is an array of evidence objects. Each evidence object has text, source_document, location. So for this value, the evidence array has one entry with those fields.\n\nSo the patch should have key and extracted array. The extracted array has one element with value \"25-cv-00999\" and evidence containing the single evidence object.\n\nTherefore, the correct function call is append_checklist with that patch.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"25-cv-00999\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999.\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"Docket entry 2\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number", "extracted": [{"value": "25-cv-00999", "evidence": [{"text": "Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999.", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Docket entry 2"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8680, "completion_tokens": 1406, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is working on extracting related cases from legal documents, specifically looking for case code numbers. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". So far, they've already found one entry from the Docket document: \"25-cv-00999\" from entry 2.\n\nNow, the current status shows that Docket is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), and the other documents are unvisited. The task is to extract every distinct value, so I need to check if there are more related cases in the other documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents: Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, Order, Defendants' Motion to Stay, Memorandum in Opposition, Plaintiffs' Motion, and Plaintiffs’ Memorandum. Since the Docket is already fully read, the next step is to check other documents that might have related case numbers.\n\nThe checklist requires all distinct values, so I should look for any mention of case numbers in the other documents. The most likely places would be in the Complaint, Amended Complaint, or any motions that reference related cases.\n\nThe user mentioned that the Docket has already been processed, so moving to another document. The next logical step is to read a document that's unvisited. The Complaint (16,399 tokens) and the Plaintiffs' Motion (1,170 tokens) are smaller, but the Memorandum Opinion is large (15k tokens). However, since the Docket already found one case, maybe the Complaint or Amended Complaint might have more references.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 2 says \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999.\" But the current case is 25-cv-00999? Wait, the current case might be 25-cv-00999, and they're looking for related cases. Wait, the checklist is about related cases listed by their case codes. So \"25-cv-00999\" is the related case mentioned in the Docket. But the current case might be a different number. Wait, the complaint in the Docket entry 1 says \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\" (from the related case entry). Wait, no: entry 2 says \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999.\" So the current case (the one being processed) is related to 25-cv-00999, meaning 25-cv-00999 is the related case. But the current case might have a different number. Wait, the Docket entry 1 says \"COMPLAINT against All Defendants... ( Filing fee $405 receipt number ADCDC-11640852) filed by... Case No. 25-cv-00999.\" Wait, no, looking at entry 1: \"COMPLAINT against All Defendants ( Filing fee $405 receipt number ADCDC-11640852) filed by NATIONAL ACADEMY OF EDUCATION... (Attachments: # 4 Exhibit Related Case Form - Civil, ...)\". So the case number for the current case is probably 25-cv-00999, but the related case mentioned in entry 2 is the same? Wait, entry 2 says \"Notice of Related Case by All Plaintiffs. Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999.\" So maybe the current case is related to another case with that number. Wait, but the current case might be 25-cv-00999, and they're saying it's related to itself? That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a typo, but regardless, the value extracted is \"25-cv-00999\".\n\nBut the task is to find all related cases, so maybe there are other case numbers in other documents. The next step is to check other documents for case numbers. The most likely places to find related cases would be in the Complaint (entry 1 mentions \"Exhibit Related Case Form - Civil\"), so maybe the Complaint document has the related case numbers listed. Similarly, the Amended Complaint might reference other cases.\n\nSince the Docket is fully visited, the next document to read should be the Complaint (Complaint) which has 16,399 tokens. The user should read a portion of it to look for case numbers. But the document is large, so maybe start with the beginning. However, the user can't read the entire document at once if it's over 10k tokens, but 16k is more than 10k. So they need to read a window of up to 10k tokens. Since it's unvisited, they can read tokens 0-10000 first.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows \"Complaint\" as unvisited, so the next action should be to read_document on Complaint, starting at 0, ending at 10000. But the user needs to check if there's a specific pattern to search. However, the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", which likely follows the pattern like \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\" or similar. So maybe a regex search would be efficient. But the current step is to read a document. Since the user hasn't done any regex search yet, and the Docket was read directly, perhaps reading the Complaint is the next step.\n\nAlternatively, using search_document_regex with a pattern like \"Case No. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\", but the user's instructions say to use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable. The pattern here is clear: \"Case No. \" followed by a case number. So maybe using search_document_regex on all documents to find all instances of case numbers. But the user's current state is that they have one value from Docket, and need to check others.\n\nWait, the available documents include \"Complaint\" and others. The Docket was already fully read, so the next step is to check other documents. The user could use search_document_regex to look for \"Case No.\" in all unvisited documents. But the instructions say to use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable, which it is. So maybe a regex search would be better than reading the entire document.\n\nBut the user's previous steps used read_document on Docket, so maybe they should continue with reading. However, the decision policy says: \"If a specific document likely contains a target value, choose ONE: read_document or search_document_regex.\" Since the target is a case number, which is a pattern, search_document_regex might be more efficient.\n\nBut looking at the available documents, the Complaint (which is a document) might have the related case numbers. The Docket entry 1 mentions \"Exhibit Related Case Form - Civil\" as an attachment, so the Complaint document might contain the related case information.\n\nSo the next action should be to use search_document_regex on the Complaint document (since it's likely to contain the related cases) with a pattern like \"Case No. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\".\n\nWait, but the user has multiple unvisited documents. The search_document_regex can target specific documents. Since the Complaint is the most likely, they should search it first. The pattern \"Case No. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\" would match \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\", which is the value they already have, but maybe there are others.\n\nAlternatively, the user could search all unvisited documents. But the instructions say to use search_document_regex with doc_name='all' or specific. Let's see. The current checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so the pattern is \"Case No. [case number]\".\n\nSo the correct action would be to use search_document_regex on all unvisited documents (or specifically the Complaint) with pattern \"Case No. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\".\n\nWait, but the user's previous step was to append the value from Docket. Now, they need to check other documents. Since the Docket was already read, and the next likely place is the Complaint, the best action is to search the Complaint document for case numbers.\n\nSo the function call would be search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Complaint\", pattern=\"Case No. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\", and context_tokens=200.\n\nBut the user should make sure to use the correct parameters. The pattern should be precise. The example in the Docket was \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\", so the pattern should match that. So the regex pattern could be \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\". Note the dot after \"No\" needs to be escaped.\n\nWait, the Docket entry says \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\", so the pattern is \"Case No. \" followed by the case number. So the regex pattern should be \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\". The dot in \"No.\" needs to be escaped as \\. in regex.\n\nSo the correct pattern is \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\". The flags could be IGNORECASE, but since case numbers are usually uppercase, maybe not needed.\n\nSo the tool call would be search_document_regex with doc_name=\"Complaint\", pattern=\"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\", top_k=5, context_tokens=200.\n\nAlternatively, since the user might want to check all unvisited documents, but the Complaint is the most likely, so target it.\n\nThe user's available documents include \"Complaint\" (Complaint) as unvisited, so using doc_name=\"Complaint\" in the search.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to call search_document_regex on the Complaint document with that pattern.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"pattern\": \"Case No\\\\.

The user needs to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. So far, they've already found one case: 25-cv-00999 from the Docket entry 2.\n\nLooking at the current status, the Docket document is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so I shouldn't read it again. The other documents are unvisited, but the checklist item is about case codes, so I should check if other documents mention related cases.\n\nThe next step is to check the Complaint document, which is unvisited. The previous search in the Complaint using regex \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\" didn't find anything, but maybe the regex wasn't precise enough. Wait, the search was done on the Complaint document, but maybe the case number is written differently. For example, in the Docket, it was \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\", so maybe the regex should match that pattern.\n\nBut the search returned 0 matches. However, the Complaint might have the case number in a different format. Maybe the document refers to the case as \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\" but the regex didn't capture it. Wait, the search used \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\", which should match \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\" because 25-cv-00999 has letters, numbers, and hyphens. But the search returned 0 matches. Hmm, maybe the regex was case-sensitive or the document didn't have it. But the Docket already has it, so maybe the Complaint doesn't have another case number. Wait, but the task is to extract all distinct values. The Docket already provided one, but maybe other documents have more.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". The Docket entry 2 says \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999.\" So that's one value. Are there others?\n\nLooking at the documents available, the Complaint (first document) might have the case number in the caption or elsewhere. The previous search didn't find it, but maybe the regex was off. Let me check the regex again. The pattern was \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\". The backslash before the period might be necessary because in regex, . is a wildcard. So \"Case No\\.\" would match \"Case No.\" literally. But maybe the document uses \"Case No\" without a period? Or maybe the case number format is different.\n\nWait, in the Docket, it's \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\", so the regex should have \"Case No\\. \" (with a period). The search used \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\", which should match. But it returned 0 matches. Maybe the document uses a different case number format, like \"25-cv-999\" without the leading zero, but the Docket has \"25-cv-00999\". Wait, the Docket says \"25-cv-00999\", so the search should look for that exact string.\n\nBut the search was done on the Complaint document. Maybe the Complaint document doesn't have the related case listed. Let's check the Docket entries again. The Docket entry 2 is the only one mentioning a related case. The other entries don't refer to other case numbers. For example, entry 14 (MOTION for Preliminary Injunction) lists exhibits with URLs but no case numbers. Entry 27 mentions \"Case No. 25-cv-999\" in the title of the Memorandum Opinion. Wait, entry 27: \"MEMORANDUM OPINION DENYING Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Case No. 25-cv-999 and Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Case No. 25-cv-1266.\"\n\nOh! So there's another case number here: 25-cv-1266. So that's a second related case. But why didn't the regex search find it? Because the search was done on the Complaint document, but the Memorandum Opinion is a different document. The current available documents include \"Memorandum Opinion\" [Order/Opinion] which is unvisited. So I need to read that document to find the case number.\n\nWait, the user's current step is after searching the Complaint document (which returned 0 matches). Now, the next step should be to check other documents where related cases might be listed. The Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) is unvisited and has the case number 25-cv-1266 mentioned. So the next action should be to read that document.\n\nBut the task is to use the tools. The current available documents include \"Memorandum Opinion\" [Order/Opinion] - 15,044 tokens - ○ Unvisited. So I should call read_document on that document. Since it's unvisited, I can read the entire document, but to be efficient, maybe read the whole thing (up to 10k tokens, but the document is 15k, so I can read the first 10k tokens first, then maybe more if needed). Wait, the maximum token range per read_document is 10,000 tokens. The document is 15,044 tokens, so I need to read it in chunks. But since it's unvisited, the first read should be from 0 to 10,000.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to read only unvisited tokens. Since it's unvisited, I should read the entire document in one go if possible, but the max is 10k. So start from 0-10000.\n\nWait, the document is 15,044 tokens. So read 0-10000 first. Then, if needed, read 10000-15044 in a later step. But the next action should be to read the Memorandum Opinion document.\n\nSo the next action is to call read_document on \"Memorandum Opinion\" with start_token 0 and end_token 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8845, "completion_tokens": 1425, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. From the recent actions, I see that in Step 3, they already appended one value: \"25-cv-00999\" from Docket entry 2. The current status shows 1 value extracted, and the checklist item is partially filled.\n\nNow, looking at the available documents, the Docket is fully visited (5,146 tokens), so I shouldn't read it again. The Memorandum Opinion is partially visited (tokens 0-10,000 out of 15,044), so there's still unviewed content. The other documents are unvisited. The next step should be to check if there are more related cases in the Memorandum Opinion, since it's partially read and might have more references.\n\nIn the Memorandum Opinion text provided, I see the case numbers mentioned: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00999\" and \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266\". The first one was already extracted, but \"1:25-cv-01266\" might be another related case. Wait, the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so both cases might be related. The Docket entry mentioned \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999\", so the other case here (1:25-cv-01266) is probably related as well.\n\nThe current extracted value is \"25-cv-00999\", but the Memorandum Opinion uses \"1:25-cv-00999\" and \"1:25-cv-01266\". The case code format might be \"25-cv-00999\" without the \"1:\" prefix. Wait, in the Docket, it was written as \"25-cv-00999\", so the correct format is probably without the \"1:\". So \"1:25-cv-01266\" should be extracted as \"25-cv-01266\".\n\nI need to check if the Memorandum Opinion has more mentions. The text shows both case numbers. The user's checklist item is to extract the case code numbers as listed, so \"25-cv-01266\" should be another entry.\n\nSince the Memorandum Opinion is partially read (only up to token 10,000), and the case numbers are in the header (Case 1:25-cv-00999-TNM Document 25 Filed 06/03/25 Page 1 of 27), which is likely within the first 10,000 tokens. Wait, the text provided for the Memorandum Opinion starts with \"Case 1:25-cv-00999-TNM Document 25 Filed 06/03/25 Page 1 of 27\", so the case number \"1:25-cv-00999\" is there. But the Docket already extracted \"25-cv-00999\", so the other one is \"25-cv-01266\" from \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266 (TNM)\".\n\nWait, in the text, it's written as \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266 (TNM)\". So the case code here is \"25-cv-01266\" (ignoring the \"1:\" prefix, which might be the court's internal reference). The Docket used \"25-cv-00999\", so the correct extraction should be \"25-cv-01266\" for the second case.\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion is partially read, but the case numbers mentioned are in the header, which is in the first few pages. Since the text provided includes \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00999\" and \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266\", and the Docket already has \"25-cv-00999\", the new value to extract is \"25-cv-01266\".\n\nThe user's next action should be to read more of the Memorandum Opinion to confirm, but since the case numbers are in the header (which is part of the first 10,000 tokens), and the text provided includes them, I should proceed to append the new value. However, the tool response needs to be the next action. Since the text is already in the snapshot, I can extract it directly.\n\nWait, the current step is after reading the Memorandum Opinion up to 10,000 tokens. The case numbers are present in the text, so I should append the new case code \"25-cv-01266\" as a new value. The existing extracted value is \"25-cv-00999\", and the new one is \"25-cv-01266\".\n\nSo the next action is to append the new value. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and the new value is \"25-cv-01266\" from the Memorandum Opinion, specifically from the case header.\n\nI need to verify the evidence: in the Memorandum Opinion text, it says \"NATIONAL ACADEMY OF EDUCATION, et al., Plaintiffs, Case No. 1:25-cv-01266 (TNM)\".\n\nSo the evidence should include the text snippet, source document (Memorandum Opinion), and location (e.g., page 1 of the document).\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to use `append_checklist` to add the new value \"25-cv-01266\" with the evidence from the Memorandum Opinion.\n\nWait, but the checklist item might have multiple values. The existing value is \"25-cv-00999\", and now adding \"25-cv-01266\". So the append_checklist will add this new entry.\n\nThe user's recent action was a `read_document` on Memorandum Opinion, and now after analyzing that, the next step is to append the new value. So the correct tool call is `append_checklist` with the new extracted value.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"25-cv-01266\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"NATIONAL ACADEMY OF EDUCATION, et al., Plaintiffs, Case No. 1:25-cv-01266 (TNM)\", \"source_document\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"location\": \"Page 1 of 27 (Document 25)\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number", "extracted": [{"value": "25-cv-01266", "evidence": [{"text": "NATIONAL ACADEMY OF EDUCATION, et al., Plaintiffs, Case No. 1:25-cv-01266 (TNM)", "source_document": "Memorandum Opinion", "location": "Page 1 of 27 (Document 25)"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 19314, "completion_tokens": 1552, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 7, "run_id": "df09b544-16a3-466f-81de-ae7b16b3a414", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T10:21:25.080587-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking me to extract related cases from legal documents, specifically looking for case numbers like \"25-cv-00999\". So far, I've already found two entries: one from the Docket (25-cv-00999) and one from the Memorandum Opinion (25-cv-01266). \n\nHmm, the current status shows both values are extracted. But wait, the checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", and I have two values. The system says I need to extract EVERY distinct value. So far, I have two. But I should check if there are more in the remaining documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents: Docket is fully visited (5146 tokens), Memorandum Opinion is partially visited (only 10k of 15k tokens read). The other documents are unvisited: Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Order, Defendants' Motion to Stay, etc.\n\nWait, the Memorandum Opinion was read up to token 10,000, but it's 15k tokens total. Maybe there's more case numbers later in that document. The current read showed \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266\" on page 1, but maybe there are more references later. For example, in the text, they mention \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00999\" and \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266\" early on. But since the document is 15k tokens, I should check the remaining tokens (10k-15k) to make sure there aren't more case numbers.\n\nAlso, the other documents might have case numbers. For instance, the Complaint might list related cases. But the previous step tried a regex search on Complaint with pattern \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\" and found 0 matches. But maybe the pattern wasn't precise enough. Wait, the regex was \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\", but maybe the actual text uses \"Case No.\" with a period, so the regex should be \"Case No\\.\" to match the period. But the search was done with \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\" which should work. However, the search returned 0 matches, so maybe there are no other case numbers in Complaint.\n\nBut the Memorandum Opinion was partially read. Let me check the text again. The user provided up to token 10k, but the document is 15k tokens. The text shows \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00999\" and \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266\" early on. But maybe there's another one later. For example, in the opinion, they might refer to other cases. But the current read stops at page 18, which is still early in the document. So reading the remaining tokens (10k-15k) might reveal more.\n\nThe next step should be to read the remaining tokens of Memorandum Opinion. The document is partially visited, so I should read from token 10000 to 15044 (since it's 15,044 tokens total). That's 5044 tokens, which is under 10k, so it's allowed.\n\nWait, the system says: \"When reading partially visited documents (marked with ◐ Partially Visited), read ONLY unviewed token ranges.\" So yes, read from 10000 to 15044.\n\nBut the user's current status says \"Viewed tokens: 0-10000 (66% coverage)\" for Memorandum Opinion. So the next read should be 10000-15044.\n\nAlso, the checklist has two values already. But maybe there's a third case number. For example, in the Docket, entry 2 says \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999.\" Then in Memorandum Opinion, it's \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266\". Wait, the case numbers are written as \"25-cv-00999\" in Docket and \"1:25-cv-01266\" in the Opinion. But the checklist item says \"Case Code Number\", so probably the \"25-cv-00999\" format is what's expected. The Memorandum Opinion uses \"1:25-cv-01266\", but the related case is 25-cv-01266. So the value should be \"25-cv-01266\" without the \"1:\" part. Wait, in the evidence, the user listed \"25-cv-01266\" as the value, so that's correct.\n\nNow, are there any other case numbers in the document? Let me check the provided text. The Memorandum Opinion text starts with \"Case 1:25-cv-00999-TNM\" and \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266 (TNM)\". So the related case is 25-cv-01266. The \"1:\" might be a court identifier (like District Court number), but the checklist item asks for \"Case Code Number\", which is likely the \"25-cv-00999\" part. So the values are \"25-cv-00999\" and \"25-cv-01266\".\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check the rest of the Memorandum Opinion. The provided text ends at page 18, but the document is 27 pages. So there might be more references. For example, in the legal arguments, they might mention other cases. But the current read only went up to page 18 (which is token 10k), so reading the remaining tokens could uncover more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other documents have more. But the Complaint was searched with regex and found nothing. However, maybe the regex pattern wasn't perfect. For example, the pattern \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\" might miss cases where the format is different. But since the search returned 0 matches, it's probably safe to assume there are no other case numbers there.\n\nWait, the previous search was on \"Complaint\" document with pattern \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\", and it returned 0 matches. But maybe the case numbers are listed in a different format, like \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\" without the period after \"No\", but the pattern includes a period. Wait, the pattern is \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\", so the backslash escapes the period, so it's looking for \"Case No.\" followed by a space and then the case number. The text in Docket has \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\", so that should match. But the search on Complaint found 0. So likely, Complaint doesn't have any.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to read the remaining tokens of Memorandum Opinion to see if there's another case number. So the action should be read_document on Memorandum Opinion from 10000 to 15044.\n\nWait, the document's total tokens are 15,044, so end_token should be 15044. But the maximum per call is 10k tokens, and 15044-10000=5044, which is under 10k, so it's okay.\n\nSo the next action is read_document with doc_name \"Memorandum Opinion\", start_token 10000, end_token 15044.\n\nAfter that, analyze the new text to see if there's another case number. If found, append it. If not, then check if all documents are covered. But since Memorandum Opinion is partially read, this is the next step.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 15044}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 15044}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 19478, "completion_tokens": 1823, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all related cases listed by their case code numbers from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\".\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted two values: \"25-cv-00999\" from the Docket and \"25-cv-01266\" from the Memorandum Opinion. Both documents are marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so they can't be read again.\n\nThe available documents include \"Complaint\", \"First Amended Complaint\", \"Order\", \"Defendants' Motion to Stay Proceedings\", \"Memorandum in Opposition\", \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\", and \"Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law\". All of these are unvisited (○ Unvisited), so there's a chance they might contain more case numbers.\n\nThe next step is to check if any of these unvisited documents have additional related case numbers. The user should probably search through these documents for case codes like \"25-cv-####\". Since the previous search in the Complaint using \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\" returned zero matches, maybe a different pattern is needed, or maybe they should read specific documents.\n\nWait, the \"search_document_regex\" was tried on the Complaint with \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\" and found nothing. But maybe other documents have the case numbers. The Memorandum Opinion already had the case numbers, so maybe the Complaint or other pleadings have more references.\n\nLooking at the documents, \"Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in Support of Their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" is 20,039 tokens. It's a lengthy document, but maybe it contains more case numbers. However, the user should avoid reading the entire document at once. The maximum token range per read is 10,000 tokens. But since they need to check for case numbers, maybe using a regex search on all unvisited documents would be efficient.\n\nWait, the current step is to choose one action. The previous actions have already read Docket and Memorandum Opinion, which are fully visited. The next logical step is to search the remaining unvisited documents for case numbers. The regex pattern could be \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z-]+\" or similar. But the previous regex search on Complaint found nothing. Maybe the case numbers are listed differently, like \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\" but in other documents, it might be written as \"Case No: 25-cv-00999\" or with different punctuation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"First Amended Complaint\" or other pleadings have additional case numbers. But since the regex search on Complaint didn't find anything, perhaps the user should try reading another document. However, the efficient approach would be to use `search_document_regex` on all unvisited documents to look for case codes.\n\nWait, the available tools include `search_document_regex` which can search all documents. The user can set `doc_name='all'` to search all unvisited documents. The pattern should be something like \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z-]+\". The previous search used \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\" which might have been too restrictive. Let's check the example in the Memorandum Opinion: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00999 (TNM)\" and \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266 (TNM)\". So the pattern should account for the \"1:\" prefix. But the existing extracted values are \"25-cv-00999\" and \"25-cv-01266\", so maybe the \"1:\" is part of the case number but the user is only supposed to extract the code part.\n\nWait, the checklist item says \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", so the value should be the code like \"25-cv-00999\", not the full \"1:25-cv-00999\". So the regex should capture the part after \"Case No. \".\n\nLooking at the Memorandum Opinion, the case numbers are listed as \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00999 (TNM)\" and \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266 (TNM)\". The code part is \"25-cv-00999\" and \"25-cv-01266\". So the regex should capture \"25-cv-00999\" from \"1:25-cv-00999\".\n\nSo the pattern could be something like \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z:]+-([0-9a-zA-Z-]+)\" but maybe simpler: \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z:]+-([0-9a-zA-Z-]+)\" to capture the code part. Alternatively, the existing pattern used in step 4 was \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\", which didn't find anything in Complaint, but maybe the issue was the \"1:\" part. The regex should allow for digits and colons.\n\nWait, the previous search used \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\", which would match \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00999\" but the [a-zA-Z0-9-] doesn't include the colon. So the pattern needs to include colon. The correct pattern should be \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z:-]+\", but maybe better to use \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z:]+-([0-9a-zA-Z-]+)\" to capture the code.\n\nBut the user might not need to capture the whole thing; they just need to find the case code. So maybe a pattern like \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z:]+-([0-9a-zA-Z-]+)\" to extract the code. However, the previous regex search was too broad and didn't find anything. Maybe the case numbers are written differently in other documents.\n\nAlternatively, since the two existing case codes are \"25-cv-00999\" and \"25-cv-01266\", the user can search for \"25-cv-[0-9]{4}\" to find similar patterns. But the user should use a regex that matches the common case number format.\n\nWait, the task is to extract every distinct value. The current extracted values are 25-cv-00999 and 25-cv-01266. The next step is to check if there are more in the unvisited documents.\n\nThe user should use `search_document_regex` on all unvisited documents with a pattern that matches the case code format. Let's try a pattern like \"25-cv-[0-9]{4}\" but that's too specific. Better to use a more general pattern like \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z:]+-([0-9a-zA-Z-]+)\".\n\nBut the previous search on Complaint with \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\" didn't find anything. Maybe the case numbers are written as \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\" without the \"1:\". So the pattern should include the hyphen and digits.\n\nWait, in the Memorandum Opinion, the case numbers are written as \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00999 (TNM)\" and \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266 (TNM)\", but the extracted values are \"25-cv-00999\" and \"25-cv-01266\", so the \"1:\" is part of the case number but the code is the part after the colon. So the regex should capture \"25-cv-00999\" from \"1:25-cv-00999\".\n\nSo the pattern could be \"Case No\\. [0-9:]+-([0-9a-zA-Z-]+)\".\n\nBut maybe it's simpler to just search for \"25-cv-[0-9]{4}\" as the existing cases follow that pattern. However, the user should use a regex that's flexible.\n\nAlternatively, the user can search for \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z:]+-[0-9a-zA-Z-]+\" to find all instances of Case No. followed by a code.\n\nGiven that the previous regex search on Complaint didn't find anything, but maybe other documents have it. So the next action should be to use `search_document_regex` on all unvisited documents with a more permissive pattern.\n\nThe available documents to search are the 7 unvisited ones. The tool allows searching all documents with `doc_name='all'`. So the action would be to call `search_document_regex` with pattern \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z:]+-[0-9a-zA-Z-]+\" and context tokens.\n\nWait, but the user needs to extract the case code number, so the regex should capture the part after \"Case No. \" and before the next space or parentheses. But maybe the search will return the matches, and then the user can extract the code from the context.\n\nThe previous search used \"Case No\\. [a-zA-Z0-9-]+\" which might have missed the colon. So the new pattern should include colon.\n\nSo the correct pattern is \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z:]+-[0-9a-zA-Z-]+\", but let's check: \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00999\" — the pattern would match \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00999\" but the code is \"25-cv-00999\". So the regex should capture the part after the colon and hyphen.\n\nBut the user doesn't need to capture the entire string; they just need to find the case code. So maybe the regex can be \"Case No\\. [0-9:]+-([0-9a-zA-Z-]+)\" to extract the code.\n\nBut for the search, the pattern is just to find where the case number appears. So using \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z:]+-[0-9a-zA-Z-]+\" as the pattern might work.\n\nAlternatively, the user can use \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z-]+\" but that's what they tried before. The problem was that \"1:\" wasn't included in the [a-zA-Z0-9-] class, so the colon was causing a mismatch.\n\nSo the correct pattern should include colon. So \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z:]+-[0-9a-zA-Z-]+\".\n\nYes, this should match \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00999\" and similar.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to call `search_document_regex` with `doc_name='all'` and the pattern \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z:]+-[0-9a-zA-Z-]+\".\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"Case No\\\\.

{"step": 9, "run_id": "df09b544-16a3-466f-81de-ae7b16b3a414", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T10:22:28.789378-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to extract all checklist items from the provided documents, specifically the \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" item. From the snapshot, I can see that they've already extracted two values: \"25-cv-00999\" and \"25-cv-01266\". But wait, the current status says they have 2 total values extracted, and the checklist item is supposed to list all distinct values.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 8 was a regex search on all documents for \"Case No. [0-9a-zA-Z:]+-[0-9a-zA-Z-]+\", which found 7 matches across Docket, Memorandum Opinion, and Order. The Docket had 3 matches, Memorandum Opinion 3, and Order 1. But the extracted values so far are only two: 25-cv-00999 and 25-cv-01266.\n\nWait, in the Docket matches, there's a mention of \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999\" in Match 2 (tokens 4495-4695). But the extracted values from the previous steps were \"25-cv-00999\" and \"25-cv-01266\". However, the regex search in Step 8 found more matches. For example, in the Order document, there's a case number \"1:25-cv-01266-TNM\" in Match 1 (tokens 0-184). But the extracted value for that is \"25-cv-01266\" as per Step 6.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item says \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", which should be the case codes like \"25-cv-00999\" and \"25-cv-01266\". The regex search found matches that include \"Case No. 1:25-cv-00999 (TNM)\" and \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266 (TNM)\" in the Memorandum Opinion. But the extracted values are just the numbers without the \"1:\" prefix. So \"25-cv-00999\" and \"25-cv-01266\" are the correct values.\n\nNow, the current status shows 2 values extracted, but the regex search found 7 matches. However, many of those matches are just the same case numbers repeated. For example, the Docket's Match 1 says \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999\", which is the same as the existing value. The Memorandum Opinion's Match 1 and 2 have both case numbers, and the Order's Match 1 has \"Case No. 1:25-cv-1266 (TNM)\", which would be \"25-cv-1266\".\n\nWait, but in Step 6, they already extracted \"25-cv-01266\" from the Memorandum Opinion. The regex search in Step 8 found additional instances of the same case numbers. So the existing extracted values are already correct, and the regex matches are just confirming the same values.\n\nThe user's next action should be to check if there are any other distinct case numbers. But looking at the matches, all the regex matches are either \"25-cv-00999\" or \"25-cv-01266\". For example, the Docket's Match 2 mentions \"Case No. 25-cv-999\" (which is the same as 25-cv-00999) and \"Case No. 25-cv-1266\". The Memorandum Opinion has both, and the Order has \"1:25-cv-1266\" which is the same as \"25-cv-1266\".\n\nWait, the case number in the documents is \"1:25-cv-00999-TNM\", but the extracted value is \"25-cv-00999\" (without the \"1:\" and \"-TNM\"). The checklist item says \"Case Code Number\", so they probably want the core part like \"25-cv-00999\". So the two values are already extracted.\n\nBut the current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 2\", which matches the two distinct case numbers. The regex search found more instances, but they're the same values. So there are no new distinct values to extract.\n\nThe documents that are unvisited (like Complaint, First Amended Complaint, etc.) might have more case numbers, but the regex search was done across all documents and only found the two case numbers. The regex pattern was \"Case No\\. [0-9a-zA-Z:]+-[0-9a-zA-Z-]+\", which should capture all case numbers. Since the search found 7 matches but they're all the same two case numbers (just different instances), there's no new value to add.\n\nThe user's task is to extract every distinct value. Since they already have both \"25-cv-00999\" and \"25-cv-01266\", and no new distinct values were found in the regex search, they should check if they need to update the checklist to confirm these values.\n\nWait, the checklist item's extracted values are already present. The current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning the key is filled. The next step should be to stop because all applicable items are extracted.\n\nBut let me double-check the documents. The Order document (partially visited, 18% covered) has a case number \"1:25-cv-1266-TNM\" in the header, but that's the same as \"25-cv-1266\". The regex search already found that, so it's already accounted for.\n\nThe other unvisited documents (Complaint, etc.) might have case numbers, but the regex search across all documents didn't find any new case numbers. The regex search in Step 8 found 7 matches, all of which are the two case numbers. For example, the Docket's Match 1 mentions \"Case related to Case No. 25-cv-00999\", which is the same as the existing value. So there are no new distinct values.\n\nTherefore, the checklist item is already complete with two values, and there's nothing more to extract. The next action should be to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct case codes (25-cv-00999 and 25-cv-01266) have been extracted from multiple documents with supporting evidence.

The user is asking to extract all checklist items related to \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that there are already two values extracted: \"25-cv-01266\" and \"25-cv-00999\". \n\nLooking at the recent actions, step 8 did a regex search across all documents and found matches. The Docket had three matches, Memorandum Opinion had three, and Order had one. But the key point is that the two case numbers are already confirmed. The Docket mentioned \"Case No. 25-cv-00999\" and the Memorandum Opinion had \"Case No. 1:25-cv-01266\" and \"Case No. 25-cv-00999-TNM\" (which is the same as 25-cv-00999). \n\nThe checklist status shows that the key is filled with two values. The user's step 9 was a stop, but the system automatically ran get_checklist, showing that the key is 1/1 filled with 2 values. The available documents include some unvisited ones like Complaint, First Amended Complaint, etc., but the regex search already covered all documents and found only those two case numbers. \n\nThe decision policy says to stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Since the key is already fully populated with two distinct values, and the regex search across all documents didn't find any new case codes, there's no need for further actions. The system even says \"No new distinct values were found in the regex search across all documents.\" \n\nAlso, checking the document coverage: Docket and Memorandum Opinion are fully visited, Order is partially visited but the regex search already checked it. The other documents are unvisited, but the regex pattern was applied to all, so no need to read them again. The regex search found all possible matches, so no new values are expected.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop with the reason that all distinct case codes have been extracted and verified.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct case codes (25-cv-00999 and 25-cv-01266) have been extracted from multiple documents with supporting evidence.
