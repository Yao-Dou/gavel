The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The Snapshot mentions that the Document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. So, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of documents. That's the first step before I can read any documents or search them. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't available yet. So, the next action must be list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3091, "completion_tokens": 174, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The current status shows that all 9 documents are unvisited, and the Filing_Date key is empty. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where the filing date might be. In legal documents, the complaint is usually the first filed document, so the Filing_Date is likely in the Complaint or the Docket. The Docket often lists the filing date as the first entry. The Complaint might have the date at the top or in the caption.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaint is 16,399 tokens and unvisited. The Docket is 5,146 tokens, also unvisited. Since the Docket is more likely to have the filing date listed as a docket entry, maybe I should check the Docket first. But the user might need to read the Docket to find the date.\n\nThe next action should be to read a document. Since the Docket is smaller (5k tokens) compared to the Complaint (16k), it's more efficient to read the Docket first. The Docket might have the filing date right at the beginning. So I'll choose to read the Docket document. The start_token should be 0, end_token 10000, but since the Docket is 5k tokens, maybe read the whole thing. Wait, the maximum is 10k tokens, so reading the whole Docket (5k) is safe. So call read_document on Docket, start 0, end 5146.\n\nWait, the document says \"Docket [Docket] - 5,146 tokens - ○ Unvisited\". So the token count is 5146. So reading from 0 to 5146 would get the whole document. But the tool requires end_token exclusive, so end_token 5146 would cover all tokens. So parameters: doc_name \"Docket\", start_token 0, end_token 5146.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the filing date is in the Complaint. But Docket is more likely. Let's go with Docket first.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 5146}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 5146}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3380, "completion_tokens": 513, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot of the current status.\n\nFirst, looking at the Recent Actions: Step 1 was list_documents, which found 9 documents. Step 2 was read_document on the Docket (tokens 0-5146). The Docket entry shows multiple entries with dates, including the Complaint filed on 2025-04-24. The Filing_Date should be the date the complaint was filed, which is 2025-04-24.\n\nThe Docket document is marked as Fully Visited (✓ Fully Visited) with tokens 0-5146. The user read all of it. Now, checking the Docket entries, the first entry with a complaint is entry 1: \"COMPLAINT against All Defendants ( Filing fee $ 405 receipt number ADCDC-11640852) filed by NATIONAL ACADEMY OF EDUCATION, NATIONAL COUNCIL ON MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATION. (Attachments: # 1 Civil Cover Sheet, # 2 Summons, # 3 Summons, # 4 Exhibit Related Case Form - Civil, # 5 Exhibit Corporate Disclosure Statement)(Spital, Samuel) (Entered: 04/24/2025)\".\n\nThe date here is 04/24/2025, which is April 24, 2025. The Filing_Date should be this date. The checklist item is Filing_Date, and the value is 2025-04-24 (in ISO format, but the example uses MM/DD/YYYY, but the requirement says calendar date, so probably the same as in the document).\n\nThe Docket is fully visited, so no need to read it again. The next step is to append this value to the checklist. The evidence needs to include the text, source document, and location. The text is the date in the complaint entry, source is Docket, location is the entry line (e.g., \"1 | 2025-04-24 | COMPLAINT...\").\n\nWait, the document says \"Entered: 04/24/2025\", so the filing date is April 24, 2025. The checklist item's description says \"calendar date\", so the value should be \"2025-04-24\" (ISO format) or \"04/24/2025\"? The example in the Docket uses \"04/24/2025\", but the requirement says \"calendar date\", which is usually in a standard format. However, the problem statement doesn't specify the format, but the evidence should have the verbatim text. So the value should be the string as in the document, but the checklist item might expect a specific format. Wait, the checklist definition says \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So the value should be the date as stated, but in the document it's written as 04/24/2025. However, the user might want it in ISO (YYYY-MM-DD) for consistency. But the instruction says \"Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So the value should be the exact date string from the document, but the problem is that the document uses MM/DD/YYYY. However, the user's example in the Docket entry shows \"04/24/2025\", so the extracted value should be \"04/24/2025\" or maybe normalized to YYYY-MM-DD. Wait, the problem statement says \"calendar date\", which is a date, so it's probably acceptable to use the standard format. But the evidence must have the verbatim text. So the value in the extracted list should be the date as it appears, but the checklist item's value might need to be a standard string. However, the instructions don't specify, so I'll use the date as it appears in the document. Wait, the document says \"Entered: 04/24/2025\", so the value is 04/24/2025. But the user might expect it as 2025-04-24. Let me check the checklist definition: it says \"calendar date\", so it's the actual date, but the format isn't specified. However, in legal contexts, dates are often written as MM/DD/YYYY, but for the purpose of this extraction, the value should be the exact string from the document. Wait, no, the instruction says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So the value is the date string as found. But in the Docket, the date is written as \"04/24/2025\", so the value should be \"04/24/2025\".\n\nWait, but the Filing_Date is the date the lawsuit was filed, which is the date of the complaint. The complaint entry says \"filed by... (Entered: 04/24/2025)\". So the filing date is 04/24/2025. So the extracted value should be \"04/24/2025\".\n\nNow, the evidence needs to include the verbatim text. The text would be \"04/24/2025\" from the \"Entered: 04/24/2025\" part. The source document is Docket, and the location is the specific entry line (e.g., \"1 | 2025-04-24 | COMPLAINT...\").\n\nWait, in the Docket text provided, the entry is:\n\n\"1 | 2025-04-24 | COMPLAINT against All Defendants ( Filing fee $ 405 receipt number ADCDC-11640852) filed by NATIONAL ACADEMY OF EDUCATION, NATIONAL COUNCIL ON MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATION. (Attachments: # 1 Civil Cover Sheet, # 2 Summons, # 3 Summons, # 4 Exhibit Related Case Form - Civil, # 5 Exhibit Corporate Disclosure Statement)(Spital, Samuel) (Entered: 04/24/2025)\"\n\nSo the date in the entry is \"2025-04-24\" for the event, but the \"Entered\" date is \"04/24/2025\". Wait, the \"2025-04-24\" in the event line is the date the event happened (the filing), and the \"Entered\" date is the date it was entered into the docket, which might be the same. But the Filing_Date should be the date the lawsuit was filed, which is the date the complaint was filed, so it's the event date. The event date here is \"2025-04-24\", which is April 24, 2025. So the value should be \"2025-04-24\".\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"The calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" The complaint was filed on 2025-04-24, as per the event date. The \"Entered\" date might be the same as the filing date. So the value is 2025-04-24.\n\nIn the Docket entry, the line starts with \"1 | 2025-04-24 | ...\", so the date is \"2025-04-24\". So the extracted value should be \"2025-04-24\".\n\nThe evidence text would be \"2025-04-24\" from the event line. Source document is Docket, location is the specific line (e.g., \"Entry 1: 2025-04-24 | COMPLAINT...\").\n\nNow, since the Docket is fully visited, and the value is found, the next action should be to append the checklist entry with this value. So the action is append_checklist with the key \"Filing_Date\", and the extracted entry containing the value \"2025-04-24\" with evidence.\n\nWait, but the user's checklist item is \"Filing_Date\", and the value is \"2025-04-24\". The evidence needs to have the verbatim text. The verbatim text from the document is \"2025-04-24\" in the event line. So the evidence text is \"2025-04-24\", source is \"Docket\", location is the entry number 1, or the line number in the document. But the document is a docket, so the location could be \"Docket Entry 1\" or \"Line 1\".\n\nIn the evidence, location is specified as \"e.g., page, section, docket entry\". So here, it's \"Docket Entry 1\".\n\nSo the evidence array should have one entry with text \"2025-04-24\", source \"Docket\", location \"Docket Entry 1\".\n\nTherefore, the append_checklist action should be called with the patch containing key \"Filing_Date\" and the extracted array with that evidence.\n\nNow, checking the current status: Keys with Values is 0/1, so this will fill it. The next action is to append the checklist.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Filing_Date\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"2025-04-24\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"2025-04-24\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"Docket Entry 1\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "2025-04-24", "evidence": [{"text": "2025-04-24", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Docket Entry 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8667, "completion_tokens": 2149, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

However, the filing date is usually the date the complaint was filed, which is in the Docket. The other documents like Complaint, Amended Complaint, etc., might have different dates. For example, the Amended Complaint is dated 2025-07-21, but that's not the original filing date. The original filing date should be the first date the complaint was submitted, which is in the Docket.\n\nThe Docket is already fully visited, so there's no need to read it again.

So the extraction is complete.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the Docket shows 2025-04-24, and no other document has a different filing date (since the original filing is only once), then that's the only value. The other dates in the Docket are related to other events (like motions, hearings), not the filing date.\n\nThe current status shows 1 value extracted, and all keys are filled.
