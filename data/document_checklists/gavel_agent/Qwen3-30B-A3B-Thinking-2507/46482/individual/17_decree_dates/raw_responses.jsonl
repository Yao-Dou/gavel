The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since there's no documents listed, I can't proceed with reading or searching. So the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of available documents.\n\nI need to make sure I don't try to read a document that doesn't exist. The tools mention that if the catalog is unknown, use list_documents. The current state says \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" so definitely need to list them first.

The user needs to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, and it's currently empty. There are 9 documents available, all unvisited.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which documents are most likely to contain decree dates. The checklist specifies that decree-related dates include entry dates, modifications, suspensions, etc., for injunctions, consent decrees, or stipulated judgments. So, documents like Orders, Memorandum Opinions, and maybe Docket entries might have these dates.\n\nLooking at the document list:\n- Complaint and First Amended Complaint: These are initial filings, probably not containing decree dates.\n- Docket: Might have dates, but it's a log of proceedings. The actual decree dates might be in the Orders or Opinions.\n- Memorandum Opinion and Order: These are likely to contain the actual court orders with dates.\n- Motions and Memoranda: These might reference dates but not the decree entries themselves.\n\nThe Order document (1,046 tokens) is short and probably contains the decree date. The Memorandum Opinion (15k tokens) might have the main order details. The Docket could list the entry date.\n\nSince the Order document is small, it's a good candidate to read first. The task is to extract all distinct dates, so checking the Order first makes sense. The Order's name suggests it's the decree itself, so the entry date is probably there.\n\nI should use read_document on the Order. The document is unvisited, so start from token 0 to the end (but max 10k tokens). The Order is 1,046 tokens, so reading the whole thing is safe.\n\nNo regex needed here because the target is specific to the Order document. Using read_document directly on the Order will get the date. If it's not there, then check other documents, but Order is the most probable.\n\nSo the next action is to read the Order document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1046}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1046}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3496, "completion_tokens": 450, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", which requires dates like entry dates, modifications, suspensions, etc., for injunctions, consent decrees, or stipulated judgments.\n\nFirst, I checked the recent actions. Step 1 was list_documents, which found 9 documents. Step 2 was read_document on the Order (tokens 0-1046). The Order document was read, and it's marked as fully visited. Now, looking at the Order text, there's a line that says \"SO ORDERED. Dated: May 6, 2025\". That's a date, but is it a decree date? The Order is a court order denying a motion to stay, so the \"Dated: May 6, 2025\" is the date the order was issued. According to the checklist definition, \"entry dates\" of orders should be included. So this date should be extracted.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"decree-related dates, including entry dates, modification/amendment dates... for injunctions, consent decrees, and stipulated judgments\". The Order here is a denial of a stay, not a decree. But the \"SO ORDERED\" part indicates the court's order date. The example says \"if a settlement later becomes a court order (e.g., 'consent decree entered'), include the entry date\". But this isn't a consent decree; it's a denial of a stay. So does the date here count?\n\nLooking at the text: \"SO ORDERED. Dated: May 6, 2025\". The court is issuing an order, so the entry date of that order would be May 6, 2025. The checklist includes \"entry dates\" of orders, so this should be included. The example mentions \"consent decree entered\" but the definition says \"for injunctions, consent decrees, and stipulated judgments\". This order isn't a decree, but the date is an entry date of a court order. The definition says \"decree-related dates\", but the Order is a court order, so maybe the date should be included. Wait, the checklist specifies \"for injunctions, consent decrees, and stipulated judgments\". This is a denial of a stay, not a decree. Hmm. But the date is part of the order. The user's requirement says \"Extract each date as a separate value, formatted as: '[date]: [decree event].'\" So the event here is the order being entered. The Order document's date is May 6, 2025, and the event is \"Order entered\" or \"Denial of stay order entered\".\n\nWait, the Order says \"SO ORDERED. Dated: May 6, 2025\". So the decree event here is the entry of the order. Even though it's not a consent decree, the date of the order's entry is a decree-related date. The checklist says \"decree-related dates\", but maybe the term here is used broadly for any court order. The example given in the checklist includes \"consent decree entered\", but the definition also says \"for injunctions, consent decrees, and stipulated judgments\". This is a different type of order. However, the task is to extract \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", and the Order's date is a court order date. The user might consider this as part of the decree dates. The key is to follow the checklist definition. The checklist says \"decree-related dates\", which might refer to the dates related to the decrees, but this is a different order. Wait, the Order is denying a stay, so it's a court order, but not a decree. The decree would be the final judgment. However, the Order's date is the date the court issued the order, which might be considered the entry date.\n\nLooking back at the Order text: \"SO ORDERED. Dated: May 6, 2025\". The date here is the date of the order. The checklist says \"entry dates\" of the order. So this should be included. The event would be \"Order entered\" or \"Denial of Motion to Stay entered\". The format requires \"[date]: [decree event]\". So the value would be \"May 6, 2025: Order entered\" or similar.\n\nNow, the Order document was fully read (tokens 0-1046). The extracted value here is May 6, 2025. So I need to append this to the Dates_of_All_Decrees checklist item.\n\nThe checklist item is empty, so the next action should be append_checklist with the extracted value. The evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The verbatim text is \"Dated: May 6, 2025\", source document is \"Order\", location is \"Page 2 of 2\" (as per the document header).\n\nWait, the document header says \"Case 1:25-cv-01266-TNM Document 18 Filed 05/06/25 Page 2 of 2\". So the date in the document is \"Filed 05/06/25\", but the \"Dated: May 6, 2025\" is the actual date of the order. The \"Filed\" date might be the same as the Dated, but the Dated is explicitly stated. So the evidence should use the \"Dated\" line.\n\nSo the evidence text is \"Dated: May 6, 2025\", source is \"Order\", location is \"Page 2 of 2\".\n\nNow, the checklist item is \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", so the key is that. The value is \"May 6, 2025: Order entered\" (formatting as per requirement).\n\nWait, the requirement says: \"Extract each date as a separate value, formatted as: '[date]: [decree event].'\". So the example value should be \"May 6, 2025: Order entered\".\n\nBut the event here is the order being entered, so \"Order entered\" makes sense. The decree event is \"Order entered\".\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"May 6, 2025: Order entered\".\n\nNow, check if there are other dates in the Order. The document mentions \"Filed 05/06/25\" in the header, but that's the filing date of the document, which is the same as the Dated date. The checklist says to include entry dates of the order, so the Dated date is the relevant one. The Filed date is the same, so it's redundant. So only one value here.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append this value to the checklist. So use append_checklist with the key \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\", the extracted value as \"May 6, 2025: Order entered\", and the evidence as the text snippet, document, and location.\n\nCheck if there are other documents to check. The Order is fully visited, but other documents might have more dates. However, the current step is to process the text read in Step 2. Since we have a value from the Order, we should append it first before moving on.\n\nThe recent action was read_document on Order, so the next action must be append_checklist (as per the systematic extraction process: after reading, append if values found).\n\nSo the correct action is append_checklist with the patch for Dates_of_All_Decrees.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"May 6, 2025: Order entered\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Dated: May 6, 2025\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 2 of 2\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Dates_of_All_Decrees", "extracted": [{"value": "May 6, 2025: Order entered", "evidence": [{"text": "Dated: May 6, 2025", "source_document": "Order", "location": "Page 2 of 2"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4638, "completion_tokens": 1722, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The checklist item is Dates_of_All_Decrees, and we've already got one entry from the Order document dated May 6, 2025.\n\nLooking at the current status, the Order document is fully visited (100% coverage), so I shouldn't read it again. The other documents are unvisited: Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, and several motions. Since the checklist requires all decree-related dates, I need to check if any of these other documents contain additional decree dates.\n\nThe existing entry is from the Order, which is an order entered on May 6, 2025. But maybe other documents like the Memorandum Opinion or the Docket might have more dates. The Docket might list dates of various entries, so it's a good candidate. Also, the Memorandum Opinion might have a date when the opinion was issued, which could be a decree date.\n\nWait, the requirement says to include entry dates, modification dates, suspension dates, etc. So the Docket might have multiple entries with dates. The Docket document is 5,146 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing with read_document. Since it's unvisited, I should start with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for dates. The pattern could be something like dates in the format \"MM/DD/YYYY\" or \"Month DD, YYYY\". But the example given in the extracted value was \"May 6, 2025\", so the regex should match that. However, the problem is that searching for dates might return too many irrelevant matches. Since the Docket is a specific document that's likely to have chronological entries, it's better to read it directly.\n\nThe available documents list shows Docket is unvisited. So the next logical step is to read the Docket document. The Docket is 5,146 tokens, which is under the 10k limit. So I should call read_document on Docket with start_token 0 and end_token 5146.\n\nWait, but the Document catalog shows Docket as [Docket], so the doc_name is \"Docket\". So the action should be read_document with doc_name \"Docket\", start_token 0, end_token 5146.\n\nI need to make sure I don't miss other documents. But since the Docket is a key document that would list dates of filings, orders, etc., it's the next best candidate.

They've read the Docket (fully visited) and the Order (fully visited). The Docket has entries like \"2025-04-24\" etc., but those are event dates, not decree dates. The Order has the \"Dated: May 6, 2025\" which they've already extracted.\n\nThe available documents include other unvisited ones like Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, etc. The user needs to check if any of these contain additional decree dates.\n\nWait, the checklist says to extract decree dates, including entry dates, modification dates, etc. The Order they read was a denial of a motion to stay, so the entry date of that order is May 6, 2025. But are there other orders or decrees in the other documents?\n\nThe Docket has entries like \"ORDER DENYING Defendants' 16 Motion to Stay\" on May 6, 2025, but that's the same date as the Order they already processed. The Memorandum Opinion (Document 27) and Order Denying Motion (Document 28) are dated June 3, 2025. Wait, Document 27 is \"MEMORANDUM OPINION DENYING Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" dated June 3, 2025. And Document 28 is the \"ORDER DENYING Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction\" also dated June 3, 2025. So those are two separate documents (the opinion and the order) but both dated June 3, 2025.\n\nWait, but the Docket shows that Document 27 and 28 are both dated 2025-06-03. So the Memorandum Opinion and the Order have the same date. But the checklist requires extracting each decree date as a separate value. However, if the order is the decree, then the entry date of the order would be June 3, 2025. But in the Docket, Document 28 is the ORDER, so that's the decree. The Memorandum Opinion (Document 27) is the opinion, but the order itself (Document 28) is the decree.\n\nSo, the Order on Document 28 (entered June 3, 2025) would have a decree date of June 3, 2025. The user hasn't read Document 28 yet because it's in the unvisited list. The available documents include \"Memorandum Opinion\" and \"ORDER DENYING...\" as separate documents.

The \"Memorandum Opinion\" is the opinion, and the \"ORDER\" is the actual order. So the \"Memorandum Opinion\" might not be the decree, but the \"ORDER\" would be. However, the user hasn't read the \"Memorandum Opinion\" or the \"ORDER\" yet. The Docket shows that Document 27 is the Memorandum Opinion dated June 3, and Document 28 is the ORDER dated June 3.\n\nSo, the ORDER (Document 28) is the decree, so its entry date is June 3, 2025. The user needs to read Document 28 (which is listed as \"ORDER DENYING...\" but the actual document name might be \"Order\" or similar). Wait, the available documents list \"Memorandum Opinion\" and \"ORDER DENYING...\" as separate entries. Wait, the \"ORDER DENYING...\" is probably the actual order document, which would have the decree date. But the user hasn't read it yet.\n\nThe Docket entry for Document 28 says \"ORDER DENYING Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction. See attached Order for details. Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 6/3/2025.\" So the actual Order document (Document 28) would have the date. The user needs to read that document to confirm the date.\n\nBut in the available documents, \"ORDER DENYING...\" is listed as a document. Wait, looking at the \"Available Documents\" section:\n\n- **Memorandum Opinion** [Order/Opinion] - 15,044 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n- **Defendants' Motion to Stay Proceedings** [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 2,422 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n- **Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction** [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 30,884 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n- **Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction** [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 1,170 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n- **Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in Support of Their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction** [Pleading / Motion / Brief] - 20,039 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n\nWait, the \"Order\" they read earlier was Document 18. The Memorandum Opinion is Document 27, and the ORDER is Document 28. So the actual Order document (Document 28) is listed as \"ORDER DENYING...\" but it's not in the available documents list. Wait, the available documents list includes \"Memorandum Opinion\" as a separate document, but the Order (Document 28) might be part of the \"Memorandum Opinion\" or a separate one. Hmm, maybe the \"Memorandum Opinion\" includes the order. But the Docket entry for Document 28 is \"ORDER DENYING...\", so it's a separate document.\n\nBut in the \"Available Documents\" list, the \"Memorandum Opinion\" is listed as a document. The user needs to read that to see if it contains the decree date. Wait, the Memorandum Opinion (Document 27) is the opinion, and the Order (Document 28) is the order. So the Order document (Document 28) would have the decree date. However, the available documents don't list \"Order\" as a separate document but \"Memorandum Opinion\" and others. Wait, the \"Order\" they read in Step 2 was Document 18, which was the initial Order (denying the stay). Now, Document 28 is another Order (denying the preliminary injunction), which is a different document.\n\nThe user needs to read Document 28 to get its date. But the available documents don't list \"Order\" as a separate entry. Wait, the \"Available Documents\" list includes \"Memorandum Opinion\" (which is Document 27) and \"ORDER DENYING...\" might be part of that. But the Docket shows Document 28 as a separate entry. Maybe the \"Memorandum Opinion\" document (Document 27) contains the opinion, and the actual Order (Document 28) is a separate document. However, the available documents don't list it. Wait, the user has 9 documents total. They've read Docket and Order (Document 18), and the other 7 are unvisited. The \"Memorandum Opinion\" is one of them (Document 27), and \"ORDER DENYING...\" (Document 28) is another, but maybe it's included in the \"Memorandum Opinion\" document. Or perhaps the \"Memorandum Opinion\" is the document that includes the order.\n\nWait, the Docket entry for Document 27 says \"MEMORANDUM OPINION DENYING Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Case No. 25-cv-999 and Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Case No. 25-cv-1266. See attached Opinion for details.\" So the Memorandum Opinion (Document 27) is the opinion, and Document 28 is the Order, which might be a separate document. But the available documents list \"Memorandum Opinion\" as a document, so perhaps Document 28 is part of it or the user needs to read the Memorandum Opinion to find the order date.\n\nWait, the checklist requires extracting the decree dates. The order in Document 28 is the decree, so the date on that order is June 3, 2025. The user needs to read the actual order document to confirm. But since the \"Memorandum Opinion\" is listed as a document, and the Docket says Document 28 is the ORDER, perhaps the user should read the \"Memorandum Opinion\" document (which is Document 27) to see if it contains the order date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Memorandum Opinion\" includes the order, so reading that document would show the date. The user should read the \"Memorandum Opinion\" document to check for decree dates.\n\nThe current available documents include \"Memorandum Opinion\" (15,044 tokens) as unvisited. The user should read that to find any decree dates. The Docket shows that Document 27 is the Memorandum Opinion dated June 3, 2025, so the document itself likely has that date.\n\nSo the next step is to read the \"Memorandum Opinion\" document to extract the date. The document name is \"Memorandum Opinion\" as per the catalog. The user should call read_document on \"Memorandum Opinion\" for the entire document (since it's unvisited) but the maximum tokens per read is 10,000. The document is 15,044 tokens, so they might need to read in chunks. But the first read would be tokens 0-10,000.\n\nWait, the policy says not to reread fully visited documents, but this one is unvisited. So the next action is to read_document on \"Memorandum Opinion\" from 0 to 10,000 tokens.\n\nWait, but the user needs to check if the Memorandum Opinion contains a decree date. The Docket says it's dated June 3, 2025, so the document likely has that date. The user should read it to confirm and extract the date.\n\nSo the correct action is to call read_document on \"Memorandum Opinion\" with start_token 0 and end_token 10000 (since it's 15k tokens, but max 10k per call).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 1, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10025, "completion_tokens": 2550, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The next step should be to check if there are more decree dates in the remaining parts of the Memorandum Opinion or in the other unvisited documents.\n\nWait, the checklist requires extracting \"decree-related dates, including entry dates, modification/amendment dates, suspension/stay dates, partial termination dates, and full termination/vacatur dates\". The previous extraction was from the Order document where the judge signed the order on May 6, 2025.

But that's the same date as the Order. The Docket entry says \"ORDER DENYING\", so the date of the order is May 6, 2025. But we already have that date from the Order document. So maybe there's no new date here.\n\nWait, the user's previous action (Step 5) was reading the Memorandum Opinion. The Memorandum Opinion document is from Document 25, filed on 06/03/25. The document includes the date \"Filed 06/03/25\" on the first page. But the checklist is about decree dates, not filing dates. The decree dates are when the court entered an order or decree. The Memorandum Opinion is a written opinion, not a decree.

The Memorandum Opinion is the written opinion, but the actual decree (the order) was dated May 6, 2025. So maybe the Memorandum Opinion itself doesn't contain a new decree date. However, looking at the Docket, entry 27 and 28 are dated 06/03/25. Let's check:\n\n27 | 2025-06-03 | MEMORANDUM OPINION DENYING Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Case No. 25-cv-999 and Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Case No. 25-cv-1266. See attached Opinion for details. Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 6/3/2025. (lctnm1) (Entered: 06/03/2025)\n\n28 | 2025-06-03 | ORDER DENYING Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction. See attached Order for details. Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 6/3/2025. (lctnm1) (Entered: 06/03/2025)\n\nAh, here's a new decree date: June 3, 2025. The ORDER DENYING is dated June 3, 2025. So this is a new decree date that hasn't been extracted yet.\n\nBut wait, the Docket document is fully visited (tokens 0-5146), so we should have read this entry. However, in the Docket text provided in Step 4, the user read up to token 5146, which includes entries up to 31. Let me check the Docket text again.\n\nIn the Docket text, entry 18 is dated 2025-05-06 (the Order denying the stay), and entries 27 and 28 are listed as 2025-06-03. But in the provided Docket text, the user's Step 4 shows that they read tokens 0-5146, which includes entries up to 31. Entry 27 is \"2025-06-03 | MEMORANDUM OPINION...\" and 28 is \"2025-06-03 | ORDER DENYING...\". So these entries should have been read.\n\nWait, the Docket text in Step 4 shows entries up to 31, which includes 27 and 28. So the date June 3, 2025 is present in the Docket. But why wasn't it extracted before? Because the checklist is about decree dates, and the Docket entry 28 is an ORDER DENYING, which is a decree. The date here is June 3, 2025.\n\nSo the current extracted value is May 6, 2025 (from the Order document). The Docket entry 28 has June 3, 2025. So this is a new date that needs to be added.\n\nWait, but the user's previous step (Step 5) was reading the Memorandum Opinion. The Memorandum Opinion document (Document 25) was filed on June 3, 2025. But the actual order denying the motion is in the Docket as entry 28, dated June 3, 2025. So the decree date is June 3, 2025.\n\nSo the next step is to extract this new date. Since the Docket is fully visited, but the user might not have processed it yet. Wait, the checklist extraction is supposed to be done by reading the documents. The Docket is a document that's fully visited, so the user should have already read it. But in the recent actions, Step 4 was reading the Docket, but the user hasn't appended the new date yet. Wait, no—Step 4 was reading the Docket, and then Step 5 was reading the Memorandum Opinion.\n\nWait, the user's Step 3 was appending the May 6 date from the Order. Then Step 4 was reading the Docket (which includes the June 3 date in entry 28), but they haven't appended that yet. So the current status shows 1 value extracted, but there's another value in the Docket.\n\nWait, the user's Step 4 says: \"Read from Docket (tokens 0-5146):\" and the Docket text includes entries up to 31, including 27 and 28 with June 3, 2025. So the Docket document has the date June 3, 2025, but the user hasn't extracted it yet. So the next action should be to append that date.\n\nBut the user is supposed to analyze the text they just read (the Docket) to extract values. So after Step 4 (reading the Docket), they should have appended the June 3 date. But in the current status, they only have one value (May 6), so they probably missed the June 3 date.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so they haven't added the June 3 date. So the next step is to append the June 3 date.\n\nBut the user's recent action history shows that after Step 4 (reading Docket), they did Step 5 (reading Memorandum Opinion), but they didn't append the Docket's date. So now, after reading the Memorandum Opinion (which is partially visited), they need to check if there's any more decree dates.\n\nWait, the Memorandum Opinion document (Document 25) has a date on the first page: \"Filed 06/03/25\", but that's the filing date, not a decree date. The decree date would be when the order was entered, which is in the Docket entry 28 as June 3, 2025.\n\nSo the Docket entry 28's date is the decree date. Since the Docket is fully visited, the user should have extracted that date from the Docket. But they haven't, so they need to append it now.\n\nBut the user's next action should be to append the new date. However, the current status shows only one value. So the correct action is to use append_checklist for the new date.\n\nWait, but the user's last action was reading the Memorandum Opinion. Now, after reading that, they should check if there's any decree date in that document. The Memorandum Opinion itself is the opinion, not the decree. The decree is the order, which is dated June 3, 2025, as per the Docket. So the Memorandum Opinion doesn't contain a new decree date. The Docket document contains the date, but it's already fully visited.\n\nWait, the user's Step 4 was reading the Docket, so they should have seen the June 3 date. But they didn't extract it, so they need to append it now. So the next action should be append_checklist with the new date.\n\nBut according to the Systematic Extraction Process: \"After each read_document or search_document_regex action: Carefully analyze the returned text to identify ALL checklist items that can be extracted.\"\n\nSo after Step 4 (reading Docket), they should have extracted the June 3 date. But they didn't, so in the current turn, after reading the Memorandum Opinion (Step 5), they need to go back and process the Docket's content. Wait, no. The Docket was read in Step 4, so they should have extracted the date then. But since they didn't, the current status shows they missed it. So the next action should be to append the date from the Docket.\n\nBut how? The Docket is fully visited, so they can't read it again. But they have the text from Step 4. So they need to use append_checklist to add the new value.\n\nSo the correct action is to call append_checklist with the new date: June 3, 2025, with evidence from the Docket document.\n\nThe evidence should be: from the Docket entry 28: \"ORDER DENYING Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction. See attached Order for details. Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 6/3/2025.\"\n\nSo the value is \"June 3, 2025: Order entered\" (or similar).\n\nWait, the checklist requires formatting as \"[date]: [decree event]\". So \"June 3, 2025: Order denying motion for preliminary injunction\".\n\nBut the user's previous entry was \"May 6, 2025: Order entered\". So the new entry would be \"June 3, 2025: Order denying motion for preliminary injunction\".\n\nNow, the user needs to append this. So the next action is append_checklist with this new value.\n\nBut the current status shows only one value, so they need to add the second one.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 28 says \"ORDER DENYING Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction. See attached Order for details. Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 6/3/2025.\" So the decree event is \"Order denying motion for preliminary injunction\", and the date is June 3, 2025.\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"June 3, 2025: Order denying motion for preliminary injunction\".\n\nThe evidence would be the text from Docket entry 28: \"ORDER DENYING Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction. See attached Order for details. Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 6/3/2025.\"\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append this value.\n\nBut wait, the user's recent action history shows that after Step 4 (reading Docket), they didn't append the date, and then moved to Step 5 (reading Memorandum Opinion). Now, they should realize that the Docket has another decree date, so they need to append it now.\n\nSo the correct next action is append_checklist with the new entry.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response should be a call to append_checklist with the new value.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"June 3, 2025: Order denying motion for preliminary injunction\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"28 | 2025-06-03 | ORDER DENYING Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction.

The user needs me to extract all decree dates from the legal documents. So far, they've already extracted two dates: May 6, 2025 from the Order document and June 3, 2025 from the Docket entry.\n\nLooking at the current status, the checklist item \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" has two values. The documents that have been fully visited are Docket and Order. The Memorandum Opinion is partially visited (66% covered), but the remaining documents are unvisited. Wait, the user mentioned that the Memorandum Opinion was read up to 10,000 tokens, but the document is 15,044 tokens long. So there's still 5,044 tokens left unviewed.\n\nThe next step is to check if there are more decree dates in the remaining parts of the Memorandum Opinion. Since the document is partially visited, I should read the unviewed tokens (10,001-15,044) to see if there are additional decree dates. The checklist requires all distinct values, so I need to make sure not to miss any.\n\nThe other documents like Complaint, Amended Complaint, etc., are unvisited, but the user's current task is to extract decree dates. The previous steps already found two dates, and the Memorandum Opinion might have more. The Docket and Order were fully read, so they're done. The Memorandum Opinion's remaining part might contain more dates. For example, in the provided text of the Memorandum Opinion, there's a \"Filed 06/03/25\" on page 1, but that's the filing date, not a decree date. Wait, the decree date would be when the court entered an order, like the denial of the motion. The Docket entry 28 already captured June 3, 2025. The Memorandum Opinion's document shows it was filed on June 3, 2025, which is the same as the Docket entry. So maybe that's the same date.\n\nBut I should check the unviewed part of the Memorandum Opinion to confirm. The next action should be to read the remaining tokens of the Memorandum Opinion (from 10,001 to 15,044) to see if there's any additional decree date. The user's previous steps have already read up to 10,000 tokens, so the next step is to read the next chunk. The maximum allowed is 10,000 tokens, and the remaining is about 5,044, which is under the limit. So the correct action is to call read_document on Memorandum Opinion for tokens 10001-15044.\n\nWait, the document says \"Memorandum Opinion\" is 15,044 tokens, and viewed tokens are 0-10000. So the next read should be 10001 to 15044. That's 5,044 tokens, which is under 10,000. So the next action is read_document with doc_name \"Memorandum Opinion\", start_token 10001, end_token 15044.\n\nOther documents like the Complaint or Motion to Stay might not contain decree dates, as decree dates are typically in court orders. The Docket and Order already had the dates. The Memorandum Opinion is the opinion that would include the dates of the orders, but since it's partially read, maybe the rest has more info. But the two dates already extracted are from the Order (May 6) and Docket (June 3). The Memorandum Opinion's filing date is June 3, which is the same as the Docket entry, so it's the same decree date. So perhaps there are no more dates. But the user needs to check the remaining tokens to be thorough.\n\nThe system's instruction says to never reread fully visited documents, but this is partially visited, so reading the unviewed part is allowed. So the correct next action is read_document for the remaining tokens of Memorandum Opinion.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 10001, \"end_token\": 15044}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 10001, "end_token": 15044}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 20678, "completion_tokens": 930, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all decree dates from the legal documents, specifically for the checklist item \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\". \n\nFirst, I'll review the current status. The system has already extracted two dates:\n1. \"May 6, 2025: Order entered\" from the Order document (page 2)\n2. \"June 3, 2025: Order denying motion for preliminary injunction\" from the Docket (entry 28)\n\nNow, looking at the available documents, most are fully visited (Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Order), but there are 6 unvisited documents: Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Defendants' Motion to Stay, Memorandum in Opposition, Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, and Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law.\n\nThe checklist definition specifies that we need to extract \"decree-related dates\" including entry dates, modification dates, suspension dates, etc. for injunctions, consent decrees, etc. The key is to find any date that matches these criteria.\n\nI should check if any of the unvisited documents contain decree dates. The Memorandum Opinion (which is fully visited) already contains the June 3, 2025 date in the order denying the motion. The Docket entry 28 confirms this.\n\nBut let's think about the other documents. The \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" (1,170 tokens) might contain a date when the motion was filed, but that's not a decree date. The \"Defendants' Motion to Stay\" might have a date, but again, that's a motion, not a decree.\n\nThe \"Complaint\" and \"First Amended Complaint\" are filings, not decrees. The \"Memorandum in Opposition\" is a brief, not a decree. The \"Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law\" is also a brief.\n\nWait, the Memorandum Opinion (which is fully visited) has a date: \"Dated: June 3, 2025\" in the signature block. But that's already been extracted as \"June 3, 2025: Order denying motion for preliminary injunction\" from the Docket entry. So that's covered.\n\nThe Order document already gave us May 6, 2025. The Docket gave us June 3, 2025. Are there any other decree dates?\n\nLooking at the Docket entries:\n- Entry 18: \"ORDER DENYING Defendants' 16 Motion to Stay. See attached Order for details. Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 5/6/2025.\" So May 6, 2025 is another date, but this is the same as the Order entry (entry 18 says \"on 5/6/2025\", and the Order document has \"Dated: May 6, 2025\"). So this is the same decree date, just listed in the Docket. We already have this date from the Order document, so it's a duplicate.\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion is dated June 3, 2025, which we've already extracted.\n\nAre there any other decree dates in the unvisited documents? Let's consider:\n\n- The \"First Amended Complaint\" might have a date when it was filed, but that's not a decree.\n- The \"Defendants' Motion to Stay\" might have a date, but again, not a decree.\n- The \"Memorandum in Opposition\" and \"Plaintiffs' Motion\" are briefs, not decrees.\n\nThe only decrees mentioned in the visited documents are the Order dated May 6, 2025 and the Order denying the motion dated June 3, 2025.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 18 says \"ORDER DENYING Defendants' 16 Motion to Stay. See attached Order for details. Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 5/6/2025.\" But this is the same as the Order document we already read (which was dated May 6, 2025). So it's the same decree, just referenced in the Docket. We don't need to extract it again.\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion is dated June 3, 2025, which we've extracted from the Docket entry 28.\n\nSo it seems like we have all the decree dates. The two dates we have are:\n1. May 6, 2025 (Order entered)\n2. June 3, 2025 (Order denying motion)\n\nNow, checking the document catalog: the other documents are unvisited, but they're all complaints, motions, and briefs—not decrees. Decrees are court orders, so they'd be in the Order document, the Docket entries for orders, and the Memorandum Opinion (which is the court's opinion).\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion is the court's opinion, and it's dated June 3, 2025, which we've already extracted. The Order document is the actual order dated May 6, 2025.\n\nI don't see any other decree dates in the visited documents. The unvisited documents are all filings or briefs, not court orders. For example, the \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" would be a motion, not a decree. The decree would be the court's order on that motion, which we've already extracted as June 3, 2025.\n\nSo, the checklist item \"Dates_of_All_Decrees\" has two values, and all applicable documents have been checked. The unvisited documents don't contain decree dates because they're not decrees—they're motions, complaints, etc.\n\nTherefore, the checklist is complete. We have two values, both with evidence. No more documents need to be read because the remaining documents aren't likely to contain decree dates.\n\nWait, but the system says \"Total Values Extracted: 2\" and \"Keys with Values: 1/1\". So all keys are filled. The only key is Dates_of_All_Decrees, which has two values. The system should stop.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any other decree date. The Docket entry 28 says \"ORDER DENYING Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction. See attached Order for details. Signed by Judge Trevor N. McFadden on 6/3/2025.\" And the Memorandum Opinion is dated June 3, 2025. So that's the same date.\n\nThe Order document has \"Dated: May 6, 2025\", which is the order denying the motion to stay (entry 18 in Docket), so that's the same as the Order document.\n\nSo yes, only two distinct decree dates: May 6 and June 3, 2025.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to stop, since all checklist items are fully extracted.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All decree dates extracted: May 6, 2025 (Order entered) and June 3, 2025 (Order denying motion for preliminary injunction).
