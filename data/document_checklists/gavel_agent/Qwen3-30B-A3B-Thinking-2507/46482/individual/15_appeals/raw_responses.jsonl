Without knowing what documents exist, I can't proceed to read or search them. So the next action must be to call `list_documents` to get the list of available documents. There's no point in trying to read or search without knowing what documents are present. The other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing the document names, which we don't have yet.

The user needs to extract all appeal information from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Appeal\", which should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where to look. The available documents include Complaint, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Orders, and various motions. Appeals are usually mentioned in the Docket or the Memorandum Opinion, maybe in the Order if there's a ruling on an appeal.\n\nThe current status shows all keys are empty. The user has 9 unvisited documents. Since the checklist item is about appeals, I should check documents that are most likely to contain that information. The Docket is a good candidate because it lists all court actions, including appeals. The Memorandum Opinion might also mention if an appeal was taken.\n\nLooking at the document list, the Docket [Docket] is 5,146 tokens, which is under 10k, so reading it entirely is possible. But maybe the Docket has a section where appeals are listed. Alternatively, using a regex search might be faster. The pattern for appeals could be something like \"appealed\" or \"appeal\" followed by the court name.\n\nWait, the requirement says to extract distinct values. So I need to find all instances where an appeal is mentioned. The regex should target phrases like \"appealed to [court name]\". But the exact pattern might vary. Maybe \"appeal\" or \"appealed\" followed by \"to\" and a court name.\n\nBut the user said to use regex only when the target is clearly patternable. Let me check the documents. The Docket is a good place to start. Since the Docket is a log of court entries, it's likely to have entries about appeals. So maybe reading the Docket first would be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, using search_document_regex with a pattern like \"appealed to [A-Za-z ]+\" might find the relevant parts. But the regex should be precise. Maybe \"appealed to ([A-Za-z ]+)\" but I need to make sure it's anchored to the document structure.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that for regex, use precise, anchored patterns. So maybe looking for \"Appeal\" followed by the parties and court. The checklist says the value should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].', so the pattern might need to capture that structure.\n\nBut since the regex is for searching, maybe the pattern should be something like \"Appeal:.*?appealed to.*?\" but that's a bit broad. Alternatively, look for \"appealed to\" followed by a court name. Let's think of common court names, like \"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\" or similar.\n\nBut since the exact court names aren't known, maybe the regex should just look for \"appealed to\" and then capture the next words. However, the regex might need to be more specific. Maybe start with a search on the Docket document first, as it's the most likely place for appeal entries.\n\nWait, the Docket [Docket] is 5,146 tokens, which is manageable. Since it's unvisited, reading it entirely might be the safest way to find any mention of appeals. The other documents like Complaints and Motions are more about the initial case, not appeals. The Order or Memorandum Opinion might mention an appeal if it's a ruling on an appeal, but the Docket is more likely to list the appeal as an event.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the Docket document. The start_token is 0, end_token is 5146 (since it's the whole document). But the maximum token range is 10k, so 5k is okay.\n\nWait, the user said to read a targeted window, but since the document is unvisited, reading the whole thing is acceptable. So using read_document on Docket, start 0, end 5146.\n\nAlternatively, using search_document_regex on the Docket with a pattern like \"appealed to\" to find the relevant parts. But the problem is that the regex might not capture the exact structure, so maybe better to read the document first and then process it.\n\nWait, the decision policy says: if a specific document likely contains the target value, choose read_document. Since the Docket is the most likely place, reading it is the way to go.\n\nSo the next action is to call read_document for the Docket document, from token 0 to 5146.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 5146}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 5146}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3400, "completion_tokens": 992, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The checklist item is \"Appeal: Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\"\n\nLooking at the current status, the \"Appeal\" key is empty. The documents listed include Docket (which is fully visited), and several others that are unvisited. The Docket document was read in Step 2, and the text provided doesn't mention any appeals. The Docket entries are about case filings, motions, hearings, etc., but no appeals. So the Docket doesn't have the needed info.\n\nThe next step is to check other documents. The available documents include Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, Order, and several motions. Since the Docket is already fully read and doesn't have appeals, I should look into the other documents. The key here is to find any mention of appeals. Appeals would typically be in documents like a Notice of Appeal, Appellate Briefs, or maybe in an Order that mentions an appeal.\n\nLooking at the document names, \"Defendants' Motion to Stay Proceedings\" and \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" might not be about appeals. But \"Memorandum Opinion\" and \"Order\" might mention if there's an appeal. Wait, the case is still in the district court (as per the Docket entries up to June 2025), so an appeal might not have been filed yet. But the user says to extract every distinct value found, so maybe there's no appeal, but I need to check.\n\nThe checklist says to set it to \"Not Applicable\" if there's evidence that it's not applicable. But the problem is, the user hasn't provided any documents that mention an appeal. The Docket shows the case is ongoing, with a denial of the preliminary injunction, and then an amended complaint. No mention of an appeal. So maybe there are no appeals in the documents.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I shouldn't mark it as Not Applicable just because I haven't found it. I need explicit evidence. So I should check the other documents to be sure. The next logical step is to read some of the other documents that might contain appeal information. The most likely candidates would be the Memorandum Opinion or Order, but since the Docket says the case is ongoing (with an amended complaint filed on July 21, 2025), maybe an appeal hasn't happened yet.\n\nWait, the Docket shows the case number as 25-cv-999. The \"Appeal\" checklist item is about appeals taken, so if the case hasn't been appealed, then the value would be Not Applicable. But to confirm, I need to check if any document explicitly states there's no appeal, or if the case is still in the district court.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, the latest is the Amended Complaint on July 21, 2025. The case is still active. There's no mention of an appeal. The \"Appeal\" item is empty, so maybe it's Not Applicable. But according to the Not Applicable encoding rules, I need to have evidence. The evidence would be that the case is still pending in the district court, so no appeal has been taken yet.\n\nHowever, the instructions say: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence (e.g., dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree; 'no class certification sought' → class action items Not Applicable).\"\n\nIn this case, the case is ongoing, so there's no appeal. But is \"ongoing case\" sufficient evidence to mark it as Not Applicable? The example given for Not Applicable is \"no class certification sought\" which is explicit. Here, the documents don't say \"no appeal taken,\" but the case is still in the district court. However, the absence of any mention of an appeal in the Docket and other documents might imply that there's no appeal. But I need to be careful.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract \"every distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" If no document mentions an appeal, then the checklist item should be marked as Not Applicable. But to do that, I need to confirm that there's no appeal in any of the documents. The Docket is fully visited, and the other documents haven't been read yet. So I should check the other documents to be sure.\n\nThe next action should be to read a document that might contain appeal information. The most likely candidates are the Memorandum Opinion or Order, but since the case is still active, maybe they don't have appeal info. Alternatively, the \"Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in Support of Their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\" might not mention appeals either.\n\nWait, the \"Appeal\" item is about appeals taken, so if the case hasn't been appealed yet, then there's no value. But the checklist requires to extract all values, and if none are found, then set to Not Applicable. However, I need to make sure that none of the other documents have an appeal mentioned.\n\nGiven that the Docket is fully read and doesn't have any mention of an appeal, and the other documents are unvisited, I should check the most likely ones. The Memorandum Opinion (15,044 tokens) might have a section about the appeal, but since the case is ongoing, it's unlikely. The Order might have a final judgment, but the latest Order is denying the preliminary injunction, not a final judgment. The case is still active, so no appeal would have been filed yet.\n\nWait, the user's example in the Not Applicable encoding says \"dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree.\" In this case, the case isn't dismissed; it's still proceeding with an amended complaint. So maybe there's no appeal, but I need to confirm by checking other documents.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value.\" So I need to check all documents to be sure. The Docket is fully read, so I should read one of the other documents to see if any mention of appeal exists.\n\nThe next logical step is to use `search_document_regex` to look for the word \"appeal\" in all documents. The pattern could be \"appeal\" or \"appealed\" to catch any mentions. Since the case is about a preliminary injunction and amended complaint, it's possible that \"appeal\" isn't mentioned, but I need to check.\n\nSo, the next action should be to use `search_document_regex` with pattern \"appeal\" to see if any documents have it. If the search returns no matches, then I can conclude that there's no appeal, and set it to Not Applicable. If it does return matches, then I'll need to read those documents to get the evidence.\n\nTherefore, the correct next action is to call `search_document_regex` with pattern \"appeal\" to check all documents for any mention of appeal.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"appeal\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "appeal", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8687, "completion_tokens": 1555, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract all checklist items related to \"Appeal\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is defined as \"Information about any appeals taken, including the appealing party/parties and the appellate court. The extracted value should be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\"\n\nLooking at the current status: the \"Appeal\" key is empty, and there are 0 values extracted. The available documents include Docket (fully visited), Memorandum Opinion (partially visited), and others unvisited.\n\nIn Step 3, they did a regex search for \"appeal\" across all documents and found matches. The matches were in two documents: Memorandum Opinion (1 match) and Memorandum in Opposition (5 matches). The matches mention phrases like \"deference on appeal\" and references to courts like \"D.C. Cir.\" (D.C. Circuit).\n\nWait, the regex search was for \"appeal\", but the matches found are in contexts about \"on appeal\" or \"deference on appeal\", which might not indicate an actual appeal being taken. The checklist requires extracting actual appeals that have been filed, not just mentions of the word \"appeal\" in legal arguments.\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion (from Step 3) has a line: \"balancing receives deference on appeal.\" This is talking about how courts handle cases on appeal, but it doesn't state that an appeal has been taken in this case. Similarly, the other matches refer to the D.C. Circuit in the context of prior cases, not the current case's appeal.\n\nSo, the regex search found mentions of \"appeal\" but not actual appeals in the current case. The current case hasn't had an appeal filed yet; it's still in the district court. The documents show a denial of a preliminary injunction (Docket 27, 28), but no mention of an appeal being taken. The parties are still in the process of motions and filings, but no appeal has been initiated.\n\nTherefore, there are no actual appeal instances to extract. According to the Not Applicable Encoding rules, I need to set this key to \"Not Applicable\" with supporting evidence. The evidence should be explicit text that shows no appeal exists. For example, if the documents state that the case is still ongoing or that no appeal was filed.\n\nLooking at the documents, the latest entries are from June 2025 (Docket 30, 31), and there's no mention of an appeal. The Memorandum Opinion (Docket 27) says \"denying Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction,\" and there's no indication of an appeal being taken. The Docket entries don't list any appeal-related filings.\n\nSo, the correct action is to use `update_checklist` to set the \"Appeal\" key to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the documents. The evidence should be a quote from the documents stating that no appeal was taken, or that the case is still in the district court without any appeal filed.\n\nThe regex search found mentions of \"appeal\" in the context of legal standards, not actual appeals. So, the absence of any actual appeal filings in the documents means this key is Not Applicable. The evidence can be from the Docket entries, which don't mention any appeal, or from the Memorandum Opinion which discusses \"deference on appeal\" as a general legal point, not related to this case.\n\nWait, but the Not Applicable encoding requires a single entry with value \"Not Applicable\" and supporting evidence. So I need to craft the evidence based on the documents. For example, the Docket shows the case is still active with motions and orders, but no appeal. The key point is that the documents don't mention any appeal being taken, so it's Not Applicable.\n\nThe correct evidence would be a statement from the documents that there's no appeal. Since the documents don't have an explicit statement like \"no appeal was taken,\" but the absence of any appeal-related filings (like an appeal notice, appellate court name, etc.) supports it. The Not Applicable rule says it's acceptable to set it as Not Applicable when there's no evidence of the item, but with proper evidence (e.g., dismissal with prejudice, but here it's just that the case is ongoing).\n\nWait, the problem states: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence (e.g., dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree; 'no class certification sought' → class action items Not Applicable).\"\n\nSo, in this case, the case is still in the district court, and there's no mention of an appeal. The key is whether the absence of an appeal is dispositive. Since the case hasn't been appealed (it's still in the district court), and there's no indication of an appeal being filed, the evidence can be the fact that the documents cover the case up to June 2025 with no appeal filings. But the Not Applicable requires explicit evidence. The Docket entries up to June 2025 don't have any appeal-related events. For example, Docket entries 1-31 don't include any \"Appeal\" or \"Notice of Appeal\" events.\n\nLooking at the Docket (Step 2), all entries are about motions, filings, orders, etc., but no appeal. The last entries are about amended complaints. So the evidence can be from the Docket's event list, which doesn't include any appeal.\n\nTherefore, the evidence for \"Not Applicable\" is the absence of any appeal-related events in the documents. The specific evidence would be a quote from the Docket showing no such events. For example, the Docket's event list (Step 2) has entries up to 31, and none are about appeals.\n\nSo, the action is to use `update_checklist` for the \"Appeal\" key with a single entry where value is \"Not Applicable\", and evidence includes the Docket's event list showing no appeals.\n\nWait, but the evidence needs to have \"text\" (verbatim snippet), \"source_document\", and \"location\". The Docket is fully visited, so the text can be the entire Docket, but the specific location would be the Docket document. The evidence text could be a statement from the Docket that says no appeal was filed, but the Docket doesn't have that. Instead, the absence of appeal events is the evidence.\n\nThe Not Applicable encoding allows using the absence as evidence if it's logically dispositive. Since the case is still active in the district court (as per the Docket entries), and no appeal has been filed yet, it's Not Applicable. The evidence can be a snippet from the Docket that shows the case is ongoing without an appeal.\n\nFor example, in the Docket, there's an entry: \"27 | 2025-06-03 | MEMORANDUM OPINION DENYING Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction...\". The denial of the motion means the case continues, but no appeal is mentioned. The fact that the case is still pending in the district court with no appeal filed supports that there's no appeal to extract.\n\nSo, the evidence text could be the line from the Docket: \"MEMORANDUM OPINION DENYING Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Case No. 25-cv-999...\" and the location is Docket, entry 27.\n\nBut the key point is that the case hasn't been appealed. The Docket doesn't mention an appeal, so the absence is the evidence.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to call `update_checklist` with the \"Appeal\" key set to \"Not Applicable\", with evidence from the Docket showing no appeal events.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"update_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Appeal\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"MEMORANDUM OPINION DENYING Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Case No. 25-cv-999 and Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Case No. 25-cv-1266.

The user wants me to extract all checklist items related to \"Appeal\" from the legal documents. The current status shows that the Appeal key has been marked as \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the Docket entry 27. The evidence given is the Memorandum Opinion denying the motion for preliminary injunction, which mentions \"Case No. 25-cv-999 and Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Case No. 25-cv-1266.\"\n\nWait, but the checklist item is about appeals taken, including the appealing party and appellate court. The current entry says \"Not Applicable\" because there's no mention of an appeal in the documents. The Docket entry 27 is about a denial of a preliminary injunction, not an appeal. So the system marked it as Not Applicable because there's no appeal mentioned.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any other documents that might have appeal information. The available documents include \"Memorandum Opinion\" and \"Memorandum in Opposition\" which were partially read. The regex search found matches in those documents related to \"appeal\" in the context of legal arguments about jurisdiction and appellate review, but not actual appeals taken.\n\nFor example, in the Memorandum Opinion, there's a mention of \"deference on appeal\" and \"courts have 'latitude' in balancing the factors, and that balancing receives deference on appeal.\" But that's referring to potential future appeals, not an actual appeal that has been taken. Similarly, the Memorandum in Opposition talks about \"exclusive review in the court of appeals\" and \"Thunder Basin framework,\" but again, it's about the legal framework for appeals, not an actual appeal in this case.\n\nThe key point here is that the checklist requires extracting \"any appeals taken,\" meaning actual appeals that have been filed, not just references to appeals in legal arguments. Since the documents only mention potential future appeals (like the court might defer to appellate courts in the future), but no actual appeal has been filed yet, the \"Not Applicable\" is correct.\n\nThe user's current status shows that Appeal is marked as Not Applicable. The task is to extract all checklist items, and the checklist only has one item: Appeal. Since the system has already set it to Not Applicable with evidence from the Docket, and the other documents don't contain any actual appeal information, there's nothing more to extract.\n\nThe available documents that are unvisited (like Complaint, Amended Complaint, etc.) probably don't contain appeal information either, since appeals typically happen after a trial or lower court decision, and the current case is still in the preliminary injunction phase. The denial of the preliminary injunction (Docket 27) is a lower court decision, so an appeal might be possible, but the documents don't mention any appeal being filed yet.\n\nTherefore, all required checklist items are already handled.
