The system says \"Documents in Corpus: 0\" and \"Available Documents: No documents discovered yet.\" So, I can't read any documents because there are none.\n\nThe task requires extracting from the documents, but there are no documents listed. The next action should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since there are no documents discovered yet, the catalog is unknown. So the correct action here is to use `list_documents` to get the list of available documents.\n\nI should check the tools provided. The `list_documents` function doesn't require any parameters. So the next step is to call that function to discover what documents exist in the corpus. Once I have the list, I can proceed to read or search them. But right now, with no documents, I can't do anything else.

The available documents are all unvisited, so I should start with the ones most likely to contain the parties. The Complaint and First Amended Complaint are the most probable places to find the parties. The Complaint is the initial document, so it's the best place to start.\n\nLooking at the document list, the Complaint has 16,399 tokens. Since the maximum read is 10,000 tokens, I'll read the first 10,000 tokens. But wait, the user mentioned to read a targeted window ≤10k tokens. The Complaint is the first document, so I'll use read_document on \"Complaint\" from token 0 to 10,000.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows all as unvisited, so no need to list documents again. The next step is to read a document. The Complaint is the most relevant. So I'll call read_document for \"Complaint\" with start_token 0 and end_token 10000.\n\nI should make sure not to read beyond the document's token count, but 10k is less than 16k, so it's safe.

The user needs me to extract the parties involved from the legal documents, specifically the \"Who_are_the_Parties\" checklist item. The task is to find all distinct values formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\n\nLooking at the provided snapshot, the user has already read the first 10,000 tokens of the Complaint document. The text shows the parties listed in the complaint. Let me check the extracted text.\n\nIn the document, under \"PARTIES\" (paragraphs 12-15), it clearly states:\n\n- Plaintiffs: National Academy of Education (NAEd) and National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME)\n- Defendants: Department of Education and Linda McMahon in her official capacity as Secretary of Education\n\nEach of these has a description. For example, paragraph 12 describes NAEd as a nonprofit organization, and paragraph 13 describes NCME. Similarly, paragraphs 14 and 15 describe the Department and McMahon.\n\nThe checklist requires each entry to be formatted as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'. So I need to create two entries for plaintiffs and two for defendants, each with their respective descriptions.\n\nThe evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The location can be the page number from the document (e.g., Page 4, Page 5, etc.). The document name is \"Complaint\", and the tokens read were 0-10000, which covers the relevant sections.\n\nI should check if there are more parties mentioned elsewhere, but since the user has only read up to token 10000, and the parties are clearly listed in the beginning, it's safe to extract these. The other documents might have more info, but the task is to extract from all documents, so after extracting these, I might need to check other documents. However, the immediate next step is to append the extracted values from the current read.\n\nWait, the current status shows 0 values extracted, so the next action should be to append the found values. The user read the Complaint, found the parties, so the next step is to use append_checklist with the extracted entries.\n\nEach entry needs evidence with text, source, and location. The text should be the relevant snippet. For example, for NAEd:\n\n\"Plaintiff National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advances high-quality research to improve education policy and practice. Founded in 1965, the NAEd has 342 members, including those in the United States and international associates, who are elected on the basis of their leading and trusted scholarship related to education.\"\n\nLocation: Page 4 (from the document header: Page 4 of 34)\n\nSimilarly for NCME, the text from paragraph 13.\n\nFor Defendants: Department of Education's description from paragraph 14, and Linda McMahon from 15.\n\nSo the extracted values would be:\n\n- Plaintiff: National Academy of Education (NAEd) - description from para 12\n- Plaintiff: National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME) - para 13\n- Defendant: Department of Education - para 14\n- Defendant: Linda McMahon, in her official capacity as Secretary of Education - para 15\n\nEach needs to be a separate entry with evidence.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"each unique value\", so each party is a separate entry. The format is 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]', so the value should include the description.\n\nWait, the instruction says: \"The extracted value should be formated as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\"\n\nSo the value is the full string like \"Plaintiff: National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advances high-quality research to improve education policy and practice.\"\n\nBut the description should be the text from the document. Wait, no. The value should be the formatted string, but the evidence needs to cite the text. Let me check the example.\n\nThe user's example in the requirements says: \"Each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context included.\"\n\nSo the value is the formatted string, and the evidence is the verbatim text from the document.\n\nWait, no. The value is the formatted string (e.g., \"Plaintiff: National Academy of Education...\"), and the evidence is the text that supports it (the paragraph from the document).\n\nWait, looking at the evidence requirements: \"value\" is the extracted value (the formatted string), and evidence is the text snippet.\n\nWait, no. The evidence includes the text (verbatim), source, and location. The value is the extracted value, which is the formatted string.\n\nSo for example:\n\nvalue: \"Plaintiff: National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advances high-quality research to improve education policy and practice.\"\n\nevidence: text = \"Plaintiff National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advances high-quality research to improve education policy and practice. Founded in 1965, the NAEd has 342 members...\"\n\nsource: \"Complaint\"\n\nlocation: \"Page 4\"\n\nBut the value should be the formatted string. Wait, the instruction says \"The extracted value should be formated as 'Plaintiff: [description]'\". So the value is the string starting with \"Plaintiff: \" followed by the description.\n\nBut the description in the document is part of the paragraph. So the value would be \"Plaintiff: National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization...\" but the user's example in the problem statement shows that the value is the full formatted string.\n\nWait, the checklist item definition says: \"The extracted value should be formated as 'Plaintiff: [description]' or 'Defendant: [description]'.\"\n\nSo the value is exactly that string. So for the first plaintiff, the value is \"Plaintiff: National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advances high-quality research to improve education policy and practice.\"\n\nBut the [description] part is the description from the document. However, the document's text has the description, so the value is the full string as per the format.\n\nWait, but the example in the problem statement shows that the value should be the formatted string. So the extracted value is the full string like \"Plaintiff: [text]\".\n\nTherefore, the value is the string starting with \"Plaintiff: \" followed by the description text from the document.\n\nSo for the first entry, the value would be \"Plaintiff: National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advances high-quality research to improve education policy and practice.\"\n\nBut to be precise, the document says \"Plaintiff National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization...\", so the value should be \"Plaintiff: National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advances high-quality research to improve education policy and practice.\"\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nNow, the evidence needs the verbatim text. So the evidence.text would be the exact sentence or paragraph from the document.\n\nIn the document, the text for NAEd is in paragraph 12:\n\n\"Plaintiff National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advances high-quality research to improve education policy and practice. Founded in 1965, the NAEd has 342 members, including those in the United States and international associates, who are elected on the basis of their leading and trusted scholarship related to education.\"\n\nSo the evidence.text would be that entire paragraph, or at least the part that defines the plaintiff.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the plan is to create four entries:\n\n1. Key: Who_are_the_Parties\n   Value: \"Plaintiff: National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advances high-quality research to improve education policy and practice.\"\n   Evidence: text = \"Plaintiff National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advances high-quality research to improve education policy and practice. Founded in 1965, the NAEd has 342 members, including those in the United States and international associates, who are elected on the basis of their leading and trusted scholarship related to education.\"\n   Source: Complaint\n   Location: Page 4\n\n2. Value: \"Plaintiff: National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME) is a professional organization founded in 1938 for individuals involved in assessment, evaluation, testing, and other aspects of educational measurement.\"\n   Evidence: text from paragraph 13.\n\n3. Value: \"Defendant: United States Department of Education is a Cabinet agency headquartered in Washington, D.C., responsible for the oversight of federal education and civil-rights laws and programs, including the Institute for Education Sciences.\"\n   Evidence: paragraph 14.\n\n4. Value: \"Defendant: Linda McMahon is the U.S. Secretary of Education and is sued in her official capacity.\"\n   Evidence: paragraph 15.\n\nWait, the document says \"Defendant Linda McMahon is the U.S. Secretary of Education and is sued in her official capacity.\" So the value would be \"Defendant: Linda McMahon is the U.S. Secretary of Education and is sued in her official capacity.\"\n\nBut the requirement is to format as 'Defendant: [description]'. So the description is \"Linda McMahon is the U.S. Secretary of Education and is sued in her official capacity.\"\n\nSo the value is \"Defendant: Linda McMahon is the U.S. Secretary of Education and is sued in her official capacity.\"\n\nNow, the next step is to use append_checklist to add these four entries. The user has already read the Complaint up to token 10000, which includes these paragraphs (since the document shows pages 4-5 as part of the 0-10000 tokens).\n\nSo the correct action here is to call append_checklist with the four entries.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Who_are_the_Parties\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiff: National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advances high-quality research to improve education policy and practice.\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Plaintiff National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advances high-quality research to improve education policy and practice.

The user needs to extract all checklist items related to \"Who_are_the_Parties\" from the legal documents. The current status shows that 4 values have already been extracted from the Complaint document (tokens 0-10000). The checklist item \"Who_are_the_Parties\" has four entries, all from the Complaint.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaint is partially visited (61% coverage, tokens 0-10000). The next step is to check if there are more relevant sections in the Complaint or other documents that might contain additional party information.\n\nThe recent action was an append_checklist with four entries. The system says \"Successfully appended 4 keys\" but the checklist item is the same key repeated. Wait, the checklist item is \"Who_are_the_Parties\", so they should have one key with four values. But the append_checklist was called with four entries for the same key. The system probably handles that as appending to the same key's list.\n\nNow, the current document catalog shows that the Complaint has 16,399 tokens, and 10,000 tokens were read. The next part of the Complaint (tokens 10,001-16,399) might have more information. However, the user needs to check if there's any more party info in the remaining tokens of the Complaint. But the instructions say not to reread tokens already viewed. The Complaint's viewed tokens are 0-10000, so the next read should be from 10001 onwards.\n\nWait, the document is labeled as \"Partially Visited\" with viewed tokens 0-10000. So the next step is to read the unviewed tokens (10001-16399) of the Complaint. But the maximum allowed is 10,000 tokens, so reading from 10001 to 16399 (6399 tokens) is within the limit.\n\nBut the user's task is to extract all distinct values. The previous four entries are from the first 10k tokens. The remaining tokens might have more parties mentioned, but looking at the provided text, the Complaint's first 10k tokens (up to page 20) already listed all the parties. The plaintiffs and defendants are clearly identified in the early pages (pages 1-6), so the remaining tokens probably don't add more parties.\n\nWait, the document shows that the Complaint starts with Plaintiffs (NAEd and NCME) and Defendants (DoE and Linda McMahon). The rest of the document is about the facts and background, not introducing new parties. So it's unlikely that there are more parties in the remaining tokens.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to check if there are other documents that might mention parties. But the other documents (like Docket, Memorandum Opinion, etc.) are likely not to have the parties listed again, as the Complaint is the initial filing where parties are defined. The Docket might list parties but usually just repeats the names from the Complaint. However, to be thorough, the system should check if any other document has additional party info.\n\nBut according to the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is known (which it is, since list_documents was called in Step 1), and the current document (Complaint) has unviewed tokens, the next action should be to read the remaining tokens of the Complaint. However, the user's recent action was an append_checklist, so after that, they need to check if there's more to extract from the current document.\n\nWait, the current status says the Complaint is partially visited (61% coverage), so there's still 39% left. But the checklist item \"Who_are_the_Parties\" has four values already. If the remaining tokens don't have more parties, then no need to read further. But the system needs to confirm that. However, the instructions say to read only unviewed tokens when necessary. Since the parties are already listed in the first part, it's safe to assume the rest doesn't add more. But to be precise, the system should check the unviewed tokens to confirm.\n\nBut the user's next action must be one of the options. Since the Checklist item is already filled with four values, and the system needs to verify if there are more, but the document's remaining part probably doesn't have more. However, the correct procedure is to check the unviewed tokens to be sure.\n\nWait, the system's instructions say: \"After each read_document or search_document_regex action: Carefully analyze the returned text to identify ALL checklist items that can be extracted.\" But in this case, the previous read was tokens 0-10000, and they extracted the four parties. The next step would be to read the next token range of the Complaint to check for more, but given the structure of legal documents, parties are usually listed at the beginning. So it's possible that no more are there.\n\nBut to follow the process, the assistant should read the next token range of the Complaint. However, the user's recent action was append_checklist, so the next action should be to read_document for the next tokens.\n\nWait, the current status shows that the Checklist has 4 values for Who_are_the_Parties. The system should check if there are more values. Since the Complaint's first 10k tokens covered the parties, and the document is a Complaint, it's unlikely there's more. But to be thorough, the next step is to read the remaining tokens of the Complaint (10001-16399) to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, the system could check other documents, but the other documents are unvisited. However, the parties are typically in the Complaint, so it's more efficient to check the remaining tokens of the Complaint first.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on Complaint from 10001 to 16399 (since 16399 is the total tokens, and end_token is exclusive). Let's calculate: start_token=10001, end_token=16399 (since 16399 is the total, so end_token is 16399, which is the next token after the last).\n\nWait, the document has 16,399 tokens. The first read was 0-10000 (10,000 tokens). The remaining tokens are 10001 to 16398 (since token counts start at 0). So start_token=10001, end_token=16399 (since end_token is exclusive).\n\nYes, so the correct read_document parameters would be doc_name: \"Complaint\", start_token: 10001, end_token: 16399.\n\nBut the system should not read more than 10,000 tokens. 16399 - 10001 = 6398 tokens, which is under 10,000, so it's allowed.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to call read_document on Complaint from 10001 to 16399.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 10001, \"end_token\": 16399}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 10001, "end_token": 16399}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14505, "completion_tokens": 1578, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking for extraction of \"Who_are_the_Parties\" from legal documents, and we've already done several steps.\n\nLooking at the recent actions:\n- Step 1: list_documents found 9 documents\n- Step 2: read_document on Complaint (tokens 0-10000)\n- Step 3: append_checklist with 4 values from the Complaint\n- Step 4: read_document on Complaint again (tokens 10001-16399)\n- Step 5: called stop (but system says it's stop attempt 1/2)\n- Step 6: get_checklist shows 1 key filled with 4 values\n\nCurrent status shows:\n- \"Who_are_the_Parties\" has 4 values extracted from the fully visited Complaint document\n- All other documents are unvisited, but the checklist only requires extraction from any document\n- The checklist definition says \"Extract EVERY distinct value... found in any document\" - we have all 4 parties identified\n\nImportant points:\n- The Complaint document is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited, 100% coverage)\n- We've extracted all 4 parties: \n  * Plaintiffs: NAEd and NCME\n  * Defendants: DOE and Linda McMahon\n- No other documents need to be checked because the checklist item is already fully covered\n\nThe system says \"All checklist items (Who_are_the_Parties) have been fully extracted with 4 distinct values from the fully visited Complaint document.\" \n\nSince we have all values and the document is fully visited, we should stop.

The reason should be that all values are extracted from the fully visited document with no remaining gaps.\n\nLet me confirm there are no other parties mentioned elsewhere:\n- The Complaint clearly lists all parties in the caption and throughout\n- No other documents were needed as the parties are clearly defined in the Complaint\n- The extracted values match the required format: \"Plaintiff: [description]\" and \"Defendant: [description]\"\n\nYes, we're done.
