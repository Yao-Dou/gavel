Since the system says \"No documents discovered yet,\" the next logical action should be to list the documents. The available tools include `list_documents`, which is meant to return all documents with their metadata when the catalog is unknown.\n\nLooking at the decision policy, if the document catalog is unknown, the correct action is to call `list_documents`. The user's current state mentions \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" so they haven't found any documents yet. Therefore, I shouldn't try to read or search anything without knowing what documents exist. The only valid first step is to list the documents to get the catalog started.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not making any assumptions here. The snapshot says \"No documents discovered yet,\" so the catalog is unknown. The policy clearly states to use `list_documents` in that case. There's no point in trying to read a document that isn't in the catalog yet. So the correct action here is to call `list_documents` with no parameters since it doesn't require any.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3090, "completion_tokens": 287, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract trial information from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Trials\", and it's currently empty.

The Memorandum Opinion and Orders could mention trial outcomes. The motions might reference trial schedules, like a motion to stay proceedings.\n\nThe Docket is a good starting point because dockets often list court events, including trial dates. The Docket document is 5,146 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing with read_document. Since it's unvisited, I'll read the entire document to check for any trial mentions.\n\nI should use read_document on the Docket. The parameters would be doc_name \"Docket\", start_token 0, end_token 5146. That's within the 10k limit. Checking the other documents, the Memorandum Opinion is 15k tokens, which is over 10k, so I can't read it all at once. But the Docket is small enough.\n\nSo the next action is to read the Docket document. That should give me the most relevant info for trial scheduling or proceedings. If there's nothing there, I can move to other documents like the Memorandum Opinion or Orders.

The user needs me to extract all checklist items related to \"Trials\" from the legal documents provided. The current status shows that the \"Trials\" key is empty, and there are 9 documents in total. The Docket document has already been fully read (tokens 0-5146), but the other documents are unvisited.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the Docket contains any trial-related information. The Docket entries listed include events like motions, hearings, and orders. Looking through the Docket entries, I see entry 17 mentions a \"Preliminary Injunction hearing on May 16, 2025 at 9:30 a.m.\" and entry 25 is a transcript of that hearing. Entry 27 and 28 mention the denial of the motion for preliminary injunction. \n\nThe checklist item \"Trials\" should include scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and related rulings. The hearing date (May 16, 2025) is a key scheduling detail. The transcript (entry 25) is evidence of the proceeding. The denial of the motion (entries 27 and 28) is part of the outcome. \n\nSince the Docket has been fully read, I need to extract these details. Each of these points should be a separate entry in the \"Trials\" checklist. The evidence must include the verbatim text, source document, and location. \n\nFor the hearing date: The text says \"MINUTE ORDER: The parties are ORDERED to appear for a Preliminary Injunction hearing on May 16, 2025 at 9:30 a.m.\" So the evidence would be that line, from the Docket document, location as the minute order entry. \n\nFor the transcript: Entry 25's description mentions the transcript of the hearing, so that's another entry with the transcript details. \n\nFor the denial: Entries 27 and 28 state the denial of the motion, so that's the outcome. \n\nI need to make sure each extracted value has the required evidence. Since the Docket is fully visited, I can't read it again, so the next step is to append these findings using append_checklist. The checklist key is \"Trials\", and each entry should have the value, evidence with text, source, and location.\n\nWait, the Docket is the source document for all these entries. The location for each would be the specific entry number in the Docket. For example, the hearing date is in entry 17 (the minute order), the transcript is entry 25, and the denial is in entries 27 and 28. But the checklist item is \"Trials\", so each of these points (hearing date, transcript, denial) should be separate entries under Trials.\n\nSo, the extracted values would be:\n\n1. Hearing scheduled for May 16, 2025 at 9:30 a.m.\n2. Transcript of the hearing (May 16, 2025) filed on May 21, 2025.\n3. Denial of the preliminary injunction motion (Order dated June 3, 2025).\n\nEach needs evidence. For example, the first one's evidence text would be \"MINUTE ORDER: The parties are ORDERED to appear for a Preliminary Injunction hearing on May 16, 2025 at 9:30 a.m.\" from Docket, location \"Docket entry 17\".\n\nSimilarly, the transcript entry's evidence is \"TRANSCRIPT OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION HEARING before Judge Trevor N. McFadden held on May 16, 2025; Page Numbers: 1-89.\" from Docket entry 25.\n\nThe denial's evidence is \"MEMORANDUM OPINION DENYING Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Case No. 25-cv-999 and Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Case No. 25-cv-1266. See attached Opinion for details.\" from Docket entry 27.\n\nSo, I should use append_checklist to add these three entries to the Trials key. Each entry in the extracted array must have the value and evidence. The evidence array for each entry has the text, source document (Docket), and location (e.g., \"Docket entry 17\").\n\nWait, the Docket is the document name, so source_document is \"Docket\". The location can be the entry number, like \"Docket entry 17\" or \"MINUTE ORDER for hearing on May 16, 2025\".\n\nCheck the required fields for evidence: text (verbatim), source_document, location. So for each, I'll format it correctly.\n\nNow, the current status shows 0 values extracted for Trials. So I need to append these three entries. Since the Docket has been fully read, and these are all in the Docket, I can proceed to append them. The next action should be append_checklist with the three entries.\n\nI should verify if there are more trial-related items in other documents, but since the Docket is the only one read so far, and the others are unvisited, but the checklist might not need more. However, the instructions say to extract all distinct values from any document. But since the Docket already has the hearing, transcript, and denial, which are all part of the trial process, these are the key points. The other documents like the Memorandum Opinion might have more details, but the Docket already captures the scheduling and outcomes. However, the user's task is to extract from all documents, but the Docket is the only one read. Wait, the Docket is fully visited, so the next step is to process the information from the Docket into the checklist. So the correct action here is to append the extracted values from the Docket to the Trials key.\n\nSo the next action is append_checklist with the three entries. The function call should have the patch with key \"Trials\" and the extracted array containing the three entries with their evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Trials\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Preliminary Injunction hearing scheduled for May 16, 2025 at 9:30 a.m.\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"MINUTE ORDER: The parties are ORDERED to appear for a Preliminary Injunction hearing on May 16, 2025 at 9:30 a.m. The Government will file its opposition to Plaintiffs' 14 Motion for Preliminary Injunction by May 9, 2025.

The task is to extract all checklist items related to Trials from the legal documents. The user has already done steps 1-3, and now they're at step 4. The current status shows that they've extracted 3 values for Trials from the Docket document, which is fully visited. The available documents include several others that haven't been read yet, like the Complaint, Amended Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there are any other documents that might contain additional trial information. The Docket is fully visited, so no need to read that again. The other documents are unvisited, so maybe they have more details about the trial proceedings, outcomes, or related rulings.\n\nThe checklist item is \"Trials: Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" The existing extracted values are about the preliminary injunction hearing, the transcript, and the denial of the motion. But maybe other documents like the Memorandum Opinion (which is listed as \"Memorandum Opinion\" [Order/Opinion] - 15,044 tokens) might have more details on the trial outcome or related rulings. The Order document (1,046 tokens) might also contain the final order.\n\nWait, the user already has the denial from Docket entry 27 and 28. The Memorandum Opinion (Docket 27) says \"MEMORANDUM OPINION DENYING Plaintiffs' 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction...\" So maybe the actual opinion document (the Memorandum Opinion file) has more detailed information. The Docket entry refers to the attached opinion, so the actual document might have more context.\n\nAlso, the \"Defendants' Motion to Stay Proceedings\" and other motions might have related information. But the main trial-related info so far is about the preliminary injunction hearing. However, the checklist says \"any trials,\" which could include other proceedings. But in this case, the only trial mentioned so far is the preliminary injunction hearing.\n\nWait, the user's extracted values are all from the Docket. The Docket is a record of events, but the actual legal documents (like the Memorandum Opinion) might have more detailed information. For example, the Memorandum Opinion might have the court's reasoning, which could be considered part of the trial proceedings.\n\nSo, the next step should be to read the Memorandum Opinion document to see if it contains additional trial information. The document is listed as \"Memorandum Opinion\" [Order/Opinion] with 15,044 tokens. Since it's unvisited, I should use read_document to access it. But I need to make sure I'm not reading the entire document at once if it's over 10k tokens. Wait, 15k is over 10k, so I need to read a portion. But the user's policy says to read up to 10k tokens per call. So I'll start with the first 10k tokens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe search_document_regex to look for specific terms like \"trial,\" \"hearing,\" \"denial,\" etc., but since the user has a specific document type (Memorandum Opinion) that's likely to have the detailed opinion, it's better to read it directly. The document name is \"Memorandum Opinion\" [Order/Opinion], so the doc_name should be \"Memorandum Opinion\".\n\nWait, the available documents list the name as \"Memorandum Opinion\" [Order/Opinion], so the doc_name is \"Memorandum Opinion\". The token count is 15,044, so I'll read from 0 to 10,000 tokens first. Then, if needed, read the next part.\n\nThe user's recent actions show that they've already extracted from the Docket, which is fully visited. The next logical step is to check the Memorandum Opinion document for more trial-related info. The other documents like the Complaint might have the initial filing, but the trial details are probably in the opinion or order.\n\nSo the correct action here is to call read_document on \"Memorandum Opinion\" with start_token 0 and end_token 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Opinion\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Opinion", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9043, "completion_tokens": 924, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The Memorandum Opinion was read up to token 10000, but the document is 15,044 tokens long, so there's still 5,044 tokens left unviewed. However, the checklist item \"Trials\" is about information on trials, scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and related rulings.\n\nLooking at the Memorandum Opinion text provided (up to token 10000), the document is a court opinion denying the preliminary injunction. The opinion mentions the hearing on May 16, 2025, and the denial on June 3, 2025. But the user already extracted these details from the Docket entries (Docket entries 17, 25, 27). The Docket entry 17 had the minute order for the hearing, 25 the transcript, and 27 the denial. So the Memorandum Opinion itself might not add new trial-related information beyond what's already in the Docket.\n\nThe user's current extraction has 3 values for Trials, all from the Docket. The Memorandum Opinion is being read, but the text provided doesn't seem to contain any additional trial information that's not already covered. The opinion discusses the case's background and the court's decision but doesn't add new scheduling or procedural details beyond what's in the Docket.\n\nThe available documents include other files like Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Motion for Preliminary Injunction, etc. However, the checklist item is specifically about trials (scheduling, proceedings, outcomes). The Docket already captured the hearing date, transcript, and denial. The other documents might have more details, but the user's process requires checking if the current read (Memorandum Opinion) has new info.\n\nWait, the Memorandum Opinion's text starts with \"Case 1:25-cv-00999-TNM Document 25 Filed 06/03/25 Page 1 of 27\" and discusses the denial of the preliminary injunction. The Docket entry 27 and 28 already mention the denial, so the opinion's content is the same as the Docket's summary. Therefore, reading more of the Memorandum Opinion might not yield new trial information.\n\nThe user's next step should be to check if there are any other documents that might have additional trial-related info. But the current state shows that the Trials key has 3 values, and the checklist summary shows all keys are filled. Wait, the Current Status says:\n\n- Keys with Values: 1/1\n- Empty Keys: 0/1\n- Not Applicable: 0/1\n- Total Values Extracted: 3\n\nSo the only checklist key is \"Trials\", which has 3 values. The system should stop once all keys are filled. Since all values are already extracted, there's no need to read more documents. The user has already appended the 3 values from the Docket, and the Memorandum Opinion read didn't add anything new.\n\nWait, but the Memorandum Opinion was read partially, but the extracted values were already from the Docket.
