The user needs me to extract all checklist items related to \"Appeal\" from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus, and the checklist item \"Appeal\" is empty.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why there are no documents. The available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So the first step should be to list the documents to see what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known yet. \n\nLooking at the tools provided, `list_documents` is the right function to use here. It will return all documents with their metadata. Without knowing what documents exist, I can't proceed to read or search them. So the next action must be to call `list_documents` to get the list of available documents. There's no point in trying to read or search without knowing what documents are present. The other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing the document names, which we don't have yet. So the correct first step is definitely `list_documents`.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3111, "completion_tokens": 257, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract all appeal information from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Appeal\", which requires the appealing parties and the appellate court, formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nFirst, I should check which documents are most likely to contain this information. The documents listed are Complaint, Docket, Omnibus Order, two Orders, a Motion to Stay, and an Untitled Document. \n\nThe Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal seems directly relevant because it mentions \"Pending Appeal,\" so that's a strong candidate. The Docket might have appeal-related entries too. The Omnibus Order could also have court orders related to appeals.\n\nSince the catalog is known (7 documents), I don't need to call list_documents again. The next step is to search for the term \"appeal\" or \"appealed\" to find relevant sections. Using search_document_regex would be efficient here. The pattern should be something like \"appeal\" or \"appealed\" to catch variations. Let's use a regex pattern that matches \"appeal\" with possible variations, maybe case-insensitive.\n\nWait, the instructions say to use precise, anchored patterns. So maybe \"appeal\" or \"appealed\" but not too broad. The Motion to Stay document is titled with \"Pending Appeal,\" so searching for \"appeal\" in that document might be best. But the user might need to search all documents first to find where it's mentioned.\n\nThe available documents include \"Motion to Stay... Pending Appeal,\" which is a good sign. So the regex should look for \"appeal\" in all documents. Let's set doc_name to 'all' and pattern to 'appeal' with IGNORECASE flag. Top_k=5, context_tokens=200. That should give the top matches where \"appeal\" appears, which would likely include the relevant parts.\n\nSo the next action is to call search_document_regex with pattern 'appeal', doc_name='all', flags=['IGNORECASE'], top_k=5, context_tokens=200. This will help identify where the appeal information is located without reading the whole documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"appeal\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"], \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "appeal", "doc_name": "all", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3325, "completion_tokens": 501, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Appeal\" checklist item from the legal documents. The checklist requires extracting every distinct value formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nFirst, I should check the recent actions. They already did a `search_document_regex` on all documents with the pattern \"appeal\" and found 15 matches across three document types: Docket, Motion to Stay..., and Untitled Document. The matches are in specific token ranges.\n\nLooking at the Docket matches, especially Match 2 and Match 4-5, there's mention of \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal\" by Kevin Guthrie, and \"Transmission of Notice of Appeal... to US Court of Appeals.\" So the parties here are Kevin Guthrie as the appellant, and the court is the US Court of Appeals (Eleventh Circuit, based on other documents).\n\nIn the Motion to Stay document, there's a case number \"No. 25-12873\" and \"In the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\" with parties \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC., ET AL.\" as Plaintiffs-Appellees and \"EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT\" as Defendant-Appellant. So the appeal here is by the Defendant-Appellant (FDEM) to the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nThe Untitled Document (Document: 20) also references the same case, \"No. 25-12873,\" and mentions \"Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\" The parties here are \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY\" as Plaintiffs/Appellants and \"KRISTI NOEM, et al.\" as Defendants/Appellees. So the appeal is by the Plaintiffs/Appellants (Friends of the Everglades, etc.) to the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nWait, but the checklist says to format as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].' So for each distinct appeal, I need to note the parties who appealed and the court.\n\nFrom the Docket entries, Kevin Guthrie filed an interlocutory appeal, so the appeal is by Kevin Guthrie to the US Court of Appeals (Eleventh Circuit). The Motion and Untitled documents refer to the same case (25-12873) where FDEM is the appellant (Defendant-Appellant) in the first case, and Friends of the Everglades is the appellant in the second case. Wait, but the case numbers might be different. Wait, the Motion to Stay has case number 25-12873, and the Untitled Document (Document: 20) also has 25-12873. Wait, the Docket entries mention \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal re 131 Order by Kevin Guthrie\" and \"Transmission... to US Court of Appeals re 132 Notice of Interlocutory Appeal.\" But the Motion and Untitled documents are about a different case? Wait, no, the Motion to Stay is for case 25-12873, which is the same as the Untitled Document (Document 20). The Docket entries might be part of the district court docket leading up to the appeal.\n\nWait, the Docket entries (Matches 2-5) mention \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal\" filed by Kevin Guthrie, and then the Motion to Stay and Untitled Document are part of the appellate court filings. So the appeal in the Motion and Untitled documents is the same as the one mentioned in the Docket. Wait, but the Docket says \"Transmission of Notice of Appeal... to US Court of Appeals re 132 Notice of Interlocutory Appeal.\" So the appeal is being transmitted to the Eleventh Circuit, which matches the Motion and Untitled documents which are from the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nSo the key is that there's an appeal to the Eleventh Circuit. The parties in the appellate case are:\n\n- For the Motion/Untitled documents: Plaintiffs-Appellees (Friends of the Everglades, etc.) vs. Defendant-Appellant (FDEM) in the first case, but wait, the Motion to Stay is filed by the Defendant-Appellant (FDEM) to stay the injunction pending appeal. Wait, the case is \"FOE v. FDEM\" with FDEM as the defendant appealing, so they are the appellant. The Untitled Document (Document 20) shows \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, Plaintiffs/Appellants\" vs. \"KRISTI NOEM, et al., Defendants/Appellees.\" Wait, that's a different case? The case numbers are different: 25-12873 for the first, and the Untitled Document (Document 20) is also 25-12873. Wait, the document says \"USCA11 Case: 25-12873\" for both. So maybe the same case. Wait, the Motion to Stay is Document 11-2, and the Untitled Document is Document 20, both for case 25-12873.\n\nWait, the Docket entries mention \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal re 131 Order by Kevin Guthrie.\" The 131 Order is from the district court. The appeal to the Eleventh Circuit would be from that order. So the appellant is Kevin Guthrie, appealing to the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nIn the Motion to Stay document, the case is \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC., ET AL., Plaintiffs-Appellees\" vs. \"EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Defendant-Appellant.\" So here, FDEM is the appellant (defendant in the district court, appealing the order), so they are the ones who appealed to the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nBut the Docket mentions Kevin Guthrie as the appellant. Maybe Kevin Guthrie is the attorney for FDEM? The Motion to Stay has \"James Uthmeier, Jesse Panuccio\" as attorneys for the defendant (FDEM), so perhaps Kevin Guthrie is the person filing the notice on behalf of FDEM.\n\nSo the appeal is by FDEM (as Defendant-Appellant) to the Eleventh Circuit, and the Docket mentions Kevin Guthrie filing the notice. So the parties appealing are FDEM, and the court is the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nWait, but the checklist requires the parties who are appealing. So for the Motion to Stay document, the Defendant-Appellant is FDEM, so they are appealing. The appeal is to the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nSimilarly, in the Docket, \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal by Kevin Guthrie\" – but Kevin Guthrie is likely the attorney, so the party is FDEM.\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"Appeal: FDEM appealed to US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\" Or more precisely, \"Appeal: EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n\nBut the format should be 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nSo the parties are \"EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT\" (FDEM) and the court is \"United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n\nAlso, from the Untitled Document (Document 20), it's \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, Plaintiffs/Appellants\" – wait, that's a different case? Wait, the case number is 25-12873, same as the Motion to Stay. Wait, the Motion to Stay is Document 11-2, and the Untitled Document is Document 20. The case is the same. But in the Motion to Stay, FDEM is the Defendant-Appellant, and in the Untitled Document, Friends of the Everglades is the Plaintiff/Appellant. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe there are two different appeals? Or maybe the case is being appealed by both sides? Wait, no, in an appeal, only one side appeals. Wait, the Motion to Stay is filed by the defendant (FDEM) to stay the injunction pending appeal, so they are the appellant. The Plaintiffs (Friends of the Everglades) might be the appellees, meaning they don't appeal, but the defendant is appealing. Wait, but the Untitled Document says \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, Plaintiffs/Appellants\" – so they are the ones appealing. That's confusing. Let me check the document.\n\nLooking at the Untitled Document (Document 20) excerpt:\n\n\"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, Plaintiffs/Appellants,\n\nv.\n\nKRISTI NOEM, et al., Defendants/Appellees.\"\n\nSo they are the appellants. But the Motion to Stay document says:\n\n\"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC., ET AL., Plaintiffs-Appellees,\n\nV.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Defendant-Appellant.\"\n\nWait, so in the Motion to Stay, the Plaintiffs-Appellees are Friends of the Everglades, and Defendant-Appellant is FDEM. But in Document 20 (the Untitled Document), the Plaintiffs are Appellants. This is conflicting. Maybe the case number is the same, but it's a different case. Wait, the Motion to Stay is for case 25-12873, and the Untitled Document is also 25-12873. So it's the same case.\n\nWait, perhaps the Motion to Stay is from the defendant (FDEM) appealing the district court's order, and the Plaintiffs (Friends of the Everglades) are the appellees (not appealing). But the Untitled Document (Document 20) is a motion filed by the Plaintiffs (now Appellants) – but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the case name is different. Let me check the case names.\n\nThe Motion to Stay case: \"FOE v. FDEM\" (FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC., ET AL., Plaintiffs-Appellees, V. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Defendant-Appellant).\n\nThe Untitled Document case: \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, Plaintiffs/Appellants, v. KRISTI NOEM, et al., Defendants/Appellees.\"\n\nWait, KRISTI NOEM is the Secretary of Homeland Security, so this might be a different case. But the case number is the same (25-12873). Hmm, maybe a typo, but the user has to go with what's provided.\n\nWait, the Docket mentions \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal re 131 Order by Kevin Guthrie\" and \"Transmission... to US Court of Appeals re 132 Notice of Interlocutory Appeal.\" So the appeal is being transmitted to the Eleventh Circuit, which matches the Motion and Untitled documents being from the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nSo the key is to extract the appeal information from the documents. The main appeal mentioned is to the Eleventh Circuit, with the appellant being the Defendant (FDEM) in the Motion to Stay case, and the Plaintiffs (Friends of the Everglades) are the Appellants in the Untitled Document. Wait, but the checklist says \"appealing party/parties,\" so both instances might be separate appeals? But the case number is the same. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the Motion to Stay is part of the same appeal. The Motion to Stay is filed by the appellant (FDEM) to stay the injunction while the appeal is pending. So the appeal is by FDEM to the Eleventh Circuit. The Untitled Document (Document 20) is a motion filed by the Plaintiffs (who are Appellants in the appeal), but if they're the Plaintiffs in the district court, they would be the appellees on appeal. Wait, no: in the district court, Plaintiffs filed the complaint, so if they are appealing a judgment against them, they would be appellants. But the Motion to Stay says \"Plaintiffs-Appellees,\" meaning they are the appellees (the side being appealed against), so the Defendant (FDEM) is the appellant.\n\nTherefore, the appeal is by FDEM (Defendant-Appellant) to the Eleventh Circuit. The Plaintiffs (Friends of the Everglades) are the appellees, so they are not appealing. The Untitled Document (Document 20) might be a different motion filed by the Plaintiffs (now appellees) in the appellate court, but the appeal itself is by FDEM.\n\nWait, but the Untitled Document's title is \"TIME-SENSITIVE MOTION FOR STAY PENDING APPEAL\" by \"ADAM R.F. GUSTAFSON\" from the U.S. Department of Justice. Wait, the document says \"Counsel for the Federal Defendants\" – so the Federal Defendants (FDEM) are the ones appealing, and the motion is to stay the injunction pending appeal. So the appellant is FDEM.\n\nTherefore, the correct appeal information is: EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (FDEM) appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nAdditionally, the Docket mentions Kevin Guthrie filing the Notice of Appeal, but he's likely the attorney, so the party is FDEM.\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"Appeal: EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n\nNow, the evidence needs to be the verbatim text. From the Motion to Stay document (Match 2), the case name is \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC., ET AL., Plaintiffs-Appellees, V. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Defendant-Appellant.\" So the Defendant-Appellant is the appealing party.\n\nAlso, the court is \"In the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n\nSo the evidence is the text from the Motion to Stay document showing the parties and the court.\n\nThe document name for this is \"Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal and for Administrative Stay\" (since the document type is listed as \"Motion to Stay...\").\n\nThe location is the page where the case name is mentioned, which in Match 2 is tokens 7-207, but the specific line is \"V. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Defendant-Appellant.\"\n\nSo the evidence text would be \"V. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Defendant-Appellant.\"\n\nWait, but the checklist requires the exact format. The value should be \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nSo the parties are \"EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT\" and the court is \"United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n\nSo the value is \"Appeal: EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n\nEvidence: the text from the document, source document, and location.\n\nNow, the Docket entries also mention \"Transmission of Notice of Appeal, Order under appeal, and Docket Sheet to US Court of Appeals re 132 Notice of Interlocutory Appeal\" – so the court is US Court of Appeals (Eleventh Circuit, as per other documents).\n\nBut the Motion to Stay document explicitly states the court as Eleventh Circuit, so that's better evidence.\n\nSo, the next step is to use `append_checklist` to add this extracted value with the evidence.\n\nWait, but the user's recent actions already did a search_document_regex, which found the matches. Now, based on the search results, they have the text to extract from. So the next action should be to append the checklist with the extracted value.\n\nThe checklist key is \"Appeal\", and they need to add the extracted entry.\n\nSo the action should be `append_checklist` with the patch containing the key \"Appeal\" and the extracted value with evidence.\n\nLet me check the evidence requirements: for each value, evidence must include text (verbatim snippet), source_document, and location.\n\nFrom the Motion to Stay document (doc_name: \"Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal and for Administrative Stay\"), the text snippet is \"V. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Defendant-Appellant.\" But the exact line in the document is in Match 2, tokens 7-207. The location can be \"Case header, page 1\" or \"Document header\".\n\nWait, the document's metadata says it's a \"Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal and for Administrative Stay\" document, and the match is in the document's header.\n\nSo the evidence for the value would be:\n\n- text: \"V. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Defendant-Appellant.\"\n\n- source_document: \"Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal and for Administrative Stay\"\n\n- location: \"Document header, page 1\"\n\nBut the tokens were 7-207, but the location can be described as the header.\n\nAlso, the case name in the document says \"On Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida\", so the appellate court is the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nWait, the Motion to Stay document starts with \"In the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\", so that's the court.\n\nSo the value is correct.\n\nNow, check if there's another appeal. The Docket mentions Kevin Guthrie filing a Notice of Appeal, but that's the same appeal. The Untitled Document (Document 20) also refers to the same case, so it's the same appeal. So there's only one appeal to extract.\n\nSo the extracted value is one entry.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to `append_checklist` with the key \"Appeal\" and the extracted entry.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Appeal\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Appeal: EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"V.

{"step": 4, "run_id": "7aa7dbd9-0d40-4213-82a2-ec36807c5e35", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T07:57:51.858823-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking to extract all appeal information from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Appeal\", which needs to be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted one value from the \"Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal and for Administrative Stay\" document. The evidence shows that Defendant-Appellant is EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, and the court is the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nBut the task says to extract EVERY distinct value. The recent actions show they found matches in three document types: Docket (5 matches), Motion to Stay (5 matches), and Untitled Document (5 matches). The current extraction only has one entry from the Motion to Stay. They need to check if there are more appeals mentioned elsewhere.\n\nThe available documents include \"Docket\" which has some matches, but it's only partially visited (viewed tokens 14275-14773). The \"Untitled Document\" has matches but only 0% coverage viewed. The other documents (Complaint, Omnibus Order, etc.) are unvisited.\n\nWait, the Docket matches include a Notice of Interlocutory Appeal by Kevin Guthrie. Let me check the matches. In Docket Match 2, it says \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal re 131 Order by Kevin Guthrie.\" So Kevin Guthrie is the appellant. The court mentioned is US Court of Appeals. But the specific court name might be Eleventh Circuit, as in the other documents. The evidence needs to be verified.\n\nAlso, in the Untitled Document (Document 20), there's a case: \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, Plaintiffs/Appellants, v. KRISTI NOEM, et al., Defendants/Appellees.\" So that's another appeal where Plaintiffs are appealing to the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nThe current extraction only has one entry. They need to check if these other matches provide additional appeal information. The Docket's \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal\" by Kevin Guthrie would be another entry. The Untitled Document shows another appeal with different parties.\n\nThe next step is to read more of the documents to get the full context. The Docket document has a notice of appeal, but the exact court might not be specified in the snippet. However, the Motion to Stay document mentions the Eleventh Circuit. The Untitled Document (Document 20) also refers to the Eleventh Circuit Court.\n\nWait, in the Untitled Document's header, it says \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\". So that's the court. The parties are Plaintiffs/Appellants: FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, Defendants/Appellees: KRISTI NOEM, et al.\n\nSo the second appeal entry should be: \"Appeal: FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n\nBut the current extraction only has the first one. So they need to extract this second value.\n\nThe Docket's Match 2 mentions \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal by Kevin Guthrie\" and \"Transmission of Notice of Appeal... to US Court of Appeals\". But the court name isn't specified here. However, since the Motion to Stay and Untitled Document are from the Eleventh Circuit, it's likely the same. But the evidence needs to have the court name. The Docket snippet doesn't specify the circuit, so maybe it's not sufficient. But the \"Transmission of Notice of Appeal, Order under appeal, and Docket Sheet to US Court of Appeals\" would imply it's going to the Eleventh Circuit as per other documents. However, the exact court name should be verified. But in the Docket's Match 4 and 5, it says \"US Court of Appeals re 132 Notice of Inter\", so maybe the court is Eleventh Circuit as per the other documents.\n\nBut the user needs to extract based on evidence. The Docket's evidence doesn't explicitly say \"Eleventh Circuit\", whereas the Motion to Stay and Untitled Document do. So maybe the Docket's notice is part of the same case, so the court is the same. But to be safe, they should check the Docket document for the court name.\n\nHowever, the Docket document's viewed tokens only cover up to 14773, and the match is at 14573-14773. The snippet shows \"Transmission of Notice of Appeal, Order under appeal, and Docket Sheet to US Court of Appeals re 132 Notice of Inter\". So it's to US Court of Appeals, but the circuit isn't specified here. But since the other documents in the same case (Motion to Stay and Untitled) are Eleventh Circuit, it's probably the same. However, for evidence, they need to have the court name in the document. Since the Docket snippet doesn't have it, maybe it's not sufficient. So the Docket's notice might not provide a separate court name, but the parties (Kevin Guthrie) and the fact that it's an appeal. But the checklist requires the court name. So perhaps the Docket's entry isn't enough to form a complete \"Appeal\" value. The Motion to Stay and Untitled Document have both parties and court.\n\nSo the two distinct appeals are:\n1. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (appellant) to Eleventh Circuit.\n2. FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (appellants) to Eleventh Circuit.\n\nWait, in the Untitled Document, it's \"Plaintiffs/Appellants\" so they are the ones appealing. So the value would be \"Appeal: FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n\nThe current extraction only has the first one. So they need to add the second one.\n\nNow, the Untitled Document (Document 20) has matches at tokens 0-260, 830-1030, 1068-1268. The first match (tokens 0-144) shows the header with the court. So they need to read the Untitled Document to confirm the parties and court.\n\nWait, the Untitled Document's Match 1 (tokens 0-144) has the header: \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\" and \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, Plaintiffs/Appellants, v. KRISTI NOEM, et al., Defendants/Appellees.\"\n\nSo the parties are clearly stated. Therefore, the evidence for the second appeal is in the Untitled Document.\n\nThe current extraction has only one value. They need to append the second value from the Untitled Document.\n\nThe Untitled Document is partially visited (0% coverage), but the first match (tokens 0-144) was viewed. However, the full header is in that match. The token range for Match 1 is 0-144, which includes the header. So they have the evidence from that. Wait, in the snapshot, the Untitled Document's viewed tokens include 0-260 (from Match 1 and 2). So they've already read up to token 260, which includes the header. So the evidence is already available.\n\nWait, the user's Step 3 appended the first value. Now, they need to check if the Untitled Document has another value. The header in the Untitled Document (Match 1) shows the appeal, so that's a separate appeal from the Motion to Stay document.\n\nTherefore, they should append the second value from the Untitled Document.\n\nBut the current action is to decide the next step. The checklist has one key (Appeal) with one value. They need to add the second value.\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist with the new value.\n\nThe evidence for the second value would be from the Untitled Document, header (tokens 0-144), with the text showing Plaintiffs/Appellants and the court name.\n\nSo the value is \"Appeal: FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n\nThe evidence needs to include the text snippet, source document, and location.\n\nThe text snippet from the Untitled Document (Match 1, tokens 0-144) shows:\n\"In the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\nFRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, Plaintiffs/Appellants, \nv. \nKRISTI NOEM, et al., \nDefendants/Appellees.\"\n\nSo the extracted value would be based on that.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append this value.\n\nThey should not use read_document again because the evidence is already in the viewed tokens. The viewed tokens for Untitled Document include 0-260, which covers the header.\n\nWait, the viewed tokens for Untitled Document are 0-260, 830-1030, 1068-1268. The header is in 0-260, so it's already read. So the evidence is available. Therefore, they can append the checklist entry without needing to read more.\n\nSo the correct action is append_checklist with the new entry.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Appeal\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Appeal: FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\\n\\nFRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY,\\nPlaintiffs/Appellants,\\n\\nv.\\n\\nKRISTI NOEM, et al.,\\nDefendants/Appellees.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Untitled Document\",\n                \"location\": \"Document header (tokens 0-144)\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Appeal", "extracted": [{"value": "Appeal: FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.", "evidence": [{"text": "IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\nFRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY,\nPlaintiffs/Appellants,\n\nv.\n\nKRISTI NOEM, et al.,\nDefendants/Appellees.", "source_document": "Untitled Document", "location": "Document header (tokens 0-144)"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7079, "completion_tokens": 2272, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 5, "run_id": "7aa7dbd9-0d40-4213-82a2-ec36807c5e35", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T07:58:20.352868-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user needs me to extract all checklist items for the \"Appeal\" field from the legal documents. From the recent actions, they've already found two entries: one from the \"Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction\" document and another from the \"Untitled Document\". The checklist item requires the format \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nLooking at the current status, the \"Appeal\" key has two values, but I need to check if there are more. The available documents include several unvisited ones: Complaint, Omnibus Order, Order (001), and Order (002). The partially visited documents have some tokens read, but maybe there's more info in the unvisited sections.\n\nWait, the \"Docket\" document was partially read (tokens 14275-14773), which included a notice of interlocutory appeal by Kevin Guthrie. The evidence from Step 3 mentioned that the first value came from the Motion to Stay document, but the Docket entry says \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal by Kevin Guthrie\" and mentions transmission to US Court of Appeals. So maybe there's a third appeal instance here.\n\nAlso, the \"Untitled Document\" (which seems to be part of the appeal case) has another appeal. But the user already extracted two values. Let me check the Docket's Match 2: \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal re 131 Order by Kevin Guthrie.\" The parties here would be Kevin Guthrie (appellant) appealing to the Eleventh Circuit. The court is mentioned as \"US Court of Appeals\" in Match 4 and 5.\n\nWait, the first value from Step 3 was from the Motion to Stay document, where the defendant-appellant is the Executive Director. The second from the Untitled Document is Plaintiffs/Appellants: Friends of the Everglades. But the Docket has Kevin Guthrie as the appellant. So that's a third entry.\n\nThe Docket's tokens 14324-14524 mention \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal re 131 Order by Kevin Guthrie.\" Then Match 4 and 5 mention \"Transmission of Notice of Appeal, Order under appeal, and Docket Sheet to US Court of Appeals re 132 Notice of Interlocutory Appeal.\" So the appeal here is by Kevin Guthrie to the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nSo the third value should be \"Appeal: Kevin Guthrie appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n\nNow, I need to confirm if this is a valid entry. The evidence would be from the Docket document, tokens 14324-14524. The text says \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal by Kevin Guthrie\" and the transmission to the court. So the parties are Kevin Guthrie (appellant), and the court is US Court of Appeals for Eleventh Circuit.\n\nBut the current checklist has only two values. So I need to append this third one. However, the Docket document was partially visited (viewed up to 14773), but the relevant tokens (14324-14524) were already read. Wait, in the recent actions, Step 2's search found those matches, so the text is already available. But the user's Step 3 and 4 only appended two entries. The Docket's match 2 and 4/5 weren't used for the appeal value. So I need to append the third value from the Docket.\n\nWait, the user's Step 3 used Match 2 from Motion to Stay (tokens 7-207) for the first value. Step 4 used the Untitled Document's header. The Docket's matches (1-5) were part of the search results, but the user didn't extract the appeal from the Docket yet. So the third value is missing.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to append the third appeal entry from the Docket. The evidence would be the specific match in the Docket. Let's check the exact text:\n\nMatch 2 (tokens 14324-14524) has \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal re 131 Order by Kevin Guthrie.\"\n\nMatch 4 (tokens 14567-14767) has \"Transmission of Notice of Appeal, Order under appeal, and Docket Sheet to US Court of Appeals re 132 Notice of Interlocutory Appeal.\"\n\nSo the appellant is Kevin Guthrie, court is US Court of Appeals for Eleventh Circuit (as mentioned in the Motion to Stay document, but the Docket's Match 4 says \"US Court of Appeals\" without specifying circuit, but the Motion to Stay refers to Eleventh Circuit. Wait, the Motion to Stay document's header says \"In the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\", and the Docket's transmission is to the same court. So the court is Eleventh Circuit.\n\nThus, the value should be \"Appeal: Kevin Guthrie appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n\nNow, to append this, I need to use append_checklist with the new entry. The evidence would be from the Docket document, tokens 14324-14524 (for the appellant) and Match 4 for the court. But the court is mentioned in the Motion to Stay, but the Docket's transmission says \"US Court of Appeals\", so it's safe to assume it's the Eleventh Circuit based on the context. However, the requirement is to have evidence from the document. The Docket's Match 4 says \"Transmission of Notice of Appeal... to US Court of Appeals\", but the specific circuit isn't stated there. However, the Motion to Stay document (which was read) specifies the Eleventh Circuit. But since the user is supposed to cite evidence from the document where the value is found, the court name should be from the document where the appeal is mentioned. Wait, the Docket is the one mentioning the appeal, so the court should be inferred from the context. But the Docket itself doesn't say \"Eleventh Circuit\", but the Motion to Stay does. Hmm.\n\nWait, the Motion to Stay is a separate document. The Docket is the court's docket. The Docket entry for the notice of appeal would be linked to the appellate court. But the text in the Docket says \"Transmission of Notice of Appeal... to US Court of Appeals\", but the actual appellate court for the district is Eleventh Circuit. Since the case is from Southern District of Florida, the appellate court is Eleventh Circuit. So it's safe to assume it's the Eleventh Circuit. The evidence for the court would be the Motion to Stay document, but the user might need to use the Docket's reference to \"US Court of Appeals\" and the context from other documents. However, the instruction says \"evidence\" must be verbatim from the document. So perhaps the court name is \"United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\" from the Motion to Stay, but the Docket's entry is the one that mentions the appeal. Wait, the Docket's Match 4 says \"Transmission of Notice of Appeal... to US Court of Appeals re 132 Notice of Interlocutory Appeal.\" The \"re 132\" refers to the docket entry number. But the court is the Eleventh Circuit as per the case context.\n\nBut to strictly follow the evidence requirement, the court name should be taken from a document that explicitly states it. The Motion to Stay document's header says \"In the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\", so that's the evidence for the court. The Docket's Match 4 mentions \"US Court of Appeals\", but the specific circuit is in the Motion to Stay. However, the user's previous entries used the Motion to Stay for the court. So for consistency, the court is \"United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\".\n\nTherefore, the third value is \"Appeal: Kevin Guthrie appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\" The evidence for the parties is from the Docket (Match 2), and the court from the Motion to Stay (Match 2). Wait, but the evidence needs to be from the same document? Or can it be from different documents? The requirement says \"evidence\" with source_document, so for the parties (Kevin Guthrie), the source is Docket, and for the court, it's Motion to Stay. But the checklist value should be a single string, so the evidence can include multiple sources. However, the evidence field is an array of evidence objects, each with their own source. So the extracted value would have two evidence entries: one for the appellant from Docket, and one for the court from Motion to Stay.\n\nWait, the checklist item's value is a single string, but the evidence can have multiple entries. So for the new value, the evidence would include:\n\n- From Docket (tokens 14324-14524): \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal re 131 Order by Kevin Guthrie.\" → this shows the appellant is Kevin Guthrie.\n\n- From Motion to Stay (tokens 7-207): \"In the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\" → this shows the court.\n\nBut the user's previous entries used the Motion to Stay for the court. So it's okay to reference that.\n\nTherefore, I need to append this third value. The next action should be append_checklist with this new entry.\n\nWait, but the user's Step 3 and 4 have already appended two values. The current status says 2 values extracted. So the third one is missing. Hence, the correct action is to append the third value from the Docket's Match 2 and the Motion to Stay's header.\n\nSo the append_checklist should have a new entry under Appeal with value \"Appeal: Kevin Guthrie appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\" The evidence would be two parts: the Docket's notice of appeal mentioning Kevin Guthrie, and the Motion to Stay's header mentioning the court.\n\nBut the evidence array in the checklist entry must include the verbatim text, source document, and location. So for the appellant part, evidence is from Docket, tokens 14324-14524, text \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal re 131 Order by Kevin Guthrie.\" For the court, evidence is from Motion to Stay, tokens 7-207, text \"In the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n\nWait, but the Motion to Stay's tokens 7-207 was already used in Step 3 for the first entry. But that's okay; evidence can be reused across entries.\n\nSo the new extracted value's evidence will have two evidence objects.\n\nTherefore, the next action is append_checklist with the new value.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Appeal\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Appeal: Kevin Guthrie appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal re 131 Order by Kevin Guthrie.\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"tokens 14324-14524\"}, {\"text\": \"In the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\", \"source_document\": \"Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal and for Administrative Stay\", \"location\": \"tokens 7-207\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Appeal", "extracted": [{"value": "Appeal: Kevin Guthrie appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.", "evidence": [{"text": "Notice of Interlocutory Appeal re 131 Order by Kevin Guthrie.", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "tokens 14324-14524"}, {"text": "In the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit", "source_document": "Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal and for Administrative Stay", "location": "tokens 7-207"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7248, "completion_tokens": 2466, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract all checklist items for \"Appeal\" from the legal documents. The current status shows that three values have been extracted so far. The checklist item requires each distinct value to be formatted as 'Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].'\n\nLooking at the Recent Actions, Steps 3-5 have already appended three entries. The first one was from the Motion to Stay document, the second from the Untitled Document, and the third from the Docket. The user's task is to make sure all possible distinct appeals are captured.\n\nNow, checking the available documents. The Docket has been partially visited (tokens 14275-14773), but maybe there are more matches in other documents. The other documents like Complaint, Omnibus Order, Order (001), and Order (002) are unvisited. The Motion to Stay and Untitled Document have been partially visited but maybe not fully. The Untitled Document's coverage is listed as 0% even though some tokens were viewed, which might mean the viewed tokens aren't the full document.\n\nWait, the Untitled Document has 137k tokens but only 0% coverage because the viewed tokens are very small ranges. So it's possible that there are more appeals in the remaining parts of that document. Similarly, the Motion to Stay has 3% coverage, so there might be more information there.\n\nThe checklist requires all distinct values. The current extracted values are:\n1. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR... appealed to Eleventh Circuit (from Motion to Stay)\n2. FRIENDS... appealed to Eleventh Circuit (from Untitled)\n3. Kevin Guthrie appealed to Eleventh Circuit (from Docket)\n\nBut maybe there's another appeal in the Complaint or other documents. The Complaint is titled \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction\" – sometimes complaints mention appeals, but usually, appeals come after a trial. However, the Motion to Stay and Docket entries are about appeals, so maybe the Complaint doesn't have an appeal mentioned.\n\nWait, the Motion to Stay document is part of the appellate process, so it's likely that the appeal is already captured. The Docket has the Notice of Interlocutory Appeal by Kevin Guthrie, which is already included. The Untitled Document (which seems to be the appellate brief) has the appeal by Friends of the Everglades.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe the other unvisited documents (Complaint, Omnibus Order, etc.) should be checked. However, the Complaint is likely the initial filing, so it might not mention an appeal. The Omnibus Order might be a lower court order, but if it's an order that's being appealed, maybe the appeal is already captured in the Docket or Motion to Stay.\n\nThe current status shows 3 values, but the user needs to make sure all are extracted. The next step should be to check if there are more matches. Since the document catalog is known (7 documents), and some are unvisited, but the regex search in Step 2 already found 15 matches across 7 documents. However, the matches were in Docket, Motion to Stay, and Untitled Document. The other documents (Complaint, Omnibus Order, etc.) might not have \"appeal\" in their text, but it's possible.\n\nWait, the search was done on all documents with pattern \"appeal\", and found 15 matches. The matches were distributed in those three documents. The other four documents (Complaint, Omnibus Order, Order 001, Order 002) weren't listed in the search results, meaning they didn't have \"appeal\" in the text. So maybe they don't contain any appeal references.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm. The available documents show that Complaint, Omnibus, etc., are unvisited. However, since the regex search didn't find matches in them, it's unlikely they have the keyword. But maybe the regex pattern was too narrow. The pattern was \"appeal\", but maybe the documents use \"Appeal\" with capital A, or \"Appeals\" plural. However, the regex search used \"appeal\" as the pattern, which is case-sensitive unless flags are set. The search parameters didn't specify flags, so it's case-sensitive. So maybe the other documents have \"Appeal\" with capital A, which wasn't caught.\n\nWait, in the search parameters, the flags were default (none), so it's case-sensitive. So \"Appeal\" (capital A) wouldn't match \"appeal\" (lowercase). So the search might have missed some matches. But the user's current step is to extract based on the checklist, which says \"appeal\" as the keyword. However, the actual document might use different capitalization.\n\nBut in the provided matches, the Docket had \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal\" (with capital A), but the regex pattern was \"appeal\", so it's possible that the search didn't catch all. However, in the search results, Match 2 in Docket was \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal\", which would have \"Appeal\" in it. Wait, the pattern was \"appeal\", but the match was found. So maybe the search was case-insensitive by default? Wait, the tool's description says the default flags are empty, so it's case-sensitive. But the search found matches like \"Appeal\" in the text. So maybe the regex engine is case-insensitive by default, or the document had \"appeal\" in lowercase.\n\nWait, the example in the search results shows matches like \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal\" – the word \"Appeal\" is capitalized. But the pattern was \"appeal\", so if the regex is case-sensitive, it wouldn't match. But the search found 15 matches, so probably the regex was case-insensitive. Wait, the user's Step 2 used `search_document_regex` with pattern \"appeal\", and it found matches. So perhaps the tool uses case-insensitive by default, or the pattern was matched in a case-insensitive way. But the documentation says flags can include IGNORECASE, but they weren't specified. So maybe the tool is case-insensitive by default, or the pattern matched regardless of case.\n\nAssuming that the search did capture all instances of \"appeal\" regardless of case, then the other documents (Complaint, etc.) don't have the word \"appeal\" in them, so they probably don't contain appeal information. Therefore, the three extracted values are all that exist.\n\nBut to confirm, maybe check the Complaint document. The Complaint is titled \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction\" – a complaint usually doesn't mention an appeal, since it's the initial filing. The appeal would come after a judgment. So it's unlikely the Complaint has appeal info.\n\nThe Omnibus Order might be a court order that's being appealed, but the Docket already captured the Notice of Appeal by Kevin Guthrie. The Motion to Stay and Untitled Document are part of the appellate process, so they likely contain the appeal details.\n\nGiven that, the three values are probably all. But the user needs to make sure there are no more. The current checklist has 3 values, but maybe there's a fourth. Wait, the Motion to Stay document had two different cases: one where FDEM is the appellant, and another where Friends of the Everglades are appellants. Wait, no, the Motion to Stay was for the FDEM case (No. 25-12873), and the Untitled Document was a different case (Friends of the Everglades v. Noem). Wait, looking at the document headers:\n\n- Motion to Stay: \"FOE v. FDEM\" (Friends of the Everglades vs. Florida Division of Emergency Management)\n- Untitled Document: \"Friends of the Everglades and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, Plaintiffs/Appellants, v. KRISTI NOEM, et al.\"\n\nSo these are two separate cases. The Docket entry was Kevin Guthrie appealing a 131 Order, which is a different case.\n\nSo three distinct appeals. The checklist requires each distinct value. So three values are correct.\n\nBut wait, the current extracted values are:\n\n1. FDEM appealed to Eleventh Circuit\n2. Friends of the Everglades appealed to Eleventh Circuit\n3. Kevin Guthrie appealed to Eleventh Circuit\n\nEach of these is a separate appeal in different cases, so they should be separate entries.\n\nNow, the question is, are there any more? The other documents are unvisited, but the regex search didn't find matches in them, so it's unlikely. The next step should be to use `get_checklist` to verify if all keys are filled. The checklist has only one key, Appeal, and it's already filled with three values. So the next action should be to call `get_checklist` to confirm, and then stop.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say: \"Stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable.\" The current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. But to be thorough, maybe call `get_checklist` to confirm. However, the decision policy says to stop when all are filled. Since the checklist has only one key, and it's filled with three values, it's time to stop.\n\nBut the user's recent actions have been appending the values, and now the checklist is complete. So the next step is to stop.\n\nWait, the current status shows \"Total Values Extracted: 3\", and the checklist item is \"Appeal\" with three values. So all possible values are extracted. Therefore, the correct action is to stop.\n\nBut the user's instructions say that after each append, you should verify. Since the last action was appending the third value, and the checklist is now complete, the next step is to stop.\n\nSo the correct JSON response should be {\"decision\": \"stop\", \"reason\": \"All appeal values extracted: FDEM, Friends of the Everglades, and Kevin Guthrie.\"}\n\nWait, but need to check if the three values are correctly formatted. The required format is \"Appeal: [parties] appealed to [court].\"\n\nThe extracted values:\n\n1. \"Appeal: EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n2. \"Appeal: FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n3. \"Appeal: Kevin Guthrie appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\"\n\nYes, all correctly formatted.

The user is working on extracting appeal information from legal documents. They've already done several steps: listed documents, searched for \"appeal\", and appended three entries for the Appeal checklist item. The current status shows all three values are extracted from different documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there's Docket, Motion to Stay, Untitled Document, and four unvisited documents. The user's recent actions show they've already extracted from Docket (Kevin Guthrie), Motion to Stay (FDEM), and Untitled (Friends of the Everglades). The checklist has three values, all filled.\n\nWait, the system says \"All distinct appeal values extracted\" in step 6. But the current status shows 3 values. The available documents include four that are unvisited: Complaint, Omnibus Order, Order (001), Order (002). Could there be more appeals in those?\n\nThe user's task is to extract EVERY distinct value. The previous steps found three. But maybe the unvisited documents have more. However, the step 6 stop decision was made after finding three. The system's automatic review says \"All distinct appeal values extracted\" and the checklist is 1/1 filled.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Appeal\", and they have three values. The system's current status says 3 values extracted. The documents left unvisited are Complaint, Omnibus Order, Order (001), Order (002). But the user hasn't found any other matches in the regex search. The regex search (step 2) found 15 matches, split across Docket, Motion, and Untitled. The three values they extracted account for those matches.\n\nWait, the regex search found 5 in Docket, 5 in Motion, 5 in Untitled. But in the extracted values, they have one from Docket (Kevin Guthrie), two from Motion (FDEM), and one from Untitled (Friends). Wait, no: step 3 had Motion to Stay, step 4 had Untitled, step 5 had Docket. So that's three values, but the regex matches were 15. Maybe some matches were duplicates or not actual appeals. The user probably considered the three as the distinct appeals.\n\nThe key point is whether there are more distinct appeals in the unvisited documents. The unvisited documents are Complaint, Omnibus Order, etc. But the regex search was done on all documents (step 2), which would have included those. The regex search found 15 matches total, split as 5 Docket, 5 Motion, 5 Untitled. So the unvisited documents (Complaint, etc.) weren't part of those matches. So the regex search didn't find any matches in the unvisited docs, meaning they probably don't have \"appeal\" in them.\n\nTherefore, there are no more appeal values to extract.
