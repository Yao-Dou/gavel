The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet.

The available documents are all unvisited, so the first step is to figure out which document is most likely to contain the relevant information.\n\nThe checklist item is about whether the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs. Typically, the complaint would state this upfront. The \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction\" seems like the best candidate because complaints usually include the type of action (class or individual) in the beginning.\n\nAll documents are unvisited, so I should start by reading the complaint. The complaint is 11,582 tokens, which is under 10,000? Wait, no, 11,582 is more than 10,000. But the read_document function allows up to 10,000 tokens. So I need to read a portion of it. The first part of the complaint is probably where the class action status is mentioned. So I'll set start_token to 0 and end_token to 10,000 to get the first 10k tokens.\n\nI should use read_document for the Complaint document, starting at 0, ending at 10,000. That way, I can check the beginning of the complaint where the class action status is likely stated. Once I read that, I can look for phrases like \"class action\" or \"individual plaintiffs\" and extract the value with evidence.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3355, "completion_tokens": 389, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which requires determining if the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nLooking at the provided document, which is the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction (tokens 0-10000). I need to scan through the text for any mentions of class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nFirst, check the title and parties. The document starts with \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC., a Florida 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation, and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization\" as Plaintiffs. So there are two plaintiffs here, both organizations. \n\nNext, look for any indication of class action. The complaint mentions \"Plaintiffs\" multiple times, but does it specify a class action? The term \"class action\" isn't used in the text provided. However, the plaintiffs are two organizations, not individuals. The checklist requires the value to be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nWait, the plaintiffs are two organizations. But the checklist is about whether they're proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs. A class action typically involves a group of people suing as a class, but here the plaintiffs are organizations. However, the complaint might not be a class action. Let me check for specific phrases.\n\nLooking through the text: \"Plaintiffs seek an injunction and declaratory relief...\" and \"Plaintiffs have filed their Expedited Motion for Temporary Restraining Order...\" No mention of \"class action\" here. The plaintiffs are named as two organizations, so they're acting as individual plaintiffs (i.e., the organizations themselves, not a class of people). \n\nThe checklist definition says \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". Since the plaintiffs are two organizations, the description would be \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC. and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY\". But the format needs to be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nWait, the example says \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". So if it's not a class action, it's individual plaintiffs. Since the plaintiffs are organizations, they're acting as individual plaintiffs (the organizations themselves), not as a class. So the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and Center for Biological Diversity\".\n\nCheck if the document explicitly states it's a class action. The complaint doesn't use the term \"class action\" in the provided text. The parties are listed as the two organizations, so it's individual plaintiffs (the organizations), not a class of individuals. Therefore, the correct entry is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and Center for Biological Diversity\".\n\nNow, evidence: The text states the plaintiffs at the beginning: \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC., a Florida 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation, and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Plaintiffs.\" So the exact text is the parties listed in the complaint.\n\nThe source document is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction\", location is the beginning of the document (Page 1, tokens 0-10000, specifically the party section).\n\nSo, the extracted value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and Center for Biological Diversity\". The evidence includes the verbatim text from the document, source, and location.\n\nSince this is the first value found, I need to use append_checklist to add this entry. The checklist key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the extracted value should be in the correct format.\n\nWait, the checklist requires the value to be formatted as specified. So the value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and Center for Biological Diversity\". The evidence needs to have the text, source, and location.\n\nThe text evidence would be the exact line: \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC., a Florida 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation, and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Plaintiffs.\"\n\nSource: \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction\"\n\nLocation: Page 1, tokens 0-10000 (as per the document's metadata, which says tokens 0-10000 were read).\n\nSo, the append_checklist should have the key \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the extracted array with one entry containing the value and evidence.\n\nCheck if there are other mentions. The document doesn't mention class action, so this is the only value. Since it's the first entry, append is correct.\n\nNow, the next action after reading the document (which was done in Step 2) is to append the checklist entry. The recent actions show that Step 2 was a read_document, so the next step is to append the found value.\n\nTherefore, the correct tool to call is append_checklist with the patch for the key.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and Center for Biological Diversity\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC., a Florida 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation, and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Plaintiffs.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1, tokens 0-10000\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Friends of the Everglades, Inc. and Center for Biological Diversity", "evidence": [{"text": "FRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC., a Florida 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation, and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Plaintiffs.", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction", "location": "Page 1, tokens 0-10000"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13901, "completion_tokens": 1356, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The current extraction shows they're individuals (two organizations), so it's not a class action. The next step is to make sure there are no other documents that might indicate a class action. But the user's task is to extract every distinct value found. The Complaint already has the plaintiffs listed as two organizations, so the value is \"Individual\" with the description. \n\nBut I should check if other documents might have more information.

The other documents are unvisited, so maybe I need to read another document to see if there's another value.\n\nWait, the instruction says to extract every distinct value. If the Complaint says the plaintiffs are two organizations (individuals), then that's one value. If another document says \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", then that would be another value.

The task is to extract every distinct value. Since the Complaint lists the plaintiffs as two organizations, that's the only value found so far. The other documents might not have any other mentions of the plaintiffs' status. For example, the Docket might have the case number but not the plaintiff description. The Orders might not mention the plaintiff structure again.\n\nThe current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning the one key is fully filled. The next step should be to verify if there's any remaining document that might have another value. But the system's instructions say to stop when all keys are filled or Not Applicable.
