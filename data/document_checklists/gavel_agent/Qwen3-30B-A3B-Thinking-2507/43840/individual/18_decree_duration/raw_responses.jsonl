The user needs to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The current status shows no documents discovered yet, and the checklist item \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" is empty.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the next step should be. The available actions include listing documents, reading, searching, etc. Since there are no documents in the corpus (as stated in \"Documents in Corpus: 0\"), the first thing to do is list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Here, the catalog is unknown because there are zero documents listed. So the correct action is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents before proceeding. There's no point in trying to read or search if there are no documents to read from. \n\nI should make sure not to skip this step. The user mentioned \"No documents discovered yet,\" so listing them is necessary. Once the documents are listed, the next step would be to check which ones might contain the decree duration information. But right now, the immediate action is to call `list_documents`.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3150, "completion_tokens": 253, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and they want every distinct value with evidence.\n\nFirst, I should check which documents are most likely to contain this information. The checklist mentions \"formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction.\" So documents like Orders, Opinions, or Settlement Agreements might have this.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there are several \"Order/Opinion\" documents (Order (001) to Order and Opinion (008)), which are probably where the court's decrees would be. Also, the \"Settlement Agreement and Release\" might have terms, but the requirement specifies court-ordered decrees, not just agreements. So maybe focus on the Orders first.\n\nThe \"Docket\" documents might list orders but not contain the full text of the decree duration. The Complaints are probably the initial filings, so less likely to have the decree duration. The Status Update might mention settlement but not the court's decree.\n\nSince the user needs to extract the duration, a regex search might be efficient. The pattern should look for phrases like \"duration,\" \"term,\" \"will last,\" \"injunction,\" \"decree,\" etc. But the exact wording might vary. Maybe use a pattern like \"duration|term|last|period|injunction|decree\" to find relevant sections.\n\nWait, the instructions say to use precise patterns. So maybe look for \"decree\" followed by a duration phrase. For example, \"for a period of [X] years\" or \"continuing until [date].\" But since the exact pattern might not be known, using a regex to search for \"decree\" and then checking the context makes sense.\n\nBut the user's current state shows that the document catalog is known (18 documents), so no need to call list_documents. The next step is to either read a document or search with regex. Since there are many Order documents, using search_document_regex with a pattern like \"decree\" or \"injunction\" would help find relevant sections without reading all documents.\n\nThe pattern should be precise. Let's use \"decree|injunction\" to search across all documents. The top_k can be set to 5, and context_tokens to 200 to get enough context around matches. This will return the top matches with surrounding text, which can then be read to confirm the duration.\n\nSo the next action should be search_document_regex with pattern \"decree|injunction\" across all documents. That way, we can find where these terms appear and then read the specific sections to extract the duration.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"decree|injunction\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "decree|injunction", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3718, "completion_tokens": 608, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot with recent actions and available documents.\n\nFirst, I need to check what's been done so far. The recent actions include a `list_documents` which found 18 documents, and a `search_document_regex` on all documents with the pattern \"decree|injunction\". The search found 17 matches across several documents. The matches are in Docket (002), Findings Of Fact, Order (001), Order (002), and Status Update.\n\nLooking at the current status, all keys are empty except for the one checklist item, which is empty. The documents that have been partially visited include Docket (002), Findings Of Fact, Order (001), Order (002), and Status Update. The other documents are unvisited.\n\nThe checklist item is about the duration of decrees, specifically court-ordered decrees like injunctions, not negotiated agreements. The user needs every distinct value with evidence.\n\nFrom the search results, I need to look for specific durations mentioned in the documents. Let's go through the matches provided.\n\nIn the Docket (002) matches, there's a mention of \"permanent injunction\" but no specific duration. The Findings Of Fact and Conclusions Of Law have several matches. For example, in Match 5 (tokens 19399-19599), it says \"Consequently, the Court hereby enjoins the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court.\" So the duration here is \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court.\" That's a key point.\n\nIn Order (002) Match 2 (tokens 2066-2266), there's \"Consequently, the Court hereby enjoins the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court.\" So the duration here is \"after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved.\"\n\nThe Status Update Regarding Settlement mentions the Court denying a consent decree, but that's not a decree duration, so probably not relevant.\n\nThe Order (001) mentions modifying an injunction under Rule 62(d), but doesn't specify a duration. The other matches don't seem to have explicit durations.\n\nSo the relevant durations are:\n1. \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court\" (from Findings Of Fact, Match 5)\n2. \"after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court\" (from Order (002), Match 2)\n\nWait, the second one specifies \"after the 2024 election cycle\", which adds a time element. So these are two distinct values.\n\nNow, the next step is to extract these values with evidence. The user needs to append these to the checklist. Since these values were found in the search results, but the documents are partially visited, I should check if the exact text is available. The search results provided the tokens, so I can use those.\n\nThe evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The location can be the token range or a specific section.\n\nFor the first value: \n- Value: \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court\"\n- Evidence: text from Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law, tokens 19399-19599\n- Source document: \"Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law\"\n\nFor the second value:\n- Value: \"after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court\"\n- Evidence: text from Order (002), tokens 2066-2266\n- Source document: \"Order (002)\"\n\nWait, but the user's checklist requires each duration as a separate value formatted as '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. However, the examples given in the checklist definition might need the duration part. Let me check the requirements again.\n\nThe checklist says: \"Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\"\n\nWait, but the examples in the search results don't have the duration in that format. The user needs to extract the duration part. For example, in the Findings match, the decree obligation is \"enjoins the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved\". So the duration part is \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved\".\n\nBut the instruction says to extract the duration as a separate value, formatted as [duration]: [decree obligation]. So the value should be \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1\".\n\nWait, but the exact wording in the checklist says: \"Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\"\n\nSo the value should be the duration phrase followed by a colon and the decree obligation. But the example given in the user's task says \"each duration as a separate value\", so maybe they just want the duration part. Wait, no, the exact instruction says \"formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\", so the value should be a string like \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1\".\n\nBut looking at the search results, the text says \"Consequently, the Court hereby enjoins the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court.\"\n\nSo the duration is \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved\", and the decree obligation is \"enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1\".\n\nThus, the formatted value would be \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1\".\n\nSimilarly, the second one: \"after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle\".\n\nWait, the text says \"enjoins the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved\". So the duration part is \"after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved\", and the decree obligation is \"enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle\".\n\nBut the instruction says to extract the duration as [duration]: [decree obligation], so the value should be \"after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle\".\n\nWait, but the user's example in the requirements says \"Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\", so the duration is the time aspect, and the decree obligation is the action.\n\nBut in the search results, the duration is part of the sentence. So I need to parse the duration part.\n\nIn the Findings match, the duration is \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved\", and the decree obligation is \"enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1\".\n\nSimilarly, in the Order (002) match, duration is \"after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved\", and decree obligation is \"enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle\".\n\nSo the extracted values should be:\n\n1. \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1\"\n\n2. \"after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle\"\n\nNow, to confirm, these are the only two durations found. The other matches don't mention specific durations, just references to injunctions or decrees without timeframes.\n\nNext, I need to append these to the checklist. Since the user is supposed to use `append_checklist` for adding new entries. Each entry must have evidence with text, source, and location.\n\nThe evidence for the first value would be the text snippet from Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law, tokens 19399-19599. The exact text is:\n\n\"Consequently, the Court hereby enjoins the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court.\"\n\nSimilarly, the second value is from Order (002), tokens 2066-2266:\n\n\"Consequently, the Court hereby enjoins the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court.\"\n\nSo the evidence for each would include that text, source document, and location (tokens range).\n\nNow, the next action should be to append these values using `append_checklist`.\n\nWait, but the user's current state says that the documents are partially visited. The Findings Of Fact document has been viewed up to tokens 19066-19599, which includes the matches. Similarly, Order (002) has tokens 1568-1823 and 2147-2347, but the match 2 is at tokens 2066-2266, which is within the viewed range? Wait, the Order (002) is listed as having viewed tokens 1568-1823, 2147-2347. The match 2 is tokens 2066-2266. 2066-2266 overlaps with 2147-2347? Wait, 2066-2266 is from 2066 to 2266. The viewed tokens for Order (002) include 2147-2347. So 2066-2266 would start before 2147, but the search result is for tokens 2066-2266. However, the document's viewed tokens are 2147-2347. So the part from 2066-2146 hasn't been read yet. Wait, but the search result says tokens 2066-2266. So the actual text might be in the unviewed part. Wait, the document's viewed tokens are 1568-1823 (which is up to 1823) and 2147-2347. The match is at 2066-2266. So 2066-2146 is unviewed, and 2147-2266 is viewed. But the search result might have captured the text even if part of it is unviewed. However, the system's document catalog shows that Order (002) is partially visited with those token ranges. So to get the exact text, maybe the search already provided the context, so we can use that.\n\nBut according to the instructions, after a search_document_regex, the next step is to use append_checklist if values are found. Since the search results provided the text snippets, we can proceed to append the values based on those.\n\nSo the correct action now is to call `append_checklist` with the two values and their evidence.\n\nWait, but the user's recent actions already did the search_document_regex, and the search results are provided. So the next step is to process those matches and append the extracted values.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be `append_checklist` with the two entries.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Consequently, the Court hereby enjoins the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law\",\n                \"location\": \"tokens 19399-19599\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Consequently, the Court hereby enjoins the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order (002)\",\n                \"location\": \"tokens 2066-2266\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "How_Long_Decrees_will_Last", "extracted": [{"value": "until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1", "evidence": [{"text": "Consequently, the Court hereby enjoins the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court.", "source_document": "Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law", "location": "tokens 19399-19599"}]}, {"value": "after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle", "evidence": [{"text": "Consequently, the Court hereby enjoins the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court.", "source_document": "Order (002)", "location": "tokens 2066-2266"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7905, "completion_tokens": 3009, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user wants me to extract the decree duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and they need every distinct value with evidence.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already appended two values from the Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law and Order (002) documents. The extracted values are:\n\n1. \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1\"\n2. \"after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle\"\n\nWait, but the second one mentions \"after the 2024 election cycle\". The user's requirement says to format each duration as '[duration]: [decree obligation]'. So the duration here is \"after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved\". But I need to check if there are more values to extract.\n\nThe available documents include several unvisited ones like Complaints, other Orders, and Settlement Agreement. The Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation mentioned the court denied a consent decree, but that's about not having a decree, not the duration. The other documents might have more decree durations.\n\nThe current checklist has two values, but maybe there are more. The user's task is to extract EVERY distinct value. So I should check if other documents have additional decree durations.\n\nLooking at the documents, the Settlement Agreement is unvisited. The title says \"Settlement Agreement and Release\", which might contain a decree duration. Also, the other Orders (003-008) might have relevant text.\n\nWait, the search_document_regex was done on all documents with \"decree|injunction\", but the matches found were in Docket, Findings, Order (001), Order (002), and Status Update. The Status Update mentioned the court denied the consent decree, so no decree there. The Settlement Agreement might have a decree, so it's worth checking.\n\nBut the user's recent action was to append the two values. Now, the next step is to check if there are more values. The document catalog shows that Settlement Agreement is unvisited (○ Unvisited), so I should read it to see if it contains the decree duration.\n\nWait, the Settlement Agreement might not have a court-ordered decree but a settlement. The checklist specifies \"formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction\". The Settlement Agreement might be the agreement itself, not the court order. But the Status Update says the court denied the consent decree request, so maybe the Settlement Agreement is separate.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should read the Settlement Agreement document. The document name is \"Settlement Agreement and Release\" with 701 tokens, which is small. So I can read the entire document with read_document.\n\nAlso, check if other unvisited documents like the Complaints or other Orders have more decree durations. But the Complaints might not have the decree, as the decree comes from the court order. The Orders (003-008) might have more, but since the user's current status shows that Order (001) and (002) were partially read, maybe the other Orders have more info.\n\nWait, the Order (001) and (002) were partially visited. The user read some tokens there, but maybe there's more. However, the user's previous search found matches in those documents. But the two values they extracted were from Order (002) and Findings. Let me check the tokens they read.\n\nFor Order (002), they read tokens 1568-1823 and 2147-2347. The second match in Order (002) was tokens 2066-2266, which was used for the second value. The other tokens in Order (002) might not have more relevant info.\n\nThe Findings document was read up to tokens 19399-19599, which was the last match. The Findings document is 20,002 tokens, so maybe more tokens could have other decrees, but the search found 5 matches, all related to the injunction duration. So probably no more there.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement is unvisited. Let's read that. The document is small (701 tokens), so it's safe to read the whole thing. If it's a settlement agreement, it might have terms about the duration, but the checklist specifies court-ordered decrees. If the settlement was approved by the court, it might be considered a consent decree. But the Status Update says the court denied the consent decree request, so the Settlement Agreement might not be court-approved. But I need to check.\n\nSo the next logical step is to read the Settlement Agreement document to see if it contains a decree duration. Since it's unvisited, use read_document on \"Settlement Agreement and Release\" with start_token 0 and end_token 701 (since it's 701 tokens).\n\nWait, the document's token count is 701, so reading 0-701 would get the whole thing. But I need to make sure not to exceed the 10k token limit, which it's well under.\n\nSo the action should be read_document for \"Settlement Agreement and Release\" from 0 to 701.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Settlement Agreement and Release\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 701}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Settlement Agreement and Release", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 701}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8200, "completion_tokens": 1220, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" checklist item from the legal documents. So far, they've already done some steps: listed documents, searched for \"decree|injunction\", appended two values from the Findings Of Fact and Order (002) documents. Then they read the Settlement Agreement and Release document, but it didn't have any new decree duration info.\n\nNow, looking at the current status: they have 2 values extracted, but the documents they've read so far (like Docket, Findings, Orders) have only partial coverage. The Settlement Agreement was fully read but didn't add anything. The next step is to check if there are more documents that might contain the decree duration.\n\nThe available documents list shows several unvisited ones: Complaints, Docket (001), and other Orders. The key is to find more instances of decree durations. The previous search with regex found matches in Docket (002), Findings, Order (001), Order (002), and Status Update. But maybe the unvisited documents have more.\n\nWait, the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" is about the duration of court-ordered decrees, not just any mention of \"decree\". The existing entries are from the Findings and Order (002), which have specific \"until a constitutionally valid plan is approved\" phrases. The other documents like the Complaints might have details about the requested injunctions, but the user needs the court-ordered duration, not just the request.\n\nLooking at the unvisited documents: Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (14,907 tokens) and Third Amended Complaint (24,060 tokens). These are complaints, so they might state what the plaintiffs are asking for, but the decree duration would be in the court's order. However, sometimes complaints include specific requests for duration. But the checklist says \"only include obligations ordered by the court\", so the complaint might not have the actual court order. So maybe those are less likely to have the value, but maybe the Third Amended Complaint mentions a duration they're seeking, but the user needs the court-ordered one. Hmm.\n\nThe Docket (001) is unvisited (5,393 tokens). Dockets usually list entries, so maybe there's a court order there. The previous Docket (002) had some entries, but Docket (001) might have more. The other Orders (like Order and Opinion 001-008) are unvisited. These might contain the actual decree durations.\n\nWait, the user already read Order (001) and Order (002) partially. Order (001) had tokens 1556-1756 and 2066-2266. The second match in Order (001) was about modifying the injunction, but maybe there's more in the unvisited part. Similarly, Order (002) had some tokens read, but maybe more.\n\nBut the user's current step is to decide the next action. They have two values already. The checklist says to extract every distinct value. The two they have are similar but have \"after the 2024 election cycle\" in one. Are there more?\n\nWait, in the Status Update Regarding Settlement, they found that the court denied a consent decree. But that's about the denial, not the decree duration. So maybe not relevant.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement was read but didn't have any decree duration. The Complaints might have the plaintiffs' requested duration, but the checklist specifies \"ordered by the court\", so unless the court's order is in the Complaint (which it's not), those might not count. So the Complaints might not be the right documents.\n\nThe other Orders (Order and Opinion 001-008) are unvisited. The user has read Order (001) and Order (002) partially. Maybe Order (003) or others have the decree duration. But the user needs to check which document is most likely to have it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they should use `get_checklist` to see if there are more keys, but the checklist only has one key. Wait, the checklist items to extract is only \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", so they just need to find all instances of that.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so only that one key. They need to find all values for it. They have two values. Are there more?\n\nLooking back at the search results from Step 2: the regex search found matches in various documents. The Docket (002) had matches, but the excerpts shown didn't mention duration. The Findings had the two entries they extracted. The Order (002) had the second entry. The Status Update had the denial of consent decree, but no duration.\n\nWait, the Order (002) tokens 2066-2266 had \"after the 2024 election cycle until...\", and the Findings had \"until a constitutionally valid...\". Are there other instances in other documents?\n\nThe unvisited Orders (Order and Opinion 003-008) might have more. For example, Order and Opinion (003) is 4,193 tokens. Maybe it contains a decree duration.\n\nBut the user should check which document is most likely to have the value. Since the previous matches were in Order (002) and Findings, maybe the other Orders (like Order and Opinion 003) have similar content.\n\nAlternatively, the user could do a `search_document_regex` again for the specific pattern of \"until a constitutionally valid\" or \"until...approved\", but the regex search was already done. Wait, the previous search was for \"decree|injunction\", which found matches, but maybe they need a more specific regex to find the actual duration phrases.\n\nBut the next action should be to read another document. The most promising unvisited documents with Order/Opinion types are Order and Opinion (003) through (008), as well as Docket (001). Since the previous Order (002) was read partially, maybe Order (003) is a good next step.\n\nWait, the user's current available documents list shows Order and Opinion (003) as unvisited. So, the next logical step is to read a portion of Order and Opinion (003) to see if it contains more decree duration info.\n\nBut the user must choose one action. The decision policy says to choose `read_document` for a targeted window. Since Order and Opinion (003) is unvisited, they should read it. But to be efficient, they should read the entire document (since it's 4,193 tokens, which is under 10k). Wait, the document is 4,193 tokens, so reading it all is possible.\n\nWait, the user's previous reads were partial (e.g., Order (001) was partially read), but Order and Opinion (003) is unvisited, so they can read the whole thing. So the next action should be `read_document` for Order and Opinion (003) with start_token 0 and end_token 4193.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they should check the Docket (001) first, but Dockets usually list entries, so the actual decree might be in an Order document. So the Order and Opinion documents are more likely to contain the decree duration.\n\nSo, the next action is to read Order and Opinion (003) from 0 to its token count (4193).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order and Opinion (003)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4193}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order and Opinion (003)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4193}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 9010, "completion_tokens": 1688, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract the decree duration from legal documents, specifically the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" checklist item. From the recent actions, I see they've already extracted two values from the Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law and Order (002) documents.\n\nLooking at the current status: they have 2 values extracted, 1 key total, and all other documents are either partially visited or unvisited. The Order and Opinion (003) document was fully read (tokens 0-4193), but the extraction didn't find any new decree durations there. The Settlement Agreement was fully read but also didn't contain the required decree duration.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other documents that might contain the decree duration. The remaining unvisited documents include Complaints, Docket entries, and other Orders. But the checklist specifically asks for \"formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction\" - so I should focus on documents that are orders or opinions.\n\nThe Docket (001) is unvisited and has 5,393 tokens. Since the Docket often contains court orders, it's a good candidate. The pattern \"decree\" or \"injunction\" was already searched earlier, but maybe the full document has more context. However, the Docket (002) was partially visited and had some matches, but Docket (001) is completely unvisited.\n\nWait, the Docket (002) was partially visited (1% coverage), but the Docket (001) is completely unvisited. Since the user needs to check all possible documents, I should read Docket (001) next. But the token count is 5,393, which is under 10,000, so reading the whole thing is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Order and Opinion (003)\" was fully read but didn't have new info. The other Orders (004-008) are unvisited, but they might have similar content. However, Docket (001) is a primary document that might contain the decree duration.\n\nWait, the checklist requires \"duration of decree obligations\" from court orders. The previous extractions came from the Findings document and Order (002). The Docket (001) might have a court order with a duration. Since it's unvisited, I should read it to check for any new decree durations.\n\nI should use `read_document` for Docket (001) from tokens 0-5393. That's the entire document. The other unvisited documents are larger (like the Complaints), but they're less likely to contain the decree duration since they're complaints, not orders. So focusing on Docket (001) makes sense.\n\nAlso, the user's recent action history shows they've been reading documents to find decree durations. The Docket (001) hasn't been read yet, so it's the next logical step. The system says not to reread fully visited documents, but Docket (001) is unvisited, so it's safe to read.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket (001)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 5393}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket (001)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 5393}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13423, "completion_tokens": 726, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the decree duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is How_Long_Decrees_will_Last.\n\nLooking at the current status, there are two values already extracted. One from Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law and another from Order (002). The user provided the extracted values:\n\n1. \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1\"\n   Evidence from Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law (tokens 19399-19599).\n\n2. \"after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved: enjoining the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle\"\n   Evidence from Order (002) (tokens 2066-2266).\n\nNow, I need to check if there are more values in the remaining documents. The available documents that are unvisited or partially visited include:\n\n- Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Three Judge Panel Requested (unvisited)\n- Third Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (unvisited)\n- Memorandum Opinion and Order Denying Without Prejudice the Parties' Motion to Limine to Exclude Expert Testimony (unvisited)\n- Order and Opinion (001) to (008) (all unvisited except Order and Opinion (003) which is fully visited)\n- Docket (002) is partially visited (only 1% covered)\n- Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law is partially visited (3% covered)\n- Order (001) and (002) partially visited (17% each)\n- Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation is partially visited (10% covered)\n\nWait, the user's recent actions include Step 5: read_document on Order and Opinion (003) (tokens 0-4193), which is fully visited. Step 6: read_document on Docket (001) (tokens 0-5393), fully visited.\n\nThe current state shows that the document catalog is known (18 documents), and the checklist key How_Long_Decrees_will_Last has two values. The next step is to check if there are more values in the unvisited parts of the partially visited documents or in the unvisited documents.\n\nLooking at the partially visited documents:\n\n- Docket (002): only 1% viewed. The search_document_regex earlier found matches in Docket (002), but the tokens read were minimal. However, the user's step 2 search found 4 matches in Docket (002), but those were in specific token ranges. The current viewed tokens for Docket (002) are 7308-7508, 7608-7808, 10966-11166, 11502-11702. The document is 92,649 tokens, so 1% coverage. Maybe there's more in other parts.\n\n- Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law: viewed 19066-19599 (3%), but the document is 20,002 tokens. So maybe more matches in other parts.\n\n- Order (001) and (002): viewed 1556-1756, 2066-2266 (Order 001), and 1568-1823, 2147-2347 (Order 002). Both are small documents (2k-2.6k tokens), so maybe the rest hasn't been read.\n\n- Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation: viewed 374-604 (10%), but the document is 2,205 tokens. So 10% covered, 90% left.\n\nBut the key is to find more decree durations. The existing values are about injunctions related to elections. The checklist says \"the duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction\".\n\nLooking at the documents that have been read:\n\n- The Order (002) entry had the value with \"after the 2024 election cycle\".\n\n- The Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law had \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved\".\n\nNow, checking the unvisited documents. For example, the Third Amended Complaint (unvisited) might have a decree duration, but complaints usually don't contain court orders; they request relief. The court orders would be in the orders or opinions.\n\nThe Order and Opinion (003) was read and it's a denial of summary judgment, so no decree there. The other Order and Opinion documents (001, 002, 004-008) are unvisited. But Order (001) and (002) were partially visited. Wait, Order (001) and (002) are listed as partially visited, but the user read some tokens. Maybe there's more in those.\n\nWait, the user's Step 3 appended two values from Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law and Order (002). The Order (002) in the snapshot has a value from tokens 2066-2266. The document Order (002) is 2,671 tokens, and viewed tokens are 1568-1823, 2147-2347. So the next token range to read would be, for example, 1824-2146 or 2348 onwards. But the user's current status shows that Order (002) is partially visited with 17% coverage. So maybe there's more in Order (002) that wasn't read yet.\n\nSimilarly, Order (001) is 2,388 tokens, viewed 1556-1756 and 2066-2266. So 1556-1756 (200 tokens) and 2066-2266 (200 tokens), so maybe the middle part (1757-2065) is unvisited. But the Order (001) was read in Step 3's search, but the user read specific tokens. Wait, Step 2 search found matches in Order (001) at tokens 1556-1756 and 2066-2266. So the user read those, but maybe there's more.\n\nBut the checklist item is about decree duration. The existing values are from the Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law (which is part of the order) and Order (002). The Order (001) might have other parts. Wait, the Order (001) in the snapshot's Step 2 search had two matches. The first match was tokens 1556-1756, which was about Rule 62(d), modifying the injunction. The second match was tokens 2066-2266, which is the same as the Order (002) entry. Wait, no, the Order (002) had a different match.\n\nWait, looking back at Step 2's search results:\n\n- **Order (001)** (2 matches):\n  Match 1 (tokens 1556-1756): ... modified to now read (added language underlined): Consequently, the Court hereby enjoins the conducting of an election under Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court.\n\nWait, no, that's from Order (002). Let me check again.\n\nWait, in Step 2's search results:\n\n- **Order (001)** (2 matches):\n  Match 1 (tokens 1556-1756):\n  ```\n  521 at 6-18). \n  Discussion \n  The Court finds that the present circumstances are best addressed under Federal Rule of \n  Civil Procedure 62( d), which authorizes a trial court to modify an injunction pending appeal to \n  maintain the status quo until a final decision on appeal.  Nat. Res. Def Council, Inc. v. Sw. Marine \n  Inc.,  242  F.3d  1163,  1166 (9th Cir.  2001) (\"The district court retains jurisdiction during the \n  pendency of an appeal to act to preserve the status quo.\"); Coastal Corp. v.  Texas E.  Corp., 869 \n  -3-\n  ```\n\n  Match 2 (tokens 2066-2266):\n  ```\n  the  appeal  before the  Supreme  Court still  pending,  and no \n  remedial plan in place, the ideal must bend to the practical. \n  The Court hereby exercises its authority under Rule 62( d) to modify its injunction to \n  preserve the status quo on appeal.  The last paragraph of the Court's Order of January 6, 2023 \n  (Dkt. No. 493) at page 30 is modified to now read (added language underlined): \n  Consequently, the Court hereby enjoins the conducting of an election under \n  Congressional District No. 1 after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally \n  valid apportionment plan is approved by this Court.  Johnson v. Miller, 864 F. \n  Supp. 1354, 1393 (S.D. Ga. 1994), aff'd and remanded\n  ```\n\nWait, this match 2 (tokens 2066-2266) is actually from Order (002), not Order (001). The document name for that match is listed as **Order (002)**. So the user read Order (002) for that token range.\n\nSo, the two values were from:\n\n- Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law (tokens 19399-19599)\n- Order (002) (tokens 2066-2266)\n\nNow, the user needs to check if there are more values in other parts of the documents. The next step would be to read more of the partially visited documents to see if there are additional decree durations.\n\nFor example, the Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law has only 3% coverage (tokens 19066-19599). The document is 20,002 tokens, so there's 97% left. But the search in Step 2 found 5 matches in that document, and the user read tokens 19066-19599, which covered the matches. Wait, the matches were at 19066-19266, 19117-19317, etc., up to 19399-19599. So the user read the last match (19399-19599), which was the one used for the first value. The other matches (19066-19266, etc.) were in the same document but maybe not read yet. Wait, the Step 2 search found 5 matches in Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law, and the user's Step 3 appended values from one of them (the last match). But the other matches might have similar text.\n\nWait, the user's Step 3 says: \"Successfully appended 1 key: How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" with two values. Wait, no, the Step 3 says \"appended 1 key\" but lists two values. Wait, the extracted values section shows two values for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last. So maybe the two values came from two different matches.\n\nWait, the Step 3 says:\n\n**Extracted Values:**\n• How_Long_Decrees_will_Last:\n  → Value 1: ... from Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law (tokens 19399-19599)\n  → Value 2: ... from Order (002) (tokens 2066-2266)\n\nSo the two values are from two different documents.\n\nNow, the next step is to check if there are more values in other documents. The user should check if there are other matches in the remaining documents.\n\nLooking at the other partially visited documents:\n\n- Docket (002): only 1% viewed, but the search found matches there. However, docket entries are typically lists of filings, not the decree itself. The decree would be in the orders or opinions.\n\n- Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation: viewed 10%, but this is a status update, not a decree. The document mentioned the court denied the consent decree, so maybe no decree duration here.\n\n- The unvisited documents like Complaints, Third Amended Complaint, etc., are likely not containing the decree duration, as they are pleadings, not court orders.\n\nSo, the main candidates are the partially visited Order and Opinion documents. For example, Order (001) has a match in the tokens read, but it's about modifying the injunction. The value from Order (002) already includes the \"after the 2024 election cycle\" part. Wait, the Order (002) match 2 (tokens 2066-2266) has the value. So perhaps that's the only one.\n\nWait, the user's Step 3 appended two values. Now, to ensure all possible values are extracted, they need to check if there are other decree durations in other parts of the documents.\n\nBut according to the document coverage, the Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law was partially visited (3% coverage), but the search found 5 matches. The user read the last match (19399-19599), which was the fifth match. The other matches (19066-19266, etc.) were earlier in the document, but the user might not have read them. However, the Step 2 search was done on all documents, and the matches were found, but the user's Step 3 appended the values from the last two matches.\n\nWait, the Step 3 says \"appended 1 key: How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" with two values. So perhaps the two values are from two different matches. The other matches in the same document might not have additional decree durations.\n\nFor example, the other matches in Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law were about the four-factor test for injunctions, but the actual decree duration was only in the last part (the \"Consequently, the Court hereby enjoins...\" sentence). So the other matches might not have the duration.\n\nSimilarly, in Order (002), the match 2 was the one with the duration.\n\nNow, the user should check if there are other documents that have decree durations. For example, the Order and Opinion (003) was fully visited, and it's a denial of summary judgment, so no decree there. The other Order and Opinion documents (001, 002, 004-008) are unvisited or partially visited. Order (001) was partially visited, but the user read some tokens. Let's check if there's more.\n\nWait, Order (001) has a match at tokens 1556-1756, which was about Rule 62(d) modifying the injunction. But the actual decree duration might be in the order text. However, the user's Step 3 didn't extract anything from Order (001), so maybe there's no decree duration there, or the duration is already covered.\n\nThe existing values are:\n\n1. \"until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved\" (from Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law)\n2. \"after the 2024 election cycle until a constitutionally valid apportionment plan is approved\" (from Order (002))\n\nThese seem to be two different time frames. The first is a general \"until approved\", the second specifies \"after 2024 election cycle until approved\". So these are two distinct values.\n\nNow, the user needs to confirm if there are more. For example, in Order (001), the match at tokens 1556-1756 says \"The Court hereby exercises its authority under Rule 62(d) to modify its injunction to preserve the status quo on appeal.\" But it doesn't specify the duration. The duration was specified in the Order (002) match.\n\nSo perhaps there are only two values.\n\nWait, the current status shows \"Total Values Extracted: 2\", and the keys with values are 1/1. So maybe that's all. But the user should verify with get_checklist to make sure.\n\nThe next step could be to call get_checklist to see if all values are extracted. But the user's instructions say to stop when all keys are complete or Not Applicable.\n\nThe checklist item How_Long_Decrees_will_Last has two values, and the user has extracted both. The remaining documents (unvisited) are unlikely to have more decree durations, as they are complaints or other documents that don't contain court orders.\n\nSo the next action should be to stop, as all applicable values are extracted.\n\nWait, but the user should confirm with get_checklist. However, the system says to stop when all keys are complete. The current state shows that How_Long_Decrees_will_Last has two values, and there are no empty or Not Applicable keys. So it's complete.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last have been fully extracted with two distinct values from Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law and Order (002), with complete evidence.

From the provided history, they've already done several steps.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: Step 7 was a stop attempt, but the system automatically ran get_checklist, showing 1 key filled with 2 values. The current status says all checklist items are filled (1/1) with 2 values extracted. The available documents show that most have been fully visited or partially visited, but the key documents related to the decree duration (Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law and Order (002)) have been partially visited.\n\nWait, the user's goal is to extract every distinct value. The checklist status shows 2 values for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last, and the documents that were read (like Order and Opinion (003), Docket (001), Settlement Agreement) didn't yield additional values. The partially visited documents like Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law only had 3% coverage, but the system's automatic review says the extraction is complete.\n\nThe key point here is whether there's any remaining unvisited document that might contain more values. The checklist status indicates all keys are filled. The \"Not Applicable\" section is 0, so no need for that.
