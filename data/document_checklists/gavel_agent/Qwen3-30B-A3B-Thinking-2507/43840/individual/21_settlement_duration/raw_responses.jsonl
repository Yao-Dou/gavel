Since there are no documents listed, I should use list_documents to get the catalog.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, the first function to call here is list_documents. There's no need to read or search any documents yet because there are none to read. The user hasn't provided any documents, so the system needs to discover them first.

The task is to extract the settlement duration from the documents, specifically the \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" item. The user provided a snapshot with 18 documents, all unvisited so far.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document is most likely to contain settlement duration information. The checklist definition says to look for settlement obligations not incorporated into court orders. So, court orders and opinions might not be the right places because they're formal judgments. The Settlement Agreement and Release document (701 tokens) seems like the most probable candidate since it's a settlement agreement. The Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation might also have relevant info, but the Settlement Agreement is more direct.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Settlement Agreement and Release is a specific document labeled as [Settlement Agreement], which should contain the actual terms of the settlement, including duration. The other documents like Complaints and Doctored are more about legal proceedings, not the settlement terms themselves. So, reading the Settlement Agreement first makes sense.\n\nI should use read_document on the Settlement Agreement. The document has 701 tokens, which is under the 10,000 limit. Since it's unvisited, I'll start from the beginning. The parameters would be doc_name \"Settlement Agreement and Release\", start_token 0, end_token 701. That way, I can get the whole document in one go.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"do not reread fully visited documents,\" but this one is unvisited, so it's safe to read the entire document. No need for regex here because the document type is specific and likely to contain the info. Using read_document is the right choice here. Let me confirm: the checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", and the Settlement Agreement is the most relevant. So, the next action should be read_document on that specific file.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Settlement Agreement and Release\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 701}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Settlement Agreement and Release", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 701}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3718, "completion_tokens": 442, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the settlement duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", and they want every distinct value with evidence.\n\nFirst, I checked the recent actions. Step 1 was list_documents, which found 18 documents. Step 2 was read_document on Settlement Agreement and Release for tokens 0-701. The text they provided from that document doesn't mention any settlement duration. The pages show signatures and dates, but no specific duration like \"1 year\" or \"5 years\" related to settlement obligations.\n\nLooking at the current status: the key \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" is empty. The only document read so far is fully visited (Settlement Agreement), and it didn't have the info. The other 17 documents are unvisited. \n\nThe next step should be to check another document. Since the Settlement Agreement didn't have the info, I need to look elsewhere. The most relevant documents might be the Complaints, Dockets, or Orders, but the user mentioned settlement duration, so maybe the Settlement Agreement itself should have it. Wait, the Settlement Agreement they read was page 1-11, but the text they pasted ends at page 7 with signatures. Maybe the actual settlement terms are on later pages? But the read was up to 701 tokens, which covered all pages (since it's 11 pages, but the token count was 701). Wait, the document is marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited) with 0-701 tokens. So they already read the entire document, and there's no settlement duration mentioned there.\n\nSo the next logical step is to check another document. The Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation might be relevant. It's a document titled with \"Settlement\" in the name, so it's likely to contain settlement terms. That's the first unvisited document that seems promising. Let me check the available documents list again.\n\nAvailable documents: The Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation is listed as unvisited (○ Unvisited) and has 2,205 tokens. That's under 10k, so reading it would be efficient. The other documents like Complaints or Dockets might not have the settlement duration, but the Status Update seems directly related. \n\nThe user's checklist specifies that settlement duration should be from agreements not incorporated into court orders. The Status Update document might discuss the settlement terms. So, reading that document would be the next step. Using read_document on \"Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation\" from tokens 0-2205 (since it's 2,205 tokens, the full document). \n\nWait, the document says \"Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation\" – maybe it's a brief or motion that mentions the settlement duration. Since the Settlement Agreement didn't have it, this is the next best bet. So the action should be read_document for that specific document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 2205}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 2205}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4528, "completion_tokens": 663, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the settlement duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which requires the duration of settlement obligations not incorporated into a court order.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: they've already read two documents. The first was the Settlement Agreement and Release (tokens 0-701), but the text provided doesn't mention any duration. The second document is the Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation (tokens 0-2205), which has some relevant info.\n\nIn the Status Update document, the key part says: \"The Settlement Maps will be passed by both chambers of the Legislature, presented to the Governor on or before May 12, 2022, and signed into law on or before May 17, 2022.\" Also, \"H.1024 will pass the Senate and be delivered to the Governor for signature on or before May 12, 2022. Thereafter, the Governor will have until May 17, 2022 to sign and enact H.1024 into law.\"\n\nSo the settlement duration here is from the agreement date (May 5, 2022) until May 17, 2022. But the exact duration isn't stated as a period. The text mentions specific dates: the bill needs to be passed by May 12 and signed by May 17. The time frame is 12 days from May 5 to May 17? Wait, May 5 to May 17 is 12 days, but the agreement says \"on or before May 12\" and \"on or before May 17\". So the settlement obligation period is until May 17, 2022, which is 12 days after May 5.\n\nBut the checklist requires the duration formatted as \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\". The duration here would be \"12 days\" or \"until May 17, 2022\". The text says \"on or before May 17\", so the settlement duration is the period until May 17. The exact wording should be extracted as per the document.\n\nWait, the requirement says: \"Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [settlement obligation].'\" So the duration should be the time period, like \"12 days\", and the settlement obligation is the specific obligation mentioned.\n\nIn the Status Update, the settlement obligation is the requirement to pass the bill by May 12 and have it signed by May 17. So the duration is from the agreement date (May 5) until May 17, which is 12 days. But the document says \"on or before May 12\" and \"on or before May 17\", so the timeline is 12 days (May 5 to May 17 is 12 days later). Wait, May 5 to May 12 is 7 days, but the deadline is May 12 for passage and May 17 for signing. So the total time from agreement to signing deadline is 12 days (May 5 to May 17).\n\nBut the exact wording in the document: \"The Settlement Maps will be passed by both chambers of the Legislature, presented to the Governor on or before May 12, 2022, and signed into law on or before May 17, 2022.\" So the settlement obligation is that the maps must be passed by May 12 and signed by May 17. The duration here is the period until May 17, so the duration is \"12 days\" (from May 5 to May 17).\n\nWait, but the settlement agreement itself might have the duration. The Settlement Agreement document (first read) didn't have any duration mentioned, just the signatures. The Status Update is the one with the timeline.\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"12 days: Settlement Maps to be passed by both chambers and signed into law by May 17, 2022.\" But the exact wording from the document is \"passed by both chambers... presented to the Governor on or before May 12, 2022, and signed into law on or before May 17, 2022.\" So the duration is the period from the agreement date (May 5) to May 17, which is 12 days. But the document doesn't say \"12 days\"; it gives specific dates. So the duration should be expressed as the time period mentioned, which is \"until May 17, 2022\" or \"12 days\".\n\nThe checklist says \"formatted as: '[duration]: [settlement obligation]'\". So the duration could be \"12 days\" and the obligation is \"Settlement Maps to be passed by both chambers and signed into law by May 17, 2022.\"\n\nLooking at the document: \"The Settlement Maps will be passed by both chambers of the Legislature, presented to the Governor on or before May 12, 2022, and signed into law on or before May 17, 2022.\"\n\nSo the settlement obligation is that the maps must be passed by May 12 and signed by May 17. The duration is the time until May 17. So the duration is \"until May 17, 2022\" or \"12 days from agreement date\". But the document doesn't state the duration in days; it's given in dates. However, the checklist requires the duration as a time period. So we need to calculate it. From May 5 to May 17 is 12 days (May 5 to May 12 is 7 days, May 12 to May 17 is 5 days, total 12 days). So \"12 days\".\n\nTherefore, the extracted value would be \"12 days: Settlement Maps to be passed by both chambers and signed into law by May 17, 2022.\"\n\nNow, check if this is the only value. The other documents haven't been read yet, but the Status Update has this info. The Settlement Agreement (first document) didn't mention duration, so the only value comes from the Status Update.\n\nThe next step is to append this to the checklist. Since it's the first value, we need to use append_checklist with the key \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", the value \"12 days\", and the evidence from the Status Update document.\n\nWait, the evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The verbatim text is \"The Settlement Maps will be passed by both chambers of the Legislature, presented to the Governor on or before May 12, 2022, and signed into law on or before May 17, 2022.\" Source document is \"Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation\", location is page 2 (since it's in the middle of the document, but the token range was 0-2205, which covers the whole document).\n\nSo the evidence should have:\n- text: the exact sentence\n- source_document: \"Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation\"\n- location: \"Page 2\" (since the document shows \"Page 2 of 4\" in the header)\n\nWait, the read_document was for tokens 0-2205, which is the entire document. The specific text is on page 2, as per the headers in the document.\n\nSo the evidence location would be \"Page 2\".\n\nNow, the checklist key is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", and the extracted value is \"12 days: Settlement Maps to be passed by both chambers and signed into law by May 17, 2022.\"\n\nWait, the checklist says \"formatted as: '[duration]: [settlement obligation]'\". So the duration part is \"12 days\", and the settlement obligation is the rest. But the example in the checklist is \"[duration]: [settlement obligation]\", so the value should be \"12 days: Settlement Maps to be passed by both chambers and signed into law by May 17, 2022.\"\n\nBut the actual text in the document says \"The Settlement Maps will be passed... on or before May 17, 2022.\" So the settlement obligation is the requirement to pass and sign by those dates. So the duration is 12 days, and the obligation is the specific timeline.\n\nTherefore, the value to extract is \"12 days: Settlement Maps to be passed by both chambers and signed into law by May 17, 2022.\"\n\nNow, check if there are other possible values. The other documents are unvisited, but the current step is to use the evidence from the Status Update. Since the Status Update is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), and we've extracted the value from it, we should append it now.\n\nThe next action should be append_checklist with the patch for \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" with the extracted value and evidence.\n\nSo the tool call should be append_checklist with the patch containing the key and the extracted list with one entry.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"12 days: Settlement Maps to be passed by both chambers and signed into law by May 17, 2022\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"The Settlement Maps will be passed by both chambers of the Legislature, presented to the Governor on or before May 12, 2022, and signed into law on or before May 17, 2022.\", \"source_document\": \"Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation\", \"location\": \"Page 2\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "How_Long_Settlement_will_Last", "extracted": [{"value": "12 days: Settlement Maps to be passed by both chambers and signed into law by May 17, 2022", "evidence": [{"text": "The Settlement Maps will be passed by both chambers of the Legislature, presented to the Governor on or before May 12, 2022, and signed into law on or before May 17, 2022.", "source_document": "Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation", "location": "Page 2"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6917, "completion_tokens": 2115, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking for the settlement duration from legal documents, specifically the \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\" checklist item. So far, they've extracted one value from the \"Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation\" document, which says the settlement maps need to be passed by both chambers and signed by May 17, 2022. That's 12 days from May 5 to May 17.\n\nNow, looking at the current status: all other documents are unvisited (marked as ○ Unvisited). The checklist has only one key, and it's already got one value. But wait, the requirement says to extract \"EVERY distinct value\" found in any document. So I need to check if there are more documents that might contain additional settlement duration info.\n\nThe available documents include things like Complaints, Dockets, and various Orders. The Settlement Agreement document was already fully read (tokens 0-701), and the Status Update was also fully read. But maybe other documents like the Third Amended Complaint or Orders could have more details about the settlement timeline.\n\nHmm, the Settlement Agreement (which was read) mentions execution on May 5, 2022, but the duration is in the Status Update. The other documents haven't been checked yet. For example, the \"Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law\" might have details on the settlement terms. Or maybe the Docket entries have dates that imply the duration.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says to exclude court orders or judgments. So if any document is a court order that incorporates the settlement, that shouldn't count. But the Status Update is a motion, not a court order, so it's valid. But maybe other motions or briefs have more details.\n\nThe user's current action is to check if there's more to extract. Since the checklist item has only one value so far, and there are 16 unvisited documents, I should probably read another document to see if there's more info. But which one? The most likely candidates would be documents that discuss the settlement terms. The Third Amended Complaint might reference the settlement timeline, or the Orders might have orders related to the settlement.\n\nLooking at the document names, \"Third Amended Complaint\" is a good candidate because complaints often include settlement terms. It's 24k tokens, so I can read a targeted section. But the user can only read up to 10k tokens at a time. Maybe start with the beginning to see if there's mention of settlement duration.\n\nAlternatively, use `search_document_regex` to look for phrases like \"settlement duration\" or \"deadline\" across all documents. But the user's policy says to avoid broad patterns. The pattern should be specific. Maybe search for \"May 17\" since that's in the existing evidence, but that might not find other dates. Or search for \"signed into law\" to find similar clauses.\n\nWait, the existing value is \"12 days: Settlement Maps to be passed by both chambers and signed into law by May 17, 2022\". So maybe other documents have similar phrases. Let me think of a regex pattern. Maybe something like \"signed into law on or before \\w+ \\d{1,2}, \\d{4}\".\n\nBut the user's instructions say to use `search_document_regex` when the target is patternable. The deadline dates are specific, so a regex might help find other documents with similar deadlines. However, the document catalog shows other documents are unvisited, so maybe reading the most relevant ones first is better.\n\nThe next step should be to read a document that's likely to contain settlement terms. The Third Amended Complaint is a good candidate. It's a complaint, which might have settlement details. Let's check its name: \"Third Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\". It's possible that the complaint mentions the settlement agreement's terms, like the timeline.\n\nSo, I'll choose `read_document` for \"Third Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" starting from token 0 to 10,000 (since it's 24k tokens, but max 10k per read). That should cover the beginning where settlement terms might be discussed.\n\nWait, but the existing value already has a 12-day period. Maybe there's another document that specifies a different duration. For example, the Settlement Agreement might have a monitoring period, but it was fully read. The Status Update was the one with the timeline. So maybe there's no other value, but I need to confirm.\n\nBut the user's task is to extract EVERY distinct value. So if there's another document with a different duration, I need to find it. If not, then the checklist is complete. But since there are other documents, I should check them.\n\nThe safest move is to read the next most relevant document. The Third Amended Complaint is likely to reference the settlement, so I'll read that. Let's go with `read_document` for that document, tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Third Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Third Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7084, "completion_tokens": 1119, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The progress shows 1 out of 1 keys filled. But wait, the user's task is to extract EVERY distinct value. So maybe there are more values in other documents.\n\nThe available documents include the Third Amended Complaint, which they've partially read (tokens 0-10000). The other documents are unvisited. The Status Update and Settlement Agreement are fully visited. The Third Amended Complaint has 24,060 tokens, and they've read the first 10,000 tokens. The remaining tokens (10,001-24,060) might contain more settlement duration info.\n\nWait, the current step says they read the Third Amended Complaint up to tokens 0-10000. The text provided ends at page 20, which might be around token 10,000. But maybe the settlement duration is mentioned later in the document. The Status Update already provided one value: \"12 days: Settlement Maps to be passed by both chambers and signed into law by May 17, 2022.\"\n\nBut the checklist requires all distinct values. So maybe there's another value in the Third Amended Complaint beyond the first 10k tokens. Since they've only read up to token 10,000, they need to read the next part. The document is partially visited (42% coverage), so the next step should be to read the next unvisited token range.\n\nThe maximum per read is 10,000 tokens. The document has 24k tokens, so after 10k, there's 14k left. They can read from 10001 to 20000 (10k tokens) next. But the tool requires start_token inclusive and end_token exclusive. So start at 10001, end at 20001.\n\nWait, the current viewed tokens are 0-10000, so the next range should be 10001 to 20001 (10,000 tokens). That's within the limit.

The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", and they need every distinct value with evidence.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they've already read three documents. The Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation (tokens 0-2205) had a key sentence: \"The Settlement Maps will be passed by both chambers of the Legislature, presented to the Governor on or before May 12, 2022, and signed into law on or before May 17, 2022.\" So they extracted a value of \"12 days: Settlement Maps to be passed by both chambers and signed into law by May 17, 2022\" from that document.\n\nNow, the current status shows that the Third Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief has been partially read (tokens 0-20001, 83% coverage). The user needs to check if there's more settlement duration information in the remaining tokens of that document or other unvisited documents.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about settlement duration, which should be in settlement agreements or related documents. The Settlement Agreement and Release (fully visited) was read, but it's just the signature page. The Status Update had the main info. The Third Amended Complaint is about the lawsuit, not the settlement terms. So maybe the settlement duration is only in the Status Update.\n\nBut the user has a document called \"Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation\" which was fully visited. The extracted value came from there. The Third Amended Complaint might not have settlement duration details. Let me check the provided text of the Third Amended Complaint.\n\nLooking at the Third Amended Complaint (tokens 0-20001), it's a legal complaint about redistricting, not the settlement terms. The settlement was mentioned in the Status Update. The Third Amended Complaint's content is about the lawsuit's background, not the settlement agreement. So probably no more settlement duration info there.\n\nOther unvisited documents like Dockets, Orders, etc., might not contain settlement duration. The Settlement Agreement and Release was fully read (only 701 tokens, just signatures), and the Status Update was fully read. So maybe the only value is the one already extracted.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if there's only one value, that's it.

The settlement terms were in the Status Update and Settlement Agreement.\n\nWait, the Status Update is a motion filed by the plaintiff stating the settlement terms. The Settlement Agreement is the actual agreement. The Third Amended Complaint is the lawsuit, which might reference the settlement but not the duration. Let me check the provided text of the Third Amended Complaint.\n\nIn the Third Amended Complaint (tokens 0-20001), the only mention of settlement is in footnote 1: \"Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their claims in the Second Amended Complaint regarding challenged state House districts adopted in H. 4493 based on an agreement pending legislative action.\" But that's about the dismissal due to the settlement agreement, not the duration itself. The duration was already covered in the Status Update.\n\nSo the only value for How_Long_Settlement_will_Last is the one already extracted. The user should verify if there are any other mentions in the remaining tokens of the Third Amended Complaint. But given the document's content, it's unlikely. The other unvisited documents are docket entries, orders, etc., which probably don't contain settlement duration.\n\nWait, the user's action history shows Step 6 was reading the Third Amended Complaint from tokens 10001-20001. The next logical step would be to check if there's more in the remaining tokens (20001-24060) or if it's safe to conclude that no more values exist.\n\nBut the problem states that the settlement duration is only in the Status Update. The Settlement Agreement (fully visited) didn't have the duration details, just signatures. The Status Update had the key sentence. So probably, the only value is the one extracted.\n\nThe current status shows all keys are filled (1/1), so the next action should be to stop. Wait, the checklist summary says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", \"Empty Keys: 0/1\", \"Not Applicable: 0/1\". So all required keys are filled. The user needs to stop.\n\nBut the user's previous step was reading the Third Amended Complaint up to 20001 tokens. The document is 24,060 tokens, so there's 4,059 tokens left. However, since the document is a complaint, not a settlement, it's unlikely to have more settlement duration info. The user should probably call get_checklist to verify, but according to the process, after extracting the value, they should append or update, then check if done.\n\nWait, they already used append_checklist in Step 4. Now, after reading the Third Amended Complaint, they need to check if there's anything new. But the Third Amended Complaint doesn't have settlement duration. So no new values. Therefore, all keys are done. The next step is to stop.\n\nBut the system says to stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Here, the key is filled with one value. So the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All required checklist items (How_Long_Settlement_will_Last) have been fully extracted with one distinct value from Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation.

The user wants me to extract the settlement duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Settlement_will_Last\", which needs to capture the duration of settlement obligations, not incorporated into court orders.\n\nLooking at the current status: they've already extracted one value from \"Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation\". The evidence is about the Settlement Maps needing to be passed by both chambers and signed into law by May 17, 2022. The value is \"12 days: Settlement Maps to be passed by both chambers and signed into law by May 17, 2022\".\n\nNow, the user has read the \"Third Amended Complaint\" document up to tokens 20001, but the excerpt provided doesn't mention any settlement duration. The document is about redistricting and voting rights, not settlements. The other documents are unvisited, but the checklist item specifically asks for settlement duration, which would likely be in settlement agreements or related documents.\n\nThe available documents include \"Settlement Agreement and Release\" which is fully visited (tokens 0-701), but the prior action (Step 2) already read it. The \"Status Update Regarding Settlement by Legislation\" is also fully visited. The other documents like Dockets, Orders, etc., seem to be court-related but not settlement agreements. The \"Third Amended Complaint\" is a complaint, not a settlement document.\n\nSince the only document that mentions a settlement is the \"Status Update\", and the \"Settlement Agreement\" was already read, there's no other document likely to contain settlement duration. The user's step 7 called stop after finding one value, and the system's automatic check shows 1/1 filled. The current status shows all keys are filled, so stopping is appropriate.\n\nThe user has already done the extraction, and no other documents are relevant for settlement duration. The remaining documents are court orders, complaints, dockets—none would contain settlement terms.
