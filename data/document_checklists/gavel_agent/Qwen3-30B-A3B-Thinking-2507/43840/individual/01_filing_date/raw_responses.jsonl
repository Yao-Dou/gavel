The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The Snapshot mentions that the Document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. So, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of documents. That's the first step before I can read any documents or search them. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't available yet. So, the next action must be list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3091, "completion_tokens": 174, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs the filing date extracted from legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, and it's currently empty. There are 18 documents, all unvisited.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where the filing date is most likely to be. In legal cases, the filing date is often on the complaint or the docket. The Complaint documents (the first two listed) probably have the initial filing date. The Docket entries might also list it, especially Docket (001) which is the first entry.\n\nSince the user mentioned \"first filed/initiated,\" the Complaint is the best place to start. The first document is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Three Judge Panel Requested\" with 14,907 tokens. It's unvisited, so I should read it. But the token count is over 10k, so I need to read a window. Wait, the max for read_document is 10k tokens. The complaint is 14k, so I'll have to split it. But the first part might have the filing date. Usually, the filing date is near the top of the document, like in the caption.\n\nSo, I'll start by reading the first 10,000 tokens of the first Complaint document. That's the most likely place. Using read_document with start_token 0 and end_token 10000. That's within the limit. The next step after reading would be to look for the date in that text and then append it to the checklist. But for now, the first action should be to read the document's beginning.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Three Judge Panel Requested\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Three Judge Panel Requested", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3659, "completion_tokens": 406, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot with the current status.\n\nLooking at the Recent Actions, Step 1 was list_documents which found 18 documents. Step 2 was read_document on the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Three Judge Panel Requested, tokens 0-10000. The extracted text shows that the document has \"Date Filed 10/12/21\" on page 1. So the filing date is October 12, 2021.\n\nThe current status says Filing_Date is empty, but we just found it in the document. So the next step should be to append this value to the checklist. The evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text says \"Date Filed 10/12/21\" and it's on page 1 of the document. The document name is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Three Judge Panel Requested\" and the location is \"Page 1 of 30\" as per the header.\n\nI need to use append_checklist because this is a new entry. The key is Filing_Date, and the value is \"10/12/21\". The evidence should have the text snippet, document name, and location. The text is \"Date Filed 10/12/21\", source is the document name, location is \"Page 1 of 30\" (or maybe just \"Page 1\" but the header says \"Page 1 of 30\").\n\nWait, the document's token range read was 0-10000, and the date appears early on, so it's in the viewed tokens. Since we found the value, we should append it. There's no need for search_document_regex here because we already read the document and found the date. The checklist item is empty, so appending the value is correct. The Not Applicable encoding isn't needed here because we have a valid date. So the next action is append_checklist with the extracted value.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Filing_Date\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"10/12/21\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Date Filed 10/12/21\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Three Judge Panel Requested\", \"location\": \"Page 1 of 30\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "10/12/21", "evidence": [{"text": "Date Filed 10/12/21", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Three Judge Panel Requested", "location": "Page 1 of 30"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14269, "completion_tokens": 562, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the filing date from legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, and they need every distinct value with evidence.\n\nLooking at the recent actions: Step 1 was list_documents, found 18 docs. Step 2 read the first 10k tokens of the Complaint document. In that read, they found \"Date Filed 10/12/21\" on page 1. Step 3 appended that to Filing_Date.\n\nCurrent status shows Filing_Date has 1 value, and all other keys (but there's only one key) are filled. The document catalog shows 18 docs, but only the Complaint was partially read (0-10000 tokens). The other docs are unvisited.\n\nWait, the task is to extract EVERY distinct value. So I need to check if there are other documents that might have a different filing date. But the Complaint's filing date is 10/12/21. However, maybe other documents in the case have different filing dates? For example, amended complaints or docket entries might have different dates.\n\nThe available documents include \"Third Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" which might have a different filing date. Also, the Docket entries (001, 002) could list the initial filing date or subsequent filings.\n\nThe user's instruction says to extract every distinct value. So even if the main complaint has 10/12/21, maybe the amended complaint has a later date. But the initial filing date should be the same as the main complaint. Wait, the main complaint is the initial filing, so the amended one would have a later filing date. But the checklist says \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So the first filing date is what's needed, not subsequent amendments. So the Third Amended Complaint would have a filing date after the initial, but the initial is already captured from the Complaint.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe check if the docket entries have the initial filing date. The Docket (001) might list the initial filing date. For example, in court dockets, the first entry is usually the complaint filing date.\n\nSo the next step should be to check the Docket (001) document, which is unvisited. Since the Complaint already has the date, but to confirm, maybe the docket lists it. However, the user's requirement is to extract every distinct value. If the docket says the same date, it's redundant. But maybe there's a different date in another document. Wait, but the initial filing should be the same across all documents. However, sometimes the docket might have a different format or a different entry.\n\nBut the main point: the Complaint's first page shows \"Date Filed 10/12/21\", so that's the initial filing. The task is to extract that. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the date the lawsuit was first filed. So the value is 10/12/21. The user might have only one value.\n\nBut the system says \"extract EVERY distinct value\". So if all documents have the same date, then only one value. But to be sure, maybe check the Docket to confirm. However, the Docket (001) is a document that might list the filing date. Since the Complaint already provided it, maybe it's redundant, but the instructions say to extract from all documents. Wait, no, the requirement is to extract every distinct value found in any document. So if the Docket (001) also says the same date, it's the same value, so no need to add it again. But if it's a different date, then it's a new value.\n\nBut the initial filing date should be consistent. So the key is to confirm that there's only one distinct value. However, the user's current state shows Filing_Date has 1 value. The next action should be to check if there are other documents that might have the same or different values. But since the checklist is only one item, and it's already filled, maybe it's time to stop.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning all keys are filled. The checklist has only Filing_Date. So if that's the only key, and it's filled, then the stop criteria are met. The user's goal is to extract the filing date, which they've done. The evidence is from the Complaint document. The other documents might have the same date, but since it's the same value, it's not a new entry. So the extraction is complete.\n\nThe instructions say: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either: Complete: all relevant values present... or Not Applicable.\"\n\nHere, Filing_Date is complete with one value. So the next action should be to stop.\n\nBut wait, the available documents include other unvisited ones. However, the task is to extract the filing date, which is the initial filing. The initial filing is in the Complaint, so the value is known. The other documents might not have a different filing date. For example, the Third Amended Complaint would have a later date, but that's not the initial filing. The checklist specifies \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed\", so only the initial date matters. So even if the amended complaint has a different date, it's not relevant here. Therefore, the value 10/12/21 is the only one needed.\n\nThus, all keys are filled, so the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"Filing_Date extracted from Complaint with evidence (10/12/21), all checklist items completed with no remaining empty/Not Applicable keys.\"\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": null, "args": null, "decision": "stop", "reason": "Filing_Date extracted from Complaint with evidence (10/12/21), all checklist items completed with no remaining empty/Not Applicable keys.", "remaining_empty_keys": [], "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 14391, "completion_tokens": 1232, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The system is prompting me to decide if I should stop again or continue.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract EVERY distinct value. The complaint document has \"10/12/21\" as the filing date. But the system's current state says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and the checklist is marked as filled. However, the complaint document is only partially visited (67% coverage, tokens 0-10000). The document has 14,907 tokens, so there's more to read. Could there be another filing date in the rest of the document?\n\nBut the filing date is usually on the first page or in the docket entry. The text they read shows \"Date Filed 10/12/21\" on the first page. The rest of the document might not have another filing date. The other documents like Docket entries might have different dates, but the checklist item is specifically for the initial filing date of the lawsuit. The complaint is the initial filing, so the docket entries might reference it but not have a new filing date.\n\nThe system's get_checklist shows Filing_Date has 1 value. The user's instruction says to extract every distinct value. Since the complaint is the initial document, the filing date should be there. The other documents (like Docket (001)) might have the same date, but it's redundant. The task is to get the initial filing date, which is in the complaint.\n\nThe user has already extracted \"10/12/21\" from the complaint. The system's status says it's filled. The stop attempt 1/2 is asking if they should stop. Since the checklist only has one item and it's filled, and the system's get_checklist confirms it's done, the next logical step is to stop again. But the system says \"stop attempt 1/2\" and will accept a second stop as final.\n\nWait, the user's step 4 called stop, but the system ran get_checklist automatically, and now it's stop attempt 1/2. So this is the second chance to stop. Since all keys are filled (only one key), and there's no indication of missing values, the correct action is to stop again. The evidence is already there from the complaint. No need to read more documents because the filing date is already found in the first document. The other documents might not have a different filing date; they might be subsequent entries.\n\nSo the answer should be to stop with the reason that the Filing_Date is extracted and all checklist items are complete.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"Filing_Date extracted from Complaint (10/12/21) with verified evidence.
