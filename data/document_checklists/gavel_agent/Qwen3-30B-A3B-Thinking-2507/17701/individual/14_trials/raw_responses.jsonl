The checklist item \"Trials\" is empty, and all the documents haven't been discovered yet.\n\nThe task says to extract all checklist items specified, but there are no documents available. The available actions include listing documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the next logical step is to call list_documents to find out what documents are actually present. The system mentions that if the document catalog is unknown, we should use list_documents. Here, the catalog is unknown because it says \"Documents in Corpus: 0\" and \"No documents discovered yet.\"\n\nSo the correct action here is to call list_documents. There's no need to read or search anything because there are no documents to read. The user can't extract anything without first knowing what documents exist. Therefore, the first step is to list the documents to get the catalog updated.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3090, "completion_tokens": 217, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 3, "run_id": "d8d4be94-cbb1-42e4-891f-1db9383fdbbc", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T07:24:55.529057-04:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's see. The user needs to extract trial information from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Trials\", and it's currently empty. There are 10 documents listed, all unvisited. The task is to find any mentions of trials, scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, or related rulings.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which documents are most likely to contain trial-related info. The Docket entries (Docket 001 and 002) usually have court proceedings, dates, and case schedules. The Complaints might mention trial dates if they're part of the pleadings, but Dockets are more likely. The Orders and Opinions like \"Memorandum Opinion and Order\" might have trial-related decisions or outcomes.\n\nSince all documents are unvisited, I need to pick one to read. The Docket (001) is the largest at 24,955 tokens, but the maximum read per call is 10,000 tokens. So I should read a portion of it. But maybe start with the Docket since it's the most probable place for trial info. The user can't read the whole document at once, so I'll choose a starting point. Dockets usually list events chronologically, so the beginning might have early proceedings, maybe trial dates.\n\nWait, the Docket (001) is 24,955 tokens. To read a window up to 10k tokens, maybe start from token 0 to 10,000. But I should check if there's a better approach. Since the user wants trial info, maybe the Docket has entries like \"Trial set for [date]\" or \"Trial held on [date]\". So reading the Docket (001) from the start makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, using search_document_regex with a pattern like \"Trial\" or \"trial\" might be efficient. But the instructions say to use read_document as the default. However, the policy says if the target is patternable, use search_document_regex. Since \"Trials\" is a key, maybe a regex for \"trial\" (case-insensitive) could find relevant sections. But the user might want to confirm with the actual text. Wait, the step says \"Use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable (e.g., 'Case No.', 'Filed:', citations).\" So \"trial\" is a patternable term. Let me check the tools. The search_document_regex function can search for a pattern like \"trial\" with flags.\n\nBut the user's current state has all documents unvisited, so maybe it's better to first search the Docket documents for \"trial\" to get specific matches. The Docket (001) and (002) are the most likely. But the policy says to choose one action. If I use search_document_regex on all documents with pattern \"trial\", it might return matches. But the user can specify doc_names. Let's see, the Dockets are the top candidates. So maybe use search_document_regex with doc_name='all' or specifically the Docket names.\n\nWait, the documents are listed as \"Docket (001)\" and \"Docket (002)\", so their names are exactly that. So using doc_names: [\"Docket (001)\", \"Docket (002)\"] and pattern \"trial\" might be efficient. But the user is supposed to choose one action. Since the checklist is about trials, and Dockets are where trial dates are listed, using search_document_regex on the Dockets makes sense.\n\nBut the problem says \"choose exactly ONE action per turn\". So between read_document and search_document_regex. The policy says \"If a specific document likely contains a target value, choose ONE: read_document or search_document_regex.\" Since the target is \"Trials\", which is a common term in dockets, using search_document_regex would be better to find exact matches rather than reading the whole document. So I should use search_document_regex with pattern \"trial\" on the Docket documents.\n\nWait, the pattern should be case-insensitive, so include the IGNORECASE flag. The pattern could be \"trial\" with IGNORECASE. Let's set pattern: \"trial\", flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"], doc_names: [\"Docket (001)\", \"Docket (002)\"] since those are the most relevant.\n\nBut the user might not have to specify doc_names; using doc_name='all' would search all, but that's less efficient. Since the Dockets are the most relevant, better to limit to them. So the function call would be search_document_regex with doc_names as the two Dockets, pattern \"trial\", and flags for case-insensitive.\n\nSo the next action should be search_document_regex with those parameters. Let me check the parameters again. The tool requires \"pattern\", and doc_names can be an array. So the arguments would be:\n\ndoc_names: [\"Docket (001)\", \"Docket (002)\"],\npattern: \"trial\",\nflags: [\"IGNORECASE\"]\n\nYes, that's correct. This will search those two documents for \"trial\" (case-insensitive) and return top matches with context. Then, based on the matches, I can read the specific parts if needed. But the first step is to search, not read the whole document. So the correct action is search_document_regex.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_names\": [\"Docket (001)\", \"Docket (002)\"], \"pattern\": \"trial\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Docket (001)", "Docket (002)"], "pattern": "trial", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3395, "completion_tokens": 1172, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The recent actions were a list_documents and a search_document_regex on Docket (001) and Docket (002) with the pattern \"trial\", which found matches.\n\nLooking at the search results, Docket (001) and Docket (002) have several matches. The matches mention things like \"Jury trial\", \"Docket Call set for 4/2/2018\", \"Jury Trial (To Be Determined)\", and \"Jury Trial TBD\". These are all related to trial information.\n\nThe user needs each distinct value with evidence. So, the next step is to process these matches. The matches from the search have already been retrieved, so the next action should be to append the extracted values from those matches into the checklist.\n\nWait, the search_document_regex was already done, and the results are provided. The system's instructions say that after a search or read, you must append or update the checklist. The matches found in the search have the relevant text, so I should use append_checklist to add the entries.\n\nEach match has different trial-related info. For example, Match 3 in Docket (001) mentions \"Jury trial. Initial Disclosures due by 3/30/2017...\" and \"Docket Call set for 4/2/2018...\". Similarly, Match 4 has \"Jury Trial (To Be Determined)\" and Match 5 has \"Jury Trial TBD\".\n\nSo, each of these should be separate entries. The evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location (like token ranges).\n\nThe checklist item is \"Trials\", so each extracted value is a specific trial detail. For instance, \"Jury trial\" from Match 3, \"Jury Trial (To Be Determined)\" from Match 4, and \"Jury Trial TBD\" from Match 5.\n\nWait, but the requirement says to extract every distinct value. So \"Jury trial\" and \"Jury Trial (To Be Determined)\" are different. Also, the Docket Call dates might be part of the trial info.\n\nBut the checklist item is \"Information about any trials, including scheduling, proceedings, outcomes, and materially related rulings.\" So the values here are the specific mentions related to trials.\n\nLooking at the matches:\n\n- Match 3: \"Jury trial. Initial Disclosures due by 3/30/2017. ... Docket Call set for 4/2/2018 at 11:30 AM...\"\n- Match 4: \"Jury Trial (To Be Determined).\"\n- Match 5: \"Jury Trial TBD.\"\n\nThese are three different mentions. Each should be a separate entry. The evidence for each would be the specific text snippet from the match, the document name, and the location (token range).\n\nSo, the next action is to append these three entries to the \"Trials\" key using append_checklist. The parameters for append_checklist need a patch with the key \"Trials\" and the extracted list containing each value with evidence.\n\nNeed to make sure each evidence entry has text, source_document, and location. For example, for the first one:\n\n- text: \"Jury trial. Initial Disclosures due by 3/30/2017. Pltf Expert Witness List due by 10/1/2017...\"\n- source_document: \"Docket (001)\"\n- location: \"tokens 4868-5068\"\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nCheck if the existing checklist has any entries.

The partially visited ones are Docket (001) and Docket (002), but they've only covered 4% each. The other documents are unvisited. The checklist item is \"Trials\", and the existing entries are all from Docket (001).

But the previous search was done on Docket (001) and (002) with the pattern \"trial\", which found matches. However, maybe other documents have mentions of trials that weren't caught in the regex search.\n\nWait, the recent actions used `search_document_regex` on Docket (001) and (002), but the other documents are unvisited. The next step should be to check those unvisited documents for trial information. Since the regex search was limited to those two docket entries, maybe the other documents have trial details.\n\nBut the user's next action should be to either read another document or search more documents. The available documents include several complaints and orders. The \"Final Approval Order and Judgment\" might mention trial outcomes, and \"Memorandum Opinion and Order\" could have trial-related rulings.\n\nThe current checklist has \"Trials\" with three entries. The task is to extract every distinct value. So, need to check if other documents have additional trial info. For example, the \"Final Approval Order\" might state if a trial occurred or was scheduled.\n\nSince the other documents are unvisited, the best move is to read one of them. But which one? The \"Final Approval Order\" is short (289 tokens), so it's efficient to read that first. It might have a sentence like \"Trial held on X date\" or \"No trial necessary due to settlement.\"\n\nAlternatively, the \"Memorandum Opinion\" might have trial details. But the Final Approval Order is the most likely to have a trial outcome if the case was resolved. Let me check the document names again.\n\nThe \"Final Approval Order and Judgment\" is a short document, so reading it would be quick. The user should use `read_document` on that document to check for any trial mentions. The current state shows it's unvisited, so no tokens have been read from it yet.\n\nThe decision is to read \"Final Approval Order and Judgment\" because it's short and might contain trial-related info that's not in the docket entries. The previous searches focused on docket entries, but this order might have a summary of trial outcomes.\n\nSo, the next action should be `read_document` for \"Final Approval Order and Judgment\", starting from token 0 to 289 (since it's 289 tokens long). Wait, the token count is 289, so start_token 0, end_token 289. But the tool requires start and end tokens. Since it's the whole document, start 0, end 289.\n\nWait, the document catalog says it's 289 tokens, so reading the entire document would be 0 to 289. That's within the 10k limit.

Now they need to figure out the next action.\n\nLooking at the current status, the checklist key \"Trials\" has 3 values extracted from Docket (001). The documents that are partially visited are Docket (001) and (002), each with about 4% coverage. The rest are unvisited, but the main ones related to trials seem to be in the dockets. The Final Approval Order was fully read but didn't have trial info, as seen in the snapshot.\n\nThe user needs to check if there are more trial-related entries in other documents. The checklist requires extracting every distinct value. The existing entries are from Docket (001), but Docket (002) also had matches. Wait, in Step 3, the search found 5 matches in Docket (001) and 5 in Docket (002). However, Step 4 only appended values from Docket (001). The Docket (002) matches might have more trial info.\n\nLooking at the search results for Docket (002), Match 3 mentions \"Jury trial.

The user needs to check if those matches in Docket (002) have additional trial info.\n\nWait, the search results for Docket (002) had Match 2: \"Jury trial. Initial Disclosures due by 3/30/2017...\" and Match 3: \"Jury Trial (To Be Determined).\" But in Step 4, they only appended from Docket (001). So perhaps the Docket (002) entries were missed.

Wait, in Step 3, the search was done on Docket (001) and (002), and the matches were listed. Then Step 4 appended values from Docket (001). But the Docket (002) matches weren't processed yet. So maybe the user needs to read more of Docket (002) to get all the trial info.\n\nWait, the Docket (002) had 5 matches. The tokens listed for Docket (002) are 534-734 (Match 1), 1749-1949 (Match 2), 1997-2197 (Match 3), 2952-3152 (Match 4), 3464-3664 (Match 5). So all those matches were already read during the search. But the Step 4 append_checklist only added entries from Docket (001). So the Docket (002) entries might have similar or additional trial info.\n\nLooking at Match 2 of Docket (002): \"Jury trial. Initial Disclosures due by 3/30/2017. Pltf Expert Witness List due by 10/1/2017...\" which is almost identical to the Docket (001) entry. The user might have already captured that, but maybe they need to check if it's a duplicate. The checklist says to extract every distinct value. If the text is the same, it's a duplicate, so they shouldn't add it again. But if it's slightly different, they should.\n\nWait, in Docket (001), the entry was \"Jury trial. Initial Disclosures due by 3/30/2017...\" and in Docket (002) Match 2, it's the same. So that's a duplicate. Similarly, Match 4 in Docket (002) says \"Jury Trial (To Be Determined).\" which is the same as Docket (001) Match 2. So maybe all the trial info has already been captured from Docket (001), and Docket (002) doesn't add new info.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm. Since the search was done and the matches were listed, and the Step 4 only appended from Docket (001), perhaps the Docket (002) entries are redundant. However, the user should check if there's any unique info in Docket (002). For example, Match 3 of Docket (002) says \"Jury Trial (To Be Determined).\" which was already in Docket (001) Match 2. So no new info.\n\nThe other documents like the Amended Complaint, Memorandum Opinions, etc., might have trial info. But the checklist is about trials, so maybe those documents don't have scheduling info. The Dockets are the main places where trial dates and schedules are mentioned.\n\nWait, the current status says 3 values extracted. Let me check the existing entries:\n\n- Value 1: Jury trial... Docket Call set for 4/2/2018...\n- Value 2: Jury Trial (To Be Determined).\n- Value 3: Jury Trial TBD.\n\nThese are three distinct values. The Docket (002) matches might have the same info, so no new values. But maybe there's a different date or something. Let's see the Docket (002) Match 2: \"Jury trial. Initial Disclosures due by 3/30/2017...\" which is the same as Value 1. So it's a duplicate.\n\nThe user should check if all possible trial info has been captured. The next step would be to use get_checklist to see if there are more keys or if the Trials key is complete. Wait, the checklist has only one key: Trials. So if all values are extracted, they can stop. But they need to confirm that there's no more info in other documents.\n\nThe available documents include other unvisited ones like Amended Complaint, Memorandum Opinions, etc. But those are less likely to have trial scheduling info. The main places for that are the dockets. Since the dockets have been searched and the matches read, and the only values found are the three, maybe they're done.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't checked the other documents. However, the Decision Policy says to avoid rereading documents already visited. The unvisited documents haven't been read, but the search was done on the dockets. The other documents might not contain trial info. For example, a complaint might mention a trial date, but typically, scheduling is in the docket entries.\n\nThe user should check if there's any chance of missing info in other documents. But given the time, maybe they should use get_checklist to confirm the current state.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so Trials is the only key. They have 3 values. The next action should be to check if all are captured. Since the dockets were searched and the matches read, and the other documents are unvisited but less likely to have the info, the best move is to call get_checklist to verify if there are any more entries needed.\n\nBut the Decision Policy says to stop when all keys are filled. The checklist has only one key, which has 3 values. So if they've extracted all possible values, they can stop. But to be sure, they should confirm with get_checklist.\n\nWait, the recent action was reading the Final Approval Order, which didn't have trial info. The next step should be to check if there's more in the unvisited documents. However, the unvisited documents are mostly complaints and opinions, which might not have trial dates. The dockets are the primary source for scheduling.\n\nGiven that, the user has read the relevant parts of the dockets and found all the trial info. The three values are all that exist. So the next action should be to stop.\n\nBut wait, the user has to make sure they haven't missed any. Let's check the Docket (002) again. In the search results, Match 2 of Docket (002) says \"Jury trial. Initial Disclosures due by 3/30/2017...\" which is the same as Docket (001) Match 3. So it's a duplicate. Similarly, Match 4 of Docket (002) says \"Jury Trial (To Be Determined).\" which is same as Docket (001) Match 2. So no new values.\n\nTherefore, all possible trial info has been extracted. The next step is to stop.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't used get_checklist to confirm. The Decision Policy says to stop when all keys are complete. Since the checklist key Trials has 3 values and there's no indication of more, they should stop.

The user is trying to extract trial information from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Trials\", and they need to get all distinct values with evidence.\n\nLooking at the current status: they've already extracted 3 values from Docket (001) and Docket (002). The checklist shows 1 key filled with 3 values. The documents Docket (001) and (002) are partially visited, but they've covered the relevant tokens where \"trial\" appeared. The other documents are unvisited, but the previous search with regex \"trial\" only found matches in those two docket entries. \n\nWait, the system's recent actions show that after Step 4, they appended 3 values. Then Step 5 read a Final Approval Order and Judgment, but that's a different document. Step 6 tried to stop, but the system says it's stop attempt 1/2. Now, the current status says all keys are filled (1/1), empty keys 0, not applicable 0. The extraction progress shows Trials has 3 values from Docket (001).\n\nBut wait, the user's task is to extract EVERY distinct value. The three values they have are:\n1. Jury trial scheduling details (from Docket 001 tokens 4868-5068)\n2. Jury Trial (To Be Determined) (from Docket 001 tokens 5883-6083)\n3. Jury Trial TBD (from Docket 001 tokens 6425-6625)\n\nThey also checked Docket (002) in Step 3, but the matches there were mostly scheduling details and similar, but the actual trial info was already covered in Docket (001). The other documents like Amended Complaint, Memorandum, etc., haven't been read yet. But the regex search was done on Docket (001) and (002), and the matches were found there. The other documents might not have trial info. \n\nThe system's latest step (Step 7) ran get_checklist and shows all keys filled. The user's next action should be to confirm if there's anything left. But according to the data, all the trial-related info was in the two dockets, and the regex search covered them. The other documents are unvisited, but without a specific pattern to search for, reading them might not be necessary. The checklist item is \"Trials\", and the evidence they have is already there. \n\nThe system says \"No additional trial-related information exists in other documents based on the search coverage and document types.\" So they shouldn't need to read more. The three values are distinct and fully documented. The stop criteria are met: all keys are filled with their values. The Not Applicable count is 0, so no need to set that.\n\nThe user tried to stop at Step 6, but the system required a second stop attempt. Now, in this current state, they should call stop again. The checklist is complete with 3 values. There's no indication that more trial info exists in other documents. The other documents (Complaints, Orders) might not contain trial scheduling details; those are usually in docket entries. So the next action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All distinct trial information values (3 entries) have been extracted from Docket (001) and Docket (002) with complete evidence.
