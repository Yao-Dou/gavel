The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The \"Available Documents\" section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call `list_documents`. The snapshot mentions that the document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. The user can't read any documents if there aren't any, so the next logical step is to list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none listed, those can't be used yet. `get_checklist` would just show empty results, and `append` or `update` aren't applicable without data.

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there are several complaints and dockets. The Docket entries usually contain filing dates, so the Docket (001) and Docket (002) are probably the best places to start. The Complaints might have the date in the header or somewhere, but dockets are more likely to have the official filing date.\n\nThe current status shows all keys are empty, and the documents are all unvisited. The user just did list_documents, so the catalog is known. Next step should be to read a document. Since dockets are more likely to have the filing date, I should pick Docket (001) first. The Docket (001) is 24,955 tokens, which is over 10k, so I need to read a window. But the instructions say to read up to 10k tokens. Let me check the token count. The document is 24,955 tokens, so I can read the first 10k tokens to see if the filing date is there.\n\nWait, the Docket entries usually have the filing date at the top. So reading the beginning of Docket (001) should have it. I'll use read_document on Docket (001) from start_token 0 to 10,000. That's the maximum allowed. Then, after reading, check the text for the date. If found, append it to Filing_Date with evidence. If not, maybe check the next document or use regex.\n\nBut the current action needs to be one step. Since the document is unvisited, the first action should be to read a part of it. So the correct next action is read_document for Docket (001) from 0 to 10000 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket (001)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket (001)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3396, "completion_tokens": 465, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that the user has already read the first 10,000 tokens of Docket (001), and in that text, there's a line that says \"Date Filed: 12/05/2016\" right at the beginning of the docket entry.\n\nSo, the checklist item Filing_Date should have the value \"12/05/2016\" with evidence from the document. The document name is Docket (001), and the location is the start of the docket, probably the header. The token range read was 0-10000, so the location could be mentioned as \"top of document\" or \"docket header\".\n\nI need to check if there are other possible filing dates in the document. Looking through the text, the first entry under \"Date Filed\" is 12/05/2016, and later entries like \"12/05/2016\" for docket entries are dates of filings of other documents, but the case's initial filing date is the one in the header. The case number is 4:16-cv-03577, and the date filed is 12/05/2016. So that's the correct value.\n\nNo other dates in the header for filing. The user needs to append this value. The evidence should include the exact text \"Date Filed: 12/05/2016\" from Docket (001), location as the header section. Since the document was partially visited (0-10000 tokens), and the date is in that range, it's valid.\n\nSo the next action is to append the Filing_Date with the extracted value. The parameters for append_checklist would be a patch with key \"Filing_Date\", extracted as a list containing the value with evidence. The evidence must have text, source_document, and location. The text is \"Date Filed: 12/05/2016\", source is \"Docket (001)\", location is probably \"Case header\" or \"Top of docket entry\".\n\nWait, the location in the evidence needs to be specific. The text shows \"Hernandez et al v City Of Houston Date Filed: 12/05/2016\". So the location could be \"Case header line\" or \"Docket header\". The token range isn't specified beyond 0-10000, but since it's in the first part, maybe just \"header\" is sufficient.\n\nSo the append_checklist call should have the key \"Filing_Date\", extracted list with one entry having value \"12/05/2016\", evidence with text \"Date Filed: 12/05/2016\", source_document \"Docket (001)\", location \"Case header\".\n\nNo other values for Filing_Date are present in the text read so far.

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user has already done Steps 1-3, and Step 3 was appending the Filing_Date value \"12/05/2016\" from Docket (001) using the case header.\n\nLooking at the current status, they have one key (Filing_Date) with one value. The checklist requires extracting every distinct value, so I need to check if there are other instances of the filing date in other documents. The document catalog shows that Docket (001) is partially visited (tokens 0-10000), but the rest are unvisited. However, the Filing_Date is usually in the case header, which is likely in the Docket documents. The user read the first 10k tokens of Docket (001) and found the date. But maybe there's another date in the same document or another document.\n\nWait, the Docket (001) has a \"Date Filed\" in the header as 12/05/2016, and then the docket entries also list dates like 12/05/2016 for the first entries. But the requirement is to extract the initial filing date, which is the same as the case header. So maybe there's only one value. However, the user needs to confirm if there are other documents that might have a different filing date, but since it's a single case, the filing date should be consistent.\n\nWait, the case number is 4:16-cv-03577, which usually indicates the year 2016, so the filing date makes sense. The docket entries start on 12/05/2016, which matches the case header. So the Filing_Date is correctly extracted as 12/05/2016.\n\nThe current status shows 1 value for Filing_Date. The checklist has only one item. The user needs to make sure there are no other values. Since it's a single case, there's only one filing date. The other documents (like the Complaints, Orders) might reference the filing date but not provide a new one. For example, the Class Action Complaint might have the filing date in the caption, but the case header already has it, and the complaint is part of the same case. So the Filing_Date should only have one value.\n\nThe next step: check if there's any other document that might have a different filing date. But given the case structure, it's unlikely. The Docket (001) is partially read, but the case header was found at the start, so the rest of the document probably doesn't have another filing date. The other documents (Complaints, Orders) are likely to have the same case number and date, but the Filing_Date is the initial date, which is already captured.\n\nThe user should confirm if all possible documents have been checked. The current available documents include Docket (001) partially visited, and others unvisited. However, since the filing date is typically in the docket, and they've already found it in Docket (001), there's no need to read other documents. The checklist item is complete with one value. So the next action should be to stop, as all keys are filled.\n\nWait, the system says to stop when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Here, Filing_Date has one value, and it's the only key. So the status shows 1 key with 1 value, empty keys 0, so it's complete. Therefore, the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items (Filing_Date) have been fully extracted with one valid value (12/05/2016) from Docket (001), supported by evidence in the case header.
