The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet. So, the next step is definitely to call list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3141, "completion_tokens": 204, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and they want to know if it's a class action or individual plaintiffs with a description.\n\nFirst, I should check the available documents. There are 10 documents listed, all unvisited. The main ones that might have this info are the complaints and maybe the docket entries. The Amended Class Action Complaint, Class Action Complaint, and Proposed Second Amended Class Action Complaint are the most likely candidates since they mention \"Class Action\" in their titles. The docket entries might reference the status too.\n\nSince the catalog is known (they listed 10 documents), I don't need to call list_documents again. The next step is to read a document that's most likely to contain the relevant info. The Class Action Complaint (7,044 tokens) is a good starting point because it's a complaint, which typically states the nature of the action. The title says \"Class Action Complaint\", so it's probable that the first few pages state that it's a class action.\n\nI should use read_document on the Class Action Complaint. Let's pick the first token range, maybe from 0 to 10,000 tokens, but since the document is 7,044 tokens, the entire document is under 10k. So start_token 0, end_token 7044. That way, I can get the whole document without needing multiple reads.\n\nWait, the document is 7,044 tokens, so reading from 0 to 7044 will cover it all. That's within the 10k limit. So the next action should be read_document for \"Class Action Complaint\" with those token ranges. After reading that, I can check if the text mentions \"Class Action\" in the complaint, which would confirm the value. Then, if found, I'll use append_checklist to add the entry with evidence.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Class Action Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7044}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Class Action Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7044}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3446, "completion_tokens": 459, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that the \"Class Action Complaint\" document was read (tokens 0-7044), and it's marked as fully visited.\n\nLooking at the document text, I see multiple mentions of \"Class Action\" in the complaint. For example, the title says \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\" and in paragraph 29, it states \"the named Plaintiffs bring this action, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, for the purpose of asserting the claims alleged in this Complaint on a common basis.\" Also, the class definition in paragraph 33 refers to \"All persons who were arrested without a warrant...\" and the case is labeled as a class action.\n\nThe checklist item requires the value to be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'. Here, it's clearly a class action, so the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\".\n\nSince the document is fully visited and we've found the relevant evidence, the next step is to append this value to the checklist. The evidence should include the exact text snippets, document name, and location (page numbers). The document mentions \"Class Action\" on page 1 (title) and page 2 (paragraph 29), and page 3 (paragraph 33). I'll need to cite those.\n\nWait, the document's page numbers are in the header: \"Case 4:16-cv-03577 Document 1 Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16 Page 1 of 14\", etc. So the evidence locations would be Page 1, Page 2, Page 3. The exact text from Page 1 has \"Class Action\" in the case caption, and Page 2 has \"Class Action\" in paragraph 29. The user wants all distinct values, but since it's the same value, we just need to include the evidence once. But the instructions say to create separate entries for each unique value. Since it's the same value, maybe one entry suffices, but the evidence can include multiple locations. However, the requirement is to have each extracted value as a separate entry with its own evidence. Wait, the checklist item should have the value once, but the evidence can have multiple sources. Wait, no: each extracted entry (value) should have its own evidence. But since the value is the same (\"Plaintiffs: Class Action\"), we can have one entry with multiple evidence snippets. Wait, no: the evidence is supposed to be a list of evidence supporting the value. So the extracted value is one, and the evidence array includes multiple entries (text, source, location).\n\nWait, the evidence field for each extracted value is an array of evidence objects. So for the value \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", the evidence array can have multiple items (e.g., the text from Page 1, Page 2, etc.). But the problem says \"create separate entries for each unique value\". Since the value is the same, it's one entry with multiple evidence sources.\n\nSo the correct action here is to use append_checklist to add the extracted value with the evidence. The value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\". The evidence should include the exact text snippets from the document where it's mentioned.\n\nLooking at the document:\n\n- Page 1: \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\" in the title.\n- Page 2, paragraph 29: \"the named Plaintiffs bring this action, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, for the purpose of asserting the claims alleged in this Complaint on a common basis.\" and \"This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(a)(1)–(4) and Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"\n\nWait, the exact text on Page 2: \"This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action...\" So the evidence can include that.\n\nSo the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", and the evidence would have entries from Page 1 (the title) and Page 2 (the paragraph). But the user says \"create separate entries for each unique value\", but since the value is the same, it's one entry with multiple evidence items.\n\nWait, the checklist item is a single key, so the extracted list for that key will have one entry (the value), and the evidence for that entry is an array of the supporting evidence snippets.\n\nSo in the append_checklist, the key is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", the extracted array has one object with value \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" and evidence array with multiple evidence objects.\n\nBut the instructions say \"each extracted value should be self-contained with relevant context included.\" So the evidence array should have the exact text snippets.\n\nSo the evidence for the value would be:\n\n1. Text: \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\" (from Page 1)\n2. Text: \"This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action...\" (from Page 2, paragraph 31)\n\nWait, paragraph 31 is on Page 2? Let me check the document. The document says Page 2 of 14, and paragraph 31 is on Page 2. Wait, the document's Page 2 has paragraphs 1-15, then Page 3 starts at paragraph 16. Wait, looking at the text:\n\nPage 1: \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\" is in the title.\n\nPage 2: \"This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(a)(1)–(4) and Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" (paragraph 31)\n\nSo the evidence can include the title and paragraph 31.\n\nTherefore, the extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", and the evidence has two entries: the title text and the paragraph text.\n\nNow, the next action is to append this to the checklist. Since the document is fully visited and we've found the value, we should use append_checklist.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is empty, so we need to add the first value. The instructions say to use append_checklist to add new entries. So the correct function is append_checklist with the patch containing the key and the extracted value with evidence.\n\nThe other documents are unvisited, but since we've found the value in the first document, we don't need to read others unless there's a possibility of multiple values. But the checklist requires all distinct values. Since it's a class action, and the document clearly states it's a class action, there's no individual plaintiffs mentioned. So the value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", and that's the only value.\n\nSo the action is append_checklist with the patch for \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" containing the extracted value and evidence.\n\nCheck the evidence requirements: each evidence entry must have text, source_document, location.\n\nSource_document is \"Class Action Complaint\".\n\nLocation for the title: \"Page 1\" (since it's the title of the document, which is on Page 1).\n\nLocation for the paragraph: \"Page 2, paragraph 31\".\n\nSo the evidence array will have two entries:\n\n1. text: \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\", source_document: \"Class Action Complaint\", location: \"Page 1\"\n2. text: \"This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(a)(1)–(4) and Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\", source_document: \"Class Action Complaint\", location: \"Page 2, paragraph 31\"\n\nWait, but the value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", so the evidence is supporting that value.\n\nTherefore, the append_checklist call should have the key \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the extracted array with one entry (since it's the same value), and the evidence array with two items.\n\nWait, the extracted field for the key is a list of values. Each value is a separate entry. But since the value is the same, it's one entry in the extracted list. So the extracted array for the key has one element, which is the value \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", and that element's evidence is the array of two evidence items.\n\nYes, that's correct. So in the append_checklist, the patch will have the key, and the extracted array with one entry (the value), and that entry's evidence array has two evidence objects.\n\nSo the JSON for the tool call would be:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Class Action Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"text\": \"This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(a)(1)–(4) and Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\",\n              \"source_document\": \"Class Action Complaint\",\n              \"location\": \"Page 2, paragraph 31\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThat's the correct structure. Now, check if this is the only action needed. The checklist item is now filled, so after appending, the key will have one value. Since the user has no other keys to extract, and the task is complete, but the stop criteria require all keys to be filled or Not Applicable. Since there's only one key, and it's now filled, the next step would be to stop. But according to the process, after appending, you need to verify if all values are included. In this case, we found the value, so append_checklist is the next action. After that, the checklist would have the key filled, so then we can stop. But the instructions say to respond with exactly one action per turn. So the next action is append_checklist, not stop. The stop would come after the append.\n\nSo the correct action here is to call append_checklist with the above parameters.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\", \"source_document\": \"Class Action Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 1\"}, {\"text\": \"This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(a)(1)–(4) and Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\", \"source_document\": \"Class Action Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 2, paragraph 31\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiffs: Class Action", "evidence": [{"text": "CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT", "source_document": "Class Action Complaint", "location": "Page 1"}, {"text": "This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(a)(1)–(4) and Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.", "source_document": "Class Action Complaint", "location": "Page 2, paragraph 31"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10924, "completion_tokens": 2360, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is working on extracting the class action status from legal documents. They've already done steps 1-3, and now they're at step 4. The checklist item they need to extract is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they've already read the \"Class Action Complaint\" document (tokens 0-7044) and used append_checklist to add one value: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" based on the document's title and paragraph 31 mentioning a class action under Rule 23. The document is marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so they can't read it again.\n\nNow, checking the available documents. The other documents are unvisited: Amended Class Action Complaint, Proposed Second Amended Complaint, Dockets, and various Orders. The current status shows all keys are filled (1/1), but the user needs to make sure there's no other document that might have a different or additional value for this checklist item.\n\nWait, the checklist requires extracting EVERY distinct value. The current extraction has one value, but maybe another document has a different status, like \"Individual Plaintiffs\" or a description. However, the user's recent action already appended the class action value. The next step is to check if there are other documents that might have more information.\n\nThe documents listed are all unvisited except the original Complaint. The next logical step is to check the other documents, especially the Amended Complaints and Dockets, to see if they mention a different class action status. For example, maybe the Amended Complaint changes it to individual plaintiffs, but that's unlikely. But the task is to extract all distinct values, so even if it's the same value, they don't need to add duplicates. But if another document confirms the same value, it's okay to have multiple entries with different evidence.\n\nWait, the user's goal is to extract every distinct value. Since the current value is \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\", they need to check if any other document has a different value. But given the context, it's probably consistent across documents. However, the system requires checking all documents to be thorough.\n\nThe current state says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so the key is filled. But the user should verify if all documents have been checked. The other documents are unvisited, so they need to check them. The next step would be to read another document to confirm if there's any other value. But the document catalog shows that the original Complaint is fully visited, and others are unvisited.\n\nWait, the user's current task is to extract the class action status. The checklist item is already filled with one value. But maybe the other documents have more evidence or a different value. For example, the Docket might have a notice that it's a class action, or maybe the Amended Complaint has a different designation.\n\nBut according to the instructions, after each read_document or search, they should append or update. Since they've already processed the original Complaint, the next step is to check another document. The most relevant would be the Amended Class Action Complaint, as it's directly related. So they should use read_document on that document.\n\nBut the problem is, the user can't read the entire document in one go if it's over 10,000 tokens. The Amended Complaint is 12,440 tokens, so they need to read a window. The maximum is 10,000 tokens. So they should read the first 10,000 tokens of the Amended Complaint to check for the class action status.\n\nAlternatively, use search_document_regex to look for \"Class Action\" or \"individual plaintiffs\" in that document. But the instructions say to use read_document as the default choice when a specific document is targeted. Since the Amended Complaint is a likely candidate to have the same or additional info, reading it is better.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on \"Amended Class Action Complaint\" for tokens 0-10000 (since it's 12k, but max 10k per call). The user should not read beyond 10k tokens in one call. So start at 0, end at 10000.\n\nWait, the token count for Amended Class Action Complaint is 12,440 tokens. So the first 10,000 tokens would be 0-10000. The next part would be 10000-12440, but that's 2440 tokens, which is under 10k, so they can read it in two parts. But since the user is to choose one action, they should read the first part.\n\nBut the current task is to extract the checklist item. The existing entry is from the original complaint. The Amended Complaint might have a similar entry, but since the value is the same, appending another entry with the same value and different evidence (from the Amended Complaint) is acceptable. The requirement says \"EVERY distinct value\", but if the value is the same, it's still the same value, so they don't need to add it again. However, the evidence is different, so the checklist allows multiple entries for the same value with different evidence.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the same value appears in multiple documents, they need to create separate entries for each with their evidence. So \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" in the original complaint and again in the Amended complaint would be two entries.\n\nBut the user's previous append_checklist already added one entry from the original complaint. So they need to check other documents to see if there's the same value again. If they find it in another document, they should append it as another entry.\n\nSo the next step is to read the Amended Class Action Complaint to check for the class action status.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is read_document on \"Amended Class Action Complaint\" with start_token 0 and end_token 10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Amended Class Action Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Amended Class Action Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 11086, "completion_tokens": 1352, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
