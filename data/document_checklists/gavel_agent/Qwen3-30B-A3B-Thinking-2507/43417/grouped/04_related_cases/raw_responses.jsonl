The user is asking me to extract two checklist items from legal case documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus, and both checklist items are empty. The available documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\"\n\nHmm, the task requires me to extract values for \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" and \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". But without any documents, I can't find any evidence. The system's decision policy says that if the document catalog is unknown, I should call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is definitely unknown here.\n\nSo the next logical step is to use `list_documents` to discover what documents are available. The user mentioned that if the catalog is unknown, that's the first action. There's no point in trying to read a document or search when there are none listed. I should make sure to call `list_documents` first to get the list of documents before proceeding.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, `list_documents` is the correct function here. It requires no parameters, so the JSON should just have the function name. I need to make sure I don't do anything else like `read_document` because there are no documents to read yet. The snapshot clearly states \"Documents in Corpus: 0\", so listing them is the only possible action now.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3184, "completion_tokens": 303, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract two specific checklist items: \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" and \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" from the provided legal documents.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current status. The snapshot shows both keys are empty, and all 10 documents are unvisited. The previous step was a list_documents call which found 10 documents, so the catalog is known. That means I shouldn't call list_documents again.\n\nNow, considering the checklist items. \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" probably refers to mentions of case consolidation, like \"consolidated with Case No. XYZ\". \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" would be specific case numbers mentioned as related.\n\nSince the documents are all unvisited, I need to start reading them. But which one first? The Docket might be a good place to look because dockets often list related cases and consolidations. The Docket document has 18,215 tokens, which is over 10k, so I can't read the whole thing in one go. But the system says to read a targeted window ≤10k tokens. So I should read the first 10k tokens of the Docket.\n\nWait, the available documents include \"Docket\" [Docket] with 18k tokens. Since it's unvisited, I should start there. The Docket is likely to have the case numbers and consolidation info. So the next action should be read_document for the Docket, starting at token 0, ending at 10,000.\n\nI should make sure not to read beyond 10k tokens. So start_token=0, end_token=10000. That's within the limit. The other documents might have info too, but starting with the Docket makes sense as it's a central document for case details.\n\nNo regex needed here because the target is specific to case numbers and consolidation mentions, which might be in the Docket. Using read_document first on the Docket is the safest next step. Then, after reading, I can check the text for the checklist items and use append_checklist if I find anything.\n\nSo the correct action is read_document for the Docket from 0 to 10000 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3491, "completion_tokens": 537, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user wants me to extract two checklist items from the legal case documents: \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" and \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\". \n\nFirst, I need to check what's been done so far. The recent actions show that Step 1 was list_documents, which found 10 documents. Step 2 was read_document on the Docket document from tokens 0-10000. The Docket entry provided in the snapshot shows a lot of docket entries from August 2022.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, I need to check if there's any mention of consolidated cases or related case numbers. Let's scan through the entries. \n\nEntry 15 mentions \"Expedited MOTION to Intervene Daniel W. Bower...\" but that's about intervention, not consolidation. Entry 16 is a motion to expedite the same intervention. Entry 17 is the motion for preliminary injunction. \n\nWait, entry 13 says \"DOCKET ENTRY ORDER: In accordance with the agreement reached by the parties and discussed with the Court at an informal status conference...\" but it doesn't mention consolidation. \n\nLooking further, entry 27 is a \"MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER granting in part and denying in part 15 Motion to Intervene.\" Still no consolidation. \n\nEntry 73 is another \"MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER. Legislatures request for an evidentiary hearing is DENIED.\" Not relevant.\n\nEntry 89 is \"DOCKET ENTRY ORDER: 87 Unopposed Motion for Leave to File Brief of Indiana and 16 Other States as Amici Curiae in Support of Defendant is GRANTED.\" This mentions \"16 Other States\" but not related case numbers. \n\nWait, the checklist item \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" requires case numbers. The Docket entries don't seem to have any case numbers listed for related cases. The entries mention case numbers like \"Dkt. 15\" but those are docket numbers, not case codes of related cases. \n\nFor \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\", the definition is \"Any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s), including identifying information.\" The Docket doesn't mention consolidation. The case is about the United States vs. State of Idaho, and there are interventions, but no consolidation of cases. \n\nSo, from the Docket document read so far, there's no evidence for either checklist item. The next step would be to check other documents. The Docket is partially visited (0-10000 tokens), but maybe the rest of the Docket has more info. However, the user mentioned that we shouldn't reread fully visited documents, and the Docket is marked as partially visited with 55% coverage. But the next token range would be 10000-18215. However, the problem states that we shouldn't reread token ranges already viewed, but since the Docket is partially visited, maybe we should read the next unviewed tokens. But the current action history says that the Docket was read up to 10000, so the next step would be to read from 10000 onwards. However, the user's instructions say not to reread partially visited documents unless necessary, but the current Docket has 18215 tokens, so 10000-18215 is the remaining part.\n\nBut wait, the checklist items might not be in the Docket. Maybe they're in other documents. The available documents include Complaint, various Orders, etc. The Complaint might have related case info, but the Complaint is unvisited. The user's instructions say to avoid rereading documents that are fully visited, but the Docket is partially visited. However, the checklist items are about consolidation and related cases, which are more likely to be in the Docket entries rather than the Complaint. But since the Docket up to 10000 tokens didn't have it, maybe the next part does. Alternatively, maybe the related cases are mentioned in another document.\n\nWait, the checklist item \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" requires case codes. The Docket entries refer to \"Dkt. 15\" but those are docket numbers, not case codes. So maybe there's no related cases listed. But the user needs to check if the documents mention any case numbers of related cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" is not present, so it should be marked as Not Applicable. But according to the Not Applicable encoding, we need explicit evidence. The instructions say not to mark as Not Applicable just because we didn't find it; we need explicit text. For example, if the document says \"no consolidation\" or \"this case is not consolidated with any other cases.\"\n\nLooking at the Docket entries again, there's no mention of consolidation. The case is proceeding as a single case with intervenors, but not consolidated. So maybe it's Not Applicable. But the instructions say to require explicit text. Since there's no text saying it's not consolidated, we can't mark it as Not Applicable yet. We have to check all documents.\n\nBut the next step is to check if there's more info in the Docket beyond token 10000. The Docket has 18,215 tokens, so the next read would be from 10000-18215. But the user's instructions say to avoid redundant reads, but since the Docket is partially visited, reading the next chunk is okay. However, the problem is that the current read was 0-10000, and the next action should be to read the next part. But the user's task is to extract the checklist items, so if the Docket doesn't have it, we need to check other documents.\n\nWait, the available documents include \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\" etc. Maybe those have consolidation info. But the user's recent actions only read the Docket. The other documents are unvisited. But according to the systematic process, after reading a document, if you find values, you append. Since the Docket read didn't yield any values, the next step is to either read more of the Docket or check another document.\n\nThe Docket is partially visited, so reading the next token range (10000-18215) is allowed. But the user's instructions say to check the \"Viewed tokens\" before reading. The current Docket has viewed tokens 0-10000, so the next step would be to read 10000-18215. But the problem is that the Docket entries provided in the snapshot go up to entry 93, which is token 10000? Wait, the snapshot shows the Docket entries from 1 to 93, but the token count is 18,215. So the text provided is the first 10,000 tokens. The remaining tokens (10000-18215) might have more entries.\n\nBut the user's job is to extract the checklist items. Since the provided text (0-10000) doesn't have any mention of consolidation or related case numbers, maybe the next part of the Docket has it. Alternatively, maybe the related cases are listed in another document. However, the Checklist items are about the case being consolidated or related cases with case codes, which is more likely in the Docket. So the next logical step is to read the next part of the Docket.\n\nBut the user's instructions say that after reading a document, if you found values, you append. Since no values were found in the first read, the next action should be to read more of the Docket. So the correct action is to use `read_document` on the Docket from 10000 to 18215 (but ensuring it's ≤10,000 tokens). The Docket has 18215 tokens, so 10000-18215 is 8215 tokens, which is under 10,000. So that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe search for a regex pattern. For \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", the pattern might be looking for case numbers like \"Case No. XXXX\" or similar. But the Docket entries use \"Dkt. 15\" which is docket number, not case code. The checklist specifies \"case code number\", so maybe case numbers like \"1:22-cv-00123\" or similar. The Docket entries don't seem to have those. So a regex search might not help here.\n\nGiven that, the best next step is to read the remaining tokens of the Docket document to see if there's any mention of consolidation or related case numbers.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 18215}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 18215}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13746, "completion_tokens": 1975, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

I need to extract two checklist items: Consolidated_Cases_Noted and Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number.\n\nFirst, looking at the current status. The Docket document has been fully read (tokens 0-18215), but both keys are empty. The other documents are unvisited. The Docket is the main document with case entries, so maybe the related cases are mentioned there.\n\nWait, the Docket entries have entries like \"MOTION to Intervene\" by the Idaho Legislature, and later entries about appeals. But the checklist items are about consolidated cases and related cases by case code numbers. Let me scan through the Docket again.\n\nIn the Docket, there's entry 135: \"MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER. IT IS ORDERED that: (1) the Idaho Legislatures Motion for Reconsideration of Order Granting Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 97) is DENIED; and (2) the State of Idahos Motion to Reconsider Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 101) is DENIED.\" But that's about motions, not consolidated cases.\n\nLooking for \"consolidated\" or \"related cases\". Entry 131: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL as to 125 Memorandum Decision, Terminate Motions by Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives...\" and 136: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL (USCA 23-35440) as to 95 Order on Motion for Preliminary Injunction...\" So USCA case numbers are mentioned here. The related cases might be these USCA numbers.\n\nWait, the checklist item \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\" refers to case numbers. The Docket entries mention USCA case numbers like 23-35153, 23-35440, 23-35450. For example, entry 132: \"USCA Case Number 23-35153 for 131 Notice of Appeal...\". Similarly, 136 has USCA 23-35440, 138 has 23-35450.\n\nSo the related cases are listed with their USCA case codes. Each of these entries (131, 136, 138, etc.) have these case numbers. So the Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number should include entries like 23-35153, 23-35440, 23-35450.\n\nNow, Consolidated_Cases_Noted: is there any mention of consolidation with other cases? The Docket entries don't seem to have \"consolidated\" or \"consolidation\". The case seems to be a single case (US v. Idaho), with related appeals. The Legislature intervened, but that's not consolidation. So maybe Consolidated_Cases_Noted is Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Any indication that the case has been consolidated with other case(s), including identifying information.\" In the Docket, there's no mention of consolidation. The appeals are separate cases (USCA 23-35153, etc.), but the main case (the district court case) isn't consolidated with others. So Consolidated_Cases_Noted would be Not Applicable.\n\nFor Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number, the USCA case numbers are listed. So I need to extract those case numbers from the Docket entries.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries:\n\n- 131: USCA 23-35153\n- 132: USCA Case Number 23-35153\n- 136: USCA 23-35440\n- 137: USCA Case Number 23-35440\n- 138: USCA 23-35450\n- 141: USCA Case Number 23-35450\n- 162: USCA 23-35153\n- 163: USCA 23-35153\n- 164: USCA 23-35153\n- 172: USCA 23-35440, 23-35450\n- 173: USCA 23-35440, 23-35450\n- 174: USCA 23-35440, 23-35450\n- 183: USCA 23-35440 and 23-35450\n\nSo the related case codes are 23-35153, 23-35440, 23-35450. These are the USCA case numbers. So the Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number should have these three entries.\n\nFor Consolidated_Cases_Noted, since there's no mention of consolidation with other cases (like \"this case is consolidated with X\"), it's Not Applicable. So I need to set that key to Not Applicable using update_checklist.\n\nBut first, I need to confirm if the Docket has these case numbers. Since the Docket has been fully read (tokens 0-18215), and I've seen the USCA numbers, I can extract those.\n\nSo the next action should be to append the related case numbers and update Consolidated_Cases_Noted to Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"each extracted value should be self-contained and easy to read, so you can include important context if needed.\" So for each case code, I need to provide evidence: the verbatim text, source document (Docket), and location (docket entry number).\n\nFor example, for 23-35153, the evidence would be from entry 131: \"USCA Case Number 23-35153 for 131 Notice of Appeal, filed by Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives...\"\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo I'll need to create entries for each case code with their evidence.\n\nBut first, check if Consolidated_Cases_Noted is Not Applicable. Since there's no indication of consolidation, use update_checklist to set it to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence.\n\nThen, for Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number, append the three case codes with their evidence.\n\nWait, the user said to use append_checklist for adding new entries, and update_checklist for replacing the entire list or setting Not Applicable.\n\nSo for Related_Cases, since it's a new key with multiple values, use append_checklist with all three entries.\n\nFor Consolidated_Cases_Noted, use update_checklist to set it to Not Applicable.\n\nBut the current status shows both keys are empty. So first, handle the Related_Cases by appending the values, then handle Consolidated_Cases by updating to Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the system says: \"After each append_checklist or update_checklist action: Verify whether all extractable values from the preceding text were included. If you notice missed values, immediately append them as the next action before continuing.\"\n\nSo I need to make sure all three case codes are included.\n\nLet me list all the case numbers from the Docket:\n\n- 23-35153 (entries 131, 132, 162, 163, 164)\n- 23-35440 (136, 137, 172, 174)\n- 23-35450 (138, 141, 172, 174)\n\nSo three unique case codes. Each should be added once to the checklist.\n\nSo for Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number, the extracted values are [\"23-35153\", \"23-35440\", \"23-35450\"].\n\nEach with evidence from the Docket entries.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \"23-35153\" from entry 131: \"USCA Case Number 23-35153 for 131 Notice of Appeal...\"\n- \"23-35440\" from entry 136: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL (USCA 23-35440) as to 95 Order...\"\n- \"23-35450\" from entry 138: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL (23-35450) by Speaker...\"\n\nSo the evidence for each would be the exact text snippet, document name (Docket), and location (e.g., \"Docket Entry 131\").\n\nNow, Consolidated_Cases_Noted: need to set to Not Applicable. The evidence should be a statement that there's no indication of consolidation. So maybe \"No indication of case consolidation found in the Docket or other documents.\"\n\nWait, but the Docket is fully read, and no mention of consolidation. So the evidence for Not Applicable is the absence of such information.\n\nBut the Not Applicable encoding requires explicit evidence. So need to have a text that states there's no consolidation, or a dispositive posture. Since there's no mention, the evidence would be the absence of such text.\n\nBut according to the Not Applicable Encoding guidelines: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence (e.g., dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree; 'no class certification sought' → class action items Not Applicable).\"\n\nIn this case, since the Docket is fully read and there's no mention of consolidation, it's acceptable to mark as Not Applicable. The evidence can be \"No indication of case consolidation was found in the Docket or other documents.\"\n\nBut the evidence needs to be a verbatim text. Wait, the evidence must have a \"text\" field which is a verbatim snippet. But if there's no text, how to handle it?\n\nWait, the Not Applicable entry requires evidence with text, source, location. So for Not Applicable, the evidence text could be a statement like \"No consolidation mentioned in the case documents.\"\n\nBut the guidelines say \"explicit text or a dispositive posture supporting Not Applicable.\" So in this case, since the Docket is fully read and no consolidation is mentioned, the evidence can be a note stating that.\n\nSo for Consolidated_Cases_Noted, the evidence would be:\n\n\"text\": \"No indication of case consolidation found in the Docket or other documents.\",\n\"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n\"location\": \"Full document review\"\n\nNow, the next action is to append the related cases and update the consolidated case.\n\nBut the system says to choose exactly one action per turn. So I need to decide whether to append the related cases first or update the consolidated case.\n\nSince the Related_Cases is a new key, and we have multiple values to add, we should use append_checklist for that. Then, for Consolidated_Cases, use update_checklist.\n\nBut the user says to choose exactly one action. So which one to do first?\n\nThe checklist items are two separate keys. Since we have values for Related_Cases, we should append those. Then, handle Consolidated_Cases.\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist with the three case codes.\n\nWait, but the current status shows both keys are empty, so appending to Related_Cases is the right step.\n\nSo the tool call would be append_checklist with the three entries for Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number.\n\nThen, after that, the next action would be to update Consolidated_Cases_Noted to Not Applicable.\n\nBut since we can only do one action per turn, the first action is to append the related cases.\n\nLet me structure the append_checklist.\n\nEach entry in extracted should have evidence array with text, source_document, location.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor case 23-35153:\n\nevidence: [\n  {\n    \"text\": \"USCA Case Number 23-35153 for 131 Notice of Appeal, filed by Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives...\",\n    \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n    \"location\": \"Docket Entry 132\"\n  }\n]\n\nWait, entry 132 says \"USCA Case Number 23-35153 for 131 Notice of Appeal...\", so the text is \"USCA Case Number 23-35153\".\n\nSimilarly, entry 136 has \"NOTICE OF APPEAL (USCA 23-35440) as to 95 Order...\".\n\nSo the exact text snippets are:\n\n- \"USCA Case Number 23-35153\" (from 132)\n- \"USCA 23-35440\" (from 136)\n- \"23-35450\" (from 138: \"NOTICE OF APPEAL (23-35450) by...\")\n\nWait, entry 138 says \"NOTICE OF APPEAL (23-35450)\", so the case code is 23-35450.\n\nSo the three case codes are 23-35153, 23-35440, 23-35450.\n\nEach should have their own evidence.\n\nSo the append_checklist patch will have one key: Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number, with extracted array containing three entries.\n\nEach entry has value as the case code, and evidence with the text snippet, source, location.\n\nFor example:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"23-35153\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"USCA Case Number 23-35153 for 131 Notice of Appeal, filed by Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives...\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n          \"location\": \"Docket Entry 132\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": \"23-35440\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"NOTICE OF APPEAL (USCA 23-35440) as to 95 Order on Motion for Preliminary Injunction, 136 Notice of Appeal, filed by State of Idaho.\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n          \"location\": \"Docket Entry 136\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": \"23-35450\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"NOTICE OF APPEAL (23-35450) by Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives Scott Bedke, Idaho Senate President Pro Tempore Chuck Winder, and the Sixty-Sixth Idaho Legislature.\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n          \"location\": \"Docket Entry 138\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but the evidence array can have multiple evidence items per value, but in this case, each case code is mentioned in multiple entries, but we only need one evidence per value. So for each value, one evidence is sufficient.\n\nSo the append_checklist will have these three entries.\n\nThen, after appending, the Related_Cases key will be filled.\n\nThen, the next action would be to update Consolidated_Cases_Noted to Not Applicable.\n\nBut for now, the next action is to append the related cases.\n\nSo the tool call is append_checklist with the patch as above.\n\nWait, the system says to respond with valid JSON only, no extra text.\n\nSo the next action is append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"23-35153\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"USCA Case Number 23-35153 for 131 Notice of Appeal, filed by Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives Scott Bedke, Idaho Senate President Pro Tempore Chuck Winder, and the Sixty-Sixth Idaho Legislature.\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"Docket Entry 132\"}]}, {\"value\": \"23-35440\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"NOTICE OF APPEAL (USCA 23-35440) as to 95 Order on Motion for Preliminary Injunction, 136 Notice of Appeal, filed by State of Idaho.\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"Docket Entry 136\"}]}, {\"value\": \"23-35450\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"NOTICE OF APPEAL (23-35450) by Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives Scott Bedke, Idaho Senate President Pro Tempore Chuck Winder, and the Sixty-Sixth Idaho Legislature.\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"Docket Entry 138\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number", "extracted": [{"value": "23-35153", "evidence": [{"text": "USCA Case Number 23-35153 for 131 Notice of Appeal, filed by Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives Scott Bedke, Idaho Senate President Pro Tempore Chuck Winder, and the Sixty-Sixth Idaho Legislature.", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Docket Entry 132"}]}, {"value": "23-35440", "evidence": [{"text": "NOTICE OF APPEAL (USCA 23-35440) as to 95 Order on Motion for Preliminary Injunction, 136 Notice of Appeal, filed by State of Idaho.", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Docket Entry 136"}]}, {"value": "23-35450", "evidence": [{"text": "NOTICE OF APPEAL (23-35450) by Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives Scott Bedke, Idaho Senate President Pro Tempore Chuck Winder, and the Sixty-Sixth Idaho Legislature.", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Docket Entry 138"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 22200, "completion_tokens": 3820, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The Complaint document also doesn't mention consolidation. \n\nThe next step is to check the other documents.

The other item, \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\", is still empty.\n\nLooking at the current status, the \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" key is empty. The task is to find any indication that the case has been consolidated with other cases, including identifying information. \n\nThe available documents that haven't been fully visited yet are the other Order/Opinion documents (Memorandum Decision and Order (002) to (005), Order, SCOTUS Opinion, and Stipulation of Dismissal).

The remaining documents are unvisited, so I should check those for any mention of case consolidation.\n\nWait, the \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\" item requires evidence of consolidation. I need to look through the unvisited documents to see if any mention consolidation. The most relevant documents would likely be the subsequent Memorandum Decisions or the Stipulation of Dismissal. \n\nThe Stipulation of Dismissal (Document 182) says \"STIPULATION of Dismissal Without Prejudice by United States of America.\" But \"without prejudice\" doesn't necessarily mean consolidation. The SCOTUS Opinion might refer to other cases, but it's a high court document. The other Order documents (002-005) might have consolidation info.\n\nWait, the user's previous actions have already read the Docket, which has entries about appeals (like USCA case numbers), but those are related cases, not consolidated cases. Consolidated cases would be different; for example, if two cases are merged into one.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, there's no mention of consolidation. The entries refer to related appeals, but not consolidation. So I need to check the other documents.\n\nThe next step is to read the unvisited documents. The most likely candidates are the Memorandum Decision and Order (002) through (005), since they might contain consolidation notes. The Stipulation of Dismissal might also have info, but it's a settlement document.\n\nSince the current action is to find \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\", I should read one of the unvisited documents. The user's instruction says to read a targeted window (≤10,000 tokens). The largest unvisited document is SCOTUS Opinion (26,164 tokens), but it's over 10k, so I can't read the whole thing. But the others are smaller: Memorandum Decision and Order (002) is 1,363 tokens, which is under 10k. So reading that would be safe.\n\nWait, the user's decision policy says to read a targeted window, but the document is small enough to read entirely. So I should call read_document on Memorandum Decision and Order (002) with tokens 0-1363. That's the next logical step to check for consolidation mentions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check the SCOTUS Opinion, but it's larger. But the user's example shows that they read a 10k token window. However, since the document is only 1,363 tokens, reading it all is fine.

The other item, \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\", is still empty.\n\nI need to check if there's any evidence of case consolidation in the documents.

The goal is to extract two specific checklist items from the provided case documents. The user has already done several steps, and I need to figure out what to do next.\n\nFirst, let me review the current status. The checklist has two items: Consolidated_Cases_Noted and Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number. From the recent actions, they've already extracted three values for Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number from the Docket document (23-35153, 23-35440, 23-35450). But Consolidated_Cases_Noted is still empty.\n\nLooking at the available documents, most are fully visited (Complaint, Docket, Order/Opinion documents 001 and 002). The SCOTUS Opinion is partially visited (only tokens 0-10000 read out of 26,164). The other documents (003, 004, 005, Order, Stipulation) are unvisited.\n\nThe task is to find evidence for Consolidated_Cases_Noted. This checklist item asks for any indication that the case has been consolidated with other cases, including identifying information. So I need to check if any documents mention consolidation.\n\nThe SCOTUS Opinion (tokens 0-10000) was partially read. Let me think about what might be in that document. The SCOTUS Opinion is about the Idaho abortion case, and it mentions \"Nos. 23–726 and 23–727\" at the top. Wait, those are two different case numbers. The opinion says \"On Writs of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\" for both cases. This suggests that these two cases (23-726 and 23-727) were consolidated before the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the SCOTUS Opinion, it says \"MIKE MOYLE, SPEAKER OF THE IDAHO HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ET AL., PETITIONERS 23–726 v. UNITED STATES IDAHO, PETITIONER 23–727 v. UNITED STATES\". This indicates that two separate petitions (23-726 and 23-727) were filed and consolidated under the same case. The fact that they're listed together as \"Nos. 23–726 and 23–727\" suggests consolidation.\n\nThe user has only read tokens 0-10000 of the SCOTUS Opinion, but the case numbers are in the header, which is likely in the first part of the document. Since the case numbers are mentioned right at the beginning (in the slip opinion header), it's safe to assume that the consolidation is mentioned early in the document. So the SCOTUS Opinion document probably contains the evidence for Consolidated_Cases_Noted.\n\nSince the SCOTUS Opinion is partially visited (only 38% read), but the relevant information is likely in the first part of the document (the header), I should read the beginning of the document to confirm. But since the user has already read tokens 0-10000, which includes the header, I can use the existing text.\n\nLooking at the provided text from SCOTUS Opinion (tokens 0-10000), I see:\n\n\"Nos. 23–726 and 23–727\"\n\nAnd the case names:\n\n\"MIKE MOYLE, SPEAKER OF THE IDAHO HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ET AL., PETITIONERS 23–726 v. UNITED STATES IDAHO, PETITIONER 23–727 v. UNITED STATES\"\n\nThis clearly shows two case numbers (23-726 and 23-727) consolidated into one Supreme Court case. Therefore, this is evidence for Consolidated_Cases_Noted.\n\nThe checklist item Consolidated_Cases_Noted needs any indication of consolidation, including identifying information. Here, the two case numbers (23-726 and 23-727) are listed together, indicating consolidation.\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"Cases 23-726 and 23-727 consolidated under Supreme Court docket\".\n\nNow, I need to add this to the checklist using append_checklist or update_checklist. Since this is the first value for Consolidated_Cases_Noted, I should use append_checklist to add this entry.\n\nThe evidence should include:\n- Text: \"Nos. 23–726 and 23–727\" and the case names listing both numbers\n- Source document: SCOTUS Opinion\n- Location: Header (tokens 0-10000, but specifically the case numbers at the top)\n\nWait, the user has already read tokens 0-10000 of SCOTUS Opinion, so I can reference that. The evidence text would be the part showing the two case numbers.\n\nSo the value is \"Cases 23-726 and 23-727 consolidated\", with evidence from the SCOTUS Opinion's header.\n\nNow, I should call append_checklist to add this value for Consolidated_Cases_Noted.\n\nI need to make sure I'm using the correct function. Since this is the first value for this key, append_checklist is appropriate.\n\nThe parameters for append_checklist should be:\n- patch: an array with one object\n  - key: \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\"\n  - extracted: an array with one object\n    - value: \"Cases 23-726 and 23-727 consolidated\"\n    - evidence: an array with one evidence object\n      - text: \"Nos. 23–726 and 23–727\" (or the full header line)\n      - source_document: \"SCOTUS Opinion\"\n      - location: \"Header (tokens 0-10000)\"\n\nLooking at the provided text, the exact line is:\n\"Nos. 23–726 and 23–727\"\n\nSo the evidence text should be that line.\n\nTherefore, I'll construct the append_checklist call with this information.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Consolidated_Cases_Noted\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Cases 23-726 and 23-727 consolidated\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Nos. 23–726 and 23–727\",\n                \"source_document\": \"SCOTUS Opinion\",\n                \"location\": \"Header (tokens 0-10000)\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Consolidated_Cases_Noted", "extracted": [{"value": "Cases 23-726 and 23-727 consolidated", "evidence": [{"text": "Nos. 23–726 and 23–727", "source_document": "SCOTUS Opinion", "location": "Header (tokens 0-10000)"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 33733, "completion_tokens": 1498, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The SCOTUS Opinion is partially visited (38% coverage), but the value for Consolidated_Cases_Noted was already extracted from the header (Nos. 23–726 and 23–727), so no need to read more of that document.\n\nThe other documents (003, 004, 005, Order, Stipulation) are unvisited, but since the checklist items are already fully covered, there's no need to read them. The extraction progress shows 2 keys with values, 0 empty keys, and 0 Not Applicable. \n\nThe system says to stop when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Both keys are complete. The previous action was appending Consolidated_Cases_Noted, and the current status shows all keys are filled. So the next step is to stop.\n\nI should check if there's any possible missing values. For Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number, the prior action (Step 4) says 3 values were appended from the Docket. The Docket was fully read, so those values are covered. Consolidated_Cases_Noted was extracted from SCOTUS Opinion, which was partially read but the relevant part was in the header, so it's covered.\n\nNo further actions are needed.

The user has provided a legal checklist extraction task with two items to fill: Consolidated_Cases_Noted and Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number. From the prior steps, they've already extracted values for both.\n\nLooking at the current status: both keys are filled (1 value for Consolidated_Cases_Noted from SCOTUS Opinion header, 3 values for Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number from the Docket). The system's automatic checklist review (step 11) shows both keys are 100% filled with no empty keys.\n\nThe available documents include SCOTUS Opinion which was partially read (38% coverage), but the Consolidated_Cases_Noted value was already extracted from its header (the \"Nos. 23–726 and 23–727\" line). The Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number values came from the Docket document, which is fully visited (100% coverage). \n\nNo other documents are needed since:\n- SCOTUS Opinion's header already provided the consolidation info\n- Docket already provided all 3 related case numbers\n- All other documents are either fully visited or unvisited but irrelevant (since no new checklist items need extraction)\n\nThe system has already confirmed 2/2 keys filled, and the stop attempt at step 10 was followed by an automatic get_checklist that shows no gaps. The user is now on the second stop attempt (as per the \"stop attempt 1/2\" note), so the next action should be to confirm the final stop.\n\nNo evidence of missing values: \n- Consolidated_Cases_Noted: \"Cases 23-726 and 23-727 consolidated\" is already appended with evidence from SCOTUS header\n- Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number: 3 values from Docket (already appended in step 4)\n\nNo Not Applicable cases since both items have valid values. All documents that could contain these values have been fully processed (Docket is fully visited, SCOTUS header was read in step 8).\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop with the current state.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items fully extracted: Consolidated_Cases_Noted (1 value from SCOTUS Opinion header) and Related_Cases_Listed_by_Their_Case_Code_Number (3 values from Docket).
