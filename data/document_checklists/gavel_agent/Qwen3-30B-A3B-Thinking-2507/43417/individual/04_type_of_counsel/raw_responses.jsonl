Since the corpus has 0 documents, I can't read anything or search. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The current state mentions \"Documents in Corpus: 0,\" which means the catalog isn't known yet. Therefore, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of available documents.\n\nI need to make sure I don't try to read a document that doesn't exist. The system says to call list_documents first when the catalog is unknown. Since there are no documents listed, calling list_documents is the right move. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex would require knowing which documents to look at, but we don't have that info yet.\n\nSo, the next action should be to call list_documents with no parameters.

The documents listed include Complaint, Docket, various Orders, and a Stipulation of Dismissal. The Complaint is usually where the parties and their counsel are first mentioned, so it's a good starting point. The Complaint has 8,578 tokens, which is under the 10k limit for a single read_document call. Since it's unvisited, reading the whole thing makes sense here.\n\nI need to make sure I don't read more than 10k tokens. The Complaint is 8,578, so starting at token 0 to 8578 should work. Using read_document on Complaint with start_token 0 and end_token 8578. That's the next logical step to get the initial data. The other documents might have more info, but starting with the Complaint is standard for finding counsel types at the beginning of the case.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 8578}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 8578}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3483, "completion_tokens": 284, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user wants me to extract the \"Type_of_Counsel\" from the legal documents. The checklist says to get the type of counsel for each side, like Plaintiff and Defendant, using specific categories.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, the Complaint document was already read (tokens 0-8578). In the Complaint, I see the counsel listed. Let me check that.\n\nIn the Complaint, the first part says: \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\" followed by a list of names and titles. The names include people from the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Division, Federal Programs Branch. So the counsel for the Plaintiff is government counsel, specifically the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe Defendant is \"The State of Idaho,\" but the document doesn't list counsel for the Defendant. The Complaint mentions \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" but not for the Defendant. So for the Defendant, there's no counsel listed here. The requirement says not to include a side if the type isn't clear. Since there's no mention of Defendant's counsel in the Complaint, I shouldn't add anything for the Defendant.\n\nSo the only value I can extract is \"Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\" for the Plaintiff. The checklist says to format as 'Plaintiff: ...' and 'Defendant: ...', but since Defendant's counsel isn't specified, only Plaintiff's entry should be included.\n\nWait, the example says \"Plaintiff: …\" and \"Defendant: …\", so I need to make sure to label it correctly. The extracted value should be \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\".\n\nNow, evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text is in the Complaint, specifically the part where it says \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\" followed by the list. The location would be the page where this appears, which is Page 1 of the Complaint. The token range is 0-8578, but since the document is fully visited, I can reference the page.\n\nWait, the document says \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW Document 1 Filed 08/02/22 Page 1 of 17\" followed by the counsel info. So the location is \"Page 1\" of the Complaint.\n\nI need to check if there's any other document that might have Defendant's counsel. But the current status shows only the Complaint was read, and others are unvisited. However, the task is to extract from all documents, but the next step is to use the evidence from the Complaint since it's the only one read so far.\n\nBut the user's current status says \"Keys with Values: 0/1\" and \"Empty Keys: 1/1\", so I need to add the extracted value. Since I found the Plaintiff's counsel in the Complaint, I should use append_checklist to add that entry.\n\nWait, the checklist item is Type_of_Counsel, and the value should be a list. Each entry in the list is for a side. So the entry would be \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\".\n\nEvidence: the verbatim text is \"U.S. Department of Justice Civil Division, Federal Programs Branch\" under \"Counsel for Plaintiff\". The source document is \"Complaint\", location is \"Page 1\".\n\nWait, the exact text says: \"U.S. Department of Justice Civil Division, Federal Programs Branch\" and \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\".\n\nSo the value is \"Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\", formatted as Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice).\n\nNow, the evidence should have the text snippet, source, location. The text snippet would be the line mentioning \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" and the department.\n\nIn the Complaint, the text starts with \"BRIAN M. BOYNTON Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General...\" and then \"U.S. Department of Justice Civil Division, Federal Programs Branch\" followed by \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\".\n\nSo the verbatim text for evidence could be: \"U.S. Department of Justice Civil Division, Federal Programs Branch\\nCounsel for Plaintiff United States of America\"\n\nLocation is Page 1.\n\nSo the extracted entry would have value \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\", evidence with that text, source Complaint, location Page 1.\n\nI need to make sure to use the correct format for the evidence. The evidence array should have an entry with text, source_document, location.\n\nSo the append_checklist call should have a patch with key \"Type_of_Counsel\" and extracted list containing one entry with that value and evidence.\n\nCheck if the Defendant's counsel is mentioned anywhere. In the Complaint, there's no mention of Defendant's counsel. The Defendant is \"The State of Idaho\", but no counsel listed. So only Plaintiff's entry is valid.\n\nTherefore, the next action is append_checklist with the extracted value.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"U.S. Department of Justice\\nCivil Division, Federal Programs Branch  \\n1100 L Street, N.W.\\nWashington, D.C. 20005\\nTel: (202) 514-5578\\nlisa.n.newman@usdoj.gov\\n\\nCounsel for Plaintiff\\nUnited States of America\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Complaint\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 1\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Type_of_Counsel", "extracted": [{"value": "Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)", "evidence": [{"text": "U.S. Department of Justice\nCivil Division, Federal Programs Branch  \n1100 L Street, N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20005\nTel: (202) 514-5578\nlisa.n.newman@usdoj.gov\n\nCounsel for Plaintiff\nUnited States of America", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12554, "completion_tokens": 1239, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

So far, they've read the Complaint document and found one entry: \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\".\n\nNow, checking the current status. The Complaint is fully visited, so I shouldn't read it again. The other documents are unvisited: Docket, several Order/Opinion documents, and a Stipulation of Dismissal. The checklist item Type_of_Counsel might have entries for the Defendant as well, since the plaintiff's counsel was found, but the defendant's counsel isn't mentioned in the Complaint.\n\nLooking at the Complaint, it says \"Counsel for Plaintiff\" followed by the US DOJ details, but there's no mention of the Defendant's counsel. The Defendant is the State of Idaho, so maybe their counsel is listed in another document. The Docket might have that information, as dockets often list counsel for all parties.\n\nSo, the next logical step is to check the Docket document. The Docket is unvisited and has 18,215 tokens. Since the Complaint already covered the plaintiff's side, the Docket might list the defendant's counsel. I should read the Docket to see if it mentions the State of Idaho's legal representation.\n\nThe current action should be to read the Docket document. Since it's unvisited, I'll use read_document on the Docket, starting from 0-10000 tokens (since the max is 10,000 tokens per call). The Docket is the next most likely document to contain defendant counsel info.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12710, "completion_tokens": 383, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Type_of_Counsel from the legal documents. So far, they've already processed the Complaint document and found one entry: \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\".\n\nNow, looking at the current status, there's another document called Docket that's partially visited (55% coverage). The Docket document has entries like \"NOTICE of Appearance by Anna Lynn Deffebach on behalf of All Plaintiffs\" and similar entries for other attorneys. These notices mention counsel for both the Plaintiff (United States) and Defendant (State of Idaho).\n\nThe checklist requires extracting counsel types for each side, formatted as 'Plaintiff: ...' and 'Defendant: ...'. The existing entry only covers the Plaintiff. The Docket document probably has entries for the Defendant's counsel too. For example, entry 9 says \"NOTICE of Appearance by Megan Ann Larrondo on behalf of State of Idaho\", which would indicate Defendant counsel.\n\nSo, the next step should be to read more of the Docket document to find the Defendant's counsel details. The Docket has been read up to 10,000 tokens, but it's 18,215 tokens total. The next unviewed tokens are 10,001-18,215. Since the user can read up to 10,000 tokens at a time, they should read from 10,001 to 18,215. But wait, the maximum is 10,000 tokens, so maybe 10,001 to 20,000, but since the document is only 18,215, it would be 10,001-18,215.\n\nWait, the Docket's tokens are 18,215, and they've read up to 10,000, so the remaining is 8,215 tokens. So the next read_document should be from 10,001 to 18,215 (which is within the 10k limit). This will cover the rest of the Docket, where the Defendant's counsel might be listed.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries provided, entries 9, 12, 26, 31, etc., mention the State of Idaho's counsel. For example, entry 9: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Megan Ann Larrondo on behalf of State of Idaho\". Entry 12: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Steven Lamar Olsen on behalf of State of Idaho\". Entry 26: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Brian V Church on behalf of State of Idaho\", and so on. So the Defendant's counsel is listed as State of Idaho's attorneys.\n\nTherefore, the Type_of_Counsel for Defendant should be \"State of Idaho: Government counsel (State of Idaho Attorney General's Office)\" or similar. But need to check the exact wording. Since it's the State of Idaho, it's government counsel for the Defendant.\n\nSo, the next action is to read the remaining tokens of the Docket document to get the Defendant's counsel details. Then, after reading, append the Defendant's Type_of_Counsel entry.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 10001, \"end_token\": 18215}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 10001, "end_token": 18215}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 22965, "completion_tokens": 739, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Type_of_Counsel from the legal documents. So far, the assistant has already read the Complaint and Docket documents, both fully visited. From the Complaint, they found \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\".\n\nNow, looking at the current status, all other documents are unvisited except Complaint and Docket. The checklist item Type_of_Counsel has one value extracted. The next step is to check if there are more values in other documents.\n\nThe available documents include several Order/Opinion and Settlement Agreement files. The Docket document was fully read, but maybe the other orders have more counsel information. For example, the Memorandum Decision and Order (001) might mention counsel for the defendant or other parties.\n\nThe user's instructions say to never reread fully visited documents. Complaint and Docket are fully visited. The other documents like Order/Opinion files are unvisited (marked as ○ Unvisited), so they need to be read.\n\nThe checklist item requires extracting all distinct values. So far, only the plaintiff's counsel is extracted. The defendant's counsel might be in another document. The Docket had entries like \"Megan Ann Larrondo on behalf of State of Idaho\" and others, but those are notices of appearance, which might not be the type of counsel. Wait, the Docket entries show \"NOTICE of Appearance by Megan Ann Larrondo on behalf of State of Idaho\" but the Type_of_Counsel is supposed to be the type (like government counsel, private, etc.), not the names.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"The type(s) of counsel representing each side, using brief category labels (e.g., private counsel, public interest nonprofit, government counsel, pro se) and including specific organizations in parentheses when available (e.g., Public interest nonprofit (ACLU)). If both sides are represented, extract each as a separate value formatted as 'Plaintiff: …' and 'Defendant: …'.\"\n\nSo for the defendant, the State of Idaho, their counsel would be government counsel as well, since it's a state. But the Docket entries mention \"State of Idaho\" being represented by attorneys like Megan Larrondo, Brian Church, etc. So the defendant's counsel is government counsel (state government).\n\nIn the Complaint, they listed \"Counsel for Plaintiff United States of America\" as U.S. Department of Justice. So for the defendant, the State of Idaho, their counsel would be government counsel (State of Idaho). So the Type_of_Counsel should have two values: Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice) and Defendant: Government counsel (State of Idaho).\n\nBut the current extraction only has the plaintiff's. So need to find the defendant's counsel type. The Docket document might have that. Wait, the Docket was fully read, but the Docket entries are notices of appearance, not the type. Wait, the Docket entries like \"NOTICE of Appearance by Megan Ann Larrondo on behalf of State of Idaho\" would indicate that the State of Idaho is represented by counsel, but the type is government counsel.\n\nBut the Type_of_Counsel item requires the type, not the names. So \"State of Idaho\" as defendant would be government counsel. So the defendant's type is government counsel (State of Idaho), similar to plaintiff's being U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nWait, the current extracted value is \"Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice)\". The defendant's would be \"Defendant: Government counsel (State of Idaho)\".\n\nBut in the Docket, the notices of appearance for the defendant are listed, but the type isn't explicitly stated. However, since it's the State of Idaho, it's government counsel. So maybe the Type_of_Counsel needs to have both plaintiff and defendant entries.\n\nThe current extraction has only the plaintiff. So need to confirm if the defendant's counsel type is present in the documents. The Docket was fully read, but the Docket entries don't explicitly state \"government counsel\" for the defendant. However, the context implies that the State of Idaho is represented by state government counsel.\n\nWait, the instructions say \"Do not include an entry for a side if the type of counsel is not clear from the documents.\" So if it's clear that the defendant is represented by government counsel (since it's a state), then it should be included.\n\nBut the current extracted value is only the plaintiff. The Docket document has entries like \"NOTICE of Appearance by Megan Ann Larrondo on behalf of State of Idaho\" which would mean the defendant is represented by counsel, and since it's a state, it's government counsel.\n\nSo the Type_of_Counsel should have two entries: Plaintiff: Government counsel (U.S. Department of Justice) and Defendant: Government counsel (State of Idaho).\n\nBut the current extraction only has the first. So need to add the defendant's entry.\n\nBut the Docket was already fully read. The assistant read the Docket tokens 0-10000 and then 10001-18215. The Docket entries from 1-183 include notices of appearance for the defendant. For example, entry 9: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Megan Ann Larrondo on behalf of State of Idaho\". So the defendant's counsel is the State of Idaho, which is government counsel.\n\nTherefore, the Type_of_Counsel should have a second entry for Defendant: Government counsel (State of Idaho).\n\nBut the assistant hasn't extracted that yet. So the next step is to append that value.\n\nWait, the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Total Values Extracted: 1\". So they have one value. The second value (defendant) is missing.\n\nBut the Docket was fully read, so the information should be there. The assistant needs to append the defendant's entry.\n\nSo the correct action is to use append_checklist to add the Defendant value.\n\nBut the assistant needs to confirm that the Docket contains evidence for the defendant's counsel. Let's check the Docket text.\n\nIn the Docket, entry 9: \"NOTICE of Appearance by Megan Ann Larrondo on behalf of State of Idaho\". So \"State of Idaho\" is the defendant, and the counsel is appearing on behalf of them. Since the State of Idaho is a government entity, the type is government counsel.\n\nSo the evidence would be from the Docket entry 9, with the text \"NOTICE of Appearance by Megan Ann Larrondo on behalf of State of Idaho\".\n\nThe value should be \"Defendant: Government counsel (State of Idaho)\".\n\nTherefore, the assistant should append this new entry.\n\nSo the next action is append_checklist with the new value.\n\nWait, but the assistant has already read the Docket. The previous step was Step 5: read_document on Docket (tokens 10001-18215), which covers the rest of the Docket. Now, after reading the Docket, they should append the defendant's counsel.\n\nSo the correct action is to call append_checklist with the new entry.\n\nThe existing extracted value is from Complaint, and now adding the Defendant entry from Docket.\n\nSo the JSON for append_checklist would have a patch with key \"Type_of_Counsel\" and extracted array containing the new entry.\n\nEach extracted entry needs evidence: text, source_document, location.\n\nFor the new entry:\n\n- value: \"Defendant: Government counsel (State of Idaho)\"\n- evidence: [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"NOTICE of Appearance by Megan Ann Larrondo on behalf of State of Idaho\",\n      \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n      \"location\": \"Docket entry 9\"\n    }\n  ]\n\nWait, the Docket entries are numbered, so location could be \"Docket entry 9\".\n\nSo the append_checklist call should add this new entry.\n\nTherefore, the next action is append_checklist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Type_of_Counsel\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Defendant: Government counsel (State of Idaho)\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"NOTICE of Appearance by Megan Ann Larrondo on behalf of State of Idaho\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Docket\",\n                \"location\": \"Docket entry 9\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Type_of_Counsel", "extracted": [{"value": "Defendant: Government counsel (State of Idaho)", "evidence": [{"text": "NOTICE of Appearance by Megan Ann Larrondo on behalf of State of Idaho", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Docket entry 9"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 31417, "completion_tokens": 1786, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The Complaint document was read in Step 2, and the Docket in Steps 4 and 5. The prior actions (Step 6) appended two values: one for Plaintiff (U.S. Government counsel) and one for Defendant (State of Idaho government counsel). The system's current status shows Type_of_Counsel has 2 values, both filled.\n\nThe available documents include other Order/Opinion and Settlement Agreement files, but the prior actions have already covered the main documents where counsel types would be mentioned. The Complaint mentions \"The United States\" as Plaintiff, and the Docket entries show multiple appearances by government attorneys for both sides.\n\nThe user's Step 7 called `stop`, but the system's automatic review (Step 8) shows that the checklist is 1/1 filled. The current status indicates all keys are filled with 2 values. The documents marked as unvisited (like Order/Opinion files) might contain more counsel info, but the instructions say to stop when all applicable items are extracted. Since the Plaintiff and Defendant counsel types are already confirmed from the Complaint and Docket, and the other documents (like the Order/Opinion) are likely just court decisions without counsel details, there's no need to read them.\n\nAlso, the Not Applicable encoding isn't needed here because both sides have clear counsel types. The evidence provided for each value is solid: Complaint entry for Plaintiff, Docket entries for Defendant. No other documents are necessary to check for this item.\n\nSo, the correct action is to stop now, as all required values are extracted and confirmed.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All applicable Type_of_Counsel values confirmed: Plaintiff (U.S. Government counsel) from Complaint (entry 1), Defendant (State of Idaho government counsel) from Docket (entries 9, 12, 26, 31, 72, 114, 116, 117, 118, 124, 129, 143, 175, 176).
