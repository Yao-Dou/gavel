The user needs to extract all reported opinions cited with shortened Bluebook citations from legal documents. The current status shows 0 documents in the corpus, and the checklist item is empty.\n\nFirst, I check the available documents section. It says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So the catalog is unknown. According to the decision policy, if the document catalog is unknown, the first action should be to call `list_documents`. \n\nThe other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing the document names, which we don't have yet. Since there are no documents listed, I can't proceed without first listing them. The `get_checklist` or other functions won't help here because there's nothing to extract from.\n\nSo the correct next step is definitely to use `list_documents` to discover what documents are available. That's the standard first step when the catalog is unknown. No need to overcomplicate it. Just call `list_documents` to get the list of documents before proceeding.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3158, "completion_tokens": 227, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 2, "run_id": "89c37313-f78b-445f-bbc2-27c511dc329c", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T02:58:56.622252-04:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's see. The task is to extract all reported opinions cited with shortened Bluebook citations from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\". The current status shows it's empty, and all documents are unvisited.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain these citations. The \"Memorandum Decision and Order\" documents (001 to 005, and the Order) are probably where court opinions would be cited. The SCOTUS Opinion document might have citations too, but it's a single opinion, so maybe it's the source, not the one citing others. The Complaint and Docket might have some citations, but the Memorandum Decisions are more likely to have the cited cases in their reasoning.\n\nSince the user mentioned \"shortened Bluebook form\", which includes case names followed by the citation (like Smith v. Jones, 123 F.3d 456), I should look for patterns that match that. But the exact pattern might be tricky. Maybe using a regex search would help find potential citations. However, the problem says not to use broad patterns, so I need a precise regex.\n\nWait, the checklist definition excludes id./supra/infra, so I should avoid those. The regex should target cases with a case name (like \"Smith v. Jones\") followed by a citation (e.g., \"123 F.3d 456\"). But Bluebook shortened form might have the case name and then the citation without the full reporter name. For example, \"Smith v. Jones, 123 F.3d 456\" would be the shortened form.\n\nBut the regex needs to be specific. Maybe start with a pattern like \"[A-Z][a-z]+ v. [A-Z][a-z]+, [0-9]+ [A-Z]+\\.[a-z]+\\s*[0-9]+\". Wait, but the reporter abbreviation can vary. Maybe better to look for the structure: case name (with \"v.\" or \"v\"), followed by a comma, then a number, then a reporter abbreviation (like F.3d, F. Supp., etc.), and then a page number.\n\nBut the regex might be complex. However, the instructions say to use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable. Since the citations follow a standard format, it's a good candidate. So using search_document_regex with a pattern that matches the structure.\n\nThe documents to search: probably the Memorandum Decisions since they are the court's opinions and would cite other cases. The SCOTUS Opinion might have citations, but it's the opinion itself, not the one citing others. So maybe search the Order/Opinion documents.\n\nWait, the document names include \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\" etc., which are all under [Order/Opinion]. So the 'doc_names' parameter could be those specific ones. But to be efficient, maybe start with the largest ones first. The largest is SCOTUS Opinion (26k tokens), but that's a single opinion. Wait, the SCOTUS Opinion is probably the actual opinion, so it might not cite other cases. The Memorandum Decisions are the court's own decisions, so they would cite other cases. So the relevant documents are the ones labeled \"Memorandum Decision and Order\" and \"Order\".\n\nWait, the list has \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\" through (005), and \"Order\" [Order/Opinion]. So those are the ones to search. Let's pick a few of the larger ones first. But since the system allows searching all documents with doc_name='all', but maybe better to target the specific ones.\n\nWait, the instruction says to use search_document_regex with a precise pattern. Let's draft a regex pattern. The shortened Bluebook citation usually has the case name (e.g., \"Smith v. Jones\"), followed by a comma, then the citation (e.g., \"123 F.3d 456\"). So the pattern could be something like:\n\n[A-Z][a-z]+ v\\.[^,]+, [0-9]+ [A-Z]+\\.\\w+\\s*[0-9]+\n\nBut need to make sure it's not matching things like \"v. 2023\" or other non-citations. Also, the \"v.\" is key. So maybe:\n\n([A-Z][a-z]+ v\\.[^,]+), ([0-9]+ [A-Z]+\\.\\w+\\s*[0-9]+)\n\nBut the exact pattern might need to be adjusted. However, the regex search will return matches, and then we can read the context to confirm.\n\nSo, the next step is to use search_document_regex on the relevant documents. The documents to search would be the Memorandum Decision and Order ones. Let's select the first one, \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\" which is 8,159 tokens. But maybe better to search all Order/Opinion documents. Wait, the doc_names parameter can take an array. So maybe search all documents with type Order/Opinion. But the available documents are listed with their names. The ones labeled [Order/Opinion] are:\n\n- Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\n- Memorandum Decision and Order (002)\n- Memorandum Decision and Order (003)\n- Memorandum Decision and Order (004)\n- Memorandum Decision and Order (005)\n- Order\n- SCOTUS Opinion\n\nSo maybe search all of these. But the SCOTUS Opinion is a single opinion, so it might not have citations to other cases. But it's possible. To be safe, include all Order/Opinion documents. So set doc_names to [\"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\", \"Memorandum Decision and Order (002)\", \"Memorandum Decision and Order (003)\", \"Memorandum Decision and Order (004)\", \"Memorandum Decision and Order (005)\", \"Order\", \"SCOTUS Opinion\"].\n\nBut the regex pattern needs to be precise. Let's go with a pattern that matches the structure. Let's say:\n\n[A-Z][a-z]+ v\\.[^,]+, [0-9]+ [A-Z]+\\.\\w+\\s*[0-9]+\n\nBut to make it more accurate, perhaps using a pattern that looks for the case name followed by the citation. However, the exact pattern might need to be tested, but since we're using a regex search, it's better to start with a reasonable pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be:\n\n([A-Z][a-z]+ v\\.[^,]+), ([0-9]+ [A-Z]+\\.\\w+\\s*[0-9]+)\n\nBut the regex flags can be set to MULTILINE and DOTALL to handle newlines. So the function call would have pattern, doc_names, flags.\n\nWait, the parameters for search_document_regex: doc_names is an array, so we can specify the list of documents. Let's use doc_names to target the Order/Opinion documents.\n\nSo the action would be search_document_regex with doc_names as the list of Order/Opinion documents, pattern as the regex, and top_k=5, context_tokens=200.\n\nWait, the user has 10 documents, but only the Order/Opinion ones are relevant. So the next step is to search those documents for the regex pattern to find potential citations.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_names\": [\"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\", \"Memorandum Decision and Order (002)\", \"Memorandum Decision and Order (003)\", \"Memorandum Decision and Order (004)\", \"Memorandum Decision and Order (005)\", \"Order\", \"SCOTUS Opinion\"], \"pattern\": \"[A-Z][a-z]+ v\\\\.[^,]+, [0-9]+ [A-Z]+\\\\.\\\\w+\\\\s*[0-9]+\", \"flags\": [\"MULTILINE\", \"DOTALL\"], \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Memorandum Decision and Order (001)", "Memorandum Decision and Order (002)", "Memorandum Decision and Order (003)", "Memorandum Decision and Order (004)", "Memorandum Decision and Order (005)", "Order", "SCOTUS Opinion"], "pattern": "[A-Z][a-z]+ v\\.[^,]+, [0-9]+ [A-Z]+\\.\\w+\\s*[0-9]+", "flags": ["MULTILINE", "DOTALL"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3465, "completion_tokens": 1747, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 3, "run_id": "89c37313-f78b-445f-bbc2-27c511dc329c", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T03:04:50.443743-04:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's break this down. The user needs me to extract all reported opinions cited with shortened Bluebook citations from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\", and I have to make sure each entry is in the correct Bluebook format.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the recent actions. They did a regex search on specific documents and found matches. The regex pattern was \"[A-Z][a-z]+ v\\.[^,]+, [0-9]+ [A-Z]+\\.\\w+\\s*[0-9]+\", which seems to target case names followed by citations. The search found 20 matches across 7 documents.\n\nLooking at the matches provided, I need to check each one to see if it's a valid Bluebook citation. The requirements say to exclude id./supra/infra, docket-only references, slip opinions without reporter cites, and non-case sources. So I have to verify each match.\n\nStarting with Memorandum Decision and Order (001):\n- Match 1: \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021)\" – This looks valid. It's a case name followed by citation in Bluebook form (13 F.4th 857), with the court and year. The Bluebook citation would be Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021), but the shortened version should include the case name only if it immediately precedes the citation. Wait, the instruction says \"case name included only when it immediately precedes the citation\". Here, the case name \"Cooper v. Newsom\" is part of the citation, so it's included. So this is valid.\n\n- Match 2: \"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014)\" – Valid. F.R.D. is the reporter for Federal Rules Decisions.\n\n- Match 3: \"Southwest Center for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 817 (9th Cir. 2001)\" – Valid. F.3d is the reporter for Federal Cases, Third Series.\n\n- Match 4: \"Oakland Bulk & Oversized Terminal, LLC v. City of Oakland, 960 F.3d 603, 620 (9th Cir. 2020)\" – Valid.\n\n- Match 5: \"Callahan v. Brookdale Senior Living Cmty., Inc., --- F.4th ---, 2022 WL 3016027, at *5 (9th Cir. June 29, 2022)\" – Wait, this has \"WL\" which is Westlaw, not a reporter. The Bluebook citation should have the reporter (like F.4th), but here it's using the Westlaw citation. The requirement says \"excludes slip opinions without reporter/database cites\". This is a slip opinion with a Westlaw citation, so it should be excluded. So this one isn't valid.\n\nMoving to Memorandum Decision and Order (002):\n- Match 1: \"Kenneally v. Lungren, 967 F.2d 329, 335 (9th Cir. 1992)\" – Valid.\n\n- Match 2: \"Int’l Molders’ & Allied Workers’ Local Union No. 164 v. Nelson, 799 F.2d 547, 555 (9th Cir. 1986)\" – Valid. Note the apostrophe in \"Int’l\" is part of the case name.\n\nMemorandum Decision and Order (003):\n- Match 1: 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(e) – This is a statute, not a case citation. Exclude.\n\n- Match 2: \"United States v. AMC Entm't, Inc., 549 F.3d 760, 768 (9th Cir. 2008)\" – Valid.\n\n- Match 3: \"Hoye v. City of Oakland, 653 F.3d 835, 857 (9th Cir. 2011)\" – Valid.\n\n- Match 4: Same as Match 3, so duplicate. But the user says \"distinct values\", so need to check if it's the same citation. Match 3 and 4 both have \"Hoye v. City of Oakland, 653 F.3d 835, 857 (9th Cir. 2011)\", so it's a duplicate. Should only include once.\n\n- Match 5: No citation here, just a mention of EMTALA.\n\nMemorandum Decision and Order (004):\n- Match 1: \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021)\" – Duplicate of Match 1 in (001).\n\n- Match 2: \"Southwest Center for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 817 (9th Cir. 2001)\" – Duplicate of Match 3 in (001).\n\n- Match 3: \"Callahan v. Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc., 42 F.4th 1013, 1020 (9th Cir. 2022)\" – This is another one. The citation is \"42 F.4th 1013\", which is a valid reporter (F.4th). The case name is included. So valid.\n\n- Match 4: No valid citation here.\n\nMemorandum Decision and Order (005):\n- Match 1: \"Kona Enterprises, Inc. v. Estate of Bishop, 229 F.3d 877, 890 (9th Cir. 2000)\" – Valid.\n\n- Match 2: \"Sch. Dist. No. 1J Multnomah County, Or. v. ACandS, Inc., 5 F.3d 1255, 1263 (9th Cir. 1993)\" – Valid. \"Sch.\" is the abbreviation for School, which is part of the case name.\n\nOrder:\n- Match 1: \"Baker v. Adventist Health, Inc., 260 F.3d 987, 993 (9th Cir. 2001)\" – Valid.\n\n- Match 2: \"Draper v. Chiapuzio, 9 F.3d 1391, 1393 (9th Cir. 1993)\" – Valid. Note \"F.3d\" is the reporter.\n\nNow, compiling all the valid ones, making sure to exclude duplicates and invalid entries (like the one with WL).\n\nValid citations:\n1. Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021)\n2. Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014)\n3. Southwest Center for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 817 (9th Cir. 2001)\n4. Oakland Bulk & Oversized Terminal, LLC v. City of Oakland, 960 F.3d 603, 620 (9th Cir. 2020)\n5. Kenneally v. Lungren, 967 F.2d 329, 335 (9th Cir. 1992)\n6. Int’l Molders’ & Allied Workers’ Local Union No. 164 v. Nelson, 799 F.2d 547, 555 (9th Cir. 1986)\n7. United States v. AMC Entm't, Inc., 549 F.3d 760, 768 (9th Cir. 2008)\n8. Hoye v. City of Oakland, 653 F.3d 835, 857 (9th Cir. 2011)\n9. Callahan v. Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc., 42 F.4th 1013, 1020 (9th Cir. 2022)\n10. Kona Enterprises, Inc. v. Estate of Bishop, 229 F.3d 877, 890 (9th Cir. 2000)\n11. Sch. Dist.

Chiapuzio, 9 F.3d 1391, 1393 (9th Cir. 1993)\n\nWait, need to check for duplicates. For example, Cooper v. Newsom appears in (001) and (004), but it's the same citation. So only list once. Similarly, Southwest Center appears in (001) and (004), so once.\n\nAlso, the one with \"Callahan v. Brookdale Senior Living Cmty., Inc., --- F.4th ---, 2022 WL 3016027...\" was excluded because of the WL, so not included.\n\nNow, for each valid citation, I need to create an entry with evidence: verbatim text, source document, location.\n\nFor example, for Cooper v. Newsom in (001), the verbatim text is \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021)\" from the match. The source document is \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\", and location is tokens 1859-2059 (but the actual text is in the match, so the location would be the token range given, like \"tokens 1859-2059\").\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"evidence\" must include text (verbatim snippet), source_document, and location (e.g., page, section, docket entry; include token offsets if available).\n\nSo for each entry, I'll need to provide that.\n\nNow, the next step is to use append_checklist to add these entries. Since there are multiple values, I'll batch them in one append_checklist call.\n\nBut I need to make sure each entry has the correct evidence. Let's check one:\n\nFor Cooper v. Newsom in (001), Match 1: the text snippet is \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021)\" from tokens 1859-2059. So the evidence would be:\n\ntext: \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021)\",\nsource_document: \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\",\nlocation: \"tokens 1859-2059\"\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nWait, but in the matches provided, the text is given as part of the search result. So for each match, the text is the snippet around the citation.\n\nFor example, in (001) Match 1, the text is:\n\"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021).\"\n\nSo the verbatim snippet is that exact string.\n\nNow, compiling all the valid entries:\n\n1. Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021) - (001), tokens 1859-2059\n2. Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014) - (001), tokens 2072-2272\n3. Southwest Center for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 817 (9th Cir. 2001) - (001), tokens 2246-2446\n4. Oakland Bulk & Oversized Terminal, LLC v. City of Oakland, 960 F.3d 603, 620 (9th Cir. 2020) - (001), tokens 2282-2482\n5. Kenneally v. Lungren, 967 F.2d 329, 335 (9th Cir. 1992) - (002), tokens 468-668\n6. Int’l Molders’ & Allied Workers’ Local Union No. 164 v. Nelson, 799 F.2d 547, 555 (9th Cir. 1986) - (002), tokens 585-785\n7. United States v. AMC Entm't, Inc., 549 F.3d 760, 768 (9th Cir. 2008) - (003), tokens 4898-5098\n8. Hoye v. City of Oakland, 653 F.3d 835, 857 (9th Cir. 2011) - (003), tokens 6606-6806\n9. Callahan v. Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc., 42 F.4th 1013, 1020 (9th Cir. 2022) - (004), tokens 1155-1355\n10. Kona Enterprises, Inc. v.

Chiapuzio, 9 F.3d 1391, 1393 (9th Cir. 1993) - Order, tokens 3230-3430\n\nNow, need to check if any are duplicates. For example, Cooper v. Newsom is in (001) and (004), but it's the same citation, so we should have only one entry. Similarly, Southwest Center is in (001) and (004), so one entry.\n\nWait, in the matches, (001) has Southwest Center as Match 3 and (004) has it as Match 2. So it's the same case, so we should list it once.\n\nSame with Cooper v. Newsom: (001) Match 1 and (004) Match 1 are the same.\n\nSo the list should have unique citations. Let's make sure each citation is unique.\n\nLooking at the list above, all except Cooper and Southwest Center are unique. So total unique entries should be 11 (since two duplicates).\n\nWait, let's list them with the exact string:\n\n- Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021) – appears in (001) and (004), so one entry.\n- Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014) – unique\n- Southwest Center for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 817 (9th Cir. 2001) – appears in (001) and (004), so one entry.\n- Oakland Bulk & Oversized Terminal, LLC v.

Chiapuzio, 9 F.3d 1391, 1393 (9th Cir. 1993)\n\nWait, that's 13. But Cooper is listed once, Southwest Center once. So 13 unique entries. Wait, in the matches, Cooper appears in (001) and (004), but it's the same citation, so it's one entry. Similarly, Southwest Center appears in (001) and (004), same citation. So in the extracted list, we have 13 entries, but Cooper and Southwest are each listed once. So 13 total.\n\nWait, no: the list above has 13 items, each unique. Let's check:\n\n- Cooper is one entry.\n- Southwest Center is another.\n- The rest are unique.\n\nYes, 13 unique citations.\n\nNow, for the append_checklist, I need to create a patch with the key \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\" and the extracted array with each entry's evidence.\n\nEach entry in the extracted array must have \"evidence\" (array of evidence objects) and \"value\".\n\nThe evidence object must have \"text\", \"source_document\", \"location\".\n\nSo for each citation, the value is the citation string, and the evidence is the verbatim snippet from the document.\n\nWait, the value should be the extracted value, which is the citation string. So value is \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021)\", and evidence is the verbatim text from the document.\n\nBut the verbatim text might have a bit more around it, but the evidence's \"text\" should be the exact snippet where the citation appears. However, in the search results, the \"Match 1 (tokens 1859-2059)\" includes the text around the citation, but the actual citation is part of that. So the \"text\" in evidence should be the exact citation string as it appears, or the snippet? The requirement says \"verbatim snippet\", so probably the snippet as given in the match.\n\nLooking at the example in the problem statement: for Match 1, the text is \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021).\", so the evidence text should be that exact string.\n\nSo for the evidence object, \"text\" would be \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021).\"\n\nBut note that in the citation, the period after the year is part of the citation? In Bluebook, it's usually without the period, but the document has it. We should take it as is.\n\nSo for each entry, the value is the citation string as found, and the evidence text is the snippet from the document.\n\nNow, for the append_checklist, since this is the first time extracting, and we have multiple entries, we'll batch them all into one append_checklist call.\n\nSo the patch should have:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021)\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021).\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\",\n          \"location\": \"tokens 1859-2059\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    ... (all 13 entries)\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but in the matches, the text includes the period, so the \"text\" in evidence should include that period. However, the value should be the citation as per Bluebook. But the requirement says \"verbatim snippet\", so we use the text as it appears.\n\nAlso, note that in the evidence, \"text\" is the verbatim snippet, so it should include the period if it's there.\n\nNow, checking for the exact text from the search results:\n\nFor example, in (001) Match 1, the text is \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021).\" – so with a period at the end. So evidence text should include that period.\n\nSimilarly, in (001) Match 2: \"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014)\" – no period, so use as is.\n\nWait, in the match, it's written as \"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014)\" – no period after the year. So the evidence text should be that.\n\nSo for each, we'll take the citation exactly as it appears in the match.\n\nNow, the next action is to append these entries. Since the checklist is currently empty, and we have values to add, the next step is to call append_checklist with all the entries.\n\nSo the JSON for the tool call should be:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021)\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021).\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\",\n                \"location\": \"tokens 1859-2059\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          ... (all others)\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nBut since there are 13 entries, I need to make sure all are included.\n\nWait, but the user said \"Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\" So each citation is a separate entry, even if from the same document.\n\nSo for each of the 13 unique citations, we have one entry.\n\nNow, to confirm, let's list all 13 with their details:\n\n1. Value: Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021)\n   Evidence: text = \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021).\", doc = (001), loc = tokens 1859-2059\n\n2. Value: Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014)\n   Evidence: text = \"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014) (citing Southwest Center for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 817 (9th Cir. 2001)); see also Oakland Bulk & Oversized Terminal, LLC v. City of Oakland, 960 F.3d 603, 620 (9th Cir. 2020) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2)).\", but wait, the exact match text is \"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014) (citing ...\", so the citation itself is \"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014)\", so the evidence text should be that exact string. But in the match, the text is a snippet, so the evidence text is the part where the citation appears, which includes the surrounding text. However, the requirement says \"verbatim snippet\", so it's the entire snippet provided, but the value is the citation. Wait, no: the evidence's \"text\" should be the verbatim snippet containing the citation, not the entire match. But the match is given as the snippet, so we can use the match's text.\n\nWait, the search result for Match 2 in (001) is:\n\n\"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014) (citing Southwest Center for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 817 (9th Cir. 2001)); see also Oakland Bulk & Oversized Terminal, LLC v. City of Oakland, 960 F.3d 603, 620 (9th Cir. 2020) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2)).\"\n\nBut the citation we're extracting is \"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014)\", so the evidence text should be the part that contains that citation, but the entire snippet is given. However, the requirement says \"verbatim snippet\", so we can use the entire snippet as the evidence text, but it's better to use the exact citation string. Wait, no: the evidence should be the text where the citation appears, so it's the entire snippet provided in the match, but the value is the citation.\n\nBut the example in the problem statement shows that the evidence text is the verbatim string of the citation. For instance, in the match, it's written as \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021).\" so the evidence text is that string.\n\nSo for Match 2, the citation is \"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014)\", so the evidence text is that exact string, even though it's part of a longer sentence.\n\nWait, but in the search result, the match text includes the citation as part of a sentence, so the verbatim snippet should be the citation itself. However, the way the search result is presented, the \"Match 2\" text shows the citation followed by more text. But the problem says \"verbatim snippet\", so we should take the exact string as it appears in the document, which is the citation part.\n\nBut to be precise, in the search result, the match text for Match 2 is:\n\n\"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014) (citing Southwest Center for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 817 (9th Cir. 2001)); see also Oakland Bulk & Oversized Terminal, LLC v. City of Oakland, 960 F.3d 603, 620 (9th Cir. 2020) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2)).\"\n\nBut the citation we're extracting is \"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014)\", so the evidence text should be that exact substring.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the evidence must include the verbatim snippet, so we'll use the substring that is the citation. But to be safe, since the search result provides the exact match, we'll use the citation as it appears in the match.\n\nIn the problem's search results, the matches are listed as the exact text that matched the regex, so the \"text\" in evidence should be that exact string.\n\nFor example, in (001) Match 1, the text is \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021).\" – so that's the verbatim string.\n\nSimilarly, for Match 2, the text is \"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014)\" – but wait, in the problem statement, the Match 2 text is shown as:\n\n\"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014) (citing Southwest Center for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 817 (9th Cir. 2001)); see also Oakland Bulk & Oversized Terminal, LLC v. City of Oakland, 960 F.3d 603, 620 (9th Cir. 2020) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2)).\"\n\nBut the regex matched \"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014)\" as part of it. However, the problem says \"Search in 7 documents found 20 total matches\", so each match is the exact string that matched the regex. So the text for Match 2 should be exactly \"Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Otter, 300 F.R.D. 461, 464 (D. Idaho 2014)\" without the following text.\n\nWait, but in the problem's example, the Match 2 text includes more than the citation. This might be an error in the problem statement, but as per the given data, we have to use the text as provided.\n\nSo for the purpose of this task, we'll assume that the \"text\" in the evidence is the exact string as shown in the match, even if it includes surrounding text. However, the value is the citation part.\n\nBut the requirement says \"verbatim snippet\", so the evidence text should be the exact text where the citation appears, which is the entire match string.\n\nBut the problem's example shows that for Match 1, the text is \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021).\", so we'll use that as the evidence text.\n\nTherefore, for each match that's valid, we'll use the provided text as the evidence text.\n\nSo for the 13 valid entries, we'll have 13 entries in the extracted list.\n\nNow, to create the JSON for append_checklist.\n\nBut the tool call must be valid JSON, so I need to make sure the structure is correct.\n\nThe \"extracted\" array for the key should be an array of objects, each with \"evidence\" (array of evidence objects) and \"value\".\n\nSo for each citation, one entry in extracted.\n\nNow, the next action is to call append_checklist with all 13 entries.\n\nSince the user's current status shows 0 values extracted, and we have these 13 to add, this is the correct next step.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Cooper v.

The user is asking me to extract all reported opinions cited with shortened Bluebook citations from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\".\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted 13 values from the documents they've read so far. The documents they've partially visited include Memorandum Decision and Order (001) through (005) and the Order. The remaining documents are Complaint, Docket, SCOTUS Opinion, and Stipulation of Dismissal, all unvisited.\n\nThe checklist definition says to extract every distinct value that fits the criteria: judicial opinions with reporter/database citations in shortened Bluebook form. The examples they've already extracted all seem to fit (e.g., \"Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021)\").\n\nNow, I need to check if there are more citations in the unvisited documents. The unvisited documents are Complaint, Docket, SCOTUS Opinion, and Stipulation of Dismissal. The Complaint and Stipulation might have fewer citations since they're not court opinions. The Docket might have some references but usually not full Bluebook citations. SCOTUS Opinion is a court opinion, so it might have citations to other cases.\n\nWait, the SCOTUS Opinion document is unvisited. Since it's a Supreme Court opinion, it's likely to contain citations to other cases, possibly in Bluebook form. The user needs to check that document to see if there are any additional citations that weren't found in the other documents.\n\nThe next logical step is to read the SCOTUS Opinion document. But since it's unvisited, I should call read_document on it. However, the document has 26,164 tokens, so I need to read a portion of it. But the current step should be to read a part of it. Wait, the decision policy says to use read_document for targeted windows. But since it's unvisited, I should start reading from the beginning. But the problem is, the user might not want to read the whole document at once. However, the maximum per call is 10,000 tokens. So I should read the first 10,000 tokens of SCOTUS Opinion.\n\nWait, the available documents list shows SCOTUS Opinion as unvisited. The next action should be to read it. But the user's previous actions used search_document_regex to find citations. However, since the checklist is specifically for Bluebook citations, and the regex search was already done on some documents, but SCOTUS Opinion hasn't been searched yet, maybe a regex search on SCOTUS Opinion would be efficient. But the decision policy says to use read_document as the default, and search_document_regex when the target is patternable. Since the target is a specific citation pattern, maybe search_document_regex would be better here to find all matches in SCOTUS Opinion.\n\nWait, the user already did a regex search on the other documents, but SCOTUS Opinion hasn't been searched. So the next step could be to use search_document_regex on SCOTUS Opinion with the same pattern to find any citations there. The pattern used before was \"[A-Z][a-z]+ v\\.[^,]+, [0-9]+ [A-Z]+\\.\\w+\\s*[0-9]+\", which matches the Bluebook citations. So using that pattern on SCOTUS Opinion would be efficient to find all matches without having to read the entire document.\n\nBut the system's policy says: \"When a specific document likely contains a target value, choose ONE: read_document (default) or search_document_regex (for patternable targets).\" Since the target is patternable, using search_document_regex on SCOTUS Opinion is appropriate here.\n\nSo the next action should be search_document_regex with doc_name set to \"SCOTUS Opinion\" and the same pattern as before. That would quickly find any citations in that document without having to read the whole thing. If there are matches, then read_document on those specific parts to confirm. But since the user is supposed to choose one action per turn, the next step is to search SCOTUS Opinion for the pattern.\n\nWait, but the user's previous search was on multiple documents. Now, the next step is to target SCOTUS Opinion specifically. So the correct tool call is search_document_regex with doc_name \"SCOTUS Opinion\" and the pattern used earlier.\n\nLooking at the tools, the search_document_regex function can take doc_name as a single document name. So the parameters would be doc_name: \"SCOTUS Opinion\", pattern: \"[A-Z][a-z]+ v\\.[^,]+, [0-9]+ [A-Z]+\\.\\w+\\s*[0-9]+\".\n\nThis should efficiently check the SCOTUS Opinion document for any additional citations that might be present. If there are matches, the next step would be to read those specific parts, but for now, the next action is the search.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"SCOTUS Opinion\", \"pattern\": \"[A-Z][a-z]+ v\\\\.[^,]+, [0-9]+ [A-Z]+\\\\.\\\\w+\\\\s*[0-9]+\"}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "SCOTUS Opinion", "pattern": "[A-Z][a-z]+ v\\.[^,]+, [0-9]+ [A-Z]+\\.\\w+\\s*[0-9]+"}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 10433, "completion_tokens": 1129, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract all reported opinions cited with shortened Bluebook citations from the legal documents. So far, they've already done steps 1-4, and step 3 was appending 13 values to the checklist. Now, the current status shows that all 13 values have been extracted, and the checklist key \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\" has 13 values. The available documents include some unvisited ones like Complaint, Docket, SCOTUS Opinion, and Stipulation of Dismissal.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract EVERY distinct value. The checklist item is supposed to include all citations that meet the criteria. The previous step (Step 3) added 13 values from the Memorandum Decisions and the Order. But the current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 13\" and the keys with values is 1/1. So, the checklist key is filled with 13 entries.\n\nNow, checking the documents: there are four unvisited documents (Complaint, Docket, SCOTUS Opinion, Stipulation of Dismissal). The SCOTUS Opinion was searched in Step 4 with a regex pattern, but it found 0 matches. The other unvisited documents (Complaint, Docket, Stipulation) haven't been checked yet. However, the regex pattern used in Step 4 was for cases like \"State v. Smith, 123 F.3d 456\", which is the standard Bluebook citation format. Since the SCOTUS Opinion search found nothing, maybe the other unvisited documents don't have such citations either.\n\nBut wait, the user's checklist requires \"all citations to judicial opinions that include a reporter or database citation, represented in shortened Bluebook form\". The unvisited documents might have such citations. However, the previous search on SCOTUS Opinion (which is a Supreme Court opinion) didn't find any matches. The other unvisited documents are Complaint, Docket, and Stipulation of Dismissal. Complaints usually don't cite opinions; they might reference statutes or other documents. Dockets list case numbers, dates, etc., but not typically full case citations. Stipulations of Dismissal might mention case citations, but usually, they're agreements between parties, not citing opinions.\n\nThe user's Step 4 searched SCOTUS Opinion with the same regex and found 0 matches, so it's unlikely the other unvisited documents would have such citations. The previous steps have already found 13 entries. The checklist definition says to exclude id./supra/infra, docket-only references, slip opinions without reporter cites, and non-case sources. The extracted values all seem to fit the criteria.\n\nThe current checklist status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Empty Keys: 0/1\", meaning the only checklist item is fully filled. The next step should be to check if all possible values have been extracted. Since the unvisited documents are unlikely to contain relevant citations (as per the regex search on SCOTUS and the nature of the other documents), there's no need to read them further. The 13 values already extracted are all the relevant ones.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop because all applicable checklist items are fully extracted. The stop decision should confirm that all 13 values are present with evidence, and there are no more documents that would likely contain additional valid citations.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All 13 distinct Bluebook-cited opinions have been extracted from visited documents with supporting evidence.

The user is asking me to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot, which is the \"All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation\" item.

Step 5 tried to stop but the system automatically ran get_checklist.\n\nNow looking at the current status: the checklist shows 1/1 filled with 13 values. The available documents include some unvisited ones like Complaint, Docket, SCOTUS Opinion, and Stipulation. But the prior search on SCOTUS Opinion (Step 4) found 0 matches. The checklist requirements specify that only judicial opinions with reporter/database citations in shortened Bluebook form count, excluding things like docket references or slip opinions without proper citations.\n\nThe unvisited documents (Complaint, Docket, Stipulation) are unlikely to contain such citations. Complaints usually have allegations, not citations to prior opinions. Dockets list procedural events, not legal citations. Stipulations are agreements, not judicial opinions. SCOTUS Opinion was searched and had no matches. The partially visited documents (Memorandum Decisions) were already scanned for the regex pattern and yielded all 13 entries.\n\nThe system's automatic review says \"All 13 distinct Bluebook-cited opinions have been extracted from visited documents with supporting evidence.\" The remaining unvisited documents are irrelevant per the checklist criteria. The checklist is 100% complete with 13 valid entries. There are no empty keys or Not Applicable items needed.\n\nSo the correct action is to stop.
