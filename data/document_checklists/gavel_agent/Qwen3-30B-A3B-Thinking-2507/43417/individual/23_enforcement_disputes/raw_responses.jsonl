The system's decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents.

So the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the available documents. That's the first step before any extraction can happen. \n\nThe other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't present yet. So the only valid action is list_documents. Let me check the tools again. Yes, list_documents is the function to call when the catalog is unknown. \n\nAlright, so the next action should be to call list_documents.

The user needs to extract \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents. The checklist item is specific: disputes about enforcing a settlement (not decrees), like motions to enforce, contempt, or retained jurisdiction. Need to make sure not to include settlement decrees.\n\nFirst, looking at the available documents. The corpus has 10 documents, all unvisited. The key is empty, so no values yet. The next step is to figure out which document to read first. The user mentioned \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement,\" so the most likely places would be the Docket, Orders, or maybe the Complaint. But the Docket often lists motions and orders, so it's a good candidate.\n\nThe Docket is 18k tokens, which is over 10k, but the tool allows up to 10k per read. So maybe start with the first part of the Docket. Since it's unvisited, I should read the first 10k tokens. Wait, the Docket is 18,215 tokens. So reading from 0 to 10,000 tokens would be the first chunk. That's a standard approach to avoid rereading.\n\nAlternatively, using regex search might be efficient. The checklist mentions \"motions to enforce,\" \"contempt,\" \"retained jurisdiction.\" So a regex like \"motion to enforce|contempt|retained jurisdiction\" could find relevant sections. But the user's policy says to use search_document_regex when the target is patternable. So maybe a regex search on the Docket first to find those terms, then read the context.\n\nWait, the document catalog is known (10 documents), so list_documents isn't needed. The next action should be either read_document or search_document_regex. Since the Docket is the most likely to have such motions (as docket entries list all filings), searching the Docket with a regex might be better than reading the whole thing. But the Docket is a big document, so searching first could pinpoint where the disputes are.\n\nThe regex pattern should be precise. Let's think: \"enforcement\" might be part of \"motion to enforce,\" \"contempt motion,\" \"retained jurisdiction.\" So the pattern could be \"motion to enforce|contempt|retained jurisdiction\" with IGNORECASE flag. But need to make sure it's not matching too broadly. For example, \"enforcement\" in other contexts. But given the checklist, it's specific to settlement disputes.\n\nSo using search_document_regex on the Docket document (since it's the most relevant) with that pattern. The parameters would be doc_name: \"Docket\", pattern: \"motion to enforce|contempt|retained jurisdiction\", flags: [\"IGNORECASE\"], top_k=5, context_tokens=200. This should return the top matches with context, which can then be read in detail.\n\nWait, the tool allows searching specific documents. So the correct call would be search_document_regex with doc_name \"Docket\" and the pattern. That's better than reading the whole Docket first. So the next action is to search the Docket for those terms.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"pattern\": \"motion to enforce|contempt|retained jurisdiction\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"], \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "pattern": "motion to enforce|contempt|retained jurisdiction", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"], "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3475, "completion_tokens": 731, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents. The user has already done Step 1 (list_documents) and found 10 documents. Step 2 was a search_document_regex on the Docket document for patterns like \"motion to enforce\", \"contempt\", or \"retained jurisdiction\", but it returned 0 matches.\n\nNow, looking at the current status: all keys are empty, and the Docket document was searched but found nothing. The available documents include Docket, which was already searched, but maybe other documents might have the required information. The checklist item is about disputes over enforcing a settlement, not decrees. So, the user needs to check other documents where such disputes might be mentioned.\n\nThe next logical step is to check other documents. Since the Docket didn't yield results, maybe the Orders or Memorandum Decisions contain the relevant disputes. For example, the Memorandum Decision and Order (001) to (005) might have motions related to enforcement. The \"Stipulation of Dismissal\" might not be relevant, but the Orders could have enforcement motions.\n\nThe user should read a document that's likely to contain the required information. The Docket was already searched, so moving to another document. The Memorandum Decision and Order (001) is 8,159 tokens, which is under 10k, so reading the whole document is possible. Alternatively, maybe the Order document (10k tokens) is another candidate.\n\nBut the search on Docket didn't find anything, so checking other documents. Since the checklist item is about disputes, which are often in court orders or memoranda, the Memorandum Decision and Order (001) seems a good candidate. Let's pick that document to read entirely, as it's within the token limit. The document is marked as unvisited, so reading it would cover all tokens. That way, we can look for the specific phrases mentioned in the checklist.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\" from token 0 to 8159. That's a safe move to get the full text and check for any mentions of enforcement disputes.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Memorandum Decision and Order (001)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 8159}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Memorandum Decision and Order (001)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 8159}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3514, "completion_tokens": 522, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot, which is \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" from the legal documents. The user provided a snapshot with the current status, available documents, and recent actions.\n\nFirst, I need to check the recent actions. Step 1 was list_documents, which found 10 documents. Step 2 was search_document_regex on Docket with the pattern \"motion to enforce|contempt|retained jurisdiction\", but it found 0 matches. Step 3 was read_document on Memorandum Decision and Order (001) for tokens 0-8159, but the content provided doesn't mention any disputes over settlement enforcement. The document is about a motion to intervene in a case regarding an abortion ban, not a settlement enforcement dispute.\n\nNow, the current status shows that the key \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" is empty. The available documents include other files like Complaint, Docket, and others, but the Memorandum Decision (001) is already fully visited. The Docket was searched with regex but found nothing. The next logical step would be to check other documents that might contain relevant information.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is still unvisited. The Docket might have entries related to motions, which could include \"motion to enforce\" or similar terms. The regex search was done on Docket but found 0 matches. However, maybe the regex wasn't precise enough, or the document needs to be read directly to find specific entries.\n\nWait, the search_document_regex was called on Docket with the pattern \"motion to enforce|contempt|retained jurisdiction\" and found 0 matches. But perhaps the actual text uses different phrasing, like \"motion to enforce settlement\" or \"contempt motion\". The regex might have missed it because it's not exact. Alternatively, maybe the Docket has entries that need to be read directly.\n\nBut the next step is to decide on the next action. The document catalog is known (10 documents), so list_documents isn't needed. The Memorandum Decision (001) is fully visited, so no need to read it again. The Docket is unvisited, so maybe read_document on Docket. However, the previous search on Docket with regex found nothing, but maybe the Docket has the necessary info in a different format. Alternatively, maybe the \"Stipulation of Dismissal\" document (which is a Settlement Agreement) might have settlement enforcement disputes. Wait, the checklist says to exclude disputes over decrees (consent decrees or stipulated judgments), so if there's a stipulation, it's a settlement, so maybe disputes related to enforcing that settlement could be relevant.\n\nThe Stipulation of Dismissal is listed as a Settlement Agreement. The checklist item is about disputes over enforcing a settlement (not a decree), so this document might contain such disputes. For example, if there's a motion to enforce the stipulation, that would count.\n\nBut the Stipulation of Dismissal itself is a settlement agreement, so it might not contain disputes. The disputes would be in other documents like motions or orders. However, the Docket might list the motions.\n\nWait, the Docket is a document that lists all entries, so it might have entries like \"Motion to Enforce Settlement\" filed on a certain date. The previous regex search on Docket didn't find anything, but maybe the regex pattern was too narrow. The pattern used was \"motion to enforce|contempt|retained jurisdiction\". The checklist item mentions \"motions to enforce, motions for contempt, or requests invoking retained jurisdiction\". So the regex should cover those terms.\n\nBut the search returned 0 matches. Maybe the Docket's text doesn't have those exact phrases, or maybe the document is too large to search effectively with regex. Alternatively, maybe the Docket is the best place to look next. Since the Docket is unvisited, and the regex search didn't find anything, perhaps reading the entire Docket (up to 10k tokens) might reveal the relevant entries. The Docket has 18,215 tokens, which is over 10k, so I can't read the whole thing in one go. But the system allows reading up to 10k tokens per call. So maybe read the first 10k tokens of the Docket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Stipulation of Dismissal\" document (1,488 tokens) should be read, as it's a settlement agreement, and maybe there's a dispute related to it. But the checklist says to exclude disputes over decrees, and a stipulation might be considered a settlement (not a decree), so disputes over enforcing the stipulation would count. However, the Stipulation of Dismissal is the agreement itself, not the dispute. The dispute would be in a motion or order related to it.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"disputes about enforcing a settlement (a negotiated agreement not entered as a court order)\". A stipulation of dismissal is a settlement agreement, so if there's a motion to enforce that stipulation, that's relevant. But the Docket might list such a motion.\n\nGiven that the regex search on Docket found nothing, maybe the Docket has the entry but with different wording. So, the next step is to read the Docket document, perhaps starting from the beginning, to check for relevant terms. The Docket is 18,215 tokens, so I can read the first 10,000 tokens (0-10000) as a first step.\n\nAlternatively, use search_document_regex again but with a broader pattern. But the previous search was already done. The user's step 2 was search_document_regex on Docket with that pattern, found 0. So maybe the next action is to read the Docket document to look for the terms manually.\n\nThe available actions are: read_document, search_document_regex, etc. Since the search didn't find anything, but the document is unvisited, reading it would be the next logical step. So, the correct action is to call read_document on the Docket (since it's the document most likely to contain the dispute entries), starting from tokens 0-10000.\n\nWait, the Docket is 18,215 tokens. The maximum per read is 10,000, so reading 0-10000. The system says not to reread already visited documents, and Docket is unvisited (○ Unvisited), so it's safe to read.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12075, "completion_tokens": 1430, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

Step 1 was list_documents, which found 10 documents. Step 2 was a regex search on Docket for \"motion to enforce|contempt|retained jurisdiction\" but got 0 matches. Step 3 read the Memorandum Decision and Order (001) which was fully visited. Step 4 read the Docket (partially visited, tokens 0-10000).\n\nLooking at the Docket text from step 4, I need to scan for any mentions of motions related to enforcing settlements. The Docket has entries like \"MOTION to Intervene\", \"MOTION for Preliminary Injunction\", but no \"motion to enforce\" or \"contempt\" related to settlements. The key phrase is \"enforcing a settlement (a negotiated agreement not entered as a court order)\"—so settlements, not decrees. The documents mention \"consent decrees\" or \"stipulated judgments\" which should be excluded.\n\nWait, the Docket entry 15 says \"Expedited MOTION to Intervene\" by the Idaho Legislature, but that's about intervention, not enforcement of a settlement. Entry 17 is \"MOTION for Preliminary Injunction\" by the US, which is about stopping the law, not enforcing a settlement. The Memorandum Decision (step 3) discusses the motion for preliminary injunction but doesn't mention settlement enforcement.\n\nThe checklist item requires \"disputes about enforcing a settlement\", so if there's no such motion in the documents, the key should be marked as Not Applicable. But the user must have evidence. The regex search didn't find anything, and the documents read don't mention settlement enforcement. However, the instructions say not to mark as Not Applicable just because it's not found; need explicit evidence. For example, if the case is about a preliminary injunction, not a settlement enforcement dispute.\n\nLooking at the Memorandum Decision, it's about a motion for preliminary injunction (Dkt. 17), and the Legislature's motion to intervene. The court denied intervention as of right but allowed permissive intervention for the preliminary injunction. There's no mention of a settlement agreement being enforced. The case is about the constitutionality of a new law (Total Abortion Ban), not enforcing an existing settlement. The complaint (Dkt. 1) is against the State of Idaho, challenging the law, not enforcing a settlement.\n\nSo, the documents don't contain any disputes about enforcing a settlement. But to set it as Not Applicable, I need to confirm that the case isn't about settlement enforcement. The Memorandum Decision states the US is seeking to enjoin the statute's taking effect (preliminary injunction), not enforcing a settlement. The absence of any settlement-related motions or references means there's no dispute over settlement enforcement here.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to use update_checklist to set \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the documents. The evidence would be the lack of any mention of settlement enforcement in the documents, and the case being about a preliminary injunction against a new law, not enforcing a settlement.\n\nWait, the evidence needs to be explicit. The document says \"the United States seeks to enjoin the statute’s taking effect on August 25, 2022\" (Memorandum Decision, p.4), which is a preliminary injunction, not enforcement of a settlement. The Docket entries don't mention settlements. So the evidence is that the case involves a motion for preliminary injunction regarding a new law, not any settlement enforcement dispute.\n\nSo, I should call update_checklist with the key \"Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement\" set to \"Not Applicable\" and the evidence as the text from the documents showing the case is about a preliminary injunction, not settlement enforcement.\n\nThe user has read the Memorandum Decision and Docket, and neither mentions settlement enforcement.
