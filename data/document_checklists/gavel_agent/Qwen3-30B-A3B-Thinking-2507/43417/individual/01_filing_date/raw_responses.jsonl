The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The \"Available Documents\" section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call `list_documents`. The snapshot mentions that the document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. The user can't read any documents if there aren't any, so the next logical step is to list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none listed, those can't be used yet. `get_checklist` would just show empty results, and `append` or `update` aren't applicable without data. So the only correct action is to call `list_documents` to discover the available documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3091, "completion_tokens": 221, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the available documents, all are unvisited. The Complaint document is a good starting point because the filing date is likely in the complaint, as it's the initial filing. The Complaint has 8,578 tokens, which is under the 10k limit for a single read_document call. So, reading the entire Complaint makes sense here.\n\nI should use read_document on the Complaint document, starting at token 0 and ending at 8578. That way, I can check the whole document for the filing date. Other documents like Docket or Orders might have the date too, but the Complaint is the most probable place for the initial filing date. Plus, it's the first document listed, so it's logical to start there.\n\nNo regex search is needed yet because the filing date is a specific date format, but the Complaint is the primary target. Using read_document directly on the Complaint will give the text to analyze. Once I get the text, I can look for dates and extract them with evidence.\n\nWait, the problem says to extract every distinct value. So I need to make sure I check for all possible dates in the document. But since it's the initial filing, there's probably one main date. But maybe there are multiple dates, so I should check thoroughly.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned that each extracted value must have evidence: verbatim text, source document, and location. So after reading the Complaint, I'll look for the date, note the exact text, document name, and where it's located (maybe the first page or header).\n\nSo the next step is definitely read_document for the Complaint. No need for regex here because the date is likely in a standard place. Let's go with that.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 8578}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 8578}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3398, "completion_tokens": 434, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the filing date from legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the current status: the Complaint document has been fully read (tokens 0-8578), and it's marked as ✓ Fully Visited. The extracted text from the Complaint shows \"Filed 08/02/22\" on the first page. So the filing date is August 2, 2022, which is 08/02/22.\n\nThe system requires that every extracted value must have evidence with text, source document, and location. The text snippet \"Filed 08/02/22\" is verbatim from the document. The source is \"Complaint\", and the location is page 1 (or token range 0-8578, but since it's the first page, specifying \"Page 1\" is clear).\n\nSince this is the only value for Filing_Date found so far, and the document is fully visited, the next step is to append this value to the checklist. The user can't use update_checklist here because it's the first value, and append_checklist is for adding new entries. The checklist key Filing_Date is empty, so appending the value makes sense.\n\nI need to make sure not to miss any other occurrences. But since the Complaint is fully read and this is the only filing date mentioned, there's no need to search other documents yet. The other documents are unvisited, but the filing date is typically in the complaint or docket, and the complaint already has it. So appending this value should be the correct next action.\n\nThe evidence must include the text, source, and location. The text is \"Filed 08/02/22\", source is \"Complaint\", location is \"Page 1\" (as per the document's header). The date format is 08/02/22, which should be kept as is since it's verbatim.\n\nSo the action is to use append_checklist with the key Filing_Date and the extracted value. The evidence array will have one entry with the text, source, and location.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Filing_Date\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"08/02/22\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 1   Filed 08/02/22   Page 1 of 17\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 1\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "08/02/22", "evidence": [{"text": "Case 1:22-cv-00329-BLW   Document 1   Filed 08/02/22   Page 1 of 17", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 12469, "completion_tokens": 581, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The Complaint is marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so they can't read it again. The checklist item Filing_Date has one value, and the system says all keys are filled (1/1).\n\nWait, the checklist only has one item: Filing_Date. They have one value from the Complaint. The next step is to check if there are any other documents that might have a different filing date. But the problem says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So maybe there are other documents with different filing dates?\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaint is fully visited, but others are unvisited (○ Unvisited). However, the filing date is typically the date the complaint was filed, which is usually in the first document. But maybe other documents like the Docket or Orders could have different dates? Wait, the filing date for the lawsuit is the date the complaint was filed, which is the first document. Other documents like orders or dismissals would have their own dates, but the checklist specifically says \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed/initiated with the court.\" So that's the date on the Complaint, which is already extracted.\n\nThe user's recent action was appending the Filing_Date from the Complaint. The system shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" meaning all keys are filled. The stop criteria say to stop when every checklist key is either complete or Not Applicable. Since there's only one key and it's already filled with one value, and there's no indication of other values (since the Complaint is the first document), they should stop.\n\nWait, but maybe they need to check other documents to confirm there are no other filing dates. But the filing date for the lawsuit is a single date—the date the complaint was filed. Other documents might have dates, but they wouldn't be the filing date of the lawsuit. For example, a dismissal might have a date, but that's the dismissal date, not the filing date. The checklist specifies \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed,\" so only the complaint's date matters.\n\nThe document catalog shows that Complaint is fully visited, and the extracted value is from there.
