The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The checklist item \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" is empty, and there are no documents available.\n\nHmm, the task says to extract all checklist items from the provided documents, but the system states there are no documents discovered yet. The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet. So, the next step is definitely to call list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3141, "completion_tokens": 204, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and they want all distinct values with evidence.\n\nFirst, the current status shows all keys are empty, and there are 10 unvisited documents. The previous step was list_documents, which found 10 docs. Now, I need to pick the next action.\n\nSince the catalog is known (10 documents listed), I shouldn't call list_documents again. The next step is to read or search a document. The checklist item is about whether it's a class action or individual plaintiffs. The key phrases might be in the Complaint, Docket, or Orders.\n\nLooking at the documents, \"Complaint\" is a good starting point because class actions are often stated there. The Complaint is 8,578 tokens, which is under 10k, so reading the whole thing is possible. But maybe I should check if there's a pattern. However, the requirement is to extract all distinct values, so reading the Complaint first makes sense.\n\nWait, the user said to use read_document for targeted windows. Since the document is unvisited, I should read the entire document. But the token count is 8,578, which is under 10k, so start_token 0 to end_token 8578.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for \"class action\" or \"individual plaintiffs\" to find relevant sections. But the instructions say if the target is clearly patternable, use search_document_regex. However, the problem is that the exact phrasing might vary. So maybe searching for \"class action\" would help.\n\nWait, the checklist item's value format is specific: 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'. So the text might say something like \"Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action\" or \"Plaintiffs are individuals...\".\n\nUsing regex search might be efficient. Let me think. The pattern could be something like \"class action|class action\\s+claims|individual plaintiffs\". But the regex should be precise. Let's use a pattern that matches common phrases.\n\nBut the user's example uses \"class action\" so maybe the regex pattern should be \"class\\s+action\" or \"class action\". However, to be safe, maybe search for \"class action\" as a phrase. The pattern could be \"class action\" with IGNORECASE.\n\nWait, the search_document_regex function allows using a pattern. So I should call search_document_regex with pattern \"class action\" to find where it's mentioned. But the problem is that the document might have it in different contexts. However, since the user needs all instances, searching for the key phrase is a good start.\n\nAlternatively, reading the Complaint document directly might be better because the Complaint is where the class action status is usually stated. Since the Complaint is a specific document, reading it entirely might be straightforward.\n\nBut the system says to use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable. Since \"class action\" is a clear pattern, using search might be faster. Let me check the tools. The search_document_regex can search all documents or specific ones. Since the user has multiple documents, maybe search all to find where it's mentioned.\n\nWait, the available documents include Complaint, Docket, etc. The Complaint is most likely to have the class action status. So maybe search the Complaint specifically. But the function allows specifying doc_names. So I can set doc_names to [\"Complaint\"] and pattern \"class action\".\n\nBut the problem is that the user might have to read the document anyway to get the exact context. However, the search function returns context around the matches, which could save time. So using search_document_regex on the Complaint with the pattern \"class action\" might give the relevant snippets.\n\nWait, the current step says to choose one action. The options are to read_document or search_document_regex. Since the target is a specific term, using search might be better. Let's go with search_document_regex on the Complaint document.\n\nSo the parameters would be doc_names: [\"Complaint\"], pattern: \"class action\", and maybe context_tokens. But the default context_tokens is 200, which is fine.\n\nAlternatively, if I search all documents, but the Complaint is the most relevant. To be efficient, search only the Complaint first. So the action should be search_document_regex with doc_names as [\"Complaint\"] and pattern \"class action\".\n\nWait, the pattern should be a regex. So \"class action\" as a regex would match that exact phrase. But maybe adding word boundaries: \\bclass action\\b. But the user might have variations. However, the instructions say to use precise patterns. So \"class action\" should work.\n\nSo the function call would be search_document_regex with doc_names: [\"Complaint\"], pattern: \"class action\", and default flags and context_tokens.\n\nYes, that's the way to go. So the next action is search_document_regex.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_names\": [\"Complaint\"], \"pattern\": \"class action\", \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"doc_names": ["Complaint"], "pattern": "class action", "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3448, "completion_tokens": 1084, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nLooking at the current status: all 10 documents are unvisited (marked with ○), and the previous search for \"class action\" in the Complaint document returned 0 matches. But wait, the search was only done on the Complaint document. Maybe the term is phrased differently in other documents. For example, maybe \"class action\" isn't the exact phrase used; it could be \"class action lawsuit\" or \"class action claim\".\n\nThe next logical step would be to check other documents. The Complaint was searched, but maybe the Docket or the Orders have the info. The Docket might mention the case type. The Memorandum Orders could also have references to class actions, especially if there's a ruling on class certification.\n\nSince the previous search on Complaint with \"class action\" didn't find anything, but the Complaint is the main document where the plaintiff's claim would be stated, maybe the search pattern was too narrow. But the user's instruction says to use regex, so maybe they need to try a different pattern. However, the system says not to use broad patterns. Wait, the previous step used \"class action\" as the pattern, which might be too specific. Maybe \"class\" alone would capture more, but the requirement is to find \"class action\" as a term. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\", so if the Complaint didn't have it, maybe the other documents do. The Docket might have a line like \"Class Action Filed\" or similar. The Orders might have a section on class certification. The Stipulation of Dismissal could indicate if it was a class action that was dismissed.\n\nThe available documents include \"Stipulation of Dismissal\" which might have a note about the case type. But since the search on Complaint didn't find anything, maybe the next step is to read the Complaint document more thoroughly. Wait, the Complaint is unvisited, so the previous search was a regex search that found 0 matches. But maybe the actual text uses a different phrasing. The regex search might not have caught it because the pattern was too strict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Complaint is the best place to check, so reading the entire document (since it's 8,578 tokens, under 10k) would be safe. But the user's previous search used \"class action\" and found 0, but maybe the document has \"Class Action\" with a capital C, or \"Class-Action\", etc. However, the regex search should have caught that if it's using the correct flags. Wait, the search used a pattern \"class action\" without flags, so it's case-sensitive. Maybe the document uses \"Class Action\" with a capital C. So the regex should have been case-insensitive, but the previous step didn't specify flags. But the user's tool call in Step 2 was a regex search with pattern \"class action\", which is case-sensitive. So maybe the actual text has \"Class Action\" (capital C), so the search missed it.\n\nBut the current task is to choose the next action. Since the Complaint was searched with \"class action\" and got 0 matches, but the document is unvisited, perhaps the next step is to read the entire Complaint document to check for any mention of class action, even if the regex search missed it. Wait, but the regex search should have covered that. Wait, no: the regex search uses the pattern as given, so if the document has \"Class Action\", the pattern \"class action\" (lowercase) wouldn't match. So the regex search was case-sensitive, hence missed it. But the user can't change the pattern in the next step; they have to choose an action.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term is not \"class action\" but something like \"class action complaint\" or \"class action status\". But the user's step 2 used \"class action\" as the pattern, which is the key phrase. Since that search returned 0, maybe the document doesn't have it, but the user should check other documents.\n\nWait, the next step is to choose one action. The available options are to read a document, search again, etc. Since the previous regex search on Complaint found nothing, but maybe other documents have the info, the best action is to read the Docket, because the Docket often lists the case type. The Docket is 18k tokens, which is over 10k, so they can't read the whole thing. But the system says to read a targeted window (≤10k tokens). So they should read the first 10k tokens of the Docket.\n\nWait, but the Docket is 18k tokens. So start_token=0, end_token=10000. That's allowed. So the next action should be read_document for Docket, first 10k tokens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Stipulation of Dismissal mentions it. But the Stipulation is only 1.4k tokens, so they could read the whole thing. But the Docket is more likely to have the case type.\n\nWait, the checklist is about whether it's a class action or individual. The Docket usually has the case type listed in the header or summary. So reading the Docket's first part is a good idea.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on Docket, start=0, end=10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3478, "completion_tokens": 1226, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which needs to be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, they did a `search_document_regex` on the Complaint with the pattern \"class action\" and found 0 matches. Then they read the Docket document from tokens 0-10000. Now, the Docket has been partially visited (0-10000 out of 18,215 tokens).\n\nI need to check if the Docket contains any mention of class action. Let me scan through the Docket entries they provided. The first entry is a Complaint filed by The United States. The next entries are Notices of Appearance by various attorneys. The Docket mentions \"COMPLAINT against State of Idaho, filed by The United States.\" Then there's an order about a status conference, and motions related to preliminary injunction.\n\nWait, the Complaint is filed by The United States, which is a federal government entity. Typically, the United States as a plaintiff isn't part of a class action because it's a sovereign entity. But the key is to check if the document explicitly states whether it's a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nLooking at the Docket entries, entry 1 says \"COMPLAINT against State of Idaho, filed by The United States.\" There's no mention of \"class action\" here. The motions filed (like Motion for Preliminary Injunction) don't specify class action status. The term \"class action\" isn't in the provided Docket text. The search earlier with \"class action\" found nothing, so maybe the case isn't a class action.\n\nBut the checklist requires checking all documents. The Docket is partially read, but maybe the Complaint (which hasn't been read yet) has the information. The Complaint is the main document where the case type would be stated. The user did a regex search on Complaint but got 0 matches. Wait, the search was on \"Complaint\" document with pattern \"class action\", and found 0 matches. But maybe the Complaint document actually has the term. However, the search didn't find any, so perhaps it's not there.\n\nWait, the user's recent action was `search_document_regex` on Complaint (pattern: \"class action\") and it found 0 matches. So the Complaint document doesn't have \"class action\" in it. But maybe the term is phrased differently, like \"class action\" in another form. However, the regex search should have caught that if it was present.\n\nGiven that the Docket and Complaint don't mention class action, maybe the case is not a class action. But the checklist requires evidence. If there's no mention, then it's not a class action, so the plaintiffs are individual (but the United States is a single plaintiff, so it's individual, not a class).\n\nWait, the United States as a plaintiff is a single entity, so it's individual plaintiffs, not a class action. The checklist item should be 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [The United States]'.\n\nBut need to confirm if the Complaint states it's not a class action. If the Complaint doesn't mention class action, and the Docket entries don't either, then it's safe to say it's individual.\n\nHowever, the user's task is to extract from the documents. The Complaint document hasn't been read yet (it's unvisited), but the search on it for \"class action\" returned 0. So maybe the Complaint doesn't have that term. But the Complaint might state the nature of the suit.\n\nWait, the Complaint is a document that would specify if it's a class action. Since the search for \"class action\" in the Complaint found nothing, perhaps the Complaint doesn't use that exact term, but maybe it's implied. But the user needs to find explicit evidence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Docket entry 1 says \"COMPLAINT against State of Idaho, filed by The United States.\" The fact that it's filed by \"The United States\" (singular) implies it's not a class action, as class actions typically involve multiple plaintiffs. So the plaintiffs are individual (the United States as a single plaintiff).\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if there's any mention of \"class\" or \"class action\" in the documents. Since the regex search on Complaint found nothing, and the Docket read so far (up to token 10000) also doesn't have it, maybe the case is not a class action.\n\nWait, the user's next step should be to check if the Complaint document has the necessary info. But since the regex search on Complaint (using \"class action\") didn't find anything, maybe the Complaint doesn't mention it. However, the Complaint might have the case type in the caption or elsewhere.\n\nBut the user hasn't read the Complaint yet. The available documents include Complaint as unvisited. So the next logical step is to read the Complaint document. But the user can't read the whole thing at once; they have to read a token range. Since it's unvisited, they can start reading from 0-10000.\n\nWait, the Docket was partially read (0-10000), but the Complaint is unvisited. The user should read the Complaint to check for \"class action\" or other relevant terms. But the previous search on Complaint with \"class action\" found 0 matches. However, maybe the term is present in a different form, or the search wasn't thorough. But the search used the exact pattern, so if it's not there, it's not there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Docket has the answer. Let's check the Docket entries again. Entry 1: \"COMPLAINT against State of Idaho, filed by The United States.\" No mention of class action. The motions are filed by various attorneys, but all on behalf of the United States, which is a single plaintiff. So it's individual.\n\nBut the checklist requires evidence. The evidence would be the Complaint's filing statement. However, the Complaint document hasn't been read. The Docket entry 1 mentions the Complaint, but the actual Complaint document might have the details.\n\nWait, the Docket entry says \"COMPLAINT against State of Idaho, filed by The United States.\" So the Complaint is filed by the United States, which is a single plaintiff. Therefore, it's individual, not class action. So the evidence is in the Docket entry 1.\n\nBut the Docket entry 1 is part of the Docket document, which was read (tokens 0-10000). So the evidence is present in the Docket.\n\nSo the extracted value should be 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as The United States'.\n\nThe location would be Docket entry 1, which is in the Docket document. The evidence text is \"COMPLAINT against State of Idaho, filed by The United States.\"\n\nTherefore, the next action is to append this to the checklist.\n\nWait, the current status shows 0 values extracted. So the user needs to use `append_checklist` with the extracted value.\n\nThe checklist key is Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs. The value is 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as The United States'.\n\nEvidence: text is \"COMPLAINT against State of Idaho, filed by The United States.\" Source document is Docket. Location is Docket entry 1 (or token range 0-10000, but since it's entry 1, maybe specify as \"Docket Entry 1\").\n\nSo the action should be `append_checklist` with this entry.\n\nWait, but the user's recent action was reading the Docket (0-10000), and now they need to process that. The Docket entry 1 is within the read tokens, so the evidence is available.\n\nSo the correct next action is to append the checklist item with the extracted value.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as The United States\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"1 | 2022-08-02 | COMPLAINT against State of Idaho, filed by The United States.

The user is trying to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs, which needs to specify if plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nFrom the recent actions, they've already done a `read_document` on the Docket (tokens 0-10000) and found one entry: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as The United States\" from Docket Entry 1. They've appended that to the checklist.\n\nNow, the current status shows 1 key with 1 value, and all other keys (empty or Not Applicable) are 0. The task is to extract EVERY distinct value. So I need to check if there are more entries in other documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket is partially visited (0-10000 tokens), but the rest are unvisited. The Docket entry they read might have more info beyond the first 10k tokens. Wait, the Docket has 18,215 tokens, and they read 0-10000 (55% coverage). So there's still 8,215 tokens left unvisited. Maybe the class action status is mentioned again later in the Docket.\n\nBut the user's task is to extract all distinct values. The current entry says \"The United States\" as individual plaintiffs. But maybe in other documents like the Complaint or Orders, it's stated as a class action. Wait, the Complaint is unvisited. The Complaint might state whether it's a class action.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says: \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The current extraction is Individual with \"The United States\" as the description. But the user needs to check if there's any mention of class action elsewhere.\n\nThe previous step used `search_document_regex` on \"class action\" in the Complaint, which found 0 matches. But maybe the Complaint is still unvisited, so they should read the Complaint to check. However, the Docket might have more info.\n\nWait, the Docket entries they read include \"COMPLAINT against State of Idaho, filed by The United States.\" That's individual. But maybe in the Complaint document itself, it's structured as a class action. But the search in Complaint for \"class action\" returned 0 matches, so maybe it's not there. But maybe the Complaint is the actual document that specifies the class action status, so they need to read it.\n\nWait, the user's step 2 was `search_document_regex` on Complaint with pattern \"class action\" and found 0 matches. So maybe the Complaint doesn't have \"class action\" in it, but the Docket entry says \"filed by The United States\" which is individual. But maybe the Complaint itself is a class action. Wait, the complaint is filed by \"The United States\", which is a single plaintiff, so it's individual. But perhaps the complaint mentions a class, but the search didn't find it.\n\nBut the user has to extract all distinct values. So the current value is Individual. To confirm, they need to check if there's any other mention. The Docket's remaining tokens (10000-18215) might have more entries. For example, maybe later entries mention class action.\n\nWait, the Docket entries they read up to token 10000 include entries up to number 93. The Docket has 93 entries, but the text shows up to entry 93. Wait, the provided text in Step 3 shows Docket entries from 1 to 93, but the tokens read were 0-10000. The Docket document is 18,215 tokens, so maybe the rest of the entries (after 93) are in the unviewed tokens. But the user's read_document was from 0-10000, and the example shows up to entry 93, which is probably within the 10k tokens. So maybe the Docket is fully covered in the 10k tokens. Wait, the Docket entry 93 is the last one in the provided text, so maybe the 10k tokens cover all entries.\n\nBut the Docket shows \"filed by The United States\" in entry 1, which is individual. The rest of the entries are about motions, appearances, etc., but not about the plaintiffs' status. So maybe there's only one value: individual.\n\nWait, but the checklist says \"extract EVERY distinct value\". If there's only one value, then they're done. But the user needs to make sure they didn't miss any other documents.\n\nThe available documents include Complaint (unvisited), Orders (unvisited), etc. The Complaint was searched for \"class action\" with 0 matches, but maybe the Complaint states it's a class action. However, the search didn't find it, so perhaps it's not there. But the user should read the Complaint to confirm.\n\nWait, the previous step used `search_document_regex` on Complaint with pattern \"class action\" and found 0 matches. So the Complaint doesn't have \"class action\" in it. But maybe the Complaint's text says \"Class Action\" without the word \"class\" or \"action\" as separate words. But the regex search was for \"class action\", so maybe it's a different phrasing.\n\nBut the user's next action should be to read the Complaint to check. However, the Docket already says it's individual. The Complaint is the document filed by the plaintiff, so if the Complaint is filed as a class action, it would say so. But the Docket entry says \"filed by The United States\", which is a single entity, so likely individual.\n\nBut to be thorough, they should check the Complaint document. The Complaint is unvisited, so the next step could be to read the Complaint. But the user has to choose one action.\n\nWait, the checklist has only one key: Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs. They have one value. The status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. But they need to confirm if there are more values.\n\nWait, the current extracted value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as The United States\". Is there any other value? For example, maybe the Complaint says \"Class Action\" but the search didn't find it. So reading the Complaint would be necessary.\n\nBut the user's step 2 was a search on Complaint for \"class action\" with 0 matches. So maybe the Complaint doesn't mention it, but the user should read it to confirm. However, the Docket already states it's individual, so the Complaint might be consistent. But to be safe, they should read the Complaint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Orders mention it. For example, the Memorandum Decision and Order might state the class action status. But the Orders are unvisited.\n\nWait, the user's goal is to extract all distinct values. If the Docket says it's individual, and no other document mentions class action, then there's only one value. But they need to make sure they've checked all documents.\n\nThe available documents are 10, but the Docket is partially visited. The Docket's unvisited tokens might not have the info, but the Complaint is unvisited. So the next logical step is to read the Complaint, since it's the document that would likely state the class action status.\n\nBut the user's previous search on Complaint for \"class action\" found 0, but maybe the actual text says \"class action\" in a different way. So reading the entire Complaint might help.\n\nWait, but the user's process says: never reread fully visited documents. Complaint is unvisited, so they should read it. The maximum token read is 10k, and Complaint is 8,578 tokens, so reading the whole thing is possible.\n\nSo the next action should be `read_document` on Complaint, tokens 0-8578.\n\nBut wait, the user's step 4 already appended the value from the Docket. The current status shows all keys filled. But maybe they need to check if the Complaint has a different value. However, the Docket entry 1 says \"filed by The United States\", which is individual. If the Complaint is filed by The United States as a single plaintiff, it's individual. So the value should be individual, and the Complaint might confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Complaint is a class action, but the Docket entry refers to the plaintiff as \"The United States\" (which is correct for a federal lawsuit, as the U.S. is the plaintiff), but the complaint might still be a class action. Wait, but the U.S. as a plaintiff in a federal case is typically not a class action; class actions are usually by individuals. Wait, but the U.S. can file a class action if it's representing a class, but in this case, the Docket says \"filed by The United States\", so it's likely a direct action, not a class action.\n\nBut the user needs to confirm. Since the Complaint is unvisited, the next step is to read it. So the correct action is to call `read_document` on Complaint, tokens 0-8578.\n\nWait, but the user's current step is to decide the next action. The available documents show Complaint as unvisited. So the next action should be to read the Complaint.\n\nBut the user has to choose one action. So the answer should be a `read_document` call for Complaint, start 0, end 8578.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 8578}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 8578}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 13894, "completion_tokens": 2078, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nLooking at the current status: they've already extracted one value from the Docket entry (entry 1), which says \"COMPLAINT against State of Idaho, filed by The United States.\" So they have \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as The United States\".\n\nBut wait, the complaint document (which they read in Step 5) also has the plaintiff as \"United States of America\". The complaint starts with \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff\". So maybe they need to check if the complaint confirms the individual plaintiff status.\n\nThe user has already read the complaint (tokens 0-8578), and the complaint clearly states the plaintiff is \"United States of America\". The Docket entry 1 also says \"COMPLAINT against State of Idaho, filed by The United States.\" So the extracted value from the Docket is correct. But do they need to add another evidence entry from the complaint?\n\nWait, the checklist requires every distinct value. The value \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as The United States\" is already extracted. The complaint doesn't add a new value; it's the same as what's in the Docket. So maybe they don't need to add another entry.\n\nBut wait, the complaint's plaintiff is \"United States of America\", and the Docket says \"The United States\". Are these considered the same? Yes, because \"United States\" refers to the U.S. government, which is a single plaintiff. So the value is the same.\n\nLooking at the available documents: Complaint is fully visited (100% covered). Docket is partially visited (55% covered). The other documents (Order/Opinion, etc.) are unvisited. But the checklist item is about the plaintiff's status, which is likely in the Complaint or Docket.\n\nThe Docket entry 1 already provided the necessary info. The complaint confirms it, but since the value is the same, appending another evidence entry from the complaint would be redundant. The system says to extract every distinct value, not every occurrence. So one value is sufficient.\n\nWait, the user's Step 4 already appended one value from the Docket. Now, after reading the Complaint, they might want to confirm it's the same value. But since it's the same, they shouldn't append another entry. Instead, maybe they should check if there's any other document that might indicate a class action.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\". The current extraction is \"Individual, described as The United States\". Is there any indication of a class action here? The complaint is filed by the U.S. as a single plaintiff, not as a class. The Docket entries don't mention any class action. The Complaint is a single plaintiff action.\n\nSo the value is already correctly extracted. The user has one value, and all documents have been checked for this item. The complaint confirms it, but it's the same value. So no new value to add.\n\nThe next step would be to check if there are any other documents that might have a different value. But the other documents (like the Orders) are about motions, not the plaintiff status. The complaint and docket are the primary places for plaintiff info.\n\nSince the complaint is fully visited and the Docket is partially visited (but they've already read the relevant part in Docket entry 1), and no other document is likely to have a different value, the checklist item is complete.\n\nWait, the current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. The user should check if they need to stop. But the system says to use get_checklist to verify before stopping. However, the user's last action was reading the Complaint, and the Complaint didn't add a new value. So they should probably stop now.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either complete or Not Applicable.\" Here, it's complete with one value. So the next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't used get_checklist to verify. However, the process says: \"Before stopping, verify state with get_checklist (in a prior turn if needed) and, if consolidation is required, issue one final update_checklist...\" But in this case, the value is already correctly appended, so no need for update_checklist.\n\nThe current extracted value is correct. So the next action should be to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are complete with verified evidence.

The user is asking to extract the class action status from legal documents.

The \"Class Action\" search in step 2 found nothing, so it's unlikely other documents will have different plaintiff info.\n\nThe checklist item is about whether plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual. The complaint clearly states \"The United States of America\" as plaintiff (not a class), and the Docket Entry 1 confirms \"filed by The United States.\" The description \"Individual, described as The United States\" is correct because the U.S. is a single plaintiff entity here, not a class.\n\nNo other documents need to be read because:\n- The complaint (fully read) and docket (partially read but covered the relevant entry) both confirm the plaintiff is the U.S. as an individual plaintiff (not a class action).\n- The regex search for \"class action\" found nothing, so no class action is mentioned.\n- Other documents (orders, opinions) are unlikely to change the plaintiff status.\n\nSince all evidence is already gathered and the checklist item is fully filled with one value (and no more values exist), the correct action is to stop.\n\nThe system says \"stop attempt 1/2\" but since the checklist is complete, stopping now is valid. The second stop would be the final one, but since the system allows it, I should proceed to stop.\n\nSo the next action is to return the stop JSON with the reason that the checklist item is fully extracted with verified evidence from Docket Entry 1 and the Complaint.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items completed: Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs confirmed as 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as The United States' from Docket Entry 1 (token 0-10000) and Complaint (page 1, tokens 0-8578).
