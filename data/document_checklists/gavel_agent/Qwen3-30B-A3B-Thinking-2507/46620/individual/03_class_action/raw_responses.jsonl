The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog isn't known. So the correct action here is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents. There's no point in trying to read or search documents when there are none to read. The next step must be to list the documents first.

The user needs to extract the class action status from the documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which requires determining if plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which document is most likely to contain this information. The complaint is usually where the plaintiff's claims are first stated, so the \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" (Complaint) is a prime candidate. The Docket might have some info, but the Complaint is more likely to have the detailed status.\n\nLooking at the available documents, all are unvisited (marked with ○ Unvisited). The Complaint is 3,313 tokens, which is under the 10,000 token limit for a read_document call. Since the catalog is known (9 documents), and the Complaint is the most relevant, I should read the entire document to check for the class action status.\n\nWait, but the user said to read a targeted window. However, since it's unvisited, I should read the whole document. The maximum allowed is 10,000 tokens, and the Complaint is 3,313 tokens, so reading the whole thing is safe. There's no need for a regex search here because the document is small and the info is likely in the main body.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for the Complaint, starting at token 0 to end (3,313 tokens). That way, I can extract any mentions of class action or individual plaintiffs from the complaint.\n\nI shouldn't use search_document_regex because the pattern isn't clear yet. The complaint is the best bet, so reading it directly makes sense. After reading, I'll check the text for the required info and then use append_checklist if found.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 3313}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 3313}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3462, "completion_tokens": 434, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" checklist item from the legal documents. The task is to find every distinct value related to whether the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the recent actions. They've already read the \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" (tokens 0-3313) and the document is marked as fully visited. The complaint text shows the plaintiffs are Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr., all named individually as CPSC Commissioners. The complaint doesn't mention a class action; instead, it lists them as individual plaintiffs. The key phrase here is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The description would be the names and their roles.\n\nSo, in the complaint, the plaintiffs are explicitly named as individuals. The complaint states they're \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr.\" as plaintiffs. The case is not a class action because they're named individually. The checklist item requires formatting like \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The description here would be the list of names and their positions.\n\nLooking at the document's content, the complaint's first page lists the plaintiffs as individuals. There's no mention of a class action. So the extracted value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr., CPSC Commissioners\".\n\nI need to make sure this is the only value. The other documents are unvisited, but since the complaint already provides the necessary info, there's no need to read more documents for this item. The checklist item is now filled based on the complaint. The next step is to append this to the checklist with proper evidence.\n\nThe evidence must include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text snippet would be from the complaint's first page where the plaintiffs are listed. The location is the first page of the complaint. The source document is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\".\n\nSo the action should be append_checklist with the extracted value and evidence. The value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr., CPSC Commissioners\". The evidence text is the line where the plaintiffs are listed. The location is \"Page 1 of 7\" as per the document's header.\n\nWait, the user's example in the requirements says \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The description here needs to be the specific details. The document lists them as \"Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr.\" so the description is those names. The roles are mentioned in the complaint (e.g., \"Plaintiff Mary Boyle is a member of the CPSC...\"), but the key point is they're individual plaintiffs, not a class.\n\nTherefore, the extracted value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr.\" The evidence is the list of plaintiffs on page 1.\n\nI should check if there's any mention of class action elsewhere in the document. Scanning through, the complaint's title is \"COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\" and it's filed by the three individuals. There's no mention of a class, so it's individual. The other documents might have more info, but since the complaint already specifies, and the task is to extract all distinct values, this is the only value needed.\n\nSo the correct action is to append the checklist entry using append_checklist with the value and evidence.

The user is working on a legal checklist extraction task, specifically for the \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" item. From the recent actions, they've already read the Complaint document and extracted one value: Plaintiffs are individuals named Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr.\n\nNow, the current status shows that all keys (just this one) are filled with one value. The available documents include others like the Docket, Memorandum Opinion, and various motions. But the checklist item is about whether the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individuals. The Complaint clearly states they're individual plaintiffs, so the extracted value seems correct.\n\nWait, but the user needs to check if there are other documents that might mention class action status. The Complaint is the first document, and it's fully visited. The other documents might have more info, but the checklist item only requires extracting the status. Since the Complaint already confirms they're individual plaintiffs, and there's no mention of a class action in that document, maybe no other documents need to be checked. However, the system's process says to check all documents unless it's clear.\n\nBut the checklist definition says to extract every distinct value. The extracted value here is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [names]\". The Complaint has that. Now, I should verify if any other document might contradict or add to this. For example, maybe a motion or order refers to it as a class action. But the current status shows only one value, and the key is filled. The user's next step should be to check if there are more values or if it's complete.\n\nWait, the available documents are all unvisited except the Complaint. The Docket might have a summary. Let me think: the Docket is a document that lists case events. It might have the case type. But the user's task is to extract the class action status from the documents. Since the Complaint already states they're individual plaintiffs, and the Docket might just list the case as \"Individual\" or similar, but the user needs evidence from the document.\n\nBut according to the rules, if a document is unvisited, they should read it to check. However, the checklist item is already filled. The system says to stop when all keys are filled or Not Applicable. Here, the key is filled with one value. But maybe they need to confirm there's no class action mentioned elsewhere. However, the Complaint is the initial filing, which typically states the nature of the action. If the Complaint says individual, it's unlikely to be a class action unless amended later.\n\nLooking at the documents, the \"Application to Stay\" and other motions might reference the case type. But the checklist item is about the plaintiffs' designation, which is probably established in the Complaint. The user's previous step already appended the value from the Complaint. The next action should be to check if there are other values. But since the Complaint says \"Individual Plaintiffs\", and no other document has been read, maybe they should check the Docket or other documents to see if there's a class action mentioned.\n\nWait, the current status shows \"Keys with Values\": 1/1, so the key is filled. The user should use get_checklist to confirm all values are extracted. But the instructions say after each append, verify. Since they already appended, the next step might be to check if any other document has a different value. However, the checklist item is for the status, and it's already extracted. The system's Stop Criteria says to stop when all keys are complete. So maybe they can stop now.\n\nBut the system requires that if the key is filled, they can stop. The user has one value, and it's from the Complaint. The other documents might not have more info. To be thorough, they should check if any other document mentions the plaintiffs' status. But the Docket might have a case type. Let me see the available documents: Docket is unvisited. Maybe the Docket entry says \"Individual Action\" or similar. But the user needs to read it to confirm.\n\nWait, the Decision Policy says: \"When you have confirmed text for one or more keys: Use append_checklist or update_checklist.\" They already did append_checklist. Now, they should check if there's more to extract. But since the Complaint is the main document and it's fully visited, and the other documents are unvisited, maybe they should read the Docket first to see if it has any mention of class action.\n\nBut the Docket is a summary document. Let's say the Docket lists the case as \"Individual Plaintiffs\" again, but that's redundant. The user needs distinct values. If all documents say the same, then only one value. But to be safe, they should check if any document contradicts or adds. However, the task is to extract every distinct value found. If all documents say individual, then one value.\n\nThe user's current step is to choose the next action. Since the key is filled, but they haven't checked all documents, they might need to read the Docket. But the system says not to reread visited documents, and the Docket is unvisited. So the next logical step is to read the Docket document (Docket) to see if it has any additional info on the class action status.\n\nWait, but the checklist item is already extracted. The system's Stop Criteria says to stop when all keys are complete. If the key is already filled, and the user has evidence from the Complaint, they can stop. However, the process requires that all applicable documents are checked. The user hasn't checked the Docket, so they should read it to confirm there's no class action mentioned.\n\nBut the user's recent action was appending the value from the Complaint. Now, they need to check if other documents have the same or different info. So the next action should be to read the Docket document (tokens 0-4374, but since it's unvisited, start from 0). Wait, but the Docket is 4,374 tokens. The read_document can handle up to 10k tokens, so reading the whole Docket is okay.\n\nWait, but the system's Document Reading Efficiency says not to reread fully visited docs. The Docket is unvisited, so they should read it. So the next action is to call read_document on the Docket document.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for \"class action\" or \"class\" in all documents. But the user should first check the Docket, as it's a likely place for case type.\n\nWait, the Checklist is about the plaintiffs' status. The Complaint already states it's individual. The Docket might have a case type. For example, in the Docket, it might say \"Civil Action - Individual\" or something. But the user needs to check.\n\nSo the correct next step is to read the Docket document to see if it contains any information about the class action status. If it does, they might need to append another value, but since it's likely the same, it might not add a new value. However, the task requires extracting all values from any document, so they need to check.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be read_document on \"Docket\" from 0-4374 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4374}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4374}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7215, "completion_tokens": 1568, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", and the requirement is to have values formatted as \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nFrom the recent actions, Step 3 already appended a value from the Complaint document. The value extracted was \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr.\" with evidence from the complaint's first page where the plaintiffs are listed.\n\nNow, looking at the current status, the Docket document was read in Step 4. The Docket lists the plaintiffs as \"Mary Boyle, Richard Trumka, Jr, Alexander Hoehn-Saric\" in the filings. But the previous extraction already used the Complaint's plaintiff list, which matches the Docket's listing. However, the Docket doesn't add new information about the class action status—it just lists the plaintiffs' names. The key point here is whether the case is a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nThe Complaint's title is \"COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\", and the plaintiffs are listed as individuals (three people), not as a class. The case is brought by three individuals, each as a Commissioner, not as a class. So the correct value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr.\" which was already extracted.\n\nThe Docket's entries (like \"filed by Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, Richard Trumka, Jr.\") confirm the same plaintiffs but don't change the nature of the case. So no new value is added from the Docket.\n\nNow, checking the remaining documents: the other documents (Memorandum Opinion, Order, etc.) are unvisited. But the key is whether any of these might indicate a class action. However, the case is about three individuals, not a class. The Complaint explicitly names them as individuals, and the Docket entries refer to them as individuals. There's no mention of a class action in the documents read so far.\n\nThe checklist requires \"every distinct value\" found. Since the case is individual plaintiffs, and the value was already extracted, there's no need to append more. The current status shows 1 value extracted, which is correct.\n\nWait, but the user's task says \"Extract EVERY distinct value\". Since the case is individual, there's only one value. The other documents might not have conflicting info. Let me check the other documents briefly.\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) is unvisited. But the case is about three individuals, so the opinion likely refers to them as individuals. The Docket shows the case was granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs as individuals. The Order (step 25) says \"granting 18 Motion for Summary Judgment\" for the plaintiffs, who are the three individuals. So no class action here.\n\nThe remaining documents like \"Opposition to Application to Stay...\" are briefs filed by the defendants, which would refer to the plaintiffs as individuals. So no new values to extract.\n\nTherefore, all applicable values for the checklist item have been extracted. The current extracted value is correct, and there's no need for more. The status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. There's no need to set Not Applicable because the item is applicable (it's individual plaintiffs, not class).\n\nSo the next action should be to stop, as all checklist items are fully extracted with proper evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All applicable values for Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs have been extracted from the Complaint (verified in Docket as consistent).
