The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call list_documents. The Snapshot mentions that the Document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. So, the correct action is to use list_documents to get the list of documents. That's the first step before I can read any documents or search them. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't available yet. So, the next action must be list_documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3091, "completion_tokens": 174, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs the filing date extracted from the legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nFirst, I should check which documents are most likely to contain the filing date. The Complaint is usually where the filing date is mentioned, as it's the initial document. The Docket might also have it since dockets list court events. The other documents like motions and orders might not have the original filing date.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is the primary document. It's marked as unvisited, so I should read it first. The Docket is next, but since the Complaint is the first filing, that's the best place to start.\n\nThe user has 9 documents, all unvisited. The Complaint has 3,313 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing with one read_document call. No need for regex search here because the filing date is likely in the header or beginning of the Complaint.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the Complaint document. I'll use read_document with the doc_name as \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" and start_token 0, end_token 3313. That covers the whole document. After reading, I'll look for the date in the text and then append it to the checklist with evidence.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 3313}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 3313}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3412, "completion_tokens": 352, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user provided the snapshot, and the current status shows that the Filing_Date key is empty.\n\nFirst, I need to check the documents. The recent action was reading the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, which is marked as fully visited (✓ Fully Visited) with tokens 0-3313. The text from that document has \"Filed 05/21/25\" on the first page. So the filing date should be May 21, 2025.\n\nWait, the document says \"Filed 05/21/25\" which is a common date format. The user needs the calendar date, so that's May 21, 2025. But the example shows \"05/21/25\", which is May 21, 2025. So the value should be \"05/21/25\" or maybe formatted as \"2025-05-21\"? But the requirement says to extract the exact value as found. The document uses \"05/21/25\", so I should use that.\n\nNow, the checklist item Filing_Date needs to have this value with evidence. The evidence must include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text from the document has \"Filed 05/21/25\" on the first page. So the evidence would be the line \"Filed 05/21/25\" from the document, source is \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location is \"Page 1\" or \"tokens 0-3313\" but since it's the first page, maybe \"Page 1\".\n\nThe current status shows 0 values extracted, so I need to append this to the checklist. The next step after reading the document is to use append_checklist. Since the document is fully visited, I shouldn't read it again. The other documents are unvisited, but the filing date is already found in the Complaint. So I don't need to read other documents for this item.\n\nWait, the user said to extract every distinct value. Is there a possibility of multiple filing dates? The Complaint is the first document, so likely the filing date is there. The other documents like Docket might have it too, but since the Complaint already has it, and it's the initial filing, that's the one to use. The Docket might list the same date, but the requirement is to extract every distinct value. If it's the same date, it's not distinct, so only one entry is needed.\n\nSo the correct action is to append the Filing_Date with the value \"05/21/25\" and the evidence from the Complaint. The evidence should have the text \"Filed 05/21/25\", source document \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", location \"Page 1\".\n\nCheck the tools: append_checklist is the right function here. The parameters need a patch with key \"Filing_Date\" and extracted as an array of entries. Each entry has evidence (array of evidence items) and value.\n\nSo the JSON for append_checklist would have patch: [{\"key\": \"Filing_Date\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"05/21/25\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Filed 05/21/25\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 1\"}]}]}]\n\nWait, the location should be specific. The document shows \"Filed 05/21/25\" on the first page, so location is \"Page 1\". The tokens are 0-3313, but the location in the evidence is usually page or section, so \"Page 1\" is acceptable.\n\nMake sure not to use update_checklist here because it's appending, not replacing. Since it's the first entry, append is correct.\n\nNo other documents need to be read for this item. The next step is to append the found value.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Filing_Date\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"05/21/25\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Filed 05/21/25\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"location\": \"Page 1\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "05/21/25", "evidence": [{"text": "Filed 05/21/25", "source_document": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "location": "Page 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7003, "completion_tokens": 988, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The user has already done Steps 1-3. Step 1 was list_documents, which found 9 documents. Step 2 was reading the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief from tokens 0-3313, and they found the filing date \"05/21/25\" on page 1. Step 3 was append_checklist, which added that value.\n\nNow, looking at the current status: the Filing_Date key has 1 value, and all other keys (but there's only one key here) are filled. The available documents show that the Complaint is fully visited (✓), but the other 8 documents are unvisited (○). However, the checklist item is Filing_Date, which is typically the date the initial complaint was filed. The Complaint document already has the filing date in the header (\"Filed 05/21/25\"), so it's likely that this is the only filing date needed. But wait, sometimes there might be other documents that mention the filing date again, but for the Filing_Date checklist item, it's supposed to be the date the lawsuit was first filed, which should be the date on the complaint.\n\nThe user's recent actions show that they've already extracted the filing date from the Complaint, which is the standard place to find it. The other documents listed (Docket, Memorandum Opinion, etc.) are probably subsequent filings or orders, not the initial filing. For example, the Docket might list the filing date, but if the Complaint already has it, and the Docket is just a summary, it might not have a different date. However, the instructions say to extract every distinct value, so maybe the Docket also lists the filing date. But the user's current status says that the Filing_Date key has 1 value, and the total values extracted are 1. The task is to extract every distinct value, but if the Complaint has the correct date, and the Docket might just reiterate it, then it's the same value, so it wouldn't count as a distinct value.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So if the Docket also says \"Filed 05/21/25\", it's the same value, so we don't need to add it again. The key is to have unique values. So if the Complaint already has it, and the Docket also has the same date, then it's redundant. But if the Docket has a different date, that would be a problem, but in legal documents, the filing date on the complaint is the official one.\n\nThe user's current state shows that the Complaint is fully visited, and the other documents are unvisited. But since the Filing_Date is already extracted from the Complaint, and the other documents are likely not the initial filing, there's no need to read them. The next step should be to check if all keys are filled. The current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", so all keys are filled. Therefore, the next action should be to stop.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The checklist item is Filing_Date, and the user has one value from the Complaint. The system's Stop Criteria says to stop when all keys are either complete or Not Applicable. Here, the key is complete with one value. The other documents might have the same date, but since it's the same value, it's not a new entry. So no need to read more documents. Therefore, the correct action is to stop.\n\nThe user's previous steps show that they appended the value, and the status shows all keys are filled. So the next action should be to stop with a reason that the Filing_Date is already extracted from the Complaint.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"Filing_Date fully extracted from Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (05/21/25).

The user is asking to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The checklist only has one item: Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 3 already appended Filing_Date with \"05/21/25\" from the Complaint document (tokens 0-3313). Step 4 tried to stop, but the system automatically did a get_checklist and now says it's stop attempt 1/2.\n\nThe current status shows:\n- All keys are filled (1/1)\n- Filing_Date has 1 value\n- Documents: Complaint is fully visited (✓), others are unvisited (○)\n\nWait, but the checklist definition says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So I need to check if there are other documents that might have the filing date. The Complaint document already gave \"05/21/25\" in the header (Filed 05/21/25). But maybe other documents like the Docket or Orders also have the filing date?\n\nHowever, the system's automatic review says \"No additional distinct values found in unvisited documents required per checklist definition.\" So does that mean the filing date is only in the Complaint? The Complaint's header clearly states \"Filed 05/21/25\", which is the filing date. Other documents might reference it but the actual filing date is in the Complaint.\n\nThe user's checklist only wants the date the lawsuit was filed, which is in the Complaint's first page. The other documents (Docket, Orders, etc.) are subsequent filings, so their dates would be different (like filing dates of motions), but the checklist specifies \"first filed/initiated with the court,\" so only the Complaint's date matters.\n\nThe system's current status shows Filing_Date is filled with one value. The other documents aren't needed because the filing date is only in the Complaint. The system's automatic review confirmed it's complete.\n\nSo the next action should be to stop. The system says \"stop attempt 1/2\" but since it's the second stop (after the automatic get_checklist), it should accept it. The reason is that the only filing date is in the Complaint, and it's already extracted with evidence. No other documents need to be checked for this specific item.\n\nDouble-checking: The Complaint's header says \"Filed 05/21/25\" on page 1. That's the filing date. The other documents are about motions and orders, so their dates aren't the initial filing date.
