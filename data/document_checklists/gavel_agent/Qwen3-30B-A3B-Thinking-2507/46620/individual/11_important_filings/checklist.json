Feldman from taking any action to effectuate President Donald J. Trump\u2019s purported termination of Plaintiffs from their roles as Commissioners of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), including by barring Plaintiffs\u2019 access to the agency resources (including, but not limited to, Plaintiffs\u2019 office spaces, CPSC telephone and computer equipment, CPSC email accounts, and physical and electronic files) to which Plaintiffs had access prior to May 8, 2025; giving effect to the purported termination of Plaintiffs\u2019 staff members; or withholding from Plaintiffs and their staff members the pay and benefits that they were entitled to receive in connection with their roles at the CPSC prior to May 8, 2025. As set forth in greater detail in the accompanying memorandum of law, President Trump\u2019s termination of Plaintiffs was ultra vires and contrary to the Consumer Product Safety Act, and Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief."
