Since there are no documents in the corpus, the catalog is unknown. The next logical step is to list the documents to find out what's available. I shouldn't try to read or search without knowing the documents first. So the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of available documents.

The user needs to extract the settlement date from legal documents. The checklist item is Date_of_Settlement, and it's currently empty.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which documents are most likely to contain the settlement date. The checklist says to look for dates related to settlement, like execution, court approval, amendments, etc. But since the settlement might not be incorporated into a judgment, I should check documents that are about settlements or agreements.\n\nLooking at the available documents: there's a Complaint, Docket, Memorandum Opinion, Order, and several motions. The \"Application to Stay the Judgment\" and \"Opposition\" documents might mention settlement dates, especially if they're related to a settlement agreement. The \"Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" is long (46k tokens), so maybe it's relevant.\n\nBut the user mentioned \"settlement date,\" so maybe the Order or Memorandum Opinion would have court-approved dates. The Docket might list dates of events. However, the Docket is often a summary of case events, so it might have the settlement date listed there.\n\nWait, the checklist says to avoid dates once the settlement is incorporated into a judgment. So if there's an Order that includes the settlement, the date in the Order would be excluded. But if the settlement was approved but not entered as an order, that date should be included.\n\nHmm. The documents listed include \"Order\" and \"Memorandum Opinion.\" The Memorandum Opinion might explain the court's reasoning and mention approval dates. The Docket might have a line item for settlement approval.\n\nSince the Docket is a standard document that lists case events with dates, it's a good candidate. The Docket has 4,374 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing with read_document.\n\nWait, but the user said to use search_document_regex if the target is patternable. Settlement dates might be in a specific format, like MM/DD/YYYY. But maybe the Docket has a section where dates are listed. Alternatively, searching for \"settlement\" or \"settle\" might help.\n\nBut the instruction says to use search_document_regex when the target is clearly patternable. Dates are patterns, but the exact date format might vary. However, the Docket is a good place to check first because it's a chronological log.\n\nWait, the current status shows all documents are unvisited. So I need to pick a document to read. The Docket (4,374 tokens) is the smallest, so reading it first makes sense. Let's call read_document on the Docket.\n\nBut the Docket name is \"Docket\" as per the catalog. So the doc_name should be \"Docket\". Since it's unvisited, I'll read the entire document (start_token 0, end_token 4374) to check for settlement dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe search for \"settlement\" in the Docket. But since the Docket is small, reading it directly is efficient. Let's go with read_document on Docket.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Docket\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 4374}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Docket", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 4374}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3512, "completion_tokens": 679, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the settlement date from the legal documents. The checklist item is Date_of_Settlement, and they need all distinct values with evidence.\n\nLooking at the current status, there are 9 documents, but only the Docket has been fully read (tokens 0-4374). The other documents are unvisited. The Docket's content was provided, and I need to check if there's any settlement date mentioned there.\n\nIn the Docket entries, I see dates like 2025-05-21, 2025-05-22, etc., but those are filing dates or hearing dates. The checklist specifies that settlement dates include execution/signing dates, court approval dates, amendment dates, etc., but not dates when the settlement is incorporated into a judgment. \n\nLooking through the Docket, the last entry is entry 40 on 2025-07-07, which is an Order granting a motion to seal. There's no mention of a settlement agreement, execution date, or court approval of a settlement. The case seems to be about a motion for summary judgment, which was granted (entry 25), but that's a court order, not a settlement. The defendants appealed (entry 26), and there's a denial of a stay (entry 39). \n\nWait, the checklist says \"Do not include any date once the settlement (in whole or in part) is incorporated into a judgment or order.\" So if the court's order is the settlement, then those dates wouldn't count. But in this case, the court denied the motion for a TRO and granted summary judgment (entry 25), which is a judgment, not a settlement. The case is still ongoing with an appeal. There's no mention of a settlement anywhere in the Docket.\n\nSince the Docket is fully visited and there's no settlement date found, the next step would be to check other documents. The available documents include Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, Orders, and various motions. The Complaint might not have a settlement date, but maybe the Memorandum Opinion or other orders mention a settlement. However, the user's task is to extract the settlement date, and if it's not present in the Docket, we need to check other documents.\n\nThe current checklist item is empty, so we need to look for the Date_of_Settlement in other documents. The next logical step is to read another document. The Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) is 19k tokens, which is large, but maybe it's the most likely place to find a settlement date. Alternatively, maybe the \"Application to Stay\" or other motions mention a settlement.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"settlement date,\" but the case seems to be a motion for summary judgment, not a settlement. Maybe there's no settlement, so the item should be marked as Not Applicable. But according to the Not Applicable encoding, we need explicit evidence. The checklist says: \"Do not include any date once the settlement (in whole or in part) is incorporated into a judgment or order.\" But if there's no settlement at all, then it's Not Applicable.\n\nBut the problem is, we need to confirm that there's no settlement. The Docket doesn't mention it, but maybe another document does. So, to be thorough, we should check the other documents. The next step is to choose a document to read. The Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) is a good candidate because it's a court opinion, which might discuss settlements. But given the size (19k tokens), maybe it's better to use search_document_regex to look for \"settlement\" or \"settle\" to find relevant sections.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say that if a specific document is likely to contain the target, use read_document or search_document_regex. Since we're looking for a settlement date, a regex search for \"settlement\" might be efficient. The pattern could be \"settlement\" or \"settle\" to find mentions, then read the context.\n\nBut the current state shows that the Docket was fully read with no settlement dates. The next step should be to search other documents for settlement-related terms. So, using search_document_regex with pattern \"settlement\" to find any mentions. The parameters would be doc_name='all' to search all unvisited documents, or maybe target specific ones like the Memorandum Opinion or the Pleading documents.\n\nWait, the available documents are listed, and the Docket is already fully visited. The other documents are unvisited. So using search_document_regex with doc_name='all' and pattern \"settlement\" would search all unvisited documents. That's efficient because it can find any mentions without reading the whole document.\n\nLooking at the checklist definition, the Date_of_Settlement includes dates related to settlement. If there's a mention of \"settlement\" in any document, we can then look for dates around that. So the next action should be to perform a regex search for \"settlement\" across all unvisited documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"settlement\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "settlement", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8037, "completion_tokens": 1107, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the settlement date from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Date_of_Settlement\", and they want every distinct value with evidence.\n\nFirst, I checked the recent actions. Step 1 was list_documents, which found 9 documents. Step 2 read the Docket document from tokens 0-4374. Step 3 did a regex search for \"settlement\" across all documents but found 0 matches. Now, the current status shows that all 1 document (Docket) is fully visited, and the other 8 are unvisited.\n\nLooking at the Docket document's content, I scanned through all entries. The Docket lists various filings, motions, orders, but none mention \"settlement\" or related terms. The regex search also found nothing. So, the Docket probably doesn't have the settlement date.\n\nNext, I need to check other documents. The available documents include Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, Orders, and several motions. The key here is that the settlement date might be in one of the unvisited documents. Since the regex search didn't find anything, maybe the term is phrased differently, like \"settlement agreement\" or \"settlement date\" but not exactly \"settlement\". However, the user specified to extract \"Date_of_Settlement\" as per the checklist, so the term might be there.\n\nBut the regex search used \"settlement\" and found nothing. Maybe the actual date is mentioned without the word \"settlement\", but the checklist requires extracting dates related to settlement events. Wait, the checklist says: \"Extract each date as a separate value, formatted as: '[date]: [settlement event].'\" So the date itself is what's needed, but the event should be settlement-related.\n\nLooking at the Docket again, the entries are all about motions, orders, hearings, but no settlement. The most relevant might be the Order on June 13, 2025, which grants summary judgment and denies motions. But that's a court order, not a settlement. The case is about a motion for summary judgment, not a settlement. The Notice of Appeal on June 16, 2025, and subsequent motions for stay, but again, not settlement.\n\nSince the Docket doesn't have it, I should move to another document. The next step is to read a document that's likely to contain settlement information. The most probable candidates are the Complaint, the Memorandum Opinion, or the motions like \"Application to Stay the Judgment\" which might reference a settlement.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Do not include any date once the settlement (in whole or in part) is incorporated into a judgment or order.\" So if there's a settlement incorporated into an order, those dates shouldn't be included. But if the settlement is not yet incorporated, then the dates should be extracted.\n\nLooking at the Order dated June 13, 2025 (entry 25), it says \"granting 18 Motion for Summary Judgment; Denying 21 RESPONSE...\". So the court granted summary judgment, which might mean the case is resolved without a settlement, so maybe there's no settlement date. But the user is asking to extract the settlement date, so if there's no settlement, it should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut before concluding that, I need to check other documents. The other documents might have settlement terms. For example, the \"Application to Stay the Judgment\" might refer to a settlement agreement that's pending. Or the Complaint might mention a settlement.\n\nWait, the Complaint is the initial filing. It's a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, so it's likely the plaintiffs are seeking relief, not that a settlement has been reached. So probably no settlement date there.\n\nThe Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) dated June 13, 2025, might discuss the case, but since the court granted summary judgment, perhaps there's no settlement. The Order says \"Denying as moot 6 Motion for TRO; Denying as moot 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction; granting 18 Motion for Summary Judgment...\" So the case is decided on summary judgment, not settlement. Therefore, there's no settlement, so the Date_of_Settlement should be marked as Not Applicable.\n\nBut I need to confirm this by checking the documents. However, the regex search didn't find \"settlement\" in any document, including the Memorandum Opinion. Wait, the regex search was done on all documents and found 0 matches. So if the word \"settlement\" isn't there, it's unlikely that there's a settlement date to extract.\n\nBut the checklist requires that if the item is not applicable, it should be set to \"Not Applicable\" with evidence. The evidence for Not Applicable would be something like \"the case was resolved via summary judgment, not settlement\" or \"no settlement was reached\".\n\nSo, the next step is to check if the case was settled. Since the court granted summary judgment and the parties appealed, but the appeal was denied (entry 39: \"ORDER of USCA Denying the motion for an administrative stay...\"), there's no indication of a settlement. The case was decided on the merits, not settled.\n\nTherefore, the Date_of_Settlement should be marked as Not Applicable. To do that, I need to use update_checklist with the key \"Date_of_Settlement\" and a single entry where value is \"Not Applicable\", with evidence from the documents.\n\nBut before updating, I need to make sure. Let me check the documents again. The Docket has no mention of settlement. The regex search found nothing. The Order on June 13, 2025, grants summary judgment, which implies no settlement. The appeal was denied, so the case is final without settlement.\n\nSo, the evidence for Not Applicable is the Order granting summary judgment (entry 25), which states the case was decided on summary judgment, not settlement. Therefore, the Date_of_Settlement is Not Applicable.\n\nThe next action should be to update the checklist for Date_of_Settlement with \"Not Applicable\". But wait, the current status says \"Empty Keys: 1/1\", so the key is empty, and we need to set it to Not Applicable.\n\nSo, the correct action is to call update_checklist with the key \"Date_of_Settlement\", extracted list containing one entry with value \"Not Applicable\", and evidence from the Order (entry 25).\n\nWait, but the Order is in the Docket, which is already fully visited. So the evidence can be taken from the Docket's entry 25.\n\nEntry 25: \"ORDER Denying as moot 6 Motion for TRO; Denying as moot 6 Motion for Preliminary Injunction; granting 18 Motion for Summary Judgment; Denying 21 RESPONSE in Opposition re 18 MOTION for Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment; Granting 2 MOTION re 1 Complaint, for Leave to Waive Requirement Under Local Rule 102.2(a) to Provide Addresses in Complaint Caption . Signed by Judge Matthew J. Maddox on 6/13/2025.\"\n\nThis order grants summary judgment, so the case is decided on the merits, not through a settlement. Therefore, there's no settlement date to extract. The evidence is the court's order granting summary judgment.\n\nSo, the evidence text would be the relevant part of the order, source document is Docket, location is entry 25.\n\nThus, the update_checklist should have:\n\nkey: \"Date_of_Settlement\"\n\nextracted: [ { value: \"Not Applicable\", evidence: [ { text: \"granting 18 Motion for Summary Judgment\", source_document: \"Docket\", location: \"Entry 25\" } ] } ]\n\nWait, the evidence needs to be verbatim text from the document. The exact text from entry 25 is \"granting 18 Motion for Summary Judgment\", which indicates the case was resolved by summary judgment, not settlement.\n\nSo, the evidence entry should have that text, source document \"Docket\", location \"Entry 25\".\n\nTherefore, the correct tool to use is update_checklist with that patch.\n\nBut the user's current status shows that the Docket is fully visited, so we can use it as evidence.\n\nSo the next action is to call update_checklist with the key Date_of_Settlement set to Not Applicable with that evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"update_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Date_of_Settlement\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Not Applicable\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"granting 18 Motion for Summary Judgment\", \"source_document\": \"Docket\", \"location\": \"Entry 25\"}]}]}]}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Date_of_Settlement", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "granting 18 Motion for Summary Judgment", "source_document": "Docket", "location": "Entry 25"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8067, "completion_tokens": 1866, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the settlement date from legal documents. The checklist item is Date_of_Settlement, and the requirements say to extract all distinct dates related to settlement, like execution dates, court approvals, etc., but not when it's incorporated into a judgment.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already marked Date_of_Settlement as Not Applicable based on the Docket entry 25, which says \"granting 18 Motion for Summary Judgment.\" But wait, the instructions say not to include dates when the settlement is incorporated into a judgment. So if the motion for summary judgment is granted, that's not a settlement date. The user's previous step (Step 4) set it to Not Applicable because they didn't find any settlement dates. But maybe they missed something.\n\nThe recent actions show that Step 3 used a regex search for \"settlement\" across all documents and found 0 matches. Then Step 4 updated the checklist to Not Applicable. But the available documents include several unvisited ones like the Complaint, Memorandum Opinion, and various motions. The Docket was fully visited, but other documents might have settlement info.\n\nWait, the checklist says to extract dates where settlement is mentioned, but the regex search didn't find any \"settlement\" in the documents. However, maybe the term isn't used, but the settlement is referred to in other ways. For example, maybe the documents mention a settlement agreement or terms without using the word \"settlement.\" But the regex search used \"settlement,\" so if the word isn't there, it won't find it. The user needs to check other documents for possible settlement-related terms.\n\nLooking at the document list, there's a document called \"Application to Stay the Judgment...\" and \"Opposition to Application...\" which might mention a settlement. But the regex search didn't find \"settlement,\" so maybe the word isn't present. However, the user should check if other terms like \"settlement agreement\" or \"stipulation\" are used. But the regex was specifically for \"settlement,\" so maybe the search was too narrow.\n\nWait, the user's current step is Step 5, and the task is to extract the settlement date. The current status says Date_of_Settlement is marked as Not Applicable. But maybe they need to check the other documents because the Docket was fully visited, but other documents might have the info.\n\nThe available documents include \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief,\" \"Memorandum Opinion,\" and several motions. The Memorandum Opinion (Order/Opinion) is 19k tokens and unvisited. The \"Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" is 46k tokens, which is a lot, but maybe they can read a part of it.\n\nWait, the previous Step 3 was a regex search for \"settlement\" across all 9 documents and found 0 matches. But maybe the regex was too strict. The user could try a different pattern, like \"settlement\" or \"settle\" or \"agreement,\" but the problem says to use the exact terms. However, the instructions say to use regex patterns, so maybe the user should try a more flexible pattern.\n\nBut according to the current state, the regex search returned 0 matches. So the next step should be to check the unvisited documents, especially those that might contain settlement info. The \"Application to Stay...\" and \"Opposition\" documents might have settlement terms. Since the regex didn't find anything, maybe the user should read those documents to see if settlement is mentioned without the exact word \"settlement.\"\n\nWait, the user's current checklist is marked as Not Applicable, but they need to confirm that there's no settlement date. The Not Applicable must be supported by evidence. The current evidence is from Docket entry 25, which says the motion for summary judgment was granted, not a settlement. But maybe there's a settlement elsewhere.\n\nThe user should read some of the unvisited documents to check for settlement-related terms. The largest document is \"Time-Sensitive Motion for Stay Pending Appeal\" (46k tokens), but it's too big to read all at once. They need to read a portion. But the system says not to reread fully visited docs, and the Docket is done. The next step should be to read a document that's unvisited and might contain settlement info.\n\nLooking at the document names, \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" might mention settlement in the body. Similarly, the \"Memorandum Opinion\" might have settlement details. The user should pick one to read. Since the regex didn't find \"settlement,\" maybe they need to check the Complaint first, as it's a common place for settlement terms.\n\nWait, but the user's current status says they've already marked it as Not Applicable. However, the instructions require that Not Applicable is only set when there's explicit evidence that settlement doesn't apply. The current evidence is from the Docket, but maybe other documents have settlement info. So the user should verify by checking other documents.\n\nThe next action should be to read one of the unvisited documents. The smallest unvisited document is \"Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction\" (813 tokens), which is small and might be quick. But maybe the Complaint is better. Wait, the Complaint is 3,313 tokens, which is manageable. Let's see, the user should pick a document that's likely to have settlement terms. Since it's a Complaint, settlement might be mentioned in the claims or requested relief. But the Complaint is for declaratory and injunctive relief, not necessarily settlement.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Application to Stay the Judgment...\" might mention a settlement. Wait, the title is \"Application to Stay the Judgment...\" which suggests they're asking to stay a judgment, not a settlement. But maybe the motion refers to a settlement agreement.\n\nThe safest bet is to read the \"Complaint\" document first, as it's the earliest document and might have settlement terms. The user should use read_document on the Complaint, starting from 0 to 3313 tokens (since it's unvisited). But the document's token count is 3,313, so reading the whole thing is possible since it's under 10k.\n\nWait, the user's policy says not to reread fully visited docs. Docket is done. The Complaint is unvisited, so read it. So the next action should be read_document for \"Complaint\" with start_token 0 and end_token 3313.\n\nBut wait, the system says to choose one action. The current state shows that Date_of_Settlement is marked as Not Applicable, but the user should confirm by checking other documents. So they need to read an unvisited document to ensure there's no settlement date.\n\nTherefore, the correct next action is to call read_document on the Complaint document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 3313}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 3313}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8157, "completion_tokens": 1508, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The regex search already confirmed no settlement mentions, so further document reads would be redundant.\n\nThe Not Applicable entry is properly set via update_checklist with \"Not Applicable\" as the value and evidence from Docket. No other documents are likely to contain settlement dates since the regex search found none. Therefore, the correct action is to stop again, confirming all items are handled.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are properly marked as Not Applicable with verified evidence from Docket Entry 25 (motion for summary judgment granted, no settlement occurred).
