The Available Documents section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to list the documents to find out what's available. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since the corpus has 0 documents, the catalog is unknown. Therefore, the correct action here is to use list_documents to get the list of documents before proceeding. No other actions make sense because there are no documents to read or search yet.

The user needs to extract the Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs from the legal documents. The checklist item requires determining if the plaintiffs are proceeding as a class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nFirst, I should check which documents are most likely to contain this information. The key documents for class action status would probably be the Complaint, the Joint Motion to Dismiss, and maybe the Settlement Agreement. The Complaint usually states the nature of the lawsuit, so that's a good starting point.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Complaint is unvisited and has 2,761 tokens. Since it's the primary document outlining the case, it's the best place to start. The other documents like the Docket might have some info, but the Complaint is more likely to have the explicit statement about class action status.\n\nI need to use read_document on the Complaint. The token count is under 10k, so reading the whole thing is feasible. The next step is to read the entire Complaint to find any mentions of class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nWait, the document is unvisited, so I should read it from start to finish. The parameters for read_document need start_token and end_token. Since it's unvisited, start_token is 0 and end_token is the total tokens, which is 2761. But the maximum range is 10k, so 2761 is fine.\n\nI should call read_document with doc_name \"Complaint\", start_token 0, end_token 2761. That will get the whole document. Then, after reading, I can look for the relevant info. If the Complaint mentions \"class action\" or similar, I'll extract that. If not, maybe check other documents like the Joint Motion to Dismiss, but first things first.\n\nNo need for regex here because the exact term might be in the text, and reading the whole document is efficient. So the next action is read_document on the Complaint.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 2761}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 2761}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3468, "completion_tokens": 448, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the class action status from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which needs to be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nLooking at the recent actions, Step 1 was list_documents, which found 11 documents. Step 2 was read_document on the Complaint (tokens 0-2761). The provided text from the Complaint shows the plaintiff is the United States of America, and the defendant is the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority. The complaint mentions \"Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act\" and \"Americans with Disabilities Act\", but there's no explicit mention of class action versus individual plaintiffs.\n\nWait, the complaint starts with \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff\" and the case is a civil case. The key here is whether it's a class action. In the Complaint, paragraph 1 says \"The United States files this Complaint pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act...\". The CRIPA (Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act) is typically used for class actions because it's about systemic issues in institutions. However, the document doesn't explicitly state \"class action\" or \"individual plaintiffs\".\n\nLooking through the text again, there's no mention of the plaintiffs being a class. The plaintiff is the United States, which is a single entity, not a class. But sometimes the government files as a class action on behalf of inmates. Wait, the complaint says \"Plaintiff, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\", so it's the US government suing as a single plaintiff. However, in the context of CRIPA, the government often sues to represent a class of inmates. But the document doesn't explicitly state \"class action\" in the title or body.\n\nWait, the case number is 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL. The \"cv\" stands for civil, but that's standard. The key is whether the complaint itself refers to a class. Let's check the text again. The complaint mentions \"prisoners\" and \"inmates\" in the facts section, but the plaintiff is the United States. The prayer for relief (paragraph 31) says \"enjoining Defendant... from continuing the acts... that deprive persons confined at the Jail of rights\", which suggests it's a class action on behalf of the prisoners. But the document doesn't explicitly say \"class action\" in the text.\n\nWait, the checklist requires the extracted value to be 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' if it's a class action. The US government as a plaintiff in a CRIPA case is typically acting on behalf of a class, so this is likely a class action. But the problem is, the document doesn't say it. The user's requirement says to extract every distinct value found in the documents. If the document doesn't explicitly state \"class action\", do we have to infer or is it considered Not Applicable?\n\nThe Not Applicable encoding rules say: \"Do not mark Not Applicable solely because you failed to find a value; require explicit text or logically dispositive evidence (e.g., dismissal with prejudice → no settlement/decree; 'no class certification sought' → class action items Not Applicable).\"\n\nIn this case, the document doesn't say \"class action\" but the context (CRIPA, suing on behalf of prisoners) implies it's a class action. However, the system requires explicit text. The user's example says \"no class certification sought\" would make it Not Applicable. But here, there's no explicit statement. So maybe we can't confirm it's a class action from this document.\n\nWait, the complaint is filed under CRIPA, which is a statute that allows the government to sue for systemic issues, typically as a class action. But the document itself doesn't state it. So perhaps the correct approach is to look for explicit mentions. Since the Complaint doesn't say \"class action\", maybe it's not listed, so we need to check other documents.\n\nThe available documents include \"Joint Motion to Dismiss\", \"Consent Decree\", \"Settlement Agreement\", etc. The Complaint alone might not have the explicit mention, so we need to check other documents. The current state shows \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" is empty, and the Complaint (the only one read so far) doesn't have the explicit value.\n\nSo the next step should be to check other documents. The next logical step is to use `search_document_regex` to look for keywords like \"class action\", \"class\", \"individual plaintiffs\", etc., across the unvisited documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the ones that might contain this info are the \"Joint Motion to Dismiss\", \"Agreement\" (settlement), \"Consent Decree\", and maybe the \"Monitor/Expert/Receiver Reports\". But the best approach is to search for the pattern \"class action\" or similar.\n\nThe regex pattern could be \"class action\" or \"class action\" with possible variations. The search_document_regex function can be used to search for that pattern across the unvisited documents. The parameters would be pattern: \"class action\", doc_name: \"all\" to search all unvisited documents.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows some documents are unvisited. Using search_document_regex with pattern \"class action\" would help find where it's mentioned. Then, once found, read the context to confirm.\n\nSo the next action should be `search_document_regex` with pattern \"class action\" to find the relevant sections.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"class action\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"top_k\": 5, \"context_tokens\": 200}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "class action", "doc_name": "all", "top_k": 5, "context_tokens": 200}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6471, "completion_tokens": 1204, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the class action status from the legal documents.

Step 2 was reading the Complaint (tokens 0-2761), and Step 3 was a regex search for \"class action\" across all documents, which found 0 matches.\n\nThe current status shows that \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" is empty, with 0 values extracted. The Complaint document is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), so we can't read it again. The regex search didn't find anything, but maybe the term \"class action\" wasn't used exactly as expected. The Complaint mentions \"class action\" in the case title? Wait, the case number is 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL, but the document title says \"COMPLAINT (Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Americans with Disabilities Act)\". The plaintiff is the United States, and the defendant is the Jail Authority. The complaint is filed by the United States as a federal action, not a class action. Wait, in the complaint, paragraph 25 says \"defendant has violated the rights... of persons confined in the Jail\", which refers to prisoners, but the plaintiff is the U.S. government, not a class of plaintiffs. So it's not a class action lawsuit; it's a government enforcement action under CRIPA and ADA. So the plaintiffs here are the U.S. government, acting individually, not as a class. Wait, but the checklist is about whether the plaintiffs proceed as a class action or individual. Since the plaintiff is the U.S., which is a single entity, it's individual plaintiffs. But the description would need to say \"Individual, described as United States of America\".\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". So the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America\".\n\nBut the regex search for \"class action\" didn't find anything. Maybe the term isn't used in the document. So I need to look at the Complaint again, even though it's fully visited. Wait, the user said \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\", so since Complaint is marked as ✓ Fully Visited, I shouldn't read it again. But the regex search didn't find any matches, but maybe the key information is in the text without using the exact phrase \"class action\".\n\nWait, in the Complaint, the plaintiff is the United States of America, and it's a single plaintiff. The case is not a class action because the U.S. is suing on behalf of prisoners, but the lawsuit itself isn't a class action; it's a government enforcement action. So the plaintiffs are individual (the U.S. government), not a class. So the correct value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America\".\n\nBut how to extract this. The Complaint document has been fully read. The regex search for \"class action\" gave 0 matches, but maybe the term \"class\" isn't used. Wait, the case is a class action? Let me check the document again. The case is titled \"COMPLAINT (Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Americans with Disabilities Act)\", and the plaintiff is the U.S. government. In CRIPA cases, the U.S. sues to enforce rights, but it's not a class action. The U.S. is the plaintiff, so it's an individual plaintiff. So the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America\".\n\nBut the user's recent actions didn't find this because the regex was for \"class action\", which wasn't present. So maybe the next step is to use the text from the Complaint to extract this, even though it's fully visited. Wait, but the instructions say not to reread fully visited documents. So since Complaint is fully visited, we can't read it again. But we have the text from Step 2. Wait, the text from Step 2 is provided. Let me look at that.\n\nIn the Complaint text, paragraph 6 says \"Plaintiff is the United States of America.\" So the plaintiff is the U.S., which is a single entity, not a class. Therefore, the value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America\".\n\nBut the regex search didn't find \"class action\", which is correct because it's not a class action. So the checklist item needs to be set to Individual. Since the document is fully visited, and we have the text, we can now append this value.\n\nWait, the previous actions didn't extract it because they were searching for \"class action\", but the correct value is Individual. So the next step is to use append_checklist with the extracted value from the Complaint.\n\nThe evidence would be the text from paragraph 6: \"Plaintiff is the United States of America.\" The source document is Complaint, location is Page 2, paragraph 6.\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America\".\n\nWait, the checklist requires the value to be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'. So the value is \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America\".\n\nThe evidence needs to include the text snippet. The text snippet would be \"Plaintiff is the United States of America.\" The location is page 2, paragraph 6 (or token range, but the user provided page numbers).\n\nSo the next action should be append_checklist with this value. Since the document is fully visited, we can't read it again, but we have the text from the previous read.

The user is working on extracting the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item they need is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be formatted as either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted one value from the Complaint document. The evidence they found was from Page 2, Paragraph 6: \"Plaintiff is the United States of America.\" So they appended \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America\" to the checklist.\n\nNow, the next step is to check if there are any other documents that might have more information about the class action status. The available documents list shows that most are unvisited (○ Unvisited), except for the Complaint which is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited). The other documents include things like Docket, Memorandum of Law, Monitoring Reports, Orders, etc.\n\nThe previous steps were:\n1. List documents (found 11)\n2. Read Complaint (0-2761 tokens)\n3. Searched all documents for \"class action\" regex, got 0 matches\n4. Appended the found value\n\nSince the regex search for \"class action\" didn't find anything, but the Complaint already gave a value, maybe other documents like the Joint Motion to Dismiss or Agreement might have more info. However, the regex search didn't find any matches, so maybe the term isn't used in those documents. But the user needs to check other documents for possible mentions.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about whether it's a class action or individual plaintiffs. The Complaint already shows it's individual (US as plaintiff). But maybe other documents could confirm if it's a class action or not. For example, if there's a consent decree or settlement that mentions class action, but the Complaint says \"Plaintiff is the United States\", which is individual.\n\nBut the user has to check all documents. The next logical step would be to read another document that might have relevant info. The Docket might have entries about the case type. Or maybe the Joint Motion to Dismiss could mention if it's a class action.\n\nBut the regex search for \"class action\" didn't find anything, so maybe the term isn't used. But perhaps the documents use different phrasing. For example, \"class action\" might be written as \"class action\" but the regex was case-insensitive? Wait, the regex search used \"class action\" without flags, but maybe it's case-sensitive. However, the user might have used the default flags. But the search returned 0 matches, so maybe there's no mention of \"class action\" in any document.\n\nBut the user needs to check other documents. The next step should be to read another document. The Docket is a common place to find case type information. The Docket document is unvisited (○ Unvisited) with 5,827 tokens. So the next action should be to read the Docket document. Since it's unvisited, they can read the entire document (up to 10k tokens, which the Docket is 5,827, so within limit).\n\nAlternatively, maybe search for \"class\" or \"plaintiffs\" in the Docket. But the regex search for \"class action\" didn't work, so maybe using a different pattern. But the instructions say to use regex when the target is clearly patternable. The checklist item is about \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", so maybe looking for \"plaintiffs\" or \"class\" in the document.\n\nWait, but the previous regex search was for \"class action\" and found 0. So maybe the term isn't there. But the user needs to check other documents. Since the Docket is a key document, reading it would be a good next step. So the next action should be read_document on Docket (tokens 0-5827).\n\nWait, but the Docket might not have the case type. The Complaint already states the plaintiff is the US, so it's individual. But maybe other documents confirm that. However, the checklist says to extract every distinct value found. If all documents confirm it's individual, then that's the only value. But the user needs to make sure there's no mention of class action elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Agreement\" or \"Consent Decree\" could have details. But the Docket is a standard place to find case type.

The user is trying to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item they need is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be formatted as 'Plaintiffs: Class Action' or 'Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]'.\n\nSo far, they've already read the Complaint and Docket documents. In the Complaint (Step 2), they found that the plaintiff is the United States of America, so they added \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America\" as a value. Then in Step 5, they read the Docket, but the Docket entries just list the parties involved (like \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" as plaintiff), but they don't mention anything about class action or individual plaintiffs. The Docket entries are mostly about motions, orders, and status conferences, but no explicit mention of the class action status.\n\nThe current status shows that the key \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\" has 1 value, which is from the Complaint. But wait, the user needs to check if there are more values in other documents. The available documents include several unvisited ones like the \"Agreement\", \"Monitor Reports\", etc. The Agreement might have details about the class action, but since the plaintiff is the US government, it's likely that this is an individual action (not a class action), but they need to confirm.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\". The Complaint says \"Plaintiff is the United States of America\" (paragraph 6), so that's individual. But maybe in the Agreement or other documents, they might have a different designation. However, the US government usually files as a plaintiff in individual capacity, not as a class action. But the user needs to check all documents to make sure.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the \"Agreement\" (Settlement Agreement) might have the class action status. The \"Agreement\" document is unvisited (○ Unvisited) and has 20,157 tokens. Since the user hasn't read it yet, they should probably read that to check if there's any mention of class action.\n\nWait, but the Docket has an entry from 2020-08-05: \"Joint MOTION for Entry of Consent Decree by UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\" The Consent Decree might be part of a settlement, but the motion is filed by the US as plaintiff, which again suggests individual, not class action. However, the user needs to confirm if the Agreement (which is the settlement document) specifies anything about class action.\n\nThe user has already used `search_document_regex` with \"class action\" and found 0 matches, so maybe the term \"class action\" isn't used, but the status might be implied. However, the checklist requires extracting the status as per the document's wording. Since the Complaint says \"Plaintiff is the United States of America\", which is individual, and the Docket entries don't contradict that, maybe there's no need for more values. But the user should check the Agreement to be thorough.\n\nThe Agreement document is listed as \"Agreement [Settlement Agreement]\" with 20,157 tokens. Since it's unvisited, the next logical step is to read it. The user should use `read_document` on the Agreement to check for any mention of class action or individual plaintiffs.\n\nWait, the user's current status shows 1 value extracted. They need to make sure there are no more values. Since the Agreement is a settlement document, it might clarify the nature of the case. For example, the Consent Decree (which is mentioned in the Docket) might specify that it's a class action, but the Complaint says it's the US government as plaintiff, which is typically not a class action. Wait, the US government can file under CRIPA and ADA, but it's usually a representative action, but the checklist might consider it individual. The user needs to check the Agreement.\n\nSo, the next action should be to read the Agreement document. The document name is \"Agreement\", so they should call `read_document` with \"Agreement\" as the doc_name, and since it's unvisited, start from tokens 0-10000 (since the max is 10,000 tokens per read). The Agreement has 20,157 tokens, so they'll need to read it in chunks, but the first chunk would be 0-10000.\n\nWait, the available documents list \"Agreement\" as 20,157 tokens, so the next step is to read it. The user shouldn't use `search_document_regex` again because they already did that and found 0 matches.

Then they read the Docket and the Agreement (partially).\n\nLooking at the Agreement document, which they read up to token 10000, I need to check if there's any mention of class action. The Agreement is a consent decree between the U.S. and the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority. The complaint was filed by the U.S. as the plaintiff, not as a class action. The Agreement itself is a settlement, so it's likely that the case was not a class action but individual (since the U.S. is suing on behalf of the prisoners, but as a government entity, not as a class).\n\nWait, the key is about whether the plaintiffs proceed as a class action or individual.

There's no mention of class action. The complaint was filed by the U.S. as the plaintiff, so it's individual.

The Docket has entries like \"Complaint, filed by UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\" No mention of class action. The Agreement is a settlement, so it's not a class action. The other documents like the Monitoring Reports probably don't mention the class status either.\n\nThe user's current status shows 1 out of 1 keys filled. The next step is to stop because all keys are filled. Wait, the checklist only has one item: Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs. They have one value for it, and there are no more documents that would add another value (since the regex search found nothing, and the documents they've read don't have class action mentioned).\n\nWait, but the user's step 4 was append_checklist with that value. Now, after reading the Agreement, they should check if there's any other value. But the Agreement doesn't add anything new. So they should stop.\n\nBut the Agreement is partially visited (only up to 10k tokens). However, the key point is whether \"class action\" is mentioned. Since the regex search found 0 matches, and the Agreement's text they read doesn't have it, it's safe to assume no other mentions. The remaining documents (like the Monitoring Reports, etc.) are unlikely to mention the class action status because the case is a government action, not a class action.\n\nSo the correct action is to stop. The checklist item is already filled with the one value, and there's no need to check further documents because the regex search didn't find any, and the existing documents don't have it.\n\nWait, but the user needs to confirm all values. Since the regex search was done across all documents and found 0 matches, and they've read the main documents (Complaint, Docket, Agreement), it's safe to conclude there are no other values. So the extraction is complete.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully extracted.

The user is asking to extract the class action status from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Class_Action_or_Individual_Plaintiffs\", which should be either \"Plaintiffs: Class Action\" or \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as [description]\".\n\nLooking at the recent actions, step 4 already appended a value from the Complaint: \"Plaintiffs: Individual, described as United States of America\" with evidence from page 2, paragraph 6. Then steps 5-7 involved reading other documents and a regex search that found no matches for \"class action\".\n\nThe current status shows that all checklist items are filled (1 out of 1), and the system suggests stopping. The available documents include some unvisited ones like the Docket [PACER], but the regex search in step 3 already checked all documents for \"class action\" and found nothing. The Agreement document was partially read, but the relevant part about plaintiffs would be in the Complaint or Docket, which were already fully visited.\n\nThe key point is that the regex search (step 3) found no instances of \"class action\", and the Complaint's paragraph 6 states the plaintiff is the United States of America, which is an individual plaintiff (not a class action). The Docket entries show the US as the plaintiff, and all motions are filed by the US, not as a class. The Agreement is between HRRJ and the US, which confirms it's an individual action, not a class action.\n\nSince the regex search found no \"class action\" mentions, and the existing evidence confirms it's individual plaintiffs, there's no need to check other documents. The checklist item is already filled with one value, and there are no other possible values. The system's automatic checklist review shows 1/1 filled, so the correct action is to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All checklist items are fully extracted.
