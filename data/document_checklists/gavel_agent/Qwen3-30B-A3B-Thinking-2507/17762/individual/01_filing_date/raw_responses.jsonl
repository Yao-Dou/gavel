The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The current status shows that there are 0 documents in the corpus. The \"Available Documents\" section says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step is to figure out what documents are available.\n\nLooking at the Decision Policy, if the document catalog is unknown, I should call `list_documents`. The snapshot mentions that the document catalog is unknown here because there are 0 documents listed. The user can't read any documents if there aren't any, so the next logical step is to list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe other options like `read_document` or `search_document_regex` require knowing which documents exist, but since there are none listed, those can't be used yet. `get_checklist` would just show empty results, and `append` or `update` aren't applicable without data. So the only correct action is to call `list_documents` to discover the available documents.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"list_documents\", \"arguments\": {}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "list_documents", "args": {}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3091, "completion_tokens": 221, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. The checklist item is Filing_Date, which is the calendar date the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLooking at the available documents, there are 11 unvisited ones. The task is to find the filing date. The first step is to figure out which document is most likely to contain this information. Typically, the Complaint (the initial filing) would have the filing date. The Docket might also have it, but the Complaint is the primary document for the start of the case.\n\nThe current status shows all keys are empty, so I need to start by reading a document. The Complaint is the most probable place. The Complaint document is 2,761 tokens, which is under the 10,000 limit, so reading the whole thing is feasible. Since it's unvisited (○ Unvisited), I should use read_document on the Complaint from start to end.\n\nI should check if there's a regex pattern that can help, but since the date might be in a standard format, maybe reading the whole document is safer. The regex approach might miss it if the date isn't in a clear pattern. So, defaulting to read_document on the Complaint.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"every distinct value,\" so there might be multiple dates, but the filing date is usually just one. Still, need to check all documents. But the Complaint is the first place to look. Let's proceed with reading the Complaint.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Complaint\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 2761}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Complaint", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 2761}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3418, "completion_tokens": 351, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the Filing_Date from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that they've already read the Complaint document (tokens 0-2761) and found the filing date in the header.\n\nLooking at the Complaint document text provided in the recent actions, the first line says \"Case 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL Document 1 Filed 08/05/20 Page 1 of 7 PageID# 1\". So the filing date here is August 5, 2020, which would be 08/05/20. The requirement is to extract every distinct value, and since this is the only document read so far, this should be the value.\n\nThe next step is to append this value to the checklist. The checklist item is Filing_Date. The evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The verbatim text is \"Filed 08/05/20\", source is Complaint, and location is the header of the document (Page 1).\n\nI should use append_checklist because it's adding a new entry. The parameters need to have the key as \"Filing_Date\" and the extracted array with the value and evidence. Each evidence entry must have text, source_document, and location. The location can be \"Page 1\" as per the document's header.\n\nWait, the document says \"Filed 08/05/20\", so the value should be \"08/05/20\" or \"August 5, 2020\"? The requirement says to extract the exact value as in the document. The document uses \"08/05/20\", so that's the value to use. The user's example in the problem statement uses \"08/05/20\", so I'll stick with that.\n\nCheck if there are any other documents that might have a different filing date. But the current status shows that Complaint is fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), and other documents are unvisited. However, the filing date is typically in the initial complaint, so it's unlikely to be elsewhere. But the task is to extract every distinct value, so if other documents have different dates, they need to be checked. But since the user hasn't read other documents yet, the next step after extracting this value is to append it.\n\nWait, the recent action was reading the Complaint, and the text shows the filing date. So the correct action now is to append the checklist entry for Filing_Date with the value from the Complaint. The next action should be append_checklist with the extracted value.\n\nI need to make sure that the evidence includes all required fields: text, source_document, location. The text is \"Filed 08/05/20\", source is \"Complaint\", location is \"Page 1\" (since it's the first page). The value is \"08/05/20\".\n\nSo the append_checklist patch should have key \"Filing_Date\", and extracted array with one entry containing evidence (text, source_document, location) and value \"08/05/20\".\n\nNo other actions are needed here because the document is fully visited, and this is the first value found. The checklist item was empty before, so adding this entry fills it.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Filing_Date\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"08/05/20\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"Filed 08/05/20\", \"source_document\": \"Complaint\", \"location\": \"Page 1\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Filing_Date", "extracted": [{"value": "08/05/20", "evidence": [{"text": "Filed 08/05/20", "source_document": "Complaint", "location": "Page 1"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6421, "completion_tokens": 793, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract the Filing_Date from legal documents. So far, they've already found \"08/05/20\" in the Complaint document, which was read in Step 2. The current status shows that Filing_Date has 1 value, and the Complaint is fully visited.\n\nNow, the task is to check if there are any other documents that might have the filing date. The available documents list shows that 10 out of 11 are unvisited. But the key point here is that the filing date is usually in the initial pleading, like the Complaint. However, sometimes other documents might have the same date or additional details.\n\nWait, the checklist definition says \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed.\" So the first filing date should be in the Complaint, which they already read. But maybe other documents like the Docket or Orders could have the same date. However, the Docket might list the filing date as well, but since the Complaint already has it, maybe it's redundant. But the requirement is to extract EVERY distinct value. So if another document has the same date, it's still the same value, so no need to add it again. But if a different date is found, that would be a problem.\n\nWait, but the user is supposed to extract every distinct value. So if multiple documents have the same date, they should only list it once. However, the current extraction already has \"08/05/20\" from the Complaint. So the next step is to check if any other documents have a different filing date. But since this is the initial filing, it's unlikely to have another date. However, maybe some documents like the Docket might have the filing date again. But the user needs to confirm.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Docket (both the main Docket and Docket [PACER]) are unvisited. Maybe the Docket entry would list the filing date. Let's think: the Docket is a chronological list of events, so the first entry would be the filing date. So checking the Docket might confirm the same date. But since the requirement is to get all distinct values, and the date is already found, adding the same date again isn't necessary. However, the system might require evidence from another document to confirm. Wait, no. The instructions say \"extract EVERY distinct value,\" so if the date is the same, it's the same value, so only one entry is needed. But the evidence for that value should come from the document where it's first found. Since the Complaint has it, and the Docket would just list the same date, there's no need to add another entry. However, maybe the Docket has a different format or additional info, but the value is the same.\n\nWait, but the user's current checklist has Filing_Date with one value. The next step should be to check if there are other documents that might have the filing date. But since the Complaint is the first document, it's the most likely place. However, to be thorough, maybe check the Docket. But the problem is that the user's task is to extract the filing date, which is already found. The Stop Criteria says to stop when all keys are filled or marked Not Applicable. Since the key is already filled with one value, and there's no indication that the value is incorrect or incomplete, maybe they can stop.\n\nWait, but the user's recent action was to append the Filing_Date from the Complaint. The current status shows 1 value, and the key is filled. So all keys (only Filing_Date) are filled. Therefore, the next step should be to stop. But wait, the instructions say \"Stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable.\" Here, the key is filled with one value. So the correct action is to stop.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user should check if there's another document that might have a different filing date. For example, if there's a motion to file or something else. But the checklist says \"the calendar date on which the lawsuit was first filed,\" which should be the initial filing. The Complaint is the first document, so the filing date is in there. The Docket might list it again, but it's the same date. So no new distinct values. Therefore, the extraction is complete.\n\nThe available documents include others, but they're all after the filing, like motions, orders, etc. So they wouldn't have the initial filing date. For example, the Joint Motion to Dismiss would be filed after the initial complaint. So the filing date is only in the Complaint and maybe the Docket. But since the Docket's filing date would be the same as the Complaint's, it's redundant. So the extraction is done.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop. The current state shows all keys are filled (1/1), so the assistant should return the stop decision with the reason.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"Filing_Date extracted from Complaint (08/05/20) with evidence.
