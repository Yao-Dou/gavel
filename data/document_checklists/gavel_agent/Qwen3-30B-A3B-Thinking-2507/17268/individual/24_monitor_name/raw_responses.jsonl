The current state says \"Documents in Corpus: 0\".\n\nHmm, the task requires extracting the name, but there are no documents available. The system says \"No documents discovered yet.\" So, the first step should be to figure out what documents exist. The decision policy says if the document catalog is unknown, call `list_documents`. Since there are zero documents listed, the catalog is unknown. The next logical step is to list the documents to see what's available.\n\nThe user can't read or search documents if there are none. So, the correct action here is to call `list_documents` to get the list of documents. That's the first step before anything else. The other options like read_document or search_document_regex require existing documents, which aren't present yet.

The task is to extract the Name_of_the_Monitor from the legal documents. The checklist has one item: Name_of_the_Monitor, which is empty right now. There are 10 documents listed, all unvisited.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the monitor's name might be. In legal documents, court-appointed monitors are often mentioned in orders, settlements, or specific motions. The available documents include Dockets, Orders, and a Joint Notice of Settlement. The Orders (like Order 001 to 005) and the Settlement Order might be good places to look.\n\nSince the catalog is known (10 documents listed), I shouldn't call list_documents again. The next step is to read a document. But which one? The Orders might be more likely to have the monitor's name. Let's pick Order (001) first because it's the smallest in tokens (2,206), so it's quick to read. The Dockets might have references, but the actual appointment would probably be in an Order.\n\nWait, the Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims is also a candidate. But maybe start with the first Order. The user's recent actions show Step 1 was list_documents, so now I need to read a document. Since all are unvisited, pick one to read. Order (001) seems a good start. Let's call read_document on that with the whole document since it's under 10k tokens. The token count is 2,206, so start_token 0 to 2206.\n\nWait, the document is unvisited, so I can read the whole thing. The parameters need start_token and end_token. Since it's the first read, start at 0, end at the total tokens. So start_token: 0, end_token: 2206. The document name is \"Order (001)\".\n\nI should make sure not to read a document that's already visited, but all are unvisited.

The user needs to extract the monitor's name from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Name_of_the_Monitor\", and the task is to find every distinct value with evidence.\n\nFirst, I'll check the current status. The snapshot shows that \"Name_of_the_Monitor\" is empty, and the only document read so far is Order (001), which is fully visited. The user provided the text from Order (001) in the recent actions. Let me scan that text for any mention of a monitor.\n\nLooking through the Order (001) text, I see references to various people like Matthew Albence, John Kelly, Kevin McAleenan, and Scott Lloyd. But the key here is whether any of them are appointed as a monitor. The document is about sanctions related to late production of documents, not about a monitor. The court order mentions handwritten notes from these officials, but there's no indication they're monitors. The case is about family separation policies, and the order is granting sanctions on discovery issues. The term \"monitor\" isn't used here. \n\nThe user's checklist item is \"Name_of_the_Monitor\", which refers to a court-appointed or agreed-upon monitor. Since the document doesn't mention a monitor, and the only document read so far doesn't have that info, I need to check other documents. The available documents include Complaint, Dockets, other Orders, etc. But the current status shows that Order (001) is fully visited, so I shouldn't re-read it. \n\nWait, the next step is to decide which action to take. The current keys have 0 values. The user might need to search other documents. The available documents are mostly unvisited. The next logical step would be to read another document, maybe the Complaint or Docket (001), but the problem is that the checklist item is about a monitor, which might not be in the Complaint. Alternatively, maybe the monitor is mentioned in a different order.\n\nWait, the Order (001) text doesn't have any mention of a monitor. So the next step is to check other documents. The user should probably read another document. But which one? Since the document catalog shows Order (002) is 553 tokens, which is small, maybe it's a good candidate. But the user should check if there's a pattern. Alternatively, use search_document_regex to look for \"monitor\" or \"appointed monitor\" across documents.\n\nWait, the Decision Policy says to use search_document_regex when the target is patternable. The key here is \"Name_of_the_Monitor\", so the pattern could be searching for \"monitor\" in the documents. So using search_document_regex with pattern \"monitor\" might be efficient to find where the monitor is mentioned. The parameters would be pattern: \"monitor\", and maybe doc_name: 'all' to search all unvisited documents.\n\nBut the user's recent action was reading Order (001), which didn't have the info. Now, to check other documents, using search_document_regex would be better than reading each one by one. The function allows searching all documents for the pattern. So the next action should be search_document_regex with pattern \"monitor\" to find any mentions.\n\nWait, the available documents are 10, with Order (001) fully visited. The other 9 are unvisited. Using search_document_regex on 'all' documents with pattern \"monitor\" would return matches in other documents. The context around the matches can then be read with read_document if needed. But since the user can only do one action per turn, the next step is to call search_document_regex to find where \"monitor\" appears.\n\nSo the correct action here is to use search_document_regex with pattern \"monitor\" and doc_name set to 'all' to search all unvisited documents. The parameters would be pattern: \"monitor\", doc_name: \"all\". The flags can be default. Top_k and context_tokens can use defaults.\n\nWait, the pattern needs to be precise. The checklist item is \"Name_of_the_Monitor\", so the word \"monitor\" is key. The regex pattern would be \"monitor\" (case-insensitive maybe, but the document might have it capitalized). Using IGNORECASE flag to cover all cases. But the problem says to prefer precise patterns. So maybe \"monitor\" with IGNORECASE.\n\nSo the function call should be search_document_regex with pattern \"monitor\", flags [\"IGNORECASE\"], doc_name \"all\". That should find any occurrence of \"monitor\" in the documents. Then, based on the matches, read the relevant sections.\n\nBut the user has to do one action at a time. So the next action is to search for \"monitor\" across all documents. That's the most efficient way to find where the monitor is mentioned, if it exists in any document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_document_regex\", \"arguments\": {\"pattern\": \"monitor\", \"doc_name\": \"all\", \"flags\": [\"IGNORECASE\"]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "search_document_regex", "args": {"pattern": "monitor", "doc_name": "all", "flags": ["IGNORECASE"]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6029, "completion_tokens": 1041, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The search for \"monitor\" didn't find anything, but maybe the monitor name is mentioned without using the exact word \"monitor\". For example, maybe it's called a \"monitor\" but the term isn't used in the text, or it's referred to by a different name.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"Name_of_the_Monitor: The name of any court-appointed or agreed-upon monitor, if one exists.\" So the key is looking for the monitor's name, not the word \"monitor\". The previous search used \"monitor\" as the pattern, which might be why it found nothing. The search pattern was \"monitor\", but the actual name might be listed without that keyword. For example, the document might say \"appointed John Smith as the monitor\", but the word \"monitor\" isn't in the text. So the regex search for \"monitor\" would miss that.\n\nSo the search was ineffective because it's looking for the exact term, but the monitor's name might be mentioned without it. Therefore, the next step should be to read other documents that might contain the name. The Order (001) was already read and didn't have it, so we need to check other documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the unvisited ones are Complaint, Docket (001), Docket (002), Order (002), Order (003), Order (004), Order (005), Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims, and Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement.\n\nSince the search for \"monitor\" didn't work, maybe the monitor's name is in one of these other documents. The next logical step is to read another document. The Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims is a short document (832 tokens), so maybe it's a good candidate. Alternatively, the Joint Notice might mention a monitor.\n\nBut the user's task is to extract the monitor name, so perhaps the monitor is mentioned in a settlement order. The document \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" might have the name. Let's check the document catalog: it's 832 tokens, unvisited. So reading that document would be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Complaint (42k tokens) could have it, but it's larger. But since the previous search didn't find \"monitor\", maybe the name is in a different context. But the Order Approving Settlements is shorter, so starting with that might be better.\n\nWait, the recent action was a search on all documents for \"monitor\", which returned 0 matches. So the term \"monitor\" isn't in any document. But the checklist is looking for the name of the monitor, not the word. So the search pattern was wrong. Therefore, the search was not helpful, and we need to read other documents to find where the monitor's name might be mentioned.\n\nSo the next step should be to read a document that's likely to contain the monitor's name. The Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims might be a good candidate because settlement orders often appoint monitors. So I should read that document. Let's check the document name: \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" – that's the name. So using read_document on that document, starting from 0 tokens, since it's unvisited. The token count is 832, so the range would be 0-832.\n\nWait, the document is 832 tokens, so reading 0-832 would cover the whole document. Since it's unvisited, that's the way to go. So the action should be read_document with doc_name \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" and start_token 0, end_token 832.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check the Joint Notice, but the Order Approving Settlements seems more likely to have a monitor named.

The previous search for \"monitor\" didn't find anything, but maybe the monitor's name is mentioned in a different context. Wait, the checklist is about a court-appointed or agreed-upon monitor. Let me check the documents they've already read.\n\nIn Order (001), they found names like Matthew Albence, John Kelly, Kevin McAleenan, and Scott Lloyd. But those are government officials or witnesses, not monitors. The Order Approving Settlements mentions Legacy Enhancement Trust handling the minors' trusts, but it's not a monitor. The search for \"monitor\" returned nothing, so maybe the term isn't used directly, or the monitor's name is embedded in other terms.\n\nWait, the user's checklist item is specifically \"Name_of_the_Monitor\". Since the regex search for \"monitor\" didn't find anything, but the key is still empty, I need to check if the monitor's name might be mentioned without the word \"monitor\". For example, maybe in the Settlement Order, they refer to a monitor without using the exact term. But in the Order Approving Settlements, it's about Legacy Enhancement Trust managing the trusts, not a monitor. The other documents like Complaint or Dockets might have more info.\n\nThe next logical step is to check other documents. Since the regex search didn't find anything, maybe reading a specific document where a monitor might be mentioned. The Complaint (42k tokens) could have references, but it's a complaint, so maybe not. The Dockets (Docket 001 and 002) might have entries about monitors. Docket entries often list motions, orders, etc. Maybe the Docket (001) or (002) has a mention of a monitor.\n\nLooking at the available documents, Docket (001) is 17,690 tokens and unvisited. Docket (002) is 56k tokens. Since the previous search for \"monitor\" didn't find anything, but the key is empty, I should read one of the docket documents. Docket (001) is smaller, so maybe start there. The user can't read a document that's fully visited, but these are unvisited. So, using read_document on Docket (001) for the first 10k tokens to see if there's any mention of a monitor or related terms.\n\nWait, the user's previous search used \"monitor\" as the regex, but maybe the monitor's name is listed under a different term. For example, \"monitor\" might not be the exact word used. But the checklist says \"Name_of_the_Monitor\", so the term \"monitor\" should be in the document. Since the regex search found 0 matches, maybe there's no monitor, but the key isn't marked as Not Applicable yet. However, the user needs to confirm if it's truly not applicable. But the task is to extract if it exists. If after checking all documents, there's no mention, then set to Not Applicable.\n\nBut the current step is to proceed. Since the regex search failed, the next step is to read a document that might contain the info. Docket (001) is a likely candidate because dockets often list appointed monitors. So, the next action should be read_document on Docket (001) for a token range, say 0-10000, since it's 17k tokens, but 10k is the max per call.

So maybe there's no monitor, but we need to check if it's Not Applicable.\n\nWait, the Not Applicable encoding requires explicit evidence. The user mentioned that if there's no monitor, we can't just say Not Applicable without evidence. So if after checking all documents, there's no mention of a monitor, then we can set it to Not Applicable. But first, we need to check all possible documents.\n\nThe current available documents: Docket (001) is partially visited. The next step is to read the remaining tokens in Docket (001) because it's the most relevant (it's the docket, which might list appointments).

But the maximum read is 10,000 tokens, so reading from 10,000 to 17,690 is 7,690 tokens, which is under 10k. So call read_document on Docket (001) with start_token 10000, end_token 17690.\n\nWait, the token count is 17,690, so end_token would be 17690. But the tool parameters need start and end. So start_token 10000, end_token 17690.\n\nBut the user has to choose exactly one action. The previous actions have already checked Order (001), Order Approving Settlements, and Docket (001) up to 10k. The next logical step is to continue reading Docket (001) to cover the remaining tokens. Since the search for \"monitor\" found nothing, but maybe the monitor's name is in the remaining part of the docket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the monitor name isn't present, and we need to set it to Not Applicable. But according to the Not Applicable encoding, we need explicit evidence. For example, if the document says \"no monitor was appointed,\" but if it's not stated, we can't assume.

The task is to extract the monitor name from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Name_of_the_Monitor\", which should be the name of any court-appointed or agreed-upon monitor.\n\nFirst, I need to check what documents have been processed so far. From the recent actions, the user has read three documents: Order (001), Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims, and Docket (001) in two parts (tokens 0-10000 and 10000-17690). All of these are marked as fully visited. The search for \"monitor\" using regex returned 0 matches.\n\nLooking at the content of these documents, the Order (001) talks about sanctions related to handwritten notes by government officials like Matthew Albence, John Kelly, Kevin McAleenan, and Scott Lloyd. But these are government witnesses, not monitors. The Order Approving Settlements mentions trusts operated by Legacy Enhancement, but no monitor is named there. The Docket (001) is a case docket with attorney names and case events, but no mention of a monitor.\n\nThe other documents are unvisited: Complaint, Docket (002), Order (002) through (005), and the Joint Notice. Since the previous search for \"monitor\" didn't find anything, maybe the monitor name is in one of these unvisited documents. The next step is to check those documents.\n\nThe user's current status shows 0 values extracted for Name_of_the_Monitor. The available documents include several Orders and the Complaint. The Complaint might have a monitor mentioned, but it's unvisited. The Docket (002) is 56k tokens, which is over 10k, so reading it in parts might be needed, but the first step is to check if any of the unvisited documents contain the monitor name.\n\nSince the regex search didn't find anything in the visited docs, the next logical step is to search the remaining documents for \"monitor\" again. But the regex search was done on all documents earlier (Step 3), and it found 0 matches. However, maybe the term is phrased differently, like \"monitor\" vs \"monitors\" or \"monitoring\". But the instruction says to use the exact term. Wait, the search was done with pattern \"monitor\", so it's looking for that exact string. If the monitor's name is part of a longer phrase, maybe it's not captured. But the checklist item is \"Name_of_the_Monitor\", so it's expecting a person's name, not the word \"monitor\".\n\nWait, the problem is that the checklist is to extract the name of the monitor, not the word \"monitor\". So the search should be for names, not the word. But the previous search was for \"monitor\", which is the keyword, but maybe the actual name is mentioned. For example, \"Scott Lloyd\" is mentioned in Order (001), but he's a government official, not a monitor. The Order Approving Settlements mentions Legacy Enhancement, which is a trust, not a monitor.\n\nHmm. Maybe the monitor name isn't present in the documents, so it should be marked as Not Applicable. But the guidelines say not to mark it as Not Applicable unless there's explicit evidence. For example, if the case doesn't have a monitor, but the documents need to state that. Let's check the documents again.\n\nIn Order (001), the court mentions \"Scott Lloyd\" as the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, but he's not a monitor. The case is about family separation, and the monitor might be a different role. The settlement order talks about placing funds into trusts operated by Legacy Enhancement, but again, not a monitor.\n\nSince all visited documents have been checked and no monitor name is found, and the regex search for \"monitor\" didn't return any matches, perhaps the monitor isn't present. But the task says to extract \"EVERY distinct value\", so if it's not there, it should be Not Applicable. However, the guidelines say to require explicit evidence. So if the documents don't mention a monitor at all, then it's Not Applicable.\n\nBut before concluding that, maybe the unvisited documents have the monitor name. The available documents include Order (002) to (005), Complaint, Docket (002), and the Joint Notice. The Joint Notice is titled \"Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines\" — maybe it mentions a monitor.\n\nThe next step should be to check the Joint Notice document, as it's a pleading/motion that might mention a monitor. Since it's unvisited, reading it would be the next action. Alternatively, using search_document_regex on the unvisited documents for \"monitor\" again, but since the previous search didn't find anything, maybe it's better to read the most likely document first.\n\nThe Joint Notice is a short document (1,832 tokens), so reading it entirely would be efficient. So the next action should be to read the Joint Notice document. Let's check the document catalog: \"Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines\" is unvisited, 1832 tokens. So using read_document on that with tokens 0-1832.\n\nWait, but the user's recent actions already did a search_document_regex on all documents and found 0 matches. However, maybe the monitor's name is in the Joint Notice. So the next step is to read that document to check.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 1832}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 1832}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 26201, "completion_tokens": 1223, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the monitor name from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"Name_of_the_Monitor\", which should be the name of any court-appointed or agreed-upon monitor.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the current status. The system shows that all documents except the unvisited ones have been fully read. The available documents include Docket (001), Order (001), Order Approving Settlements, and Joint Notice. All of these are marked as fully visited. The other documents like Complaint, Docket (002), etc., are unvisited.\n\nThe user's prior actions show that they did a regex search for \"monitor\" across all documents and found 0 matches. Then they read several documents, but none contained the word \"monitor\". Now, the task is to check if any of the visited documents mention a monitor.\n\nLooking at the Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims, it talks about placing minors' trust funds with \"Legacy Enhancement\" until they reach certain ages. But it doesn't mention a monitor. The Docket entries list attorneys and parties, but no monitors.\n\nThe Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement mentions parties and their counsel, but again, no monitor is named. The Docket (001) has a list of attorneys and case events, but nothing about a monitor.\n\nSince the regex search for \"monitor\" returned zero matches, and all visited documents have been checked, it's possible there's no monitor appointed. The checklist requires that if there's no monitor, it should be marked as \"Not Applicable\" with evidence.\n\nThe evidence for \"Not Applicable\" needs to be explicit. The documents mention settlement trusts managed by Legacy Enhancement, but that's a trustee, not a court-appointed monitor. The case doesn't mention any monitor, so the evidence would be the absence of any mention of a monitor in all documents.\n\nSo, the correct action is to update the checklist for Name_of_the_Monitor with \"Not Applicable\" and provide evidence from the documents. Since all relevant documents have been checked and no monitor is mentioned, it's safe to set it as Not Applicable.\n\nI need to use update_checklist with the key \"Name_of_the_Monitor\", a single entry with value \"Not Applicable\", and evidence citing the documents where \"monitor\" wasn't found. The evidence should reference the regex search and the document reviews.\n\nWait, the evidence needs to be a verbatim snippet. But since there's no mention, the evidence would be the search results showing no matches. The prior action step 3 was a search_document_regex with pattern \"monitor\" on all documents, which found 0 matches. So the evidence can reference that search result.\n\nSo the evidence would be: \"Search for 'monitor' in all documents yielded 0 matches (Step 3), and all fully visited documents were reviewed without finding any mention of a monitor.\"\n\nTherefore, the next action is to call update_checklist with the key Name_of_the_Monitor, value \"Not Applicable\", and the evidence as described.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"update_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Name_of_the_Monitor\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Not Applicable\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Search in 10 documents found 0 total matches (Step 3: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern 'monitor')\",\n                \"source_document\": \"All documents\",\n                \"location\": \"Search results from Step 3\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"All fully visited documents (Docket 001, Order 001, Order Approving Settlements, Joint Notice) were reviewed without finding any mention of a monitor\",\n                \"source_document\": \"All fully visited documents\",\n                \"location\": \"Document review summary\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "update_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "Name_of_the_Monitor", "extracted": [{"value": "Not Applicable", "evidence": [{"text": "Search in 10 documents found 0 total matches (Step 3: search_document_regex on all documents with pattern 'monitor')", "source_document": "All documents", "location": "Search results from Step 3"}, {"text": "All fully visited documents (Docket 001, Order 001, Order Approving Settlements, Joint Notice) were reviewed without finding any mention of a monitor", "source_document": "All fully visited documents", "location": "Document review summary"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 2, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 25843, "completion_tokens": 834, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the monitor name from legal documents. The checklist item is \"Name_of_the_Monitor\", and they need every distinct value found.\n\nLooking at the prior actions, they did a search for \"monitor\" across all documents (Step 3) and found no matches. Then they read several documents: Order (001), Docket (001), Order Approving Settlements, and Joint Notice. In all those, they didn't find any mention of a monitor.\n\nThe current status shows that \"Name_of_the_Monitor\" is marked as Not Applicable, with evidence from the search (no matches) and the document reviews. The available documents list shows that there are 10 documents total, but 4 are fully visited (all tokens read), and 6 are unvisited (like Complaint, Docket 002, etc.).\n\nWait, but the user's task is to extract the monitor name. Since the regex search for \"monitor\" found nothing, and the fully visited documents were checked without finding any mention, the next step would be to check the unvisited documents. However, the instructions say not to reread fully visited documents, but the unvisited ones haven't been checked yet.\n\nBut wait, the \"Not Applicable\" was already set via update_checklist in Step 8. The current status says it's marked as Not Applicable with evidence. The system requires that Not Applicable is only set when there's explicit evidence, like no mention of a monitor in all documents. But the user hasn't checked all documents yet—the unvisited ones (Complaint, Docket 002, etc.) might contain the word \"monitor\" even if the others didn't.\n\nWait, the \"Not Applicable\" was set based on the search across all documents (Step 3) and the fully visited documents. But Step 3 was a regex search on all documents, which returned 0 matches. So the search was done on all 10 documents, and found nothing. The unvisited documents were part of that search. So the regex search was done on all documents, not just the visited ones. Therefore, the evidence for Not Applicable is valid because the search was across all documents and found no matches.\n\nThe user's current status shows that \"Name_of_the_Monitor\" is already marked as Not Applicable. The remaining documents are unvisited, but the regex search already covered all documents. So there's no need to read the unvisited ones because the search was comprehensive.\n\nThe Stop Criteria says to stop when all keys are complete or Not Applicable. Here, the only key is \"Name_of_the_Monitor\", which is already Not Applicable. So the next step should be to stop.\n\nWait, but the user might want to confirm by checking the unvisited documents, but according to the system rules, the regex search was done on all documents (Step 3: search_document_regex on all documents), so the search covered all 10 documents. Therefore, the search result of 0 matches means there's no mention of \"monitor\" in any document. Hence, it's safe to mark as Not Applicable.\n\nThe current status shows \"Not Applicable\" with evidence from the search and the document reviews. So the checklist is fully processed. The next action should be to stop.\n\nThe available documents include unvisited ones, but since the regex search was on all documents and found nothing, those unvisited documents don't need to be read again. The search would have already checked them. So there's no need to do anything else.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All documents were searched for 'monitor' (Step 3) with 0 matches, and all fully visited documents were reviewed without finding any mention of a monitor.
