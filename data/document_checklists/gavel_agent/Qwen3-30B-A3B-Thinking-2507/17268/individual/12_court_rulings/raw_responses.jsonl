The user needs to extract court rulings from legal documents. The checklist item is Court_Rulings, which is currently empty. There are 10 documents listed, all unvisited.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which document is most likely to contain the court rulings. Court rulings are typically in Orders or Opinions, right? So looking at the available documents, the \"Order (001)\" through \"Order (005)\" and \"Order Approving Settlements...\" are the most relevant. The Complaint and Dockets might have some info, but the Orders are where the actual rulings would be.\n\nThe user mentioned that Court_Rulings should include decisions on motions, like granted/denied motions to dismiss, summary judgment, etc. So the Orders are the primary candidates. The first Order listed is Order (001) with 2,206 tokens. Since it's a small document, reading it entirely might be efficient. The token count is under 10k, so read_document with start 0 and end 2206 would cover the whole thing.\n\nWait, the document is marked as unvisited (○ Unvisited), so I should read it. The Docket entries might have some procedural info, but the actual rulings are in the Orders. Let me confirm: Docket entries list the dates and types of filings, but the court's actual decisions are in the Orders. So focusing on the Order documents makes sense.\n\nOrder (001) is the smallest, so starting there. Let's use read_document on Order (001) from token 0 to 2206. That should give the content where the ruling is likely stated. Once I get that text, I can look for the ruling details and then use append_checklist to add them with evidence.\n\nNo need for regex here since the document is small and specific. Using read_document directly is better than searching, as the document name is known. So the next action should be read_document for Order (001).\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (001)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 2206}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (001)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 2206}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3532, "completion_tokens": 462, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract Court_Rulings from the legal documents. The snapshot shows that they've already read Order (001) from tokens 0-2206, and the current status is that Court_Rulings is empty.\n\nLooking at the Order (001) document they provided, it's a court order granting in part and denying in part a Motion for Sanctions. The key part here is the court's ruling. The order states: \"IT IS ORDERED granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Sanctions.\" Then it details the specific rulings. \n\nFor the handwritten notes, the court granted sanctions regarding those notes but not for the annotated documents. Specifically, the court says: \"The Court will grant Plaintiffs’ requested sanctions in part regarding the handwritten notes. Trial will be to the Bench. The handwritten notes, if offered by Plaintiffs, will be admitted if relevant. No witness will be required to authenticate the documents. The notes will be admitted as the contemporaneous notes of the person identified by the United States in its production as the author. The United States will not be able to offer the notes but the Court will not preclude the United States from questioning the author of any of those notes at trial about the notes.\"\n\nFor the annotated documents, the court says: \"With respect to the Annotated Documents, they will only be admitted if their relevance is shown. No authentication of the Annotated Documents will be required.\"\n\nAlso, regarding the supplemental motion for the notes by Scott Lloyd, the court denied sanctions: \"No evidentiary sanction will be ordered for these notes.\" And they denied re-opening discovery for Scott Lloyd.\n\nSo, the court rulings here are:\n1. Granted sanctions on handwritten notes (admitting them if relevant, but US can't use them).\n2. Denied sanctions on annotated documents (only admitted if relevance shown).\n3. Denied sanctions for Scott Lloyd's notes.\n4. Denied re-opening discovery for Scott Lloyd.\n\nWait, but the checklist requires each ruling to be a separate value. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst ruling: The court granted in part the Motion for Sanctions regarding the handwritten notes. Specifically, the handwritten notes will be admitted (if relevant) and the US can't use them. So the ruling is \"Granted sanctions regarding handwritten notes: admitted as contemporaneous notes, US cannot use them.\"\n\nSecond ruling: For the annotated documents, the court said they'll be admitted only if relevance is shown. So the ruling is \"Denied sanctions for annotated documents; admission contingent on relevance.\"\n\nThird: For Scott Lloyd's notes, the court denied sanctions: \"No evidentiary sanction will be ordered for these notes.\"\n\nFourth: Denied re-opening discovery for Scott Lloyd.\n\nBut the checklist says to extract each distinct ruling as a separate entry. Let's check the document again.\n\nIn the order, the key rulings are:\n- Granting sanctions in part for handwritten notes (specifically, admission of notes by Plaintiffs, US can't use them).\n- For annotated documents: \"they will only be admitted if their relevance is shown\" — so the sanction (preclusion of US use) wasn't granted, hence denied for those.\n- For Scott Lloyd's notes: \"No evidentiary sanction will be ordered\" — so denied.\n- Also, denied re-opening discovery for Scott Lloyd.\n\nWait, the Motion for Sanctions had two parts: handwritten notes and annotated documents. The court granted in part for handwritten notes, denied for annotated documents. Then the supplement was about Scott Lloyd's notes, which were denied.\n\nSo the main rulings from the order are:\n1. Granted sanctions on handwritten notes (admission for Plaintiffs, US can't use).\n2. Denied sanctions on annotated documents (admission only if relevance shown).\n3. Denied sanctions on Scott Lloyd's notes.\n4. Denied re-opening discovery for Scott Lloyd.\n\nBut the checklist says \"each ruling as a separate value\". So each of these should be a separate entry. However, the problem is whether \"denied sanctions on annotated documents\" is a ruling. The order says \"the Court will grant Plaintiffs’ requested sanctions in part regarding the handwritten notes\" and \"With respect to the Annotated Documents, they will only be admitted if their relevance is shown.\" So for annotated documents, the court didn't grant the sanction (which was preclusion of US use), so it's a denial of that part of the motion.\n\nSo the first ruling: \"Granted sanctions regarding handwritten notes: notes admitted if relevant, US cannot use them.\"\n\nSecond ruling: \"Denied sanctions regarding annotated documents: admission contingent on relevance.\"\n\nThird: \"Denied sanctions for Scott Lloyd's notes.\"\n\nFourth: \"Denied re-opening discovery to depose Scott Lloyd.\"\n\nBut wait, the Motion for Sanctions was about the handwritten notes and annotated documents. The supplement was about Scott Lloyd's notes. So the court's rulings on those are separate.\n\nNow, for each of these, I need to create a separate entry with evidence. The evidence would be the relevant text from the document.\n\nFor the first ruling (handwritten notes), the evidence is on page 3-4: \"The Court will grant Plaintiffs’ requested sanctions in part regarding the handwritten notes. Trial will be to the Bench. The handwritten notes, if offered by Plaintiffs, will be admitted if relevant. No witness will be required to authenticate the documents. The notes will be admitted as the contemporaneous notes of the person identified by the United States in its production as the author. The United States will not be able to offer the notes but the Court will not preclude the United States from questioning the author of any of those notes at trial about the notes.\"\n\nFor the annotated documents: \"With respect to the Annotated Documents, they will only be admitted if their relevance is shown. No authentication of the Annotated Documents will be required.\"\n\nFor Scott Lloyd's notes: \"No evidentiary sanction will be ordered for these notes.\"\n\nFor the re-opening discovery: \"Plaintiffs request to re-open discovery to depose Mr. Lloyd is also denied.\"\n\nSo, four distinct rulings. Each should be a separate entry under Court_Rulings.\n\nNow, the next step is to use append_checklist to add these entries. Since this is the first time extracting Court_Rulings, and the previous status was empty, I need to append these values.\n\nEach entry must have evidence with text, source document, location.\n\nSo, for each ruling:\n\n1. Value: \"Granted sanctions regarding handwritten notes: handwritten notes admitted as contemporaneous notes (if relevant), United States cannot use them; no authentication required for Plaintiffs' use.\"\n   Evidence: The quoted text from the document, source: Order (001), location: Page 3-4 (tokens 23-26, but since the document is split into pages, maybe page numbers as per the document: Page 3, lines 23-26).\n\nWait, the document shows \"Case 2:19-cv-05217-SRB Document 433 Filed 08/15/23 Page 3 of 5\" and the text starts at line 19. But the exact location can be the page number as per the document header.\n\nIn the provided text, the document has page numbers: Page 1, Page 2, etc. So for the first ruling, it's on Page 3 (the text from \"The Court will grant...\").\n\nSimilarly, the annotated documents ruling is on Page 3, lines 3-5.\n\nScott Lloyd's notes denial is on Page 4, lines 15-17.\n\nRe-opening discovery denial is on Page 4, lines 19-22.\n\nSo, each of these should have their own evidence.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"each unique value\" so each ruling is a separate value. So four entries.\n\nWait, but the Motion for Sanctions had two parts (handwritten notes and annotated documents), and the supplement added Scott Lloyd's notes. So the court's rulings are on those three aspects. But the re-opening discovery is part of the ruling on the supplement.\n\nSo the four entries.\n\nNow, the tool to use is append_checklist. Since the checklist is empty, and we're adding new entries, append_checklist is the right function.\n\nEach entry in the extracted list must have value and evidence. The evidence is an array of evidence objects, each with text, source_document, location.\n\nSo for each ruling, create an evidence entry.\n\nBut wait, the checklist item is Court_Rulings, so the key is \"Court_Rulings\".\n\nThe patch will be an array with key \"Court_Rulings\" and extracted as an array of the four entries.\n\nEach entry in extracted has a value and evidence.\n\nSo, for the first ruling:\n\nvalue: \"Granted sanctions regarding handwritten notes: handwritten notes admitted as contemporaneous notes (if relevant), United States cannot use them; no authentication required for Plaintiffs' use.\"\n\nevidence: [\n  {\n    \"text\": \"The Court will grant Plaintiffs’ requested sanctions in part regarding the handwritten notes. Trial will be to the Bench. The handwritten notes, if offered by Plaintiffs, will be admitted if relevant. No witness will be required to authenticate the documents. The notes will be admitted as the contemporaneous notes of the person identified by the United States in its production as the author. The United States will not be able to offer the notes but the Court will not preclude the United States from questioning the author of any of those notes at trial about the notes.\",\n    \"source_document\": \"Order (001)\",\n    \"location\": \"Page 3, lines 19-26\"\n  }\n]\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nBut the user's example shows that evidence is an array, but for each value, it's one evidence entry. So each extracted entry (each ruling) has one evidence object (since the text is from one location).\n\nWait, the evidence field is an array, but for each value, it's one entry. So for each ruling, the evidence array has one item.\n\nSo the append_checklist patch will have:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Court_Rulings\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"...\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"...\",\n          \"source_document\": \"Order (001)\",\n          \"location\": \"Page 3\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    ... (other entries)\n  ]\n}\n\nNow, need to make sure the values are distinct and self-contained.\n\nLet me write each value concisely.\n\n1. \"Granted sanctions on handwritten notes: notes admitted as contemporaneous notes (if relevant), United States barred from using them.\"\n2. \"Denied sanctions on annotated documents: admission contingent on relevance; no authentication required.\"\n3. \"Denied sanctions on Scott Lloyd's handwritten notes: no evidentiary sanction ordered.\"\n4. \"Denied re-opening discovery to depose Scott Lloyd.\"\n\nWait, for the annotated documents, the court didn't grant the sanction (which was to preclude the US from using them), so the ruling is denial of that part. So \"Denied sanctions for annotated documents: admission only if relevance shown.\"\n\nSimilarly, for Scott Lloyd's notes, \"Denied sanctions for Scott Lloyd's handwritten notes.\"\n\nAnd the re-opening discovery is a separate ruling.\n\nSo four entries.\n\nNow, check if the document has these. Yes, from the text provided.\n\nSo the next action is to append these four entries using append_checklist.\n\nSince the user's current state shows that Court_Rulings is empty, and we've found these values in Order (001), which is fully read, we can append them.\n\nSo the tool call should be append_checklist with the patch containing these four entries.\n\nBut wait, the function append_checklist says \"You MAY batch multiple checklist keys in ONE call by adding multiple items to patch.\" But here, it's the same key (Court_Rulings), so we can have multiple entries in the extracted array for the same key.\n\nYes, so the patch will have one key: Court_Rulings, with an array of four extracted entries.\n\nEach extracted entry has a value and evidence.\n\nNow, check if the evidence is correctly cited.\n\nFor the first ruling, the text is from Page 3, lines 19-26 (as per the document's page numbers).\n\nSimilarly, the annotated documents part is on Page 3, lines 3-5 (from \"With respect to the Annotated Documents...\").\n\nScott Lloyd's notes denial is on Page 4, lines 15-17.\n\nRe-opening discovery denial is on Page 4, lines 19-22.\n\nSo the locations can be specified as \"Page 3, lines 19-26\", \"Page 3, lines 3-5\", etc.\n\nBut since the document's page numbers are given in the header (e.g., Page 3 of 5), using \"Page 3\" is sufficient.\n\nSo, the evidence locations can be \"Page 3\", \"Page 4\", etc.\n\nNow, format the JSON for the append_checklist call.\n\nThe patch should be an array with one object (since it's one key with multiple entries).\n\nWait, no: the patch is an array of patches. Each patch is for a key. So for Court_Rulings, it's one patch with the key and the extracted array.\n\nSo the patch will have one element: {\"key\": \"Court_Rulings\", \"extracted\": [list of four entries]}.\n\nEach entry in extracted has value and evidence (array with one element).\n\nSo the JSON for the tool call would be:\n\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"Court_Rulings\",\n      \"extracted\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": \"Granted sanctions regarding handwritten notes: handwritten notes admitted as contemporaneous notes (if relevant), United States barred from using them.\",\n          \"evidence\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"The Court will grant Plaintiffs’ requested sanctions in part regarding the handwritten notes.

Let's check the exact text from the document.\n\nFor the first one, the text is:\n\n\"The Court will grant Plaintiffs’ requested sanctions in part regarding the handwritten notes. Trial will be to the Bench. The handwritten notes, if offered by Plaintiffs, will be admitted if relevant. No witness will be required to authenticate the documents. The notes will be admitted as the contemporaneous notes of the person identified by the United States in its production as the author. The United States will not be able to offer the notes but the Court will not preclude the United States from questioning the author of any of those notes at trial about the notes.\"\n\nSo the evidence text should be that exact string.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nNow, check if the value is a self-contained narrative. The value should be a short, self-contained narrative. So \"Granted sanctions regarding handwritten notes: handwritten notes admitted as contemporaneous notes (if relevant), United States barred from using them.\" This seems okay.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nNow, the next action is to call append_checklist with this patch.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"Court_Rulings\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"Granted sanctions regarding handwritten notes: handwritten notes admitted as contemporaneous notes (if relevant), United States barred from using them.\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"The Court will grant Plaintiffs’ requested sanctions in part regarding the handwritten notes.

The user is asking me to extract court rulings from legal documents, and I've already done some work on the first document (Order (001)). The current status shows that Court_Rulings has 4 values extracted from Order (001), which is fully visited. Now I need to figure out what to do next.\n\nFirst, I should check if there are other documents that might contain additional court rulings. The available documents list shows 9 other documents that are unvisited (marked with ○). Since Order (001) is fully visited, I shouldn't read it again. The next step would be to check other documents for more rulings.\n\nLooking at the checklist, the requirement is to extract every distinct value of Court_Rulings from any document. The current extraction has 4 values from one document, but there might be more in other orders or opinions. The other documents include Order (002) through (005), Order Approving Settlements, and the Joint Notice. These could contain additional rulings.\n\nI need to decide which document to read next. The most relevant ones would be the other Order documents (002-005) since they're likely to contain court rulings. Order (002) is the smallest at 553 tokens, so it's efficient to read that first. Since it's unvisited, I should use read_document on Order (002) from tokens 0-553.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows Order (002) as 553 tokens, so reading the entire document (0-553) is within the 10,000 token limit. That's safe. There's no need for regex search here because the document is small and likely contains rulings. The next logical step is to read Order (002) to check for additional court rulings.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other documents, but starting with the smallest unvisited document (Order (002)) is efficient. The other orders are larger, so processing the smallest first makes sense for token efficiency.\n\nSo the correct action here is to call read_document on Order (002) with start_token 0 and end_token 553.

But the documents listed as unvisited are Complaint, Dockets, Order (003), etc. \n\nWait, the Complaint might not have rulings; it's a complaint. Dockets might list rulings, but the user needs to check. The Order (003) and others are orders, so they might have more rulings.

So next, maybe read Order (003) starting from 0-10000 tokens to check for rulings. Since the document is 27k tokens, reading the first 10k tokens would be a start. The tool call should be read_document with doc_name \"Order (003)\", start_token 0, end_token 10000. That's within the 10k limit.\n\nWait, the user has to make sure not to read fully visited documents. Order (003) is unvisited, so it's okay. The other documents like Complaint might not have rulings, but the user should check the order documents first. So the next action is to read Order (003) from 0-10000 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (003)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (003)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7221, "completion_tokens": 612, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot, which is the \"Court_Rulings\" item. From the recent actions, they've already read Order (001), Order (002), and Order (003) partially. The current status shows that Court_Rulings has 4 values extracted from Order (001).\n\nLooking at the documents, Order (003) was read partially (tokens 0-10000), but the text provided stops at page 12 of 32. The next step is to check if there's more relevant information in Order (003) that could add to the Court_Rulings. The previous extraction from Order (001) included sanctions rulings, but Order (003) is an order on summary judgment motions. The document mentions \"Pending before the Court are Defendant United States of America’s Motion for Summary Judgment...\" and \"The Court will also consider the United States’ Motion for Summary Judgment on A.P.F. Plaintiffs’ claims...\"\n\nWait, the checklist item is about court rulings on motions, so if Order (003) has a ruling on summary judgment, that's relevant. The current extraction from Order (003) so far hasn't shown a ruling yet, but the document is about the motions being considered. The user needs to read more of Order (003) to find if there's a ruling. Since they've read up to 10,000 tokens, which is 37% of the document, maybe there's more in the remaining tokens.\n\nThe next action should be to read more of Order (003) to see if there's a ruling. The document is marked as partially visited (0-10000), so the next read should start from 10001 to the end, but since the max per call is 10,000 tokens, maybe read from 10001 to 20000. But the user needs to check if the next part contains the ruling. The previous actions show that Order (003) is a summary judgment order, so the ruling would be in the later part. So the correct action is to call read_document on Order (003) for the next token range.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (003)\", \"start_token\": 10000, \"end_token\": 20000}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (003)", "start_token": 10000, "end_token": 20000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 17992, "completion_tokens": 536, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user wants me to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot, which is \"Court_Rulings\" for this case. The task is to extract every distinct value from the legal documents.\n\nLooking at the current status, I see that \"Court_Rulings\" has 4 values already extracted from Order (001). The document catalog shows that Order (003) is partially visited (73% covered), and there are other unvisited documents like Complaint, Dockets, and other Orders. \n\nThe next step should be to check if there are more rulings in the remaining parts of Order (003) or other documents. Since Order (003) was only read up to token 20,000 out of 27,352, there's still 7,352 tokens left to cover. The previous read (tokens 10,000-20,000) was from the middle of the document, so the next logical step is to read the remaining tokens in Order (003) to see if there are more rulings.\n\nI need to make sure not to reread already visited tokens. The viewed tokens for Order (003) are 0-20000, so the next read should be from 20000 to 27352. But the maximum token range per call is 10,000, so I'll read from 20000 to 27352 (7352 tokens, which is under 10k). \n\nOther documents like Complaint or Dockets might have rulings, but since the checklist is specifically about court rulings, the Orders are the most likely place. The current extracted values are all from Order (001), so checking the remaining part of Order (003) is the most efficient next step. \n\nI should use read_document for Order (003) from token 20000 to 27352.

The user is asking me to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot, which in this case is \"Court_Rulings\". The task is to extract every distinct value from the legal documents with proper evidence.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted 4 values from Order (001). The documents listed show that Order (001), Order (002), and Order (003) are fully visited, but the others like Complaint, Docket (001), etc., are unvisited. However, the snapshot mentions that the current extraction progress shows Court_Rulings has 4 values from Order (001).\n\nWait, the recent actions include Step 4 where they read Order (002) and Step 5-7 where they read Order (003) in chunks. Let me check what's in Order (002) and Order (003) to see if there are more Court_Rulings to extract.\n\nOrder (002) is a settlement order where it says \"The Court having considered the Parties’ Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines, and good cause appearing, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Stipulation is Granted.\" So the ruling here is granting the stipulation to stay litigation deadlines. That's a court ruling. So I need to extract that.\n\nOrder (003) is a more detailed order. In the text, there's a ruling where the court denies the United States' Motions for Summary Judgment and grants parts of the Plaintiffs' motions. Specifically, the conclusion says: \"IT IS ORDERED denying the United States’ Motion for Summary Judgment on C.M. Plaintiffs’ claims... IT IS FURTHER ORDERED denying the United States’ Motion for Summary Judgment on A.P.F. Plaintiffs’ claims... IT IS FURTHER ORDERED granting in part and denying in part C.M. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment... IT IS FURTHER ORDERED granting in part and denying in part A.P.F. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment...\"\n\nSo there are multiple rulings here: denying US motions, granting in part Plaintiffs' motions. Each of these should be separate entries.\n\nWait, but the checklist says \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So for Order (002), the ruling is granting the stipulation. For Order (003), the rulings are denying US motions and granting parts of Plaintiffs' motions.\n\nSo the next step is to extract these values. Since they've already read Order (002) and Order (003), they need to append these to the checklist.\n\nThe previous step (Step 7) was reading Order (003) up to 27352 tokens, which covers the entire document. So the text from Order (003) is now available.\n\nLooking at the Order (002) text: \"IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Stipulation is Granted.\" So the ruling is granting the stipulation. Need to phrase it as a self-contained narrative: \"Granted the Parties’ Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines, vacating pretrial deadlines and trial date pending further stipulation or motion.\"\n\nFor Order (003), the key rulings are:\n\n1. Denying US Motion for Summary Judgment on C.M. Plaintiffs’ claims.\n2. Denying US Motion for Summary Judgment on A.P.F. Plaintiffs’ claims.\n3. Granting in part and denying in part C.M. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\n4. Granting in part and denying in part A.P.F. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\n\nEach of these should be a separate entry. But the user's previous extraction for Court_Rulings already had 4 values from Order (001). Now adding these from Order (002) and Order (003).\n\nWait, but the current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" with 4 values. So they need to add more values. The next action should be to append the new values from Order (002) and Order (003).\n\nSo I should use append_checklist to add the new entries. The evidence for each would be the specific text from the documents.\n\nFor Order (002), the value would be: \"Granted the Parties’ Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines, vacating pretrial deadlines and trial date pending further stipulation or motion.\"\n\nEvidence: From Order (002), Page 1-2, lines 21-24: \"IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Stipulation is Granted. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date, in this case only, and this action only is stayed pending further stipulation or motion of the Parties or Order of the Court.\"\n\nFor Order (003), the first ruling: \"Denied United States’ Motion for Summary Judgment on C.M. Plaintiffs’ claims.\"\n\nEvidence: From Order (003), Page 32, lines 26-27: \"IT IS ORDERED denying the United States’ Motion for Summary Judgment on C.M. Plaintiffs’ claims (Doc. 371, 19-cv-5217).\"\n\nSimilarly for the other rulings.\n\nWait, but the previous values from Order (001) were about sanctions, so these are different rulings. So need to append all these new entries.\n\nSo the next action is to append these values using append_checklist. Since there are multiple new values, they can be batched in one append_checklist call.\n\nThe evidence must include the text, source document, and location.\n\nSo the JSON for append_checklist should have the key Court_Rulings with the new extracted values and their evidence.\n\nCheck if the document catalog is known: yes, they've listed all documents, so no need for list_documents.\n\nNo need for search_document_regex since they've already read the documents.\n\nSo the correct action is append_checklist with the new values from Order (002) and Order (003).\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"Court_Rulings\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Granted the Parties' Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines, vacating pretrial deadlines and trial date pending further stipulation or motion.\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Stipulation is Granted.

The user is asking me to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot, specifically the Court_Rulings from the legal documents. The task is to go through the provided documents and find all the court rulings mentioned.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current status. The snapshot shows that they've already extracted 9 values for Court_Rulings from Orders (001), (002), and (003). The available documents include 10 in total, but three of them (Order 001, 002, 003) are already fully visited. The remaining documents are unvisited: Complaint, Docket (001), Docket (002), Order (004), Order (005), Order Approving Settlements, and Joint Notice.\n\nThe next step is to check if there are any more documents that might contain additional Court_Rulings. Since the current extraction has 9 values, but the checklist might have more. However, the user's prior steps have already read Orders 001-003 and appended the values. The next action should be to check if any other documents might have more rulings.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines might have the ruling mentioned in Order (002), but since Order (002) already covered that, maybe not. The Complaint and Dockets might not contain rulings, as they're pleadings or docket entries. The other Orders (004, 005, etc.) could have more rulings.\n\nBut the user's current status says all keys are filled with 9 values. Wait, the \"Keys with Values\" is 1/1, meaning Court_Rulings is the only key, and it's been filled. The \"Total Values Extracted\" is 9, which includes the 4 from Order (001), 1 from (002), and 4 from (003) as per Step 8's append_checklist.\n\nWait, the user's Step 8 says they appended 5 values, but the description says 4 from Order (001), 1 from (002), 4 from (003). Wait, 4+1+4=9, which matches the \"Total Values Extracted: 9\".\n\nThe next action: the available documents are unvisited, but the user has already read the three Orders that are relevant. The other documents (Complaint, Dockets, etc.) are less likely to contain court rulings. The Court_Rulings checklist item is about the court's decisions, so the Orders are where those rulings would be. The other documents like Complaint or Docket entries might not have the actual rulings, but maybe the Joint Notice could have a ruling, but Order (002) already covered that.\n\nWait, in Step 4, they read Order (002) and found the ruling about granting the stipulation. Step 5-7 read Order (003) and found the other rulings. So Orders 001-003 are the main ones. The other Orders (004, 005) might have more, but the user's current state shows that Orders 001-003 are fully visited, and the rest are unvisited. But the system says that the current extracted values are from those three. \n\nWait, the \"Available Documents\" list shows Order (004) and (005) as unvisited. But the user might need to check if those have additional rulings. However, the task is to extract all distinct values. If Orders 004 and 005 don't have any rulings related to Court_Rulings, then they don't need to be read. But since the system hasn't checked them yet, the next step should be to check if any of the unvisited documents might contain more rulings.\n\nBut the user's current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Total Values Extracted: 9\". The checklist item is Court_Rulings, which is already filled. However, the system might need to verify if there are more values in other documents. But according to the prior actions, the user has read Orders 001-003 and extracted all possible rulings from them. The other documents are less likely to contain rulings. For example, the Complaint is the initial filing, not a ruling. Dockets list events but not the rulings themselves. The Joint Notice is a motion, not a ruling.\n\nWait, the \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" might be another ruling. So maybe Order (004) or that specific order could have a ruling. But the user hasn't read it yet. However, the system's instructions say to stop when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Since Court_Rulings has 9 values, and the user has already appended them, but maybe there are more in the unvisited documents.\n\nWait, but the snapshot says \"Current Status\" has \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning Court_Rulings is the only key and it's filled. The \"Total Values Extracted: 9\" suggests that all values have been found. But to be thorough, the user should check if any other documents might have additional rulings.\n\nBut according to the systematic process, after reading a document, you append the values. The user has already read three documents and appended the values. The next step would be to check if there are more documents to read. But the available documents include Order (004) and (005), which are Orders, so they might have rulings. However, the user's prior steps have already processed Orders 001-003, and the current extraction has 9 values. The next logical step is to check Order (004) or (005) to see if there are more rulings.\n\nWait, but the user's Step 8 says \"Successfully appended 1 key: Court_Rulings\" with 5 values. Wait, the \"Extracted Values\" listed 5 values, but the \"Total Values Extracted\" is 9. Hmm, maybe the 5 values in Step 8 are the ones appended in that step, and the prior steps had 4 from Order (001). So total 9.\n\nNow, the user needs to determine if there are more values in other documents. The available documents include Order (004) and (005), which are Orders, so they might contain rulings. So the next action should be to read Order (004) or (005) to check for additional rulings.\n\nBut the system's decision policy says to choose one action. Since Order (004) is unvisited, the next step is to read Order (004) to check for more Court_Rulings. So the action would be read_document on Order (004) with tokens 0-10000.\n\nWait, but the user has to check if the document is fully visited. Order (004) is listed as \"○ Unvisited\", so it's unvisited. The maximum read is 10,000 tokens, so reading tokens 0-10000 of Order (004) is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can use search_document_regex to look for \"Order\" or \"IT IS ORDERED\" patterns to find rulings, but the instructions say to use read_document as the default choice. Since the document is unvisited, reading it is the next step.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document for Order (004) tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (004)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (004)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 34472, "completion_tokens": 1669, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The Dockets might have rulings listed in the docket entries\n\nHowever, the instructions say: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" And \"Create separate entries for each unique value with its supporting evidence.\"\n\nI've already extracted values from Order 001, 002, and 003. The next logical step would be to check if any of the unvisited documents contain additional Court_Rulings.\n\nBut wait - the current extraction shows 9 values, and the checklist only has one item (Court_Rulings). The status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning all keys are covered. \n\nThe extraction progress shows Court_Rulings has 9 values. But I need to verify if these are all the values. The unvisited documents might contain more.\n\nHowever, the instructions say: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either: Complete: all relevant values present... or Not Applicable.\"\n\nSince the only key is Court_Rulings and it's already fully extracted (9 values), and there's no indication that the unvisited documents would contain additional distinct values for Court_Rulings (since Court_Rulings are typically found in orders/opinions, not in complaints or dockets), I should consider if we're done.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if the unvisited documents might contain additional rulings. The Complaint document (42,744 tokens) is unvisited. But complaints typically don't contain court rulings - they contain allegations. Rulings are in orders/opinions.\n\nThe Dockets might contain rulings, but typically dockets list motions and orders, not the full text of rulings. The actual ruling text would be in the Order documents.\n\nLooking at the document types:\n- Order (001), (002), (003), (004), (005) are all \"Order/Opinion\" types - these would contain the actual rulings.\n- Complaint is a complaint\n- Dockets are docket entries\n- Order Approving Settlements is an order\n- Joint Notice is a pleading\n\nI've already read Order (001), (002), (003), (004). Order (005) is unvisited (7,151 tokens), and Order Approving Settlements (832 tokens) is unvisited.\n\nSo I should check if Order (005) or Order Approving Settlements contain additional Court_Rulings.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents.\" Order (001), (002), (003), (004) are all fully visited. Order (005) and Order Approving Settlements are unvisited.\n\nHowever, the current extraction shows 9 values, and the task is to extract \"EVERY distinct value\". I need to check if Order (005) or Order Approving Settlements contain additional rulings.\n\nBut the current status shows \"Total Values Extracted: 9\" and \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning the key is fully extracted. However, I should verify if there are more values in the unvisited documents.\n\nThe best next step would be to read Order (005) since it's an Order/Opinion document that hasn't been visited yet. It's 7,151 tokens, which is under the 10,000 token limit.\n\nAlternatively, I could check Order Approving Settlements (832 tokens), but Order (005) is more likely to contain rulings.\n\nWait - the user's Step 9 was \"read_document on Order (004) (tokens 0-5875)\" and they got some evidence. Then they did append_checklist.\n\nNow, the next logical step is to read the next unvisited Order document, which is Order (005).\n\nSo I should call read_document on Order (005) for tokens 0-7151.\n\nBut let me check the document catalog again:\n- Order (005) [Order/Opinion] - 7,151 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n\nYes, it's unvisited. So I should read it to see if it contains additional Court_Rulings.\n\nAlternatively, I could use search_document_regex to look for \"Order\" or \"denied\" or \"granted\" patterns, but since it's a specific document type (Order), reading the whole document is more efficient.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on Order (005) for tokens 0-7151.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (005)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7151}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (005)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7151}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 39948, "completion_tokens": 1218, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract all checklist items from legal documents, specifically focusing on \"Court_Rulings\" as defined in the snapshot.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current status. The snapshot shows that \"Court_Rulings\" has 9 values already extracted from Orders (001), (002), and (003). The current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Total Values Extracted: 9\". \n\nLooking at the available documents, all the Orders (001-005) are fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), meaning we've already read all their content. The remaining documents are unvisited: Complaint, Docket (001), Docket (002), Order Approving Settlements, and Joint Notice.\n\nBut wait - the checklist item is \"Court_Rulings\", which refers to the court's decisions. The Orders (001-005) are court orders, so they should contain the rulings. Since we've already read all Orders (001-005) and extracted 9 values from them, the remaining unvisited documents (Complaint, Doct, etc.) are probably not relevant for court rulings. Complaints are filed by plaintiffs, not court rulings. Doctets are just lists of filings, not the actual rulings.\n\nLet me verify the extracted values:\n- Order (001): 4 values (from Step 3)\n- Order (002): 1 value (from Step 8)\n- Order (003): 4 values (from Step 8)\n\nThat's 9 total, which matches the snapshot. The Orders (004) and (005) are also fully visited, but the extraction history shows they were read in Steps 9-10, and no new Court_Rulings were added after Step 8. So the 9 values are complete.\n\nThe current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 9\" and \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning all required checklist items are filled. There are no empty keys or Not Applicable entries needed.\n\nI should check if there's any possibility of missing values. The Orders (004) and (005) were read but didn't yield new Court_Rulings. The Complaint and Doctets don't contain court rulings (they're just the initial filings or docket entries), so they're irrelevant for this checklist.\n\nThe extraction process is complete. Since all checklist items are fully extracted (only one item, and it's done), I should stop.\n\nThe stop criteria are met: every key is either complete or Not Applicable. Here, \"Court_Rulings\" is complete with 9 values.\n\nNo need for further actions like get_checklist or append_checklist.
