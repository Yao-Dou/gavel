Here, the catalog is unknown because there are zero documents listed. So the correct action is to use `list_documents` to get the list of documents before proceeding. There's no point in trying to read or search if there are no documents to read from. \n\nI should make sure not to skip this step. The user mentioned \"No documents discovered yet,\" so listing them is necessary.

The available documents include Complaint, Dockets, Orders, and a Settlement Order. Since the decree duration would likely be in an Order or Opinion document, the Orders (Order 001 to 005 and the Settlement Order) are the top candidates. The Complaint and Dockets might have some info, but Orders are more likely to have the actual decree terms.\n\nThe current status shows all keys are empty, so I need to start reading documents. The user mentioned \"Order (001)\" is 2,206 tokens, which is under 10k, so I can read the whole thing. Let me pick Order (001) first because it's the smallest and might be a good starting point. If it doesn't have the info, I can move to others. But since the task is to extract all values, I should check the most likely documents first.\n\nWait, the Decision Policy says to choose a specific document likely to contain the target value. Orders are where decrees are usually specified, so Order (001) is a good candidate. I'll use read_document on Order (001) from start to end. No need for regex yet since the document is small enough to read entirely.\n\nI should make sure not to skip any documents that might have the info. But since the user said to pick one action per turn, I'll start with Order (001).

The snapshot shows that the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" key is empty, and all documents except Order (001) are unvisited. But Order (001) is already fully visited (✓ Fully Visited) with tokens 0-2206. The user provided the content of Order (001) in the recent actions. \n\nLooking at the Order (001) text, it's a court order about sanctions related to family separation. The key part here is the sanctions granted. The court says, \"The Court will grant Plaintiffs’ requested sanctions in part regarding the handwritten notes. Trial will be to the Bench. The handwritten notes, if offered by Plaintiffs, will be admitted if relevant. No witness will be required to authenticate the documents. The notes will be admitted as the contemporaneous notes of the person identified by the United States in its production as the author. The United States will not be able to offer the notes but the Court will not preclude the United States from questioning the author of any of those notes at trial about the notes.\"\n\nWait, but where's the decree duration? The user is looking for how long the decree lasts. The order doesn't mention a duration. It's about sanctions for late production, not a decree with a duration. The order says \"Trial will be to the Bench\" and talks about admission of documents, but no specific time period for the decree.\n\nThe checklist item is about the duration of decree obligations, like injunctions or consent decrees. This order doesn't seem to be a decree with a duration; it's a sanctions order. So maybe there's no value here. But I need to check if any other documents might have it.\n\nThe available documents include other orders and the Joint Notice of Settlement. The Order (002) to (005) and the Order Approving Settlements might have relevant info. The Joint Notice mentions a settlement, which might include a decree duration.\n\nBut the current state shows Order (001) is fully visited, and others are unvisited. Since the user's task is to extract the decree duration, and Order (001) doesn't have it, I should check other documents. The next step is to read another document. Which one? The Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims (832 tokens) might have a decree duration. It's a short document, so reading it would be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, use search_document_regex to look for terms like \"decree\", \"duration\", \"injunction\", etc. But the user's example in the tools shows that regex is good for patternable items. Let's think: the key phrase might be \"for a period of\" or \"until\" followed by a time. But since the user wants exact extraction, maybe searching for \"decree\" or \"duration\" could help.\n\nWait, the checklist says \"Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\" So the value should be something like \"permanent\", \"5 years\", etc. The Order (001) didn't have it, so need to check other documents.\n\nLooking at the document list, the Order Approving Settlements might have the duration. Let's check if that's the next logical step. The user should read that document. The document is 832 tokens, so reading the whole thing is feasible. Since it's unvisited, use read_document on Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims.\n\nWait, but the user's recent action was reading Order (001), which is done. Now, the next step is to read another document. The Order Approving Settlements is a good candidate because it's about approving settlements, which might include decree terms. So the correct action is to call read_document on that specific document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 832}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 832}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 6084, "completion_tokens": 882, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The task is to extract the decree duration from the legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", which requires the duration of decree obligations ordered by the court, formatted as '[duration]: [decree obligation]'.\n\nFirst, I need to check the documents that have been read so far. The user provided two documents that were fully visited: Order (001) and Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims. Let me look through those again.\n\nIn Order (001), the court granted sanctions but didn't mention any decree duration. It talks about admitting notes and not precluding the US from questioning witnesses. No mention of a duration for a decree.\n\nThen, the Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims. This order approves settlements and mentions that the minors' portions will be placed into pooled trusts operated by Legacy Enhancement until they reach age 18, 21, or 25. So the decree here is about the trusts lasting until those ages. The duration would be \"until age 18, 21, or 25\" for each minor. But the checklist says to extract each duration as a separate value. Wait, the order says \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\" So the decree duration is until those ages. So the value would be \"until age 18, 21, or 25\" but formatted as [duration]: [obligation]. The obligation here is the trusts being maintained until those ages.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"Extract each duration as a separate value, formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation].'\" So the duration part is the time period, and the decree obligation is the specific order. In this case, the duration is \"until age 18, 21, or 25\" and the obligation is the placement into trusts. But the exact phrasing in the document says \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\" So the duration is \"until age 18, 21, or 25\" and the decree obligation is the trust setup.\n\nWait, the checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", so the duration. The document states the trusts will be operated until those ages, so the duration of the decree (the obligation) is until those ages. So the value to extract is \"until age 18, 21, or 25\" as the duration.\n\nBut the problem is, the user's instruction says to extract \"each duration as a separate value\". Here, it's one duration mentioned, but with multiple ages. However, the order says \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\" So it's a single duration phrase, not separate durations. So the extracted value should be \"until age 18, 21, or 25\" as the duration.\n\nWait, but the checklist says \"each duration as a separate value\". If the document mentions multiple durations, you list each. But here, it's one duration phrase. So it's one value.\n\nLooking at the document, in the Order Approving Settlements, item 11 says: \"The Court approves placement of B.M., B.G., L.A., and G.A.’s portions of the Settlements into pooled minors’ trusts operated by Legacy Enhancement until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\"\n\nSo the decree (the trust operation) will last until those ages. Therefore, the duration is \"until age 18, 21, or 25\".\n\nNow, the evidence needs to include the verbatim text, source document, and location. The text is from Page 2, lines 10-11: \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\"\n\nSo the extracted value should be \"until age 18, 21, or 25\", with evidence as the quoted text, source document \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\", location \"Page 2, lines 10-11\" (or tokens 0-832, but the document is fully visited, so maybe the page number is sufficient).\n\nSince the user has already read both documents, and the Order Approving Settlements has this information, the next step is to append this value to the checklist.\n\nThe checklist key is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and the extracted value is \"until age 18, 21, or 25\". The evidence should be the text snippet.\n\nSo the action should be append_checklist with the key and the extracted value. Since it's the first value for this key, append it.\n\nCheck the tools: append_checklist is for adding new entries. The parameters need a patch with key and extracted array of entries.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"append_checklist\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"patch\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\",\n        \"extracted\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"until age 18, 21, or 25\",\n            \"evidence\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\",\n                \"source_document\": \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\",\n                \"location\": \"Page 2, lines 10-11\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nWait, the location can be \"Page 2\" as per the document's page number. The document says Page 2 of 2, so location is Page 2.\n\nAlso, check if there are any other documents that might have more values. But the user has only read two documents, and the other eight are unvisited. However, the current task is to extract all values, so if this is the only one found, then this is the value. But since the user is supposed to check all documents, but the next action should be to append the value found.\n\nWait, the recent actions show that Steps 1-3 were list_documents, read Order (001), read Order Approving Settlements. Now, after reading those, the assistant should process the text and append the found value.\n\nIn the Order Approving Settlements, the relevant part is in the document, so the next action is to append the value.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is append_checklist with the extracted value from that document.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"append_checklist\", \"arguments\": {\"patch\": [{\"key\": \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", \"extracted\": [{\"value\": \"until age 18, 21, or 25\", \"evidence\": [{\"text\": \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\", \"source_document\": \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\", \"location\": \"Page 2\"}]}]}]}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "append_checklist", "args": {"patch": [{"key": "How_Long_Decrees_will_Last", "extracted": [{"value": "until age 18, 21, or 25", "evidence": [{"text": "until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.", "source_document": "Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims", "location": "Page 2"}]}]}]}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 7121, "completion_tokens": 1509, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking to extract the decree duration from legal documents, specifically the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" checklist item. So far, they've already processed two documents: Order (001) and Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims. The Order Approving Settlements document had a line that says \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\" That's the only value they've found so far.\n\nNow, checking the current status: all other documents are unvisited (marked with ○ Unvisited). The checklist has one key, and it's already got one value. But wait, the user needs to make sure there are no other values in the remaining documents. The next step should be to check the other documents to see if there's more info on decree durations.\n\nLooking at the available documents: Complaint, Docket (001), Docket (002), Order (002), Order (003), Order (004), Order (005), and the Joint Notice. The Complaint might have some details, but usually, complaints don't specify decree durations—they're more about the claims. Dockets might have case summaries, but the decree duration would likely be in an order. The other Orders (002-005) are probably related to the case and might contain the decree duration. The Joint Notice mentions a settlement, so maybe it has more info.\n\nThe user needs to check if any of these documents have the decree duration. The next logical step is to read another document that's likely to contain the information. Since the previous value came from an order approving settlements, maybe Order (002) or Order (003) would have similar info. But which one to pick first?\n\nThe document catalog shows Order (002) is 553 tokens, which is small, so it's a good candidate to read next. Alternatively, maybe the Joint Notice, but it's a pleading, so maybe less likely. The Dockets are large, but maybe the key info is in the orders. Let's pick Order (002) because it's a small document and likely to contain a decree.\n\nWait, the current checklist has only one value. The user needs to check all documents to ensure no other decree durations exist. The system says to read targeted windows, so reading Order (002) from 0-553 tokens makes sense.

The only value found so far is \"until age 18, 21, or 25\" from the Settlement Order.\n\nLooking at the current status, all three documents they've checked are fully visited. The next step is to check the remaining documents. The available documents include Complaint, Docket (001), Docket (002), Order (003), Order (004), Order (005), and the Joint Notice. \n\nThe checklist item is about the duration of court-ordered decrees, not settlements. The Settlement Order mentions \"pooled minors’ trusts operated by Legacy Enhancement until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\" But wait, the requirement says to include only court-ordered decrees, not negotiated settlements. Wait, the Settlement Order is a court order approving the settlement, so maybe the duration is part of the decree. But the user's note says \"for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction, as opposed to a negotiated agreement.\" So the settlement approval might be considered a decree here. But the example they extracted is from that document, so that's probably acceptable.\n\nBut the user might need to check other documents for more entries. The remaining documents include Orders (003-005), which are likely to have court orders. The Dockets and Complaint might not have the specific decree duration. The Joint Notice mentions a stay and status reports, but not the duration of the decree itself.\n\nSince the current extracted value is from the Settlement Order, the next logical step is to check the other Orders (003-005) because they might contain similar or additional decree durations. The user should read Order (003) next, as it's the next in line and has a high token count but unvisited. The other documents like Complaint and Dockets might not have the specific decree duration info, so focusing on the Orders makes sense.\n\nWait, the available documents list Order (003) as unvisited with 27k tokens. The user should read a portion of it. But since the token count is high, they need to read a targeted window. However, the user can't read the whole document in one go (max 10k tokens), so they should read the first 10k tokens. But the document might have the relevant info in the beginning. Alternatively, maybe search for keywords like \"until\" or \"duration\" using search_document_regex. But the user's instructions say to use read_document as default, especially if the target is clear. The checklist item is about decree duration, so looking for phrases like \"until [age]\" or \"duration of\" in the Orders.\n\nBut the user has already processed two Orders and found the value in the Settlement Order. The other Orders might not have the same info. However, to be thorough, they should check the remaining Orders. The next step would be to read Order (003) from tokens 0-10000. But since the document is 27k tokens, reading 0-10k is a safe start. If the relevant text is in the first part, that's where it'll be. If not, they can read the next segment.\n\nAlternatively, using search_document_regex with a pattern like \"until\\s+\\d{1,2}(?:,\\s+\\d{1,2})*\" to find age ranges. But the user's instructions say to use read_document as default unless the target is clearly patternable. The pattern here is specific (age ranges), so maybe search_document_regex is better. But the user has to be cautious with regex. The example they have is \"until age 18, 21, or 25\", so a regex pattern like \"until\\s+age\\s+\\d{1,2}(?:,\\s+\\d{1,2})*\" could work.\n\nBut the user's previous steps used read_document, and the current step is to choose between actions. Since the user has already extracted one value and needs to check other documents, the best action is to read Order (003) because it's a document that might contain the decree duration. The other Orders (004, 005) are also candidates, but starting with Order (003) makes sense.\n\nWait, the available documents list Order (003) as unvisited. The user should read a window of it. The token count is 27,352, so reading 0-10,000 tokens first. So the next action should be read_document on Order (003) from 0 to 10000.\n\nBut the user has to make sure they're not re-reading.

The user is asking me to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", which requires extracting the duration of court-ordered decrees, like injunctions or consent decrees, not just negotiated agreements.\n\nSo far, from the provided steps, they've already extracted one value from \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" where it says \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\" That's the only value so far.\n\nLooking at the current status: 1 key with 1 value, others empty.

But the document is 27,352 tokens, so there's still 17,352 tokens left. But the user has to avoid rereading already viewed tokens. The next step should be to check if there's more relevant info in Order (003) that they haven't read yet. The previous read was up to token 10000, so maybe the decree duration is in the unviewed part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they should use search_document_regex to look for phrases like \"duration\", \"decree\", \"until age\", etc., to find other instances. But the user has a specific item to extract, so maybe checking the remaining tokens in Order (003) is better since they're already reading that document.\n\nWait, the user's last action was reading Order (003) up to 10000 tokens. The next step should be to read more tokens in Order (003) if there's more content that might contain the decree duration.

But the max per read is 10,000 tokens, so 10001-20000 would be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the decree duration is in another document.

But maybe it's in the unviewed part. The user needs to continue reading Order (003) to check for more mentions.\n\nSo the next action should be to read the next token range in Order (003), starting from 10001 to 20000 (since 10000 is the end of the previous read, and max 10k per call). That way, they can check the remaining parts of the document for other decree durations.\n\nWait, the document is 27,352 tokens. The first read was 0-10000, so next would be 10001-20000. Then if needed, 20001-27352. But since the user can only read up to 10k at a time, the next step is to read 10001-20000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for \"decree\" or \"duration\" to find specific parts. But the user's instruction says to use search_document_regex when the target is patternable. Since the exact phrase might be \"until age X\", maybe a regex like \"until they reach the age of (\\d+)\" could help. But the user has to be precise. However, the previous extraction used \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25\", so maybe the regex would be looking for similar phrases.\n\nBut the problem is that the user already has one value, and needs to check if there are more. Since Order (003) is the most likely to have more info (as it's an order document), and they haven't read all of it, the best next step is to read more of Order (003).\n\nSo the correct action is to call read_document on Order (003) with start_token 10001 and end_token 20001 (since it's exclusive). Wait, tokens 0-10000 was read, so next is 10001 to 20000 (since 20000-10001=10000 tokens). But the parameters need start_token inclusive and end_token exclusive. So start=10001, end=20001 would be 10000 tokens (20001-10001=10000). Wait, 10001 to 20000 inclusive would be 10000 tokens (20000 - 10001 +1 = 10000). But the end_token is exclusive, so end=20001 would cover up to 20000. So start=10001, end=20001.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the next action should be read_document on Order (003) with those tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (003)\", \"start_token\": 10001, \"end_token\": 20001}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (003)", "start_token": 10001, "end_token": 20001}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 18777, "completion_tokens": 1314, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is working on extracting the decree duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", and they need to find every distinct value.\n\nFrom the recent actions, they've already extracted one value from \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" where it says \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\" So that's one entry.\n\nNow, looking at the current status: they have 1 key with 1 value, and the rest are empty or not applicable. But the document catalog shows that \"Order (003)\" is partially visited (73% coverage), and they've read up to token 20001. The next step is to check if there's more relevant info in the remaining tokens of Order (003).\n\nThe user's last action was reading tokens 10001-20001 of Order (003). The next logical step is to read the next chunk of tokens in Order (003) to see if there's more information about decree durations. Since the document is partially visited, they should read unvisited tokens. The current viewed tokens are 0-20001, so the next range could be 20001-30001, but the max is 10,000 tokens. So tokens 20001-30001 would be the next 10,000 tokens.\n\nWait, the document's total tokens are 27,352. So 20001 to 27352 would be about 7351 tokens, which is under 10,000. So reading from 20001 to 27352 is safe. But the tool allows up to 10,000 tokens. So the next read_document call should be on Order (003) from 20001 to 27352.\n\nThey need to make sure they don't read beyond the document's token count. The document has 27,352 tokens, so end_token should be 27352. But the previous read was up to 20001, so next start is 20001, end is 27352.\n\nThe other documents like Complaint, Docket, etc., are unvisited, but the checklist is about decree durations, which are likely in orders or opinions, not in complaints or dockets. So focusing on Order (003) makes sense because it's the most relevant and partially read.\n\nThey shouldn't use search_document_regex yet because the value they're looking for is specific to decree durations, and the previous read didn't find more. But since the document is partially read, reading the next token range is the most efficient step.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on Order (003) from 20001 to 27352.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (003)\", \"start_token\": 20001, \"end_token\": 27352}}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (003)", "start_token": 20001, "end_token": 27352}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 26986, "completion_tokens": 697, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs me to extract the \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" value from legal documents. From the snapshot, I see that the checklist item is defined as the duration of decree obligations in formal court orders like injunctions or consent decrees.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted one value from \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" - \"until age 18, 21, or 25\". But I need to check if there are more values in other documents.\n\nThe available documents show that \"Order (001)\", \"Order (002)\", and \"Order (003)\" are fully visited, but they haven't been read for this specific checklist item. Wait, no - the snapshot says they've read Order (001) tokens 0-2206, Order (002) 0-553, and Order (003) 0-27352. But the evidence shows that in Order (003), there's a lot of text about family separations and reunifications, but not explicitly about decree durations.\n\nWait, the checklist item specifically says \"only include obligations ordered by the court\" and \"formatted as: '[duration]: [decree obligation]'\". The existing extraction is from a settlement approval order, which is a decree. But I need to check if other orders contain similar duration terms.\n\nLooking at the text from Order (003), I see mentions of \"reunited on July 26, 2018\" or \"reunited on September 13, 2018\" - but these are specific dates, not durations. The decree itself doesn't state a duration like \"until age 18\"; it's about the timeline of reunification. The existing extraction is from the settlement order, which says \"until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25\" - that's the only explicit duration I've found so far.\n\nThe other documents like \"Complaint\", \"Docket\", \"Order (004)\", etc., are unvisited. But the user has already read three orders, and none of them seem to contain additional decree durations. The Order (003) text is about the court's reasoning, not a decree with a duration.\n\nWait, the \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" is the only one that mentions a duration. The other orders are about motions, not settlements. So maybe there's only one value.\n\nBut I should verify if there are any other mentions in the unvisited documents. However, the instructions say not to reread visited documents, and the unvisited ones haven't been read yet. But since the user's previous steps have already read all the orders (001-003), and the settlement order, and the only duration found is in the settlement order, maybe that's the only one.\n\nWait, the \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" is a separate document that's already fully visited (viewed tokens 0-832). And the extraction from it is already done via append_checklist in Step 4.\n\nThe current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning they've extracted one value. The user's next step should be to check if there are more values in unvisited documents. But the unvisited documents are \"Complaint\", \"Docket (001)\", \"Docket (002)\", \"Order (004)\", \"Order (005)\", \"Joint Notice...\".\n\nThe checklist item is about decree durations. The Complaint and Dockets probably won't have court-ordered decrees; they're pleadings and docket entries. The other Orders (004, 005) might contain decrees, but the user hasn't read them yet.\n\nBut the user's prior actions have already read Orders 001-003, and the settlement order. The remaining orders (004, 005) are unvisited. However, the user should check if those contain relevant text.\n\nBut the instructions say to avoid redundant reads. Since the user hasn't read Orders 004 and 005, they should read those to check for decree durations.\n\nWait, the snapshot says \"Order (003)\" is fully visited (tokens 0-27352), but the text provided shows it's a court order about motions, not a decree with a duration. The \"Order Approving Settlements\" is separate and already read.\n\nThe only decree duration found is in the settlement order. The user's next step should be to read the unvisited orders (004 and 005) to see if they have any decree durations. But the user can only read one document at a time. Since the user needs to extract all values, they should read Order (004) next.\n\nWait, but the user's current status says \"Documents in Corpus: 10\" and the available documents list Order (004) and (005) as unvisited. The most logical next step is to read Order (004) to check for any decree durations.\n\nBut looking at the text from Order (003), there's no mention of a decree duration. The settlement order is the only one with \"until age 18, 21, or 25\". So maybe there's only one value. However, to be thorough, the user should check the remaining unvisited orders.\n\nThe user has to choose one action. The correct action is to read Order (004) because it's unvisited and might contain the decree duration. But the user could also use search_document_regex to look for terms like \"until\" or \"duration\" across all unvisited documents. However, the instructions say to prefer read_document for targeted reads, and search_document_regex for patternable terms.\n\nBut the user's previous actions have been reading documents, so they should continue with read_document on the next unvisited document. Order (004) is the next in line, so read_document on Order (004) with tokens 0-10000 (since it's 5,875 tokens, so 0-5875).\n\nWait, the document says Order (004) has 5,875 tokens, so reading 0-5875 would cover it. But the user can read up to 10,000 tokens, so it's safe.\n\nSo the next action should be read_document on Order (004) tokens 0-5875.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"read_document\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"doc_name\": \"Order (004)\",\n    \"start_token\": 0,\n    \"end_token\": 5875\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (004)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 5875}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 33981, "completion_tokens": 1461, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" item is specifically asking for the duration of decree obligations for formal court orders or judgments (like injunctions, consent decrees, or stipulated judgments/injunctions), not for negotiated agreements between parties.\n\nLet me check the documents that have been read to see if they contain any relevant information about decree durations:\n\n1. Order (001) - fully visited (2,206 tokens)\n2. Order (002) - fully visited (553 tokens)\n3. Order (003) - fully visited (27,352 tokens)\n4. Order (004) - fully visited (5,875 tokens)\n5.

The remaining documents that haven't been fully visited are:\n- Complaint\n- Docket (001)\n- Docket (002)\n- Order (005)\n- Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines\n\nHowever, based on the task description, I need to be careful about what qualifies as a \"decree\" or \"judgment\" for this item. The task specifies that we should only include \"obligations that are ordered by the court\" and not negotiated agreements.\n\nLet me analyze the documents that have been read to see if they contain any decree duration information:\n\n1. Order (001) - Not specified in the provided text, but it was read in Step 2.\n\n2. Order (002) - From the provided text, this is a \"Order\" that \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date, in this case only, and this action only is stayed pending further stipulation or motion of the Parties or Order of the Court.\" It also states \"the Parties shall provide a joint status report every 60 days to keep the Court appraised of the progress of the pending settlement.\" This is not a decree or judgment with a duration, but rather a stay of proceedings with a reporting requirement. This does not seem to qualify as a decree with a duration obligation.\n\n3. Order (003) - This is a lengthy order that discusses the case background, legal standards, and analysis. I don't see any specific decree duration mentioned. It's a summary judgment order that discusses the legal arguments, not a decree with a specific duration.\n\n4. Order (004) - This is a \"Order\" denying the United States' Motion to Dismiss. It's a court order but doesn't specify a decree duration.\n\n5. Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims - This is the document from which the one value was already extracted for \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\". It's likely the document that contains the specific decree duration information.\n\nNow, I need to check if the remaining unvisited documents might contain additional decree duration information:\n\n- Complaint - This is a complaint filed by plaintiffs. It's unlikely to contain a decree duration, as a complaint is the initial filing that starts a lawsuit, not a court order with a duration.\n- Docket (001) & Docket (002) - These are docket entries that track the case progress. They might contain some information about court orders, but they are not the actual court orders themselves.\n- Order (005) - This is an order, but it's unvisited. It might contain a decree with a duration.\n- Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines - This is a notice and stipulation, not a court order. The task specifies that we should not include \"negotiated agreements between parties\" but only \"obligations that are ordered by the court.\"\n\nGiven the information I have, I need to check if there are any other documents that might contain a decree with a duration. The most likely candidate is Order (005), as it's an order (not a stipulation or settlement) and it's unvisited.\n\nHowever, the task is very specific: \"Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\" So I need to make sure I've read all documents that might contain a decree duration.\n\nLet me check the provided text for Order (005) - but it's not provided. Since it's unvisited, I should read it to check if it contains any decree duration information.\n\nBased on the decision policy, I should read a targeted document if it's likely to contain the target value. Since Order (005) is an order (not a settlement or stipulation), it's a good candidate to read to see if it contains a decree duration.\n\nSo my next action should be to read Order (005) to see if it contains any decree duration information.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. The task specifies that we should only include \"obligations that are ordered by the court\" and not \"negotiated agreements between parties.\" The Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines is a negotiated agreement, so I shouldn't include it.\n\nOrder (005) is an order, so it's more likely to contain a court-ordered decree with a duration.\n\nSo, I should call `read_document` on Order (005) with the full token range (0-7151) to see if it contains any decree duration information.\n\nLet's check the document catalog:\n- **Order (005)** [Order/Opinion] - 7,151 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n\nSince it's unvisited, I should read it to see if it contains any decree duration information.\n\nSo, the next action is to call `read_document` on Order (005) with tokens 0-7151.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (005)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 7151}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (005)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7151}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 40067, "completion_tokens": 1512, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The remaining documents (Complaint, Docket 001, Docket 002, Joint Notice) are unvisited.\n\nBut I need to consider if these unvisited documents are likely to contain the decree duration information. The \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" item specifically asks for \"the duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction, as opposed to a negotiated agreement between parties.\"\n\nFrom the documents that have been read, I see:\n- The \"Order (003)\" document appears to be a court order that might contain decree durations\n- The \"Order (004)\" and \"Order (005)\" documents also appear to be court orders\n\nThe document \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims\" was already read and the value was extracted from it. The other Order documents (001-005) were all read in the recent actions (Steps 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).\n\nLet's look at the most recent document read: \"Order (003)\" (tokens 20001-27352). I need to check if this document contains any decree duration information.\n\nFrom the text of \"Order (003)\" (tokens 20001-27352), I see that it's a court order that discusses the case and the parties' claims, but I don't see specific decree durations mentioned. The order mentions \"reunite Plaintiffs within the 30 days required by the court's order in Ms. L.\" (from the text: \"All children Plaintiffs except for L.A. and A.D. were reunited their parents within the 30 days required by the court's order in Ms. L.\"). This might be relevant, but it's not explicitly stating a decree duration.\n\nLet me check the other recently read documents:\n\n- \"Order (004)\" and \"Order (005)\" are also court orders, but they appear to be related to the same case and don't seem to contain specific decree durations.\n\nSince all the Order documents have been fully read and no additional decree durations were found, and the only value was extracted from \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims\", I should verify if there are any other documents that might contain decree durations.\n\nHowever, the task specifically asks for \"the duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction, as opposed to a negotiated agreement between parties.\"\n\nI need to check if the \"Complaint\" or \"Docket\" documents might contain decree durations. But typically, complaints and dockets don't contain the decree duration - they would be in the court order documents.\n\nGiven that:\n1. The only value was extracted from \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims\"\n2. All the Order documents (001-005) have been fully read and don't appear to contain additional decree durations\n3.

The snapshot says the checklist has 1 key filled with 1 value. The filled key is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\" with 1 value. The document catalog shows that most documents are fully visited (✓ Fully Visited), but there are three unvisited documents: Complaint, Docket (001), and Docket (002).

The next step should be to check if there's any other document that might contain decree duration. But the unvisited documents (Complaint, Docket 001, 002) are unlikely to contain decree durations. Court orders (like the Orders listed) are more likely to have such details.\n\nLooking at the documents that were fully visited, the Order (004) and (005) are from the same case. The Order (004) is a 2020 WL 1698191, which is a court order denying a motion to dismiss. The Order (005) is a 2020 WL 5232560, which is about certification for interlocutory appeal. Neither of these seem to have decree durations mentioned. The Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims (Step 3) is where the value was found, so that's probably the only one.\n\nBut wait, the Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement (Step 12) might have something. It's a notice about settlement and staying litigation deadlines. The text says \"the Parties have reached conditional settlements\" and \"subject to finalizing written settlement agreements\". But it doesn't mention a decree duration. The decree duration would be part of the settlement terms, but the notice is about staying deadlines, not the decree itself. So probably no new value there.\n\nThe user's checklist item specifies \"the duration of decree obligations, for any formal court order or judgment such as an injunction, consent decree, or stipulated judgment/injunction\". The Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims would contain the decree duration from the settlement. The prior append_checklist added that value, so maybe that's the only one.\n\nWait, the user's task is to extract EVERY distinct value. If the Order Approving Settlements has the decree duration, and that's the only document with it, then the checklist should have that one value. But the current status shows 1 value, so maybe that's it. However, the system says \"if you have confirmed text for one or more keys, use append_checklist or update_checklist\".\n\nBut the next step is to check if there's more. Since all documents are fully visited except the unvisited ones which are unlikely to contain the info, and the checklist has 1 value, perhaps the extraction is complete. But the user should verify.\n\nWait, the prior actions: Step 4 appended the value from Order Approving Settlements. Now, after reading all other documents (which are fully visited), there's no new info. The get_checklist (Step 11) shows 1/1 filled. So the next logical step is to stop, since all keys are filled.\n\nBut wait, the instructions say: \"Stop only when every checklist key is either complete or Not Applicable.\" Here, the key is complete with 1 value, so stop.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any other mention of decree duration in the fully visited documents. For example, in Order (003), the text provided in Step 8 has sections about reunification, but no specific decree duration. The Order (004) and (005) are about jurisdiction and certification, not decree duration. The Joint Notice is about settlement but not the decree terms.\n\nSo the only value is the one already appended. Therefore, the next action should be to stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All applicable checklist items are fully extracted (1 value for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last found in Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims).

The user is asking me to extract the decree duration from legal documents. The checklist item is \"How_Long_Decrees_will_Last\", which requires extracting the duration of court-ordered decrees, formatted as '[duration]: [decree obligation]'.\n\nLooking at the current status: The system has already found one value for this key in \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims\". The prior steps show that Step 4 appended that value. Now, after reading all the other documents (Orders 001-005, Joint Notice, etc.), the checklist status shows 1 value filled, 0 empty.\n\nThe available documents include \"Complaint\", \"Docket (001)\", and \"Docket (002)\" which are unvisited. But the user's task is to extract decree duration, which typically appears in court orders, not in complaints or dockets. Complaints are initial filings, and dockets are case summaries—they rarely contain specific decree durations. The existing value was found in an order approving settlements, which makes sense.\n\nThe system's latest check (Step 14) confirms all documents have been fully visited except three unvisited ones. But based on document types, it's unlikely those unvisited documents contain decree duration details. The \"Order Approving Settlements\" is the relevant document type, and it's already fully read.\n\nThe user's step 13 called `stop` but the system auto-generated a `get_checklist` showing 1 value. Now, the assistant needs to decide: stop again or continue.\n\nAccording to the Stop Criteria: Stop only when all keys are filled or set to Not Applicable. Here, there's one key, and it's filled with one value. The prior steps confirmed no other values were found in all visited documents. The unvisited documents (Complaint, Dockets) are not the right places for decree duration. So, no need to read them—they won't contain the required info.\n\nThe evidence for the existing value is already in the \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims\" (Step 4). The system's checklist shows it's already extracted. No other values were found in all other documents, including the newly read Order (005) and Joint Notice.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to stop. The checklist is complete with one value, and further document reads won't yield additional decree durations. The \"Not Applicable\" isn't needed since the item is filled.\n\nSo, the JSON should be {\"decision\": \"stop\", \"reason\": \"All applicable checklist items are fully extracted (1 value for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last found in Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims). Unvisited documents are unlikely to contain decree duration details.\"}\n\nWait, the user's step 13 already tried to stop, but the system required a second stop attempt. Now, it's the second chance. The reason should be concise, referencing the filled key and why no more values exist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All applicable checklist items are fully extracted (1 value for How_Long_Decrees_will_Last found in Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims).
