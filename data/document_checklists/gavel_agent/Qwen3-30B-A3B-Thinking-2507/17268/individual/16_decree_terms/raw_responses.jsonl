The checklist item is empty, and all keys are empty. The system says to choose one action based on the current state.\n\nLooking at the decision policy: if the document catalog is unknown, call list_documents. Since there are no documents listed, the catalog is unknown. The user hasn't provided any documents, so the first step should be to list all available documents.\n\nThe available actions include list_documents, which is the correct first step here.

The user needs to extract the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents.

The Order documents (Order 001 to 005 and the Order Approving Settlements) are probably the best places. The Complaint and Docket entries might have some info, but the actual decrees would be in the Orders.\n\nThe current status shows all 10 documents are unvisited. The user has already done a list_documents, so the catalog is known. The next step should be to read a document that's most relevant. The Order documents are the most likely candidates. Let's pick the smallest one first to start, maybe Order (002) which is 553 tokens. Since it's small, reading the whole thing should be efficient.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the Order (002) is 553 tokens, which is under 10k, so reading the entire document is possible. But maybe the actual decree terms are in a specific part. However, since the document is small, reading the whole thing makes sense. Let's go with read_document for Order (002) with start_token 0 and end_token 553.\n\nI should make sure not to read any other documents yet. The goal is to extract all terms, so starting with the most relevant documents first. The Order (002) is an Order/Opinion, so it's likely to have the decree terms. Let's read that one first.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (002)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 553}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (002)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 553}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 3468, "completion_tokens": 406, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user needs to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from legal documents, specifically looking for court-ordered terms in decrees or stipulated judgments. The snapshot shows they've already read Order (002) from tokens 0-553, but that document only mentions a stay of proceedings and joint status reports—no substantive decree terms. \n\nHmm, the key here is understanding what counts as a \"significant term.\" The checklist definition says to include consent decrees/stipulated judgments (since they're court orders), but exclude terms only in settlement agreements unless incorporated into the court order. The Order (002) they read is a stay order, not a decree with substantive terms. So that document doesn't help for this checklist item.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the most promising candidates are:\n- \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" (832 tokens) – this sounds like it might contain the actual decree terms.\n- \"Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement...\" (1,832 tokens) – but this is a pleading, not a court order. However, if it's incorporated into the order, the terms might appear there. But the checklist says to only extract terms expressly ordered by court, so this document alone might not suffice.\n\nWait, the user's recent action was reading Order (002), which didn't yield any terms. Now they need to move to the next logical document. The \"Order Approving Settlements...\" is a strong candidate because the title suggests it contains the decree. The other orders (001, 003-005) might also have terms, but this one is specifically about approving settlements, which likely includes the decree terms.\n\nI should check if \"Order Approving Settlements...\" is fully unvisited (it is, marked ○ Unvisited). Since it's small (832 tokens), reading the whole thing is efficient. No need for regex search here—just read the entire document to capture any decree terms. \n\nThe other documents like Complaint or Dockets are less likely to contain the decree terms themselves (they're procedural), so prioritizing the \"Order Approving...\" makes sense. No evidence of terms in the already-read Order (002), so moving to the next relevant doc.\n\nNo need for get_checklist yet since the key is still empty. Not Applicable isn't justified here—there are other documents to check. So the next action is definitely read_document on \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" from 0-832 tokens.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 832}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 832}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 4211, "completion_tokens": 587, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}
{"step": 4, "run_id": "5abb3be4-a1f9-44c7-9c14-d03be70b9ae0", "timestamp": "2025-11-16T03:56:41.189861-05:00", "raw_response": "Okay, let's see. The user needs to extract the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents. So far, they've read two documents: \"Order (002)\" and \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\". Both are marked as fully visited.\n\nFirst, I need to check if these documents contain any decree terms. The checklist says to extract substantive obligations ordered by the court, like consent decrees or stipulated judgments. The key is to not include terms from settlement agreements unless they're expressly incorporated into the court order.\n\nLooking at the \"Order (002)\" document, the text mentions vacating pretrial deadlines, staying the case pending further stipulation, and requiring joint status reports every 60 days. These seem like court-ordered terms. The stay of proceedings and status reports are part of the court's order, so those should be extracted.\n\nThen, the \"Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims\" has terms about approving settlements, allocation of proceeds, pooled minors' trusts, and coordination with counsel. The court approved the settlements and specified the trust placements, so those are court-ordered terms. The allocation amounts and trust details are part of the decree.\n\nWait, but the requirement says to extract each term as a separate value. So for \"Order (002)\", the terms are: \"vacating pretrial deadlines\", \"staying the case pending further stipulation or motion\", and \"joint status reports every 60 days\". For \"Order Approving Settlements\", terms include \"approval of settlements for minor plaintiffs\", \"allocation of settlement proceeds\", \"placement into pooled minors’ trusts\", and \"coordination with counsel for trust funding\".\n\nNow, I need to make sure these are all court-ordered terms. The first order says \"IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Stipulation is Granted\" followed by the specific orders. The second order says \"IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\" for each point. So these are all court-ordered terms, not just settlement terms.\n\nEach term should be a separate entry. So for example, in the first order, \"vacating the pretrial deadlines\" is one term, \"staying the case\" is another, and \"joint status reports every 60 days\" is a third. Similarly, the second order has four terms listed.\n\nI need to check if the documents have more terms. The \"Order (002)\" mentions \"vacating pretrial deadlines, Final Pretrial Conference, and Trial date\" as part of the stay. So \"vacating pretrial deadlines\" and \"vacating Final Pretrial Conference and Trial date\" might be separate, but the text groups them together. Wait, the text says \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date\", so it's one term: vacating those specific items. So maybe it's one term: \"vacating pretrial deadlines, Final Pretrial Conference, and Trial date\".\n\nSimilarly, the second order's terms are numbered: 1, 2, 3, 4. Each is a separate term. So term 1 is approval of settlements, term 2 is allocation, term 3 is trust placement, term 4 is coordination.\n\nSo for \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", the extracted values should include all these points. Now, the user needs to append these to the checklist.\n\nThe next step is to use append_checklist to add these entries. Each entry needs evidence with text, source document, and location. The location can be the page numbers from the document, like \"Page 1\" or \"Page 2\" as per the document headers.\n\nFor example, in Order (002), the terms are on Page 1 and 2. The first term \"vacating pretrial deadlines...\" is on Page 1 (lines 22-24), and the status report on Page 2 (line 1). Similarly, the Order Approving Settlements has the terms on Page 2, lines 24-28 (the numbered points).\n\nSo I need to create separate entries for each term. Let's list them:\n\nFrom Order (002):\n- \"Vacating pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference, and the Trial date\" (Page 1, lines 22-24)\n- \"Joint status reports every 60 days\" (Page 2, line 1)\n\nFrom Order Approving Settlements:\n- \"Approval of settlements of minor plaintiffs' claims\" (Page 2, line 24, point 1)\n- \"Allocation of settlement proceeds as specified\" (Page 2, lines 26-28, point 2)\n- \"Placement of settlement portions into pooled minors’ trusts\" (Page 2, lines 9-11, point 3)\n- \"Coordination with counsel for trust funding\" (Page 2, lines 12-15, point 4)\n\nWait, the exact wording in the documents is important. Let's check:\n\nOrder (002), line 22: \"IT IS FURTHER ORDERED vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date, in this case only, and this action only is stayed pending further stipulation or motion of the Parties or Order of the Court.\"\n\nSo the term here is \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date\" and \"staying the case pending further stipulation...\". Wait, the stay is part of the order. So maybe two terms: 1) vacating those deadlines, 2) staying the case.\n\nBut the text says \"vacating... and this action only is stayed\", so it's one order that vacates the deadlines and stays the case. Hmm, but the stay is the result of vacating. Maybe it's one term: \"vacating pretrial deadlines and staying the case pending further stipulation or motion\".\n\nWait, the requirement says to extract each term as a separate value. So if the court orders multiple things, each should be separate. The order says \"vacating the pretrial deadlines... and this action only is stayed\". So vacating the deadlines is one part, staying the case is another. But the wording is a bit merged. Let's see: \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date, in this case only, and this action only is stayed...\" So the vacating is the action, and the staying is the consequence. But the court is ordering both the vacating and the stay. Wait, the stay is the effect of vacating those deadlines. Maybe it's one term. But the checklist says to extract each term as separate. Maybe it's safer to split into two: \"vacating pretrial deadlines, Final Pretrial Conference, and Trial date\" and \"staying the case pending further stipulation or motion\".\n\nSimilarly, in the Order Approving Settlements, the numbered points are separate terms.\n\nSo for Order (002), two terms. For the other order, four terms. Total six terms.\n\nNow, need to create evidence for each. The evidence must include verbatim text, source document, location.\n\nSo for Order (002) term 1: \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date, in this case only, and this action only is stayed pending further stipulation or motion of the Parties or Order of the Court.\" Wait, the location is Page 1, lines 22-24. The exact text is \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date, in this case only, and this action only is stayed pending further stipulation or motion of the Parties or Order of the Court.\"\n\nWait, the text says \"vacating... and this action only is stayed\". So the stay is part of the same order. So maybe it's one term: \"vacating pretrial deadlines, Final Pretrial Conference, and Trial date; staying the case pending further stipulation or motion\".\n\nBut the checklist says to extract each term as separate. Hmm. The example in the requirements says \"extract each term as a separate value\". So if the court lists multiple obligations, each should be a separate entry. In the Order (002), the court says \"vacating... and this action... is stayed\", which might be considered two separate orders. But it's phrased as one sentence. Maybe it's two terms. To be safe, I'll split them into two entries.\n\nWait, looking at the Order Approving Settlements, it's numbered: 1, 2, 3, 4. So each number is a separate term. For the first order, it's not numbered, so it's a bit ambiguous. But the text says \"IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Stipulation is Granted. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED vacating... and this action... is stayed\". So the \"IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\" introduces the next terms. So \"vacating...\" is one term, and \"staying...\" is part of the same sentence but maybe it's the same term. Wait, the sentence structure: \"vacating the pretrial deadlines... and this action only is stayed\". So \"vacating\" and \"staying\" are both ordered, but it's one sentence. So perhaps it's one term. But the requirement says \"each term as a separate value\". Maybe the user should treat each distinct obligation as a separate term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"vacating\" and \"staying\" are two parts of the same order. But the example in the requirements says \"consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions\" are included, so the court's order is what's important. So the key is to extract the obligations the court ordered.\n\nIn Order (002), the court ordered:\n\n- Vacating pretrial deadlines, Final Pretrial Conference, Trial date.\n\n- Staying the case pending further stipulation or motion.\n\n- Requiring joint status reports every 60 days.\n\nWait, the third part is \"IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Parties shall provide a joint status report every 60 days...\". So that's a separate order. So three terms from Order (002):\n\n1. Vacating pretrial deadlines, Final Pretrial Conference, Trial date.\n\n2. Staying the case pending further stipulation or motion.\n\n3. Joint status reports every 60 days.\n\nBut the text says \"vacating... and this action only is stayed\", so \"staying\" is the result of the vacating. Maybe the court's order is that the case is stayed, which is achieved by vacating the deadlines. So perhaps \"staying the case\" is the main term, and vacating the deadlines is a means to that end. But the checklist says to extract substantive obligations. So \"staying the case\" is the obligation, and vacating the deadlines is part of how it's done. But the requirement says to extract the terms as they are ordered. So if the court says \"vacating X and staying Y\", then both are terms.\n\nBut to be precise, the exact text is: \"IT IS FURTHER ORDERED vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date, in this case only, and this action only is stayed pending further stipulation or motion of the Parties or Order of the Court.\"\n\nSo the court is ordering the vacating of those deadlines, and also ordering that the action is stayed. So \"vacating X\" and \"staying the case\" are two separate orders. So two terms.\n\nThen, the next sentence: \"IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Parties shall provide a joint status report every 60 days...\" So that's a third term.\n\nSo three terms from Order (002).\n\nSimilarly, the Order Approving Settlements has four terms (numbered 1-4).\n\nSo total seven terms. Wait, let's count:\n\nOrder (002):\n\n- Term 1: Vacating pretrial deadlines, Final Pretrial Conference, Trial date.\n\n- Term 2: Staying the case pending further stipulation or motion.\n\n- Term 3: Joint status reports every 60 days.\n\nOrder Approving Settlements:\n\n- Term 1: Approval of settlements for minor plaintiffs.\n\n- Term 2: Allocation of settlement proceeds.\n\n- Term 3: Placement into pooled minors' trusts.\n\n- Term 4: Coordination with counsel for trust funding.\n\nSo seven terms total.\n\nNow, each needs to be a separate entry in the checklist. So I need to append these seven entries.\n\nBut the user's current status shows 0 values extracted, so all need to be added.\n\nThe next action is to use append_checklist with all these entries. But the system says to do one action per turn. So first, append all the extracted values from the documents read so far.\n\nWait, the recent actions have read two documents, both fully visited. So the next step is to append the extracted terms to the checklist.\n\nSo the correct action is append_checklist with all the terms from the two documents.\n\nEach term must have evidence. Let's structure each entry.\n\nFor Order (002), term 1:\n\n- value: \"Vacating pretrial deadlines, Final Pretrial Conference, and Trial date\"\n\n- evidence: text: \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date, in this case only, and this action only is stayed pending further stipulation or motion of the Parties or Order of the Court.\"\n\n- source_document: \"Order (002)\"\n\n- location: \"Page 1, lines 22-24\"\n\nWait, the document shows Page 1, and the text starts at line 22. The exact line numbers might be tricky, but the document says \"Page 1 of 2\" and the text from line 22. So location could be \"Page 1, lines 22-24\".\n\nSimilarly, term 2: \"Staying the case pending further stipulation or motion\" — same text, but part of the same sentence. Wait, the text is \"vacating... and this action only is stayed...\", so the staying is part of the same sentence. So maybe the evidence for term 2 is the same text, but the value is \"Staying the case pending further stipulation or motion\".\n\nBut the value should be the term as ordered. So perhaps the value is \"Staying the case pending further stipulation or motion\" and the evidence includes the text where it's stated.\n\nWait, the requirement says to extract each term as a separate value. So even if they're in the same sentence, if they're distinct obligations, they're separate terms.\n\nBut in this case, \"vacating\" and \"staying\" are part of the same order. The court is vacating the deadlines as a means to stay the case. So maybe it's one term: \"Vacating pretrial deadlines, Final Pretrial Conference, and Trial date, and staying the case pending further stipulation or motion.\"\n\nBut the checklist says \"each term as a separate value\", so if the court lists multiple, they should be separate. However, in this document, it's phrased as a single order. The Order Approving Settlements uses numbered points, which are clearly separate. The first order doesn't, so maybe it's safer to treat the entire sentence as one term. But the problem statement says \"extract each term as a separate value\", so perhaps each distinct obligation is a term.\n\nAlternatively, the user should follow the example in the requirements. The example says \"consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions\", so the court's order terms. So in the first order, the court ordered:\n\n- Vacating deadlines (which includes the specific items)\n\n- Staying the case (which is the effect)\n\n- Status reports\n\nBut \"staying the case\" is the main order, and vacating deadlines is a part of implementing it. So maybe it's one term: \"Stay of proceedings pending further stipulation or motion, including vacating pretrial deadlines and trial dates.\"\n\nBut the user needs to extract the terms as they are ordered. The safest way is to take the exact phrases from the order. So:\n\nFrom Order (002), line 22: \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date\" — this is one term.\n\nThen, the phrase \"this action only is stayed pending further stipulation or motion\" — this is another term.\n\nBut it's all in one sentence. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the court's order is a single term: \"vacating pretrial deadlines, Final Pretrial Conference, and Trial date; staying the case pending further stipulation or motion.\"\n\nBut the checklist says to extract each term separately. Maybe the user should split it into two terms.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the requirement to extract each distinct value, I'll list them as separate terms.\n\nSo for Order (002):\n\nTerm 1: \"Vacating pretrial deadlines, Final Pretrial Conference, and Trial date\"\n\nTerm 2: \"Staying the case pending further stipulation or motion\"\n\nTerm 3: \"Joint status reports every 60 days\"\n\nSimilarly, for the other order, the four terms as per the numbered points.\n\nNow, for the evidence, each needs to have the verbatim text. So for Term 1, the text is \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date, in this case only, and this action only is stayed pending further stipulation or motion of the Parties or Order of the Court.\" But that's a bit long. Wait, the exact text from the document is:\n\n\"IT IS FURTHER ORDERED vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date, in this case only, and this action only is stayed pending further stipulation or motion of the Parties or Order of the Court.\"\n\nSo the part about vacating is \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date\", and the staying is \"this action only is stayed pending...\". So the evidence for Term 1 would be the text snippet \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date\", and for Term 2, \"this action only is stayed pending further stipulation or motion of the Parties or Order of the Court.\"\n\nBut the requirement says to include the verbatim snippet. So the evidence text should be the exact phrase from the document.\n\nSo for Term 1:\n\ntext: \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date\"\n\nsource: \"Order (002)\"\n\nlocation: \"Page 1, lines 22-24\"\n\nFor Term 2:\n\ntext: \"this action only is stayed pending further stipulation or motion of the Parties or Order of the Court\"\n\nsource: \"Order (002)\"\n\nlocation: \"Page 1, lines 22-24\"\n\nBut the text is part of the same sentence, so the location is the same.\n\nSimilarly, Term 3: \"joint status reports every 60 days\" from Page 2, line 1.\n\nFor the Order Approving Settlements:\n\nTerm 1: \"The Court approves the Settlements of the claims of minor Plaintiffs B.M., B.G., L.A., and G.A. in this Lawsuit.\" But the term is the approval, so value: \"Approval of settlements for minor plaintiffs' claims\"\n\nEvidence text: \"The Court approves the Settlements of the claims of minor Plaintiffs B.M., B.G., L.A., and G.A. in this Lawsuit.\"\n\nLocation: Page 2, line 24.\n\nTerm 2: \"The Court approves the allocation of the Settlement proceeds as follows:\"\n\nEvidence text: \"The Court approves the allocation of the Settlement proceeds as follows:\"\n\nLocation: Page 2, line 26.\n\nTerm 3: \"The Court approves placement of B.M., B.G., L.A., and G.A.’s portions of the Settlements into pooled minors’ trusts operated by Legacy Enhancement until they reach the age of 18, 21, or 25.\"\n\nValue: \"Placement of settlement portions into pooled minors’ trusts\"\n\nTerm 4: \"Plaintiffs’ counsel shall coordinate with C.M., L.G., O.A., and V.C. and Legacy Enhancement Trust for the execution of all necessary paperwork and funding of the pooled minors’ trusts on behalf of B.M., B.G., L.A., and G.A.’s and shall report back to the Court once funding is completed.\"\n\nValue: \"Coordination with counsel for trust funding\"\n\nNow, the evidence for each term needs to include the verbatim text. So each term's evidence will have the relevant text snippet.\n\nSo compiling all seven terms into the append_checklist action.\n\nThe parameters for append_checklist require a patch array with key and extracted entries.\n\nSo the patch would have:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\",\n  \"extracted\": [\n    { \"value\": \"Vacating pretrial deadlines, Final Pretrial Conference, and Trial date\", \"evidence\": [ { \"text\": \"vacating the pretrial deadlines, the Final Pretrial Conference and the Trial date\", \"source_document\": \"Order (002)\", \"location\": \"Page 1, lines 22-24\" } ] },\n    ... and so on for each term.\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but the evidence for each extracted entry must be an array of evidence objects. Each value can have multiple evidence entries, but in this case, each term has one evidence entry.\n\nSo for each term, the extracted entry has one evidence object.\n\nSo the append_checklist call will have a patch with one key (Significant_Terms_of_Decrees) and an array of seven extracted entries, each with one evidence.\n\nNow, the user has to make sure that all extracted values from the documents are included. Since they've read both documents and found these terms, the next step is to append them.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is append_checklist with all seven terms.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\":

The user is asking to extract all the significant terms of decrees from the legal documents. They've already done Steps 1-4, and now they're at Step 5. The current status shows that they've extracted 7 values for the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" key from two documents, both of which are fully visited.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the other 8 documents are unvisited (marked as ○ Unvisited). The task is to make sure all possible terms are extracted. But the user needs to check if there are more terms in the remaining documents. The checklist item specifically says to extract every distinct value found in any document. So even though they have 7 values already, they should check the other documents to see if there are more terms.\n\nWait, but the documents listed as unvisited include things like Complaint, Dockets, other Orders, and a Joint Notice. The Joint Notice might have settlement terms that are incorporated into the court order, but the instructions say not to include terms that are only in the settlement agreement unless they're expressly incorporated. The previous steps read the Order (002) and the Order Approving Settlements, which already incorporated some terms. The Joint Notice is a separate document, but maybe it's the settlement agreement itself, which might not have court-ordered terms unless incorporated. So maybe the Joint Notice isn't the right place to look for court-ordered terms, but the Orders (003-005) might have more decrees.\n\nThe user should check if any of the other Orders (001, 003, 004, 005) have additional decree terms. The current unvisited Orders are Order (001), Order (003), Order (004), Order (005). Each of these might have their own decree terms. Since the user has already read two Orders and found terms, they need to check the others.\n\nThe next logical step would be to read one of the unvisited Orders. The user should pick the next document to read. The available documents are listed, and the Order (001) is the smallest at 2,206 tokens, so it's a good candidate to read first. But they need to choose one document to read. The system says to avoid rereading, but these are unvisited. So the next action should be to read a targeted window of one of the unvisited documents. The user should pick Order (001) since it's the smallest and might be quick to process. The tokens for Order (001) are 2,206, so reading the entire document (0-2206) is within the 10k token limit. But the user should check if the document is already partially read, but the status says it's ○ Unvisited, so no tokens viewed yet. So the correct action is to call read_document on Order (001) for tokens 0-2206.\n\nWait, the system says to use read_document for targeted windows, but since it's unvisited, reading the whole document is okay. The parameters require start and end tokens, so for Order (001), start_token 0, end_token 2206. That's valid. So the next action should be read_document for Order (001) from 0 to 2206 tokens.\n\nThey shouldn't use search_document_regex yet because they don't have a specific pattern. They should read the document to check for terms.

The user is working on extracting \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from legal documents. So far, they've processed three documents: Order (002), Order Approving Settlements, and Order (001). They've already appended seven values from those documents.\n\nLooking at the current status, all three documents are marked as fully visited. The available documents left are Complaint, Docket (001), Docket (002), Order (003), Order (004), Order (005), and the Joint Notice. But the Checklist Items to Extract specifically mention that terms should be from court orders, not settlement agreements unless incorporated into the order. The Joint Notice is a settlement agreement, so maybe it's not relevant unless it's part of a court order.\n\nWait, the user's checklist definition says: \"Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court.\" So the Joint Notice might not have any terms to extract unless the court incorporated them into an order. But the Joint Notice was read in Step 1 as a document, but it's still unvisited. However, the previous steps didn't read it because the focus was on orders.\n\nThe current extracted values are from Order (002), Order Approving Settlements, and Order (001). Wait, Order (001) was read in Step 5, but the text provided doesn't have any decree terms. Let me check the Order (001) content again. The Order (001) is about sanctions, not about a decree. The order in Step 5's document is a sanctions order, not a decree. So the terms extracted from Order (001) might not be relevant. Wait, in Step 5, the user read Order (001), but the content seems to be about sanctions, not the decree terms. So maybe the user made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the checklist is for \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", which are the substantive obligations ordered by the court. The Order (001) is about sanctions, so it's not a decree. The user might have included it by mistake. But in the Step 5 action, they read Order (001), but the extracted values from that document aren't listed in the previous steps. Wait, the Step 4's append_checklist shows 7 values, all from Order (002) and Order Approving Settlements. The Order (001) read in Step 5 might not have any relevant terms, so it's possible that the user didn't add any new values from it.\n\nNow, the current available documents that are unvisited are Complaint, Dockets, Order (003), etc. But the Complaint is a complaint, not an order. Dockets are docket entries, which usually don't contain decree terms. The other Orders (003-005) might have decree terms. But the user needs to check if those orders have any relevant terms.\n\nThe user's task is to extract all distinct values of Significant_Terms_of_Decrees from any document. The current extracted values are 7, but maybe there are more in the other orders. The available documents include Order (003) with 27k tokens, which is unvisited. Since the user has to process each document, they should read Order (003) next to check for any decree terms.\n\nWait, but the user's next action should be one of the options. The available documents that are unvisited include Order (003), which is an Order/Opinion, so it's a good candidate. The user hasn't read it yet, so they should use read_document on Order (003) for the entire document (since it's unvisited, but the token count is 27k, which is over 10k. Wait, the read_document can only read up to 10k tokens per call. So they can't read the whole 27k at once. They need to read it in chunks. But the document is marked as unvisited, so the first read should be from 0-10k tokens.\n\nWait, the document catalog shows Order (003) as 27,352 tokens, unvisited. So the next step should be to read the first 10k tokens of Order (003) using read_document with start_token 0 and end_token 10000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_document_regex to look for key terms like \"order\", \"decree\", \"terms\", etc., but the user's policy says to use read_document when the document is likely to contain the target. Since Order (003) is an order, it's a good candidate to read. So the next action should be read_document on Order (003) for tokens 0-10000.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (003)\", \"start_token\": 0, \"end_token\": 10000}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (003)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 10000}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 8454, "completion_tokens": 1097, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The user is asking me to extract all checklist items related to \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the provided legal documents. So far, they've already processed Order (002), Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims, Order (001), and Order (003) up to token 10,000.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current status. The checklist item \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" has 7 values already extracted from the documents they've read. The current status says \"Keys with Values: 1/1\", meaning all required keys are being handled. The user's goal is to extract every distinct value from the documents.\n\nLooking at the available documents, Order (003) is partially visited (only 37% of tokens read). The next step should be to continue reading Order (003) to see if there are more terms to extract. Since they've already read up to token 10,000, the next logical step is to read the next window of tokens in Order (003), which is up to 10,000 tokens as per the tool's limit.\n\nThe other documents like Complaint, Docket (001), Docket (002), Order (004), Order (005), and the Joint Notice are unvisited. But the checklist item is about decree terms, which are typically found in court orders, not complaints or dockets. The Joint Notice might have settlement terms, but the requirement specifies that only terms expressly incorporated into the court order should be extracted. The previous steps show that Order (002) and the Settlement Order were used, so the Joint Notice might not have direct decree terms unless incorporated.\n\nOrder (003) is a court order, so it's the most likely place to find more decree terms. The user has only read up to token 10,000 of Order (003), which is 27,352 tokens total. So the next window should be tokens 10,001-20,000. But since the maximum per read is 10,000 tokens, reading 10,000 tokens starting at 10,001 would be the next step.\n\nThe user's previous actions show that they've already extracted terms from the first part of Order (003), but the document is long. They need to check if there are more decree terms in the remaining tokens. The next action should be to read the next token range in Order (003) to ensure they haven't missed any terms.\n\nI should make sure not to reread documents that are already fully visited. Order (001), Order (002), and Order Approving Settlements are fully visited, so no need to read those again. The other documents are unvisited, but they're less likely to contain decree terms.

The user wants me to extract all checklist items related to \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents provided. So far, they've read several documents and have already extracted 7 values. The current status shows all keys are filled (1 out of 1), but I need to check if there are more terms to extract.\n\nLooking at the available documents, Order (003) is partially visited (only up to token 20001 out of 27352). The previous steps read tokens 0-10000 and then 10001-20001. So there's still a chunk left (20001-27352) that hasn't been read yet. The other documents are either fully visited or unvisited. But since the checklist item has already been extracted from some documents, maybe Order (003) has more terms.\n\nWait, the checklist item is about \"significant terms of decrees,\" which includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments. The previous extractions were from Order (002) and the Order Approving Settlements. The Order (003) is a more detailed order, so it might contain additional terms. For example, in the text provided from Order (003), there's a lot about the Referral Policy, the DHS policy, and other legal terms. But the user needs to check if those are considered \"significant terms of decrees\" as per the definition.\n\nThe checklist definition says: \"The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders. Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court.\"\n\nSo, the key is to find terms that are ordered by the court, not just in the settlement. In the Order (003) text provided, there's a part where the court is granting or denying motions, but I need to see if there are specific terms ordered. For example, in the text, there's \"IT IS ORDERED granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Sanctions.\" But the actual terms might be the sanctions ordered, like \"admission of the documents\" or \"preclusion of the United States’ use of the documents.\"\n\nWait, looking at the Order (003) excerpt, there's a section where it says: \"The Court will grant Plaintiffs’ requested sanctions in part regarding the handwritten notes. Trial will be to the Bench. The handwritten notes, if offered by Plaintiffs, will be admitted if relevant. No witness will be required to authenticate the documents. The notes will be admitted as the contemporaneous notes of the person identified by the United States in its production as the author. The United States will not be able to offer the notes but the Court will not preclude the United States from questioning the author of any of those notes at trial about the notes.\"\n\nSo, the court ordered specific terms: admission of the notes under certain conditions, no authentication required, etc. These are substantive obligations ordered by the court, so they should be extracted as separate terms.\n\nWait, but the previous extraction from Order (003) was in Step 6 and 7, which covered tokens up to 20001. The current document (Order (003)) has more tokens (up to 27352), so the next step should be to read the remaining tokens (20001-27352) to see if there are more terms. The user hasn't read that part yet, so the next action should be to read the remaining tokens of Order (003) to check for additional terms.\n\nThe other documents are either fully visited (like Order (001), (002), and the settlement order) or unvisited. But since Order (003) is partially visited, and the next token range is 20001-27352 (which is 7351 tokens, under the 10,000 limit), the correct action is to call read_document for Order (003) from 20001 to 27352.\n\nThe user has already extracted 7 values. If there are more terms in the remaining part of Order (003), they need to extract them. If not, then maybe all terms are already covered. But since the document is partially visited, the next logical step is to read the remaining tokens to ensure no terms are missed.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"read_document\", \"arguments\": {\"doc_name\": \"Order (003)\", \"start_token\": 20001, \"end_token\": 27352}}\n", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (003)", "start_token": 20001, "end_token": 27352}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 29333, "completion_tokens": 1019, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

The only checklist item to extract is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\", and we have already extracted 7 values from two documents (Order (002) and Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims). The current status shows:\n- Keys with Values: 1/1 (meaning the one key has values)\n- Empty Keys: 0/1\n- Not Applicable: 0/1\n- Total Values Extracted: 7\n\nHowever, note that the provided documents in the corpus include 10 documents, but we have only read 4 of them (Order (001), Order (002), Order (003), and Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims) and they are all marked as \"Fully Visited\" (✓). The remaining 6 documents are unvisited (○).\n\nBut the task is to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from the legal documents. We have already found 7 values. The question is: are there more values in the unvisited documents?\n\nLet's look at the unvisited documents:\n- Complaint\n- Docket (001)\n- Docket (002)\n- Order (004)\n- Order (005)\n- Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines\n\nWe must consider if any of these documents might contain additional terms for \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\". However, note the requirement:\n\n> Extract EVERY distinct value of this checklist item found in any document.\n\nBut note the definition of the item:\n> The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders. Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court.\n\nWe have already extracted from:\n- Order (002): which is an order that vacates deadlines, stays the case, and orders joint status reports.\n- Order Approving Settlements of Minors’ Claims: which approves the settlements, the allocation of proceeds, placement in trusts, and coordination.\n\nNow, we have read Order (001) and Order (003) in their entirety (they are fully visited). Let's recall what we read in Order (001) and Order (003):\n\nOrder (001): This is a sanctions order. It does not contain any substantive obligations that are part of a decree (it's about sanctions for late disclosure). The terms we extracted from Order (001) were about sanctions (admitting documents, precluding use of notes, etc.), but note the definition: \"substantive obligations ordered by the court\" in the context of a decree. This order is about sanctions, not a decree that sets out terms of a settlement or a consent decree. So it does not contain terms for \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" as defined.\n\nOrder (003): This is a summary judgment order. It does not set out any decree terms; it is a ruling on motions. The order does not contain a decree with substantive obligations (it does not have a section that lists terms of a decree). It is a decision on the motions, not a decree.\n\nTherefore, the two orders we read (001 and 003) do not contain additional terms for \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\".\n\nNow, what about the unvisited documents?\n\n- Complaint: This is a pleading that states the claims, not a decree. It does not contain court-ordered terms.\n- Docket (001) and Docket (002): These are docket entries. They list events and filings, but they do not contain the substantive terms of a decree (unless there is a specific order attached, but the docket itself is just a log).\n- Order (004) and Order (005): These are orders, but we haven't read them. However, note that the task is to extract terms from court orders (decrees). We have already read three orders (001, 002, 003) and found terms in two of them (002 and the settlement approval order). We must check if Order (004) and Order (005) might contain additional terms.\n\nBut note: the current status says we have 7 values. We must be thorough.\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"Extract EVERY distinct value\". So we must check the unvisited orders (004 and 005) because they might contain more terms.\n\nBut note: the document catalog shows:\n- Order (004): 5,875 tokens\n- Order (005): 7,151 tokens\n\nWe can read them. However, the extraction process requires that we read the documents and then extract. But note the systematic extraction process:\n\n> After each read_document or search_document_regex action: ... Your next action MUST be append_checklist or update_checklist if you found extractable values in the text just read.\n\nBut we haven't read Order (004) or Order (005) yet. So we should read one of them.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"You must respond with valid JSON only — no prose, no extra keys.\" and \"Choose exactly one action per turn.\"\n\nWe are to choose one action. Since we have unvisited orders (Order (004) and Order (005)), we should read one of them to check for additional terms.\n\nBut note: the document catalog shows that Order (004) and Order (005) are unvisited. We should read the next unvisited document. The problem does not specify which one to read first, but we can choose one.\n\nHowever, note that the requirement is to extract every distinct value. We have 7 so far. We must check the unvisited orders.\n\nBut wait: the current status says \"Total Values Extracted: 7\", and the checklist key \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" has 7 values. We have not found any more in the documents we have read. Now we need to check the unvisited orders.\n\nWe have two orders to read: Order (004) and Order (005). We can choose to read Order (004) first.\n\nSo the next action should be `read_document` on Order (004) for tokens 0-5875 (the entire document, since it's unvisited and within 10,000 tokens).\n\nBut note: the document \"Order (004)\" is 5,875 tokens, so reading the entire document (0-5875) is allowed (<=10,000).\n\nAlternatively, we could use `search_document_regex` to look for terms, but the problem says: \"Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court.\" So we are looking for court-ordered terms, which are in the orders. We don't have a specific pattern to search for, so it's better to read the document.\n\nTherefore, the next action is to read Order (004).\n\nBut note: the problem says \"If a specific document likely contains a target value, choose ONE: `read_document` — default choice.\"\n\nWe don't have evidence that Order (004) contains terms, but we have to check because we haven't read it. So we read it.\n\nSo we choose:\n- `read_document` on Order (004) for tokens 0-5875.\n\nHowever, note that the document catalog says \"Order (004)\" is unvisited, so we read the entire document.\n\nBut note: the token count for Order (004) is 5,875, so we read from 0 to 5875.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response should be:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"read_document\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"doc_name\": \"Order (004)\",\n    \"start_token\": 0,\n    \"end_token\": 5875\n  }\n}\n\nHowever, note that the document name in the catalog is \"Order (004)\", so we use that.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"You must respond with valid JSON only\". So we output exactly that.\n\nBut note: the example of the document names in the catalog: they are exactly as listed.\n\nLet me double-check the catalog:\n\n- **Order (004)** [Order/Opinion] - 5,875 tokens - ○ Unvisited\n\nSo the name is \"Order (004)\".\n\nTherefore, the action is to read that document.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"NEVER reread fully visited documents\".

The user is asking me to extract \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from legal documents, specifically from the provided snapshots. The task is to find all distinct values of this checklist item across all documents, with each value having its own evidence.\n\nLooking at the current status, they've already extracted 7 values for \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from Order (002) and Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims. The checklist shows 1 key with 7 values extracted, 0 empty keys, and 0 Not Applicable. The documents listed as fully visited include Order (001), (002), (003), (004), and the Settlements order. The remaining documents (Complaint, Dockets, Order (005), Joint Notice) are unvisited.\n\nI need to check if there's any remaining document that might contain additional decree terms. The user's instructions say to never reread fully visited documents, so I shouldn't go back to Order (001), (002), (003), (004), or the Settlements order. The unvisited documents are Complaint (42k tokens), Docket (001) (17k), Docket (002) (56k), Order (005) (7k), and Joint Notice (1.8k).\n\nNow, considering the checklist definition: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" refers to substantive obligations ordered by the court, including consent decrees and stipulated judgments. The user emphasized not to include terms only in settlement agreements unless expressly incorporated into court orders.\n\nLooking at the unvisited documents:\n- Complaint: This is the plaintiff's initial filing, unlikely to contain court-ordered decrees (the court hasn't issued them yet).\n- Dockets: These are procedural records, might mention court orders but probably not the substantive decree terms themselves.\n- Order (005): This is another order, possibly containing decree terms.\n- Joint Notice: A settlement notice, but the instructions say to exclude terms not expressly incorporated into court orders.\n\nThe key here is that Order (005) is a document type that could contain court orders with decree terms, whereas the Joint Notice is a settlement document that might not have court-ordered terms. The Dockets are less likely to contain the actual decree language.\n\nSince Order (005) is unvisited (marked as ○ Unvisited) and it's a possible source of decree terms, I should read it. The document size is 7,151 tokens, which is under the 10,000 token limit for read_document. \n\nI should check if there's any evidence in the current text that might indicate Order (005) has relevant terms. The prior steps show that Order (003) was read in multiple chunks (tokens 0-27352), and Order (004) was read fully (0-5875). The Order (005) hasn't been read at all.\n\nThe user's instructions say to avoid rereading fully visited documents, but Order (005) is unvisited. So reading Order (005) makes sense as the next step to check for additional decree terms.\n\nThe other unvisited documents (Complaint, Dockets) are less likely to contain the actual decree terms. The Complaint is the plaintiff's claim, not a court order. Dockets are administrative records. The Joint Notice is a settlement document, which the instructions say to exclude unless terms are expressly incorporated into court orders.\n\nSo the best next step is to read Order (005) in its entirety (tokens 0-7151) since it's a court order document that might contain significant decree terms.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"read_document\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"doc_name\": \"Order (005)\",\n    \"start_token\": 0,\n    \"end_token\": 7151\n  }\n}", "parsed_action": {"tool": "read_document", "args": {"doc_name": "Order (005)", "start_token": 0, "end_token": 7151}, "decision": null, "reason": null, "remaining_empty_keys": null, "stats": null, "parse_failed": false}, "parse_success": true, "retry_count": 0, "stats": {"prompt_tokens": 41979, "completion_tokens": 854, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507"}}

This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders. Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court.\"\n\nThe checklist item has been partially extracted with 7 values already. The current status shows:\n- Keys with Values: 1/1\n- Empty Keys: 0/1\n- Not Applicable: 0/1\n- Total Values Extracted: 7\n- Documents in Corpus: 10\n\nThe available documents show that most have been fully visited (marked with ✓), but there are 4 documents that haven't been visited yet:\n1. Complaint (42,744 tokens) - Unvisited\n2. Docket (001) (17,690 tokens) - Unvisited\n3. Docket (002) (56,233 tokens) - Unvisited\n4. Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement and Stipulation to Stay Litigation Deadlines (1,832 tokens) - Unvisited\n\nHowever, the checklist item we're trying to extract is specifically for \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" which are \"substantive obligations ordered by the court.\" This means we're looking for terms that are actually ordered by the court, not just mentioned in settlement agreements.\n\nLooking at the documents that have been fully visited (Order (001) through Order (005) and Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims), these are all court orders. The Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims is specifically about approving settlements, which might contain terms that were incorporated into court orders.\n\nThe 7 values we've already extracted (from Step 4) were:\n- 3 from Order (002)\n- 4 from Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims\n\nThe question is, do we need to look at the other documents (Complaint, Dockets, Joint Notice) to find more \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\"?\n\nLet's consider the definition again: \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" are \"substantive obligations ordered by the court.\" This means we're looking for terms that are actually ordered by the court, not just mentioned in a settlement agreement or complaint.\n\n- Complaints typically contain claims and allegations, not court orders.\n- Dockets are typically lists of events and filings, not court orders.\n- The Joint Notice of Conditional Settlement might contain settlement terms, but unless those terms are expressly incorporated into a court order, they shouldn't be included.\n\nSo, based on the definition, it's unlikely that the unvisited documents (Complaint, Dockets, Joint Notice) will contain additional \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" that meet the criteria. The court orders (which we've already fully read) are where we'd expect to find these terms.\n\nLet's check the documents we've read to see if there might be additional terms we missed:\n\n1. Order (001) - Fully Visited\n2. Order (002) - Fully Visited (3 values extracted)\n3. Order (003) - Fully Visited (This is the document that was read in Steps 6-8)\n4. Order (004) - Fully Visited\n5. Order (005) - Fully Visited\n6. Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims - Fully Visited (4 values extracted)\n\nI need to check if Order (003) might contain additional terms we missed. Order (003) is a lengthy document (27,352 tokens) and was read in three parts (0-10000, 10001-20000, 20001-27352). We've already read all of it.\n\nLet me review the text from Order (003) to see if there are any terms we might have missed:\n\nFrom the text provided, I see that Order (003) is a court order that discusses the \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" in the context of the case. It mentions the government's separation of families, the Flores Agreement, and the TVPRA. But it's a court order that is discussing the legal arguments and the court's decision, not an order that contains specific terms of a decree.\n\nLet me look at the specific parts of Order (003) that might contain decree terms:\n\nThe document mentions \"the Flores Agreement\" and \"TVPRA\" but these are legal agreements, not court-ordered terms. It also mentions \"the Court denies the United States' Motions for Summary Judgment\" and \"the Court grants in part and denying in part C.M. Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\" - these are court decisions, but not specific decree terms.\n\nThe document also mentions \"the United States must provide 'contact with family members who were arrested with the minor'\" (Flores Agreement ¶ 12.A.), but this is a reference to an existing agreement, not a court-ordered term.\n\nI don't see any specific \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" in Order (003) that weren't already extracted.\n\nLet me check Order (004) and Order (005) to see if they contain any additional decree terms:\n\nOrder (004) is a \"3/30/20 Order\" that denied the United States' Motion to Dismiss. It mentions \"the Court denied the United States' Motion to Dismiss after concluding the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\") conferred jurisdiction and the United States failed to demonstrate that an exception applied.\" But this is a decision, not specific decree terms.\n\nOrder (005) is a \"7/06/20 Order\" that denied the United States' Motion for Certification of the Court's 3/30/20 Order. It also doesn't contain specific decree terms.\n\nGiven that we've read all the court orders (which is where we'd expect to find \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\") and have already extracted 7 values, and the unvisited documents (Complaint, Dockets, Joint Notice) are unlikely to contain court-ordered terms (as they're not court orders themselves), it seems like we've extracted all relevant values.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should verify that we haven't missed any specific decree terms in the court orders we've read. Let's look at the specific parts of the documents that might contain decree terms:\n\nIn Order (002), we extracted 3 values.\nIn Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims, we extracted 4 values.\n\nLet's look at Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims to see what those 4 values were (though they're not explicitly listed in the provided text, but the document is referenced as having 4 values extracted).\n\nI don't see the actual extracted values listed in the provided text, but the document catalog states that 4 values were extracted from it.\n\nGiven that we've read all the court orders (which is where we'd expect to find the decree terms) and have already extracted 7 values, and the other documents are not court orders (so they're unlikely to contain court-ordered terms), it seems like we've extracted all the relevant values.\n\nThe current status shows:\n- Keys with Values: 1/1\n- Empty Keys: 0/1\n- Not Applicable: 0/1\n- Total Values Extracted: 7\n\nSince we have 1 key with values, no empty keys, and no Not Applicable keys, and we've read all the relevant documents (the court orders), it seems like we've completed our extraction.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to stop.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything:\n\n1. We've read all the court orders (Order (001) through Order (005) and Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims) - these are all the documents where we'd expect to find \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\".\n2. We've extracted 7 values from these documents.\n3. The unvisited documents (Complaint, Dockets, Joint Notice) are not court orders, so they're unlikely to contain court-ordered terms.\n\nSo, I believe we've completed the extraction and should stop.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"decision\": \"stop\",\n  \"reason\": \"All 7 values for Significant_Terms_of_Decrees have been extracted from court orders (Order (002) and Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims).

The user has provided a legal document extraction task where I need to extract all checklist items specified in the snapshot. The checklist item in question is \"Significant_Terms_of_Decrees\" from court orders.\n\nFirst, I need to verify the current status. The system says that 7 values for Significant_Terms_of_Decrees have been extracted from Order (002) and Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims. The documents listed as fully visited include Order (001) through Order (005) and the Order Approving Settlements, all read completely.\n\nLooking at the available documents, the unvisited ones are Complaint, Dockets, and Joint Notice. But the checklist definition specifies that we should only extract terms that are part of court orders (consent decrees or stipulated judgments entered as court orders). The unvisited documents are not court orders—they're a Complaint, Dockets, and a Joint Notice—which don't contain court-ordered terms per the checklist definition. So, reading them wouldn't yield additional values for this checklist item.\n\nThe system's recent action (Step 11) already called `stop`, and the automatic `get_checklist` shows that Significant_Terms_of_Decrees has 7 values and is the only key. The status says \"1/1 filled, 0 empty\", meaning all keys are accounted for.\n\nI should check if there are any other documents that might contain court-ordered terms. The fully visited documents are all orders, and the unvisited ones aren't relevant. The prior steps (Steps 1-10) show that the extraction was done from the relevant order documents.\n\nThe checklist definition says: \"Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court.\" The Order Approving Settlements of Minors' Claims is a court order approving the settlement, so terms incorporated into that order would be included. The extraction from that document (Step 4) already accounted for that.\n\nSince all relevant court orders have been fully read and the unvisited documents aren't court orders, there's no need for further document reading. The system has already confirmed 7 values are extracted, which matches the prior steps (Step 4: appended 7 values).\n\nThe current status shows \"Keys with Values: 1/1\" and \"Empty Keys: 0/1\", so all checklist items are either filled or Not Applicable (but here, it's filled). The stop condition is met.\n\nI should call `stop` now.
